"This, of course, will enhance the credibility both internally and externally of the EU's very strong commitment to fundamental rights."
"By mid-March the Commission had proposed a negotiation mandate to the Council."
"Protocol 8 of the Lisbon Treaty requires a certain number of substantive guarantees to be provided for in an agreement relating to accession because we have to preserve the specific characteristics of Union law and the Commission's recommendation to the Council takes full account of these requirements."
"I just want to mention two of them."
"It is clear that the Union's competence and powers, as defined in the Treaties, may not be affected by the accession, and the provision in the accession agreement will have to make this very clear."
"Likewise, the accession of the European Union may not affect either the situation of individual Member States in relation to the European Court of Human Rights or the protocols there or the reservations."
"The negotiations should therefore ensure that the accession agreement creates obligations under the substantive provisions of the Conventions only with regard to acts and measures adopted by the institutions or by the bodies of the Union."
"Now the Commission is seeking a smooth insertion of the European Union into the system of the Convention."
"The accession should therefore preserve the substantive and procedural features of that system."
"However, the accession must meet two requirements."
"First, as I said already, the specific characteristics of the law of the European Union have to be preserved; safeguarding the Court of Justice and its prerogatives following accession is an important issue."
"There are interesting proposals on the table which aim at involving the Court of Justice in situations where the compatibility of a legal act of the Union is at stake before the Strasbourg Court, without a preliminary reference having been made."
"These proposals can probably be designed in such a way as not to require a Treaty amendment and they deserve careful analysis and discussion in the Council working party."
"I know that the Spanish Presidency is doing everything in order to bring these discussions forward."
"Second, it is important to deal with the specific situation of the Union as a distinct legal entity, vested with autonomous powers, which will become a contracting party side-by-side with the Member States to a mechanism which was not, initially, designed for this purpose - but it was designed for the Member States - and therefore a limited number of technical and procedural adaptations to the Conventions are necessary with regard to the specific nature of Union law."
"Among these is the so-called 'co-respondent mechanism'."
"It is of particular importance to take account of the decentralised implementation of Union law by Member States."
"By that mechanism the Union will receive the right to join the proceedings as a co-respondent in cases brought against a Member State when Union law is at stake."
"From an institutional point of view I would also like to stress the Commission's position that representatives of the European Union should participate in the bodies of the Convention on an equal footing with the representatives of other contracting parties."
"That means, for instance, that a judge elected for each contracting party is one of the founding principles of the Convention."
"This principle ensures that each legal system is represented within the Court; it is also a reflection of the collective guarantee system established by the Convention in which each contracting party is required to participate, and that means that we need a permanent full judge elected by the Union who enjoys the same status and has the same duties as his peers and who intervenes potentially in all cases."
"An ad hoc judge who intervenes only in cases brought against the Union or involving Union law would not be sufficient."
"As for the method of electing this judge, the normal procedure provided for in the Convention should also apply here."
"This means that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe elects such a judge from a list of three candidates presented by the European Union."
"We believe that an appropriate number of Members of the European Parliament should be allowed to participate in sessions of the Parliamentary Assembly when it elects the judges of the Strasbourg Court."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the AFCO and LIBE Committees, Mr Jáuregui and Mrs Gál, for their excellent cooperation on the file, and the hearing which was organised by the AFCO Committee on 18 March was really of great use."
"I am also happy that the Spanish Presidency of the Council gave high priority to this file."
"I am therefore confident that we will be able to start the negotiations on accession after the summer."
"I will ensure that the Commission, as the Union's negotiator, will keep Parliament fully informed throughout the negotiation process."
"Madam President, I do not believe that it is necessary on such a day to underline once more how important fundamental rights are for Europe and how important they are for all the acts we are proposing."
"I am sure the Union will not find it difficult to meet the standards of the Convention, but adhering to the Convention will certainly enhance the protection of fundamental rights in Europe, and by this I mean of each and every single human being who lives in Europe."
"Madam President, I absolutely endorse the statements made by Mr López Garrido on behalf of the Spanish Presidency and by Mrs Reding and I wish to congratulate Mr Jáuregui Atondo and Mrs Gál on their reports and on the work they have done."
"The accession of the EU to the European Convention of the Council of Europe and its protocols is in application of the Treaty of Lisbon and broadens protection in the field of human rights for its citizens."
"This will provide a pan-European system of protection for fundamental freedoms and human rights covered by the case law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"At the same time, in addition to external protection, the European Union is acquiring an international external protection agency, thereby enhancing its credibility towards third countries, from which it often demands respect for the European Convention on Human Rights within the framework of bilateral relations."
"Madam President, the debate on human rights and fundamental freedoms coincides today with the murder of three citizens, three workers, by extremist and marginal elements in my country, in Athens, during demonstrations against government measures in response to the economic crisis."
"I should like, in addition to my contrition and pain and on behalf of my colleagues in the main opposition in Greece, to point out that our political faction is determined to make a decisive contribution towards safeguarding democracy and the smooth functioning of the institutions."
"We respect the money which is being given to us at this critical time by our partners and the International Monetary Fund and we are firmly committed to helping with the necessary reforms, in order to come out of this crisis."
"As a responsible party, we shall contribute towards efforts to maintain calm and protect the unity of the Greek people by removing the extremist elements undermining our democracy."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (ES) Madam President, if I had to reduce what we are talking about today down to a single idea, I would say loud and clear to the European public that for the first time they are going to have a court that guarantees their human rights and fundamental freedoms in relation to the European Union and their own countries, when they are implementing Union law."
"The essential idea is that there is a new court for the European people, the Strasbourg Court, to guarantee Union law and that its application in each Member State fulfils the minimum guarantees that are at the heart of the European idea."
"These minimum guarantees are part of the umbilical cord, the historical process of European integration."
"This process is a civilising one of integration based on the idea of human dignity - the dignity of people - and it takes shape in the form of democracy, the rule of law, the welfare state based on the rule of law and human rights."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has given us the opportunity for the European Union to formalise the Charter, which as Mrs Reding said, is the most complete charter on fundamental rights that has been established in this field, and requires us to become part of the Strasbourg Court."
"This is what we are going to adopt now."
"I know that there are a large number of technical problems, but I just want to highlight how important it has been that the Commission has done quick, efficient work, establishing a specific mandate enabling us to move forward in these negotiations."
"I would like to congratulate you, Mrs Reding, on your work, which I will say once again has been quick and efficient, and I would also like to congratulate the Spanish Presidency."
"I would like to announce that in the next part-session we will adopt Parliament's report in this respect, and I would like to ask you for monitoring, information and support in negotiations that are complex, but very important for Europe."
"Madam President, the EU's accession to the European Convention has been on the agenda for a long time."
"Now there is a legal basis for the accession becoming a reality."
"We can all be pleased about that."
"The EU's accession to the European Convention will mean that the protection of fundamental rights will be supplemented and strengthened, that citizens in our Member States will have better protection in relation to the EU's activities and that legal practice in the area of human rights will be harmonised better in the two European courts, in The Hague and Strasbourg."
"With its accession to the European Convention, the EU's institutions will be subject to the administration of justice by the European Court of Human Rights."
"This will guarantee the independent external monitoring of the EU's respect for people's fundamental rights and freedoms."
"It is a very important step."
"It is very easy to be lulled into the belief that we in Europe are free of the sort of violations of human rights that are committed in other parts of the world."
"As Member States of the European Union we have laws, statutes and deeply rooted European values that safeguard our rights."
"Based on the text at the beginning of the Treaty of Lisbon, freedom of expression, freedom of the press and freedom of religion are European freedoms that are to be respected everywhere in the Union without exception."
"Unfortunately, this is not always the case, as there are Member States that violate fundamental rights in the EU."
"Regrettably, it is also the case that we in this House stand by and allow this to happen."
"With the EU's accession to the European Convention with a view to strengthening and supplementing citizens' freedoms and rights it will be important that we in Parliament legislate and act in accordance with the Convention."
"The fact is that there remains a great deal to be done in our Member States to sweep our own backyard and make the fine words that constitute our common values a reality."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Madam President, it is very important that we think of human rights as having intrinsic value, although they also have instrumental value, which I realise when I speak to representatives of third countries in my capacity as Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights."
"Just today I spoke to some Moroccan Members of Parliament."
"It is excellent that I can tell them that the European Union also stresses the importance of human rights in its own activities and does not merely try to teach others how important human rights are."
"In this way we can explain to the representatives of third countries that the European Union's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights really does mean that our activities are subject to external scrutiny, as has been explained here."
"I can also say that for the first time we have a commissioner who is specifically responsible for these matters in the context of legal issues."
"I would like to mention that the European Union's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights obviously will not resolve the problem of the European Court of Human Rights being completely overloaded with work."
"We should consider how we might resolve this problem, which has come about because of a backlog of cases to deal with."
"I would also like to suggest strongly that the Union should also decide to align itself with these various useful additional protocols that relate to such issues as opposition to torture or the fight against racism, as well as more effective laws."
"Madam President, the effects of signing the accession agreement of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms will be limited, it would seem, because the Convention has been accepted as a measure of the standard of protection of human rights in Europe for a long time."
"It has achieved this status both in European law and in policy sectors in individual Member States."
"However, it is also necessary to point to certain problems which may result from competition between the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights in the area of judicial decisions which may be made."
"The matter should, therefore, be very thoroughly analysed, so that mistakes will not be made later which will then need to be corrected."
"Furthermore, it may be supposed that decisions made by the European Court of Justice and its interpretation of EU law will become the subject of evaluation by the European Court of Human Rights."
"In this way, the European Court of Human Rights will gain significant jurisdiction over EU institutions."
"In view of this, all the legal consequences of such a decision should be considered, to avoid acting rashly."
"At the same time, the question of reforming the operation of both important European courts should be considered."
"(HU) As a lawyer working with human rights issues, I cannot understand what the added value would be for the protection of the human rights of Europe's citizens if the European Union joined the same human rights convention that every single European country has already joined."
"Please allow me to clarify a few connections, because as I see it, our non-lawyer colleagues have been considerably misled."
"The situation is as follows."
"There is a human rights instrument that is indeed very important, known as the European Convention on Human Rights."
"This Convention is not one entered into by the European Union but by its quasi-twin, the Council of Europe."
"If a country violates its citizen's rights as set out in and provided by the Convention, then that citizen has the right to approach the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and seek legal redress or enforcement of his or her rights against that country."
"This opportunity, as everyone knows, is available now to all citizens of the European Union."
"I doubt there is a single Member amongst us who is not familiar with a case where someone in their country threatened to go all the way to Strasbourg, and eventually did so and won the case against his or her Member State."
"What, then, is new, what is the added value, apart from someone from the European Union network receiving a well-paid job as a judge in Strasbourg?"
"(HU) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate today is one of the momentous occasions in the life of the European Union."
"We are discussing here today something that years ago seemed an insurmountable obstacle: the mandate of the Commission when negotiating the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"That Convention was ratified 60 years ago this year, and over these 60 years it has given many citizens faith that justice could be found even against their own state."
"What Commissioner Reding has already mentioned is closely related to this debate, and therefore should be emphasised again and again, namely that since December the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has become legally binding."
"This document is among the most progressive documents in the field of fundamental rights."
"The Convention reinforces the Charter and the Charter supplements the Convention."
"Since December, the Treaty of Lisbon commits the EU to join the Convention on Human Rights."
"Therefore our objective must be to ensure that implementation is as successful as possible."
"The most important question here is what added value joining the Convention will bring to the life of EU citizens."
"My report on joining the Convention had been prepared with this in mind, and was unanimously ratified by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Therefore I would like to ask the Council and the Commission to do all they can during the negotiations to ensure that joining the Convention really delivers value, an added value for the citizens of the EU, without raising exaggerated expectations."
"At the same time, several questions need to be clarified during the negotiations."
"One of these substantial issues is the relationship between the courts."
"It is also a precondition that internal legal remedies be fully exhausted first."
"At the same time I believe it is important to take into account during the negotiations that the reform of the operation of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will coincide with the accession of the EU to the Convention."
"The EU's accession to the Convention will be a unique experiment, but this must not threaten anything that is already functioning with regard to the enforcement of human rights."
"Accession to the Convention can be successful only if it truly reinforces the already functioning institutions and allows citizens access to them."
"We should take care not to endanger this process and make sure that in our surge of enthusiasm we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the Hungarian saying so aptly puts it."
"I believe that this is a very important moment and that we are on the right path."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to define their mandate and conduct the forthcoming negotiations reinforcing the above."
"Mrs Gál, I would like to say that you are the first Hungarian Member that I have seen since we heard the news that our fellow Member and friend, Mr Pál Schmitt, has been elected President of the Hungarian Parliament."
"I would like to say that we are definitely going to miss our friend Mr Schmitt, but I ask you to formally pass on our congratulations to him, and I am sure that he will do a magnificent job leading his country's Parliament."
"(SK) Even though all Member States are signatories to the Convention, the accession of the EU as a whole will represent not just a new dimension for human rights protection in the EU, but also - I would like to stress - a legal and political signal for a strengthening of relations between the EU and Europe."
"I would also like to support the idea that, along with the EU's accession to the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, serious consideration should also be given to the wide-scale adoption of legislation setting out the area of social rights - the adoption of a revised European Social Charter at a Europe-wide level for the Union as a whole, for example, would clearly be a welcome step."
"The EU's accession to the Convention also opens up the question of the political representation of the Union in the bodies of the Council of Europe."
"At the same time, people are saying that the European Parliament should also play an active role in this process."
"I agree in principle with this view, Commissioner, but I fear that the process, including its individual components, will not be at all easy."
"Even though I currently share your enthusiasm - and of course the Council also deserves thanks for its very good work - we must prepare ourselves for the fact that the process will be very complicated and that we still have a lot of work to do in this direction."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Union is founded upon respect for human rights."
"It is, in fact, one of the finest aspects of the institution."
"It is just that I have the impression we are building these human rights exclusively for our own citizens."
"Mrs Beňová and Mrs Wikström have spoken about this."
"However, I have the impression that we are neglecting what Mrs Hautala spoke about, and by that I mean efforts to propagate human rights outside the EU."
"It is my conviction that the European Union lacks commitment in this area."
"It is with hope that I welcome the European Union's accession to the Convention, because this gives the opportunity for a certain consistency of the system of rights and the protection of human rights in the European Union."
"It should be borne in mind that when creating new rights, other freedoms should not be curtailed."
"This is, of course, a subject for philosophers and theoreticians of law, but this tension between rights and freedoms does exist."
"In view of this, both legislators and, later, the judges who enforce the law should be aware of this."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Article 6 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that the EU shall accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which represents a strengthening of the system of fundamental rights within the EU."
"The European Convention on Human Rights is extremely important for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe."
"Our affiliation to this legal system would strengthen the fundamental rights of EU citizens, as they would gain an additional means of legal remedy in the event that they considered their fundamental rights violated."
"I view the accession of the EU to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as a very positive step, as it will also raise awareness of the importance of fundamental rights in the EU and ideally increase the credibility of the EU with regard to its external relations."
"Mr President, first of all let me thank both our rapporteurs - Kinga Gál and Ramón Jáuregui Atondo - and also the Commission and the Presidency."
"(ES) Thank you very much for the very hard but necessary work that you have done."
"When we were talking about the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights - and we have been talking about it in the European Union for the past 10 years, I think - there were quite a lot of worries that there would be competition between the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice, that we would have problems when it came to jurisdiction, that the autonomy of the European Court of Justice might be questioned."
"But I think that what we have achieved in our work is that we are coming to a situation in which those two courts can be complementary."
"We were trying to do everything to avoid hierarchical thinking, but actually we have cross-fertilisation between those two systems of human rights protection."
"In the light of recent trends, where the ECJ follows the case-law of the Strasbourg court and vice versa, I think that the two systems coexist and actually there is no competition, and most of those fears have been dissipated."
"In the recent Bosphorus judgment that we all know very well, the European Court of Human Rights said that there was no need to re-examine the case because the EU, as such, offers an adequate level of protection of human rights."
"So then the question arises: why do we need accession to the Convention?"
"This question has been posed by our colleagues here and, yes, we do need it."
"Why do we need it?"
"Not only because of the symbolic meaning, which is important, but because the whole system of protecting human rights in the European Union will gain credibility in the eyes of citizens who will enjoy the protection from the actions of the EU, not only of the Member States as is the case now."
"When there is no effective judicial review either at national or at Community level - when, for example, the applicant is denied standing or the EU body concerned cannot be sued, those are the situations where we will have added value."
"We are acceding to the Convention for the sake of greater coherence of the system of human rights protection, not to undermine the credibility of that system."
"We need loyalty, and that is why we postulate that inter-State applications should not be brought concerning an alleged failure of compliance when the act falls within the scope of Union law."
"We postulate this and we should do our utmost to put it into law."
"Finally, I would like to thank very much the Commission for setting up a DG on Human Rights."
"I remember as a student reading Joseph Weiler's articles about the protection of human rights."
"He came to the conclusion that you can do whatever you like in terms of applying for and acceding to the Convention on Human Rights, but if there is no implementation and follow-up in the Commission then it will be fruitless."
"So finally, thanks to you, we have it."
"Hopefully we will go forward and have better protection of human rights in the European Union than we have now."
"(HU) I am very pleased that by signing up to the most fundamental European human rights document, the European Union is taking another step towards developing a truly unified Europe and is enhancing its credibility when it intervenes against human rights violations in third countries."
"However, we must not forget that in terms of the protection of human rights, the Council of Europe is in many ways ahead of the European Union."
"This is why I urge the Commission to examine the possibility of signing up to other Council of Europe conventions and prepare an inventory of those international treaties concluded within the Council of Europe which would help us enhance the quality of the EU's human rights legislation, if we were to acceed to them."
"I believe that in order for Europe to truly become a region of freedom, security and law, it will be necessary to cooperate with the Council of Europe and adopt its existing achievements in the area of human rights."
"Amongst these achievements special attention should be given to the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, which set out the minimum requirements for issues concerning indigenous national minorities, based on European values, respect for diversity and the rights set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Member States of the European Union are all members of the Council of Europe, and most of them have signed and ratified the documents mentioned."
"It would be natural for the extension of the Union's legislation into this domain to be carried out with the inclusion of the widely ratified conventions."
"(RO) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has ensured the European Union's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"In fact, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will protect fundamental rights and liberties against EU actions."
"This fact is all the more important as Member States have transferred important powers to the European Union."
"I should emphasise that accession will not affect the principle of autonomy of EU law, as the Court of Justice in Luxembourg will remain the sole supreme court for all issues concerning EU law."
"Romania signed the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in 1993."
"It is important to point out that Article 20 of the Romanian Constitution stipulates that international regulations governing fundamental human rights which Romania is party to take precedence over national laws."
"(HU) Commissioner, it is very important that the Council of Europe has a mechanism that was developed and has been functioning for decades, monitored by the European Court of Human Rights, and that the European Union will share it."
"I have been saying for a long time that as far as the protection of human rights and minorities in Europe is concerned, it is of great concern that it is the Council of Europe which has a functioning system for the protection of human rights and minorities, while the real political weight in Europe lies with the Union."
"I would like to draw attention to the excellent report by the rapporteur, Kinga Gál, in which she points out that the relevant law of precedent or case law frequently provides a significant support for the protection of minority rights, which the European Union cannot offer."
"I would also reinforce what Mr Sógor mentioned."
"This could be a precedent for the European Union to join the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, since 8.5% of the Union's population belong to minorities and the Union has no system at all for the protection of minorities."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Jáuregui on the very serious work that he has done."
"This report clarifies institutional and operational aspects arising from the European Union signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"It was three decades ago now that the European Commission and Parliament adopted both resolutions requesting that the Union sign up to the Convention."
"Now, with a more complex Union, with 27 Member States, no one is questioning whether this should happen."
"Agreement on these principles is the basis for the political cohesion and the identity of the European Union, and when these things go into crisis there are political and also economic problems."
"Defending all human rights and fundamental freedoms in any circumstances and without hesitation means working to strengthen democracy and for progress, and it means completely excluding any expression of violence, imposition or totalitarianism."
"This, let us not forget, was the main direction of the European Union project."
"This is the course that we need to take, and I ask the Commission and the Council to work towards it."
"Also, Mr President, I would like to send my regards and condolences to the families of the victims in Greece."
"(PL) The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is one of the foundations of the European theory of values, which defends the rights of the individual and human rights."
"This lay at the basis of the establishment of the European Union in terms of values."
"For many years, the European Court of Human Rights has fulfilled its role very well, defending the weak and the persecuted."
"Recently, however, there have been several rulings which call into question the ECHR's understanding of the principle of freedom of the individual."
"Last year, the whole of Europe was swept by a wave of discussion and opposition to a verdict which prohibited the display of a cross in a public place."
"I think the European Union, acceding to the Convention under the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, should at the same time begin discussion and debate in the sense of profound reflection, so that this kind of distortion of individual freedom and falsely understood human rights does not happen again in the future."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Parliament has many times adopted resolutions condemning cases of breaches of human rights and freedoms in different parts of the world."
"It should, however, be said that as the European Union we are unable to cope with obvious violations of these fundamental rights in Member States of the European Union."
"I would like to give a very relevant example."
"Recently, the Chief Official Ethics Commission of Lithuania penalised Mr Tomaševski, leader of the Polish minority and a Member of the European Parliament, for putting a question to Mr Barroso about respect for the rights of minorities."
"This is a bizarre and downright scandalous situation."
"I would like to ask the following question: will accession to the Framework Convention change anything?"
"The European Union should develop standards on these matters which are very much higher than those adopted in the Framework Convention."
"It is time such cases of discrimination did not take place in Member States of the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, firstly I too should like to express my deep regret at the loss of three Greek citizens in Greece today, during the course of peaceful rallies by Greek citizens demonstrating for a better future."
"Certain persons, acting on the margins, certain persons acting anti-democratically, so wrongly deprived these people of their lives."
"It truly is a tragic irony that we are today debating the strengthening and deepening of the fabric of protection for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of European citizens with our accession to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"However effectively the Court in Strasbourg worked, we must know that, in order to strengthen the idea of Europe, a Europe of values, an anthropocentric Europe, what must take precedence over everything is solidarity: solidarity between Member States, solidarity between nations, the solidarity that we need so badly in Greece right now."
"Mr President, almost all the Members who have spoken have expressed their support for the European Union signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and we are fully in agreement with them."
"I would like to refer to the two speeches that seemed to express reticence or opposition to this, considering it either a threat to the competences of the Union, in the case of Mr Ziobro, or unnecessary, in the case of Mrs Morvai."
"I would like to refer to both of these speeches and answer them both specifically."
"With regard to Mr Ziobro's argument, there is no problem with the Strasbourg Court interfering in the Union's competences."
"That is not its objective and, moreover, this is stated in Protocol 8 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is clear that it does not change the competences or powers of the Union's institutions."
"There is no problem."
"In addition to the issue of the 'co-respondent' mechanism - in other words, the European Union along with a Member State - when there is an appeal against a Member State before the Strasbourg Court, one of the subjects that is being dealt with in a working group on this matter is that of exhausting the judicial remedies of the Luxembourg Court first, before going to the European Court of Human Rights."
"This is one of the subjects that are being worked on from a technical point of view in the working group, so that there will not be any doubt that the European Court of Human Rights does not impinge on the competences of the Union; it simply establishes whether or not there has been an infringement of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"The second argument is that of Mrs Morvai, who says, 'I can go against a decision by an authority of my country and I can go to the European Court of Human Rights, so why do I need the European Union to sign up?'"
"I think that this is quite clear: the European Union has competences that the Member States do not have."
"The European Union not only has competences, but what is more, it has increased them."
"The European Union has become an institution that takes decisions through directives, regulations and decisions from a legal point of view, which could infringe the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"That is why the European Union's journey towards an increasingly powerful institution means that as well as the Member States signing the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and submitting to the jurisdiction of Strasbourg, the European Union therefore also needs to submit to the jurisdiction of Strasbourg; that is why the Treaty of Lisbon establishes that this is the case."
"In addition, the history of the European Court of Human rights and its case law has been highly positive for human rights in Europe."
"The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, which is the text that the Court applies, is quite old - it dates back to 1950 - and, like the Treaty of Rome, it was also signed in Rome."
"Protocols have since been added to it over time."
"It is old, but nevertheless there has been a wealth of case law that has become the case law of the constitutional courts and supreme courts of the Member States."
"It has formed a sort of common doctrine, which is essentially the doctrine that the Luxembourg Court and the Strasbourg Court together are seeking to establish for the future in the interpretation of human rights."
"We therefore feel it is entirely justified for the European Union to sign this Convention."
"Moreover, we feel that it is going to protect not only the people of the Member States, but also people who come from outside the European Union and have the status of a foreign resident, because the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights protects anyone who is under the jurisdiction of a Member State and in the future anyone who is under jurisdiction that is affected by the decisions taken by the European Union."
"It is therefore not only nationals of the Member States, but also those who are not nationals of the Member States who will be protected by this Convention if the Union signs it."
"I would like to say that we are pleased that there is a consensus with regard to the importance of moving forward with the development of the mandate presented by the European Commission and that there is going to be a Parliament sitting on this, as announced by Mr Jáuregui and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate him and the other rapporteurs of this report, Mrs Gál and Mr Preda."
"I would also like to say that it is the intention of the Spanish Presidency that this mandate - based on the text sent by the Commission, which we understand has to be responsible for negotiating it with the European Council - should be adopted by the Council of Ministers, the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council, on 4 June."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by saying how much I agree with what the Spanish Presidency has just given as answers to some of the questions of the parliamentarians."
"I will not repeat it because I would say exactly the same."
"Permit me just to thank the parliamentarians who have intervened in a very positive way in order to underline the importance of fundamental rights, which are the basis of our Union."
"To reinforce those fundamental rights for each single citizen can only be an advancement of what we think as being the real values of our Europe."
"I would like to thank specifically the two rapporteurs, who have done very important work in order to bring Parliament towards agreeing to the basic mandate, but the basic mandate, as has also been said in this House, is only the beginning, because we have to negotiate."
"These negotiations will certainly take a long time, and when we have finished the negotiations, the ratification process has to start."
"So, Mr President, I foresee that I will have to come back very often - with pleasure, of course - to this House in order to report on how we stand, how we are advancing, what the problems are and what the solutions are."
"I am very confident that the parliamentarians will help us in order to achieve the common goal, which is a Europe of values and of rights."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (NL) As the European Parliament, we have to make sure that the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) does not reinforce the current trend of judges of the European Court of Justice and of the European Court of Human Rights overruling decisions taken democratically by Member States, in the areas of asylum and immigration, for example."
"I could cite quite a few recent examples of that."
"Judges who are not elected and who therefore do not have to account to anyone, are increasingly interfering with the legislative and executive powers of Member States."
"That is a pernicious development and one that reinforces the European Union's democratic deficit."
"in writing. - (PL) Accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a proposal which has been on the European Parliament's agenda for a long time."
"The Treaty of Lisbon, which provides a legal basis in this matter, allows for negotiations to be started."
"This is a very important step, which enables more effective enforcement of the fundamental rights of European Union citizens."
"We must, however, be aware that we have a great deal of work ahead of us before the Union becomes a party to the Convention."
"Many questions of a legal nature arise, which will have to be answered during the negotiations."
"The following questions are among them."
"Should the Union accede only to the Convention itself, or should it also become a party to the protocols?"
"How should the matter of representation of the Union in the bodies of the Council of Europe be solved?"
"Finally, and most importantly, what relations should be adopted between the two courts - the Court of Justice in Luxembourg and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg?"
"Let us remember that a fundamental principle of the European Union's legal system is the exclusive jurisdiction of the ECJ to interpret EU law."
"I am pleased that the newly constituted Commission has treated the matter of accession to the Convention as a priority and has prepared a recommendation to begin negotiations."
"The most important matter now is for Member States to reach an understanding on fundamental matters, so that the negotiations can proceed smoothly."
"in writing. - (DE) With the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) the EU is creating a few problems for itself."
"I am thinking, for example, about the alleged contravention of the Convention in connection with Italy's forced repatriation of African refugees."
"In that case, the cudgel of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees was swung, although the protection of refugees expressly relates to persecution on political or religious grounds, among others."
"Today, these are mainly economic migrants."
"Are we trying to stipulate their reception via a circuitous route?"
"In general, our failed integration policy of the last few decades is rebounding on us."
"The European Court of Human Rights in the EU will perhaps impose minarets and burkas on Europe, and some proceedings are already under way; is, conversely, the crucifix to disappear from school walls and perhaps subsequently from first-aid boxes, seals, coats of arms and national flags?"
"In actual fact, freedom of religion was intended to be applied against a State that prohibits the practice of religion in public."
"It must not be the case that the indigenous population has to deny its Western heritage for the sake of the rights of a few individuals to feel good."
"In particular, the retention of data will probably be incompatible with the ECHR, too."
"The question arises as to whether the current plan to block child pornography on the Internet would comply with the Convention, especially as Internet blocks by the entertainment industry are used as an opportunity to install copyright filters, and the majority of the sites originate in the US and therefore are not subject to EU law, so the root of the problem of misuse is not tackled."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs with regard to the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, I asked myself, as other colleagues have also done, what such a decision actually provides."
"I believe that the answer to this is as follows."
"Accession provides an additional external check at EU level in terms of respecting rights."
"This helps strengthen public order in Europe, based as we all know, on human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"Finally, accession provides the EU with additional credibility in its foreign relations."
"On the other hand, we must be aware that there are a number of questions expecting an answer."
"Which area is covered by accession?"
"Just the Convention or its additional protocols as well?"
"What forms of representation will the EU use in the Convention's bodies?"
"What role will Parliament play in appointing the EU judge to the ECHR?"
"I firmly believe that all these questions will be answered soon."
"Europe still does not have an effective system for the protection of human rights."
"The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is the most important instrument for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe."
"It is of particular significance to the citizens of my country, which Right-wing governments have deprived of the ability to protect the fundamental rights guaranteed by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which upholds the Convention, has dealt with over 100 000 cases since being established."
"The number of cases increases significantly from year to year."
"In 2009, almost 60 000 complaints were submitted to the Court, which represents a growth of 20% compared to 2008."
"The Member States are not in a hurry to recognise the judgments of the Court."
"If they did this quickly and effectively, there would be a decided reduction in complaints."
"Accession of the Union to the ECHR will be an additional goad to encourage efficient implementation of the decisions of the Court - an institution which upholds citizens' rights and makes it possible for them to seek justice."
"Conformity of legal acts with the text of the Convention will come under the supervision of the Court."
"In relation to this, the decisions of the Court should also find expression in EU policy."
"Perhaps thanks to this the Polish Right will understand, among other things, that the state should ensure confessional neutrality in state educational establishments, where presence at lessons is required regardless of religious confession (from the judgment of the Court on the case of Lautsi v Italy)."
"Electric cars (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on electric cars."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Tajani, as you know, European industry as a whole has been seriously affected by the global economic and financial crisis, and in this extremely tough climate for all sectors of the economy and also for industry, we believe that Europe's utmost priority is to restore growth and employment."
"Today we have heard good news in the Commission's forecasts regarding the recovery that is taking place in the whole of the European Union."
"Although the recovery is small, ultimately it is recovery, and in particular it must mean industrial activity."
"We believe that industry - and on this I am certain that I am in agreement with the Vice-President of the Commission, because we recently spoke about this matter and he agrees with us - is and must be an irreplaceable driving force behind growth and recovery for the European economy."
"We therefore need to back European industry."
"European industry - I repeat - can play a driving role in the economy and in order for this to be the case we firstly need to protect our industrial fabric from the tough economic climate that we are experiencing, and secondly we need to improve the competitiveness of European industry."
"In other words, European industry needs to return to leadership and competitiveness in the global market; it needs to back innovation and the development of new technologies."
"In this respect, as in many other things, it is very important for the response to these challenges to have a European perspective and a European focus."
"Within the industrial sector we need to place special emphasis on the sectors with the greatest capacity for impact and growth."
"One of those is undoubtedly the vehicle sector, with its great capacity for transferring technology to other activities, its impact on employment, its export capacity and its potential for growth."
"It is therefore important that we focus on the vehicle sector, which according to the Commission's own figures is a sector that in Europe employs 12 million people directly or indirectly and is the main private investor in research, development and innovation, investing EUR 20 billion per year."
"Within the European vehicle fleet, which could amount to 270 million vehicles by 2030, there is a type of vehicle that must become a focus of attention for achieving the objectives that I was referring to before."
"We are talking about electric cars, which are one of the prime examples of the innovative strategies that must be considered in this sector."
"The Spanish Presidency has therefore included developing electric cars as a priority on its agenda, as a preferred alternative mode of transport in order to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels derived from oil in the transport sector, and therefore make a clear and decisive move towards an energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable transport system."
"In order to do this the Council believes that we need a global strategy to develop the technologies, including, in this case, electric technology."
"The Council is therefore promoting the debate on possible measures to adopt in order to promote the production of electric cars by the European industry, so on 8 and 9 February we took the debate to the informal Competitiveness Council meeting in San Sebastián."
"It was a really intense debate in which three central areas for work were identified: firstly, promoting a leading European market in the production of electric vehicles and their batteries; secondly, supporting the adoption and acceptance of electric cars as a mode of transport similar to conventional cars, putting them at the same level or seeking to achieve that in the future, as at the moment they are not at the same level and it will take some time for them to get there; and thirdly, creating the conditions for a single market in electric cars."
"It was therefore agreed to invite the European Commission to draw up an action plan."
"In response to this invitation, the Commission - as Mr Tajani will mention later - has published its European strategy on clean and energy-efficient vehicles, a communication produced on 27 April that talks about electric technologies, other alternative technologies in this field and other matters."
"We would like there to be some conclusions in the Competitiveness Council in May on the Commission communication presented on 27 April, and this is our intention."
"In short, we believe that we must pursue the objectives of this strategy and, within it, the objectives of the 2010-2012 action plan, so that the broad areas for action are translated into 15 specific actions, which were also proposed by the Commission, in order to lay the groundwork for introducing electric vehicles."
"Mr President, Mr López Garrido, as the Spanish Presidency has just said, last week the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, adopted a communication on clean and energy-efficient vehicles, and I had the pleasure of presenting this text as a priority issue to the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy themselves during my hearing last Wednesday."
"The communication consists of two main pillars: a first part on the improvement of traditional combustion engines, and a second part aimed at establishing a road map for promoting and facilitating the widespread use of advanced technologies in relation to ultra-low-carbon vehicles, hydrogen vehicles, biofuel vehicles, hybrid vehicles and 100% electric vehicles."
"Electric cars are, precisely, the subject of this evening's debate and of the resolution on which this Parliament is preparing to vote tomorrow."
"Anyone who has paid close attention to the developments affecting the car industry will agree with me that an unprecedented consensus has been reached in favour of electric vehicles."
"Decisive moments have been the meeting of the Council of Ministers in San Sebastián, under the Spanish Presidency, the announcements of national programmes for electric mobility and the motor shows, not only in Europe, but also in Detroit and Beijing."
"We now know that European car manufacturers will launch the first fully electric vehicles and rechargeable hybrid vehicles onto the market in 2011, while continuing at the same time to produce more up-to-date, highly energy-efficient conventional vehicles."
"More important still is the fact that these clean cars are not only an object of curiosity in the showrooms of dealerships, but they are also eagerly awaited by European consumers, who have clearly indicated their preference for smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles."
"I wish to briefly illustrate in this House the content of the Commission's strategy: the strategy includes more than 40 concrete measures, and I would like to take this opportunity to illustrate to you the three that have been identified by the interested parties as the main priorities that the Commission must address, namely standardisation, financial incentives and research."
"Standardising electric vehicles is fundamentally important for the purposes of ensuring that European citizens can recharge their vehicles when they cross borders; so-called interoperability is an essential requirement if consumers are to wholeheartedly embrace new technology and, hence, the uptake of electric vehicles on the mass market is to be guaranteed."
"That is why it is anticipated in the communication that the Commission will work with the European standardisation bodies, on the basis of the consolidated standardisation process, to adopt a single solution for interoperability, to address safety risks and to consider a smart charging system for electric vehicle chargers."
"The standard must incorporate the existing technical solutions and, of course, guarantee safety and an affordable price for consumers."
"I am convinced that we must harness the current momentum in order to opt for a genuine single European solution, based on our internal market principles."
"If we let slip this opportunity, we could find ourselves in a fragmented market for many years; not only would this be negative for consumers and European businesses, it would also be unwise given the numerous competing international initiatives."
"As regards financial incentives, on the other hand, ladies and gentlemen, they have already been introduced by various Member States."
"In some cases the incentives relate explicitly to electric vehicles, while in other cases they are linked to low CO2 emissions."
"The Commission does not intend, of course, to force the Member States to offer incentives, but it does wish to coordinate the exchange of information and to propose a set of guidelines on this subject in order to prevent, precisely, fragmentation of the market."
"The third element is research: the Commission intends to strive to ensure that European research achieves the objective of having clean and highly energy-efficient transport."
"It will support research in all these technological sectors, while at the same time streamlining and simplifying the procedures for obtaining European subsidies."
"I shall conclude by emphasising the impact that this strategy will have; it goes far beyond the car industry."
"I share the Spanish Presidency's view: we are here to examine a strategy, that is, the one contained in the Europe 2020 document proposed by the Commission and approved by the Council, which places industrial and enterprise policy at the heart of the strategy for emerging from the crisis and for creating prosperity and promoting development in our society in the years to come."
"The measures taken on behalf of the car industry, to ensure that it can definitely innovate but that it can also compete on the international market, are part of this strategy to safeguard industry but also all those small and medium-sized enterprises that revolve around major European industry, which actually represents one of the pillars of major industry."
"Therefore, I believe that this work that we are doing to open up future prospects for the car industry is a commendable initiative, and I was delighted to hear the words of the Spanish Presidency, which welcomed the communication by the Commission."
"The Commission wants, together with Parliament and the Council, to examine a strategy that will enable our European industry, our European entrepreneurial system, to evolve, because, as the Treaty of Lisbon states and as we are all convinced, a strong market is the best vehicle for creating sound social policy."
"Without business and without industry we cannot conceive of protecting jobs, or of safeguarding the right to work of our fellow citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, this is a debate on an issue on which there is generally a great deal of agreement, so it is not one of those debates in which there are radically different positions, but rather the positions are different in simple terms."
"We heard this in the speech by Mr López Garrido, and in the speech by the Commissioner, and it is reflected in the resolution that will be put to the vote tomorrow in Parliament with the support of all the political groups."
"Having said this, there are a series of problems to resolve before electric cars can be fully efficient, and the task that we now have in front of us is to focus on seeing how we can resolve these problems as soon as possible so that electric cars can also become part of the whole project of having more sustainable and efficient energy consumption."
"In this respect I would like to highlight one of the issues that has been mentioned, which is also in the resolution, which is the issue of research."
"There are still a series of fundamental problems linked to the efficiency of the batteries and recharging, as well as the problems of standardisation, interoperability, and so on, which have a long way to go."
"In order for this ground to be covered as soon as possible, I think that it is essential, as in so many other aspects linked to energy and other issues, that efforts are focused on research."
"This does require an enormous effort from a financial point of view, both from the European institutions and from the national institutions."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (ES) Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Spanish Presidency on behalf of my group for rightly including electric cars among its priorities and also the Commission, and Mr Tajani, for taking up the challenge."
"This is because, ladies and gentlemen, the capacity to enter the sector swiftly with quality, standardised products will determine the future leaders in a highly competitive market."
"We agree, Mr Tajani, that in order to be successful it is essential that there is standardisation of infrastructures and charging methods."
"However, how are you going to speed up this standardisation in order to prevent this issue from delaying the introduction of electric cars in the European Union?"
"We agree that it is essential to support research and development in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency, as we already have significant external technological dependence."
"We are also concerned to know what measures are going to be taken at European level to promote research, especially into batteries."
"I shall end with a question to Mr Tajani."
"The Commission tends to refer to cleanly propelled vehicles generically."
"However electric propulsion technology is the most developed."
"The manufacturers have a large variety of models, and they are soon going to begin marketing them."
"Do you not think that electric cars can be introduced in Europe much sooner than other forms of clean propulsion?"
"Do you not think that it is realistic to think that electric cars will be widespread in Europe by 2015-2020?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner thank you for your statement."
"I am very grateful for the initiative by the Spanish Presidency - and this is a very Spanish event as far as I can see - in adopting this series of proposals and leading the way in this regard."
"Electromobility must play a key role in future."
"However, as we all know, we are still a long way from achieving comprehensive electromobility."
"For that reason, we should also not make the mistake of allowing electric-car hype to arise, the claims of which we are not able to fulfil in political terms."
"Therefore, we should not abandon our focus on improving conventional means of locomotion, as crude oil will probably continue to fuel our mobility for a long time yet."
"The following points are crucial, however."
"Firstly, as you and all of the other speakers have said, we need a European strategy for the development of standards."
"The United States and China are working jointly on conductive charge couplers."
"We must not lag behind in this regard."
"We ought to lead the way and should not allow European vanity to take hold."
"Are the French quicker, or the Germans or the Spaniards?"
"We should all pull together and the Commission should certainly take the lead in this."
"We need to develop cost-effective, high-performance batteries."
"Secondly, we need to extend network-infrastructure coverage to all areas."
"For us, that means that we have to focus our subsidy options on this in a more targeted way in the area of cohesion, in the regions and also in the development of rural areas."
"Citizens must be able to use electromobility across borders, otherwise they will not use this form of transport."
"Thirdly, we must also take electric cars into account in our CO2 emissions calculations."
"Car manufacturers that are currently carrying out fleet calculations cannot yet include electric cars."
"We need to be able to take these into account in future."
"Fourthly, we must provide tax relief on electric cars throughout Europe."
"This applies to batteries in particular, which are still the most expensive part."
"We need to carry out research in this regard, but we also need to harmonise our taxes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, traffic in Europe is responsible for around 30% of CO2 emissions, with road transport accounting for the greatest part of that."
"Avoiding, switching and improving are therefore the order of the day."
"We need to find the most environmentally friendly propulsion technology for vehicles."
"Electric vehicles include trains, trams, buses, cars and bicycles."
"The prerequisite for this, however, is that there must be no revival of the hazardous nuclear energy, which is why the production of renewable energy is the conditio sine qua non."
"In addition, the result of the whole cycle from production via use through to waste and recycling must be a positive one."
"Only then shall we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance be able to support electromobility."
"Replacing the current car fleet with electric cars will neither resolve the problem of congestion nor protect the climate."
"There are five disadvantages of car transport: the noise, the pollutants, the accident figures, the costs and the land use."
"At most, electric cars solve the emissions problem."
"The area of land used alone is immense."
"For this reason, Germany, for example, has undertaken to limit the amount of land sealed under concrete and asphalt each day to 30 hectares from 2020."
"It is currently 117 hectares a day."
"Therefore, the number of cars must be reduced."
"For the remaining cars and also for trains, buses, trams and electric bikes we need the most environmentally friendly technology."
"If that turns out to be electromobility, we shall need European and international standardisation."
"The Greens will vote in favour of this resolution."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - (CS) I have spent a long time looking into the problem of regulation and bureaucracy in my own country."
"Most of you probably know me only thanks to my journey by bicycle from Prague to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, which was 866 km long."
"However, most of you do not know that in Prague I ride an electric bicycle."
"I am not an environmental extremist."
"I use it for practical reasons, because it pays off for me, as it is quicker in the Prague traffic and I can ride it wearing a suit."
"In my opinion, this is how we should approach the issue of standardising electric vehicles."
"I have the honour here of being the rapporteur from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for the EP report on standardisation and normalisation."
"We will organise a hearing on this in June with the participation of Commissioner Tajani, and I am delighted that he considers it an important matter."
"There will certainly be more room for discussion there."
"More than at other times, Europe today needs to be competitive and needs innovation."
"However, standards are only one of the instruments for helping industry."
"Personally, I agree with the representatives of industry that the Brussels regulations on the introduction of electric vehicles are a death-knell."
"Pressure for innovation should come not from regulations but from demand."
"If they are developed to order, then the vehicles will be unacceptably expensive and nobody will buy them."
"By the way, the electric bicycle I ride was made in China."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I believe that it is really important that we think about this question of electric vehicles and debate it thoroughly."
"Many of the issues that I wanted to mention have already been raised here."
"Nevertheless, I wish to say that it is important because we must, from the outset, think about this question within the development model that we currently have, and the electric car issue is fundamental to allowing us to rethink that model, whether in terms of reducing dependency on fossil fuels, or in terms of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, as has already been mentioned, or in terms of greater energy efficiency and enhancement of the potential of using energy from non-renewable sources."
"There are, however, two points that appear to be absolutely fundamental to me."
"We cannot consider any of these strategies unless, first of all, it is integrated within a broader mobility strategy that goes beyond the automotive sector and includes other modes of transport."
"It has to be much more extensive; otherwise we will not solve the problem."
"A second point, which is also quite important, is that we have to take into account the crisis that we are experiencing."
"In such a context of crisis, we must take this opportunity to convert and retrain the labour market, so as to avoid negative social impacts."
"We can no longer take any more negative social impacts, so I was calling for this strategy to be taken and seen in an integrated way, as we are trying to do in the motion for a resolution that we are submitting to Parliament as a group tomorrow."
". - (NL) Mr President, when Mr Ford produced his first car, he said: ""My car is available in any colour as long as it is black.”"
"Nothing much has changed since then."
"A car is available in any model as long as it is environmentally friendly."
"I have nothing against environmental friendliness, but these days the environment has been rendered unaffordable by leftist politicians."
"The consumer is paying over the odds and that is being obscured by all sorts of government grants, but the environment would be very expensive and uneconomical if all the subsidies paid by the taxpayer were taken away."
"We now want a standardised electric car in the European Union."
"The Dutch Party for Freedom does not think that this is something the European Union should be concerning itself with, rather it is the concern of industry."
"Besides, an electric car is useless at the moment."
"The batteries and their life are still far too limited and contain extremely harmful substances."
"If millions of people are soon to start plugging in their electric cars in the evening in order to recharge them, all the fuses will blow straight away and the lights will go out, quite literally, because our grids will not be able to cope with the load."
"What is more, all that extra power for electric cars will need to be generated by additional power stations."
"In short, therefore, the electric car is unaffordable and polluting, it places too heavy a burden on network capacity and it does not generally look like much either, whether it is black or not."
"We therefore do not want any European standardisation of the electric car, not now, not ever."
"(NL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost I would ask that you pay no attention to the incredibly stupid comments made by the previous speaker."
"Having said that, I would like to point out that, as the President has already said, the automotive industry is the most important industrial sector in the European Union and will remain incredibly important for employers, for employees and for jobs."
"I think that we should switch to the electric car as soon as possible, as the Commissioner has already said."
"That is why we now have to implement the action plan which you, Commissioner, tabled a week ago."
"I will single out three priorities from your action plan."
"First of all, the employees themselves."
"They obviously need to be given training so that they can work with the new technologies and that is something we have heavily emphasised in our resolution."
"I stress this particular issue to you."
"We are asking for a major effort to be made with regard to training, particularly through the European Social Fund."
"Secondly, Commissioner and President, the vehicles of the future and, in particular, electric batteries."
"This issue has already been mentioned here, but it cannot be overstated."
"We, as the European Union, have the ambition of taking the global lead and, if nothing else, keeping pace with the Chinese."
"If we are to achieve that, battery technology must be an absolute priority in the seventh and eighth Framework Programmes for Research and Development."
"There is some reshuffling to be done there and we need to place an emphasis on this."
"Thirdly, the charging infrastructure."
"Contrary to what the previous speaker has said, we have to come up with a European standard by the end of next year, and that is included in your plan."
"Otherwise, we will get bogged down in a fragmented market."
"Commissioner, President, ladies and gentlemen, we have here a unique opportunity to provide a strong impetus to job growth in Europe and to avoid being flooded by products and parts made in China."
"It is not too late to avoid that."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner and Secretary of State, I have a few points: technology, neutrality, standardisation, smart metering and raw materials."
"May I first of all compliment the Commission on having adopted a technology-neutral approach."
"I give my backing to that because energy efficiency in cars must be regulated through ambitious CO2 emissions legislation and we have to choose a green technology."
"The technology will choose itself."
"It is the norm in Parliament to hand out compliments and I am quite happy to do that but, with your permission President, I will reserve my praise for next time because I think that the Commission is quite late with its standardisation of electric vehicles."
"You have talked about charging interfaces but, on the whole, no actual mention has been made of batteries."
"The standards will be available only in 2012 and will perhaps begin to apply as late as 2013."
"Might I suggest that you do your best to speed that up?"
"You have not mentioned smart meters in cars at all and yet you have talked about smart charging."
"May I ask you to ensure that smart meters are included in your next communication, because that is the only possible way of managing mobility and of levying tax on energy, if need be."
"Now, over to raw materials, you have talked about all sorts of possibilities but, quite frankly, lithium is not available on a large scale."
"May I therefore ask that you increase your efforts and that you carry out more research in order to find alternatives for this scarce material."
"(PL) Mr President, the European Union needs coordination of research, innovative action and aggregation of investments to stimulate the development of fuel technologies in electric vehicles."
"The European market is going to have to speed up construction of the infrastructure for recharging batteries and also ensure that there are financial incentives for consumers to purchase electric cars."
"Standardisation of vehicles and ensuring their universal operability in the European market is essential."
"In its priorities, and particularly at the meeting in San Sebastian in February this year, the Spanish Presidency clearly suggested the need to develop a uniform position both in Europe and worldwide."
"I hope European constructors will contribute to making the ideas of the 2020 strategy a reality, creating modern solutions for connecting electric vehicles to smart electricity networks."
"Nevertheless, we must not forget that the changes which are before us should be introduced in a balanced way, with appropriate measures for harmonisation and using sources of energy which are already in use in the motor industry, such as propane, butane and natural gas, all of which have ecological benefits."
"Electric cars, their significance for the continued process of decarbonisation and their efficiency must be scrupulously analysed from the point of view of carbon dioxide emissions."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is taking steps to devise a new alternative to traditional vehicles: that of electric cars."
"I am grateful to the Spanish Presidency for this, that is, for having included this important matter in its political agenda."
"I am also grateful to Commissioner Tajani for the points he made."
"Many Member States are investing in and pushing for this type of clean technology, but Europe clearly must rethink the infrastructure, the definition of safety standards, the recharging systems and interoperability."
"A great deal of progress has already been made in terms of reducing the CO2 emissions of cars, and I hope that, with the aid of innovation, electric cars will soon become an affordable method of transport for the general public."
"It is particularly important to support new technologies, when the challenge is to have a low-carbon economy."
"Any concessions must not, however, penalise the traditional car industry, which has done and continues to do a great deal to promote sustainable mobility."
"(PT) Mr President, I welcome the recent communication on clean and efficient vehicles."
"The arrival of electric cars on the market could represent a competitive advantage for European industry."
"We must not, however, forget that Europe is currently the world leader in the automotive sector, and we cannot put this competitive advantage at risk."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to develop the conditions necessary to create an internal market of electric vehicles."
"I would also warn of the need to harmonise the standards for batteries and compatible charge points in the various Member States."
"It is also important that tax incentives be created, with appropriate electricity prices for consumers."
"Another essential factor will be the modernisation of electricity grids."
"I call for greater investment in research and development into smart grids and battery technology, in order to make more efficient use of the primary materials in the batteries."
"I ask, therefore, that all efforts be made to maintain Europe's world leadership in the automotive industry."
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank the Spanish Presidency and also the Commission for bringing the subject of electromobility to the fore."
"I also believe that we can use electromobility to revitalise the mobility economy in Europe, and we need to do that in order to create value and to safeguard jobs."
"However - to use another metaphor - we need to step on the accelerator, because the issue of electromobility affects many policy areas."
"There is, of course, the issue of standardisation, technology, but also the question of the integration of electromobility into the whole transport system, because we may need new forms of mobility, particularly in urban areas."
"Energy must be renewable and we need raw materials, so trade is also affected."
"Therefore, I would ask you, Commissioner, to perhaps integrate electromobility further in the follow-on from Cars 21."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, yesterday this Chamber was full of mayors who signed up to the Covenant of Mayors in order to make a real commitment to a low-CO2 economy."
"What I was struck by, throughout the debate, was that they are prepared to take concrete action for the benefit of our citizens and to follow through on that commitment."
"Now, the electric car is a fine flagship."
"Europe has a tradition and a reputation when it comes to quality."
"However, from a global perspective, and here I would ask that you look at the electric car figures for China, we really have to move up a gear, as the Commission's communication states."
"These mayors came up with the idea of smart cities."
"It is possible to see that there is scope for a major leap forward for the electric car, and for transport in general, especially in cities."
"In that context, the standardisation of batteries, charging points etc. is indeed of major importance."
"My country, the Netherlands, has made a choice."
"We have said 'yes' to a German plug."
"Now, that is European thinking and together we are going ahead with Mennekes' six-pole plug."
"We actually need to follow that line of thinking and link up our best technologies."
"I have two more points."
"First of all, we lack a proper communications strategy."
"From the very outset, this project has been an excellent means to bring Europe closer to its citizens and Europe can generate a greater profile for it."
"People will not be turning up for the elections, and what can Europe do about that?"
"In fact, this is something worthy of an E (European) designation: European Electric."
"We are working on a European project, on keeping jobs and on taking the lead, so perhaps that could come through a little clearer in the communication."
"(IT) Mr President, Mr López Garrido, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your report, Mr Tajani."
"The electric car project dates back to 2006: all the institutions agree that it is a valid project."
"The European Parliament already gave its verdict to that effect in 2008, the Commission issued a communication on intelligent cars back in 2006 and, today, our Commissioner is making serious and practical efforts to launch these cars in the near future."
"I heard Prime Minister Zapatero, when he presented his programme, literally cite electric cars as a key priority of the Spanish Presidency's six-month term."
"I wished to repeat that such receptiveness must be matched by practicality: practicality, in terms of propulsion, practicality, in terms of equipment, and practicality, in terms of recharging systems, which are the elements needed for electric cars to work now and in the future."
"Electric vehicles have the advantage of being able to thread in and out of traffic easily and of not requiring any major infrastructure for their manufacture, which is why I believe that this issue is of strategic importance."
"Bear in mind also - bear this in mind, Commissioner - the existence of hydrogen fuel cell prototypes, which are equally important."
"Today, there are already hybrid cars on the market, and the hybrid model works for both electric and hydrogen vehicles: hydrogen with methane, and the others with traditional diesel or petrol components."
"Alternative-fuel vehicles are a winning idea; the fact that their market share almost doubled in 2008 proves it."
"However, they still account for only 1.3% of all vehicles registered."
"We are on the right track, but time is running out for innovation to help the environment and the labour market."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Tajani, in the context of today's debate, I would like to draw attention to a new danger which has arisen with the spread of electric and hybrid vehicles."
"Put briefly, in urban conditions these vehicles are too quiet."
"Paradoxically, the low noise level, which might be considered an advantage, can be a real hazard for children and the elderly and, in particular, for blind people."
"Therefore, we should already be thinking about how to avoid accidents involving hybrid cars, because the only noise they make is the sound of their tyres running on the asphalt."
"We need, then, to answer the following questions as quickly as possible: should these cars make a noise, and if so, what kind of noise and how loud should it be?"
"Should we not already be putting an obligation on producers to develop systems which warn that a vehicle is approaching and to install them as standard?"
"We shall now move on to the catch-the-eye procedure and I shall explain the criteria I shall follow so that nobody can be vexed or angry with me later."
"We still have a large number of items on the agenda."
"Therefore, I shall give the floor to five Members this time and I shall give preference to those of you who have not already spoken today on this item."
"Obviously I will be even-handed in my treatment of the different political groups."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be really very brief, not least because I completely agree with what both Mr Tajani and Mr López Garrido said."
"In fact, I am going to completely abandon the speech I had prepared because, Mr López Garrido, you have started a debate that ought to be developed within the European Union."
"Let me explain myself better."
"I am also going to leave to one side the environmental issues relating to electric cars, in order to talk about employment problems: you, together with Mr Tajani, refer to the fact that, if Europe wants to protect itself from the emerging countries and if it wants to become the point of reference at international level, then it cannot overlook research and innovation."
"The real issue, today, which must be debated by the European Parliament, is knowing what kind of Europe and what kind of relationship between the Member States we want."
"When I see, especially in my committee, the tendency among the Member States to compete with one another by lowering the tax burden, I say that we have doubtless completely failed to understand what Europe should stand for."
"Thank you, Mr López Garrido, thank you, Mr Tajani: research and innovation really can make the European Union the nerve centre of the global economy."
"(RO) Road transport is responsible for 28% of the pollutant emissions generated by non-ETS sectors."
"According to current legislative provisions, car manufacturers must only produce, by no later than 2020, vehicles whose pollutant emissions level is below 120g CO2/km."
"In addition, vehicle manufacturers can give price reductions to buyers when they replace old, less green cars with a vehicle which has a lower level of pollutant emissions."
"As a result, in the European Union in 2009, a 7% increase was seen in demand for hybrid or electric vehicles."
"These vehicles are particularly suited to urban driving."
"The large-scale use of electric or hybrid vehicles depends on the extent of the coverage provided by the infrastructure for supplying them with power."
"In this respect, standardisation of electric vehicles becomes vital."
"(PT) Mr President, the limitations associated with electric vehicles - such as, amongst other things, the pollution associated with producing the batteries, the difficulties of supplying strategic elements such as lithium, and the limited range of the vehicles - make it inadvisable to take commercial or advertising risks."
"These vehicles are, however, an important alternative that must be given due consideration, despite these problems."
"Nevertheless, they will never come close to replacing all the current, fossil fuel-powered vehicles."
"The car-based society as we know it today has thus been given a suspended sentence."
"That is why there is a pressing need, starting now, to increase the use of all types of public, collective transport and make them accessible to all, especially electric-powered forms: surface and underground railways, heavy and light vehicles, fast trams, trolleybuses, and so on."
"- (SK) Electric vehicles are considered to be one way to fulfil strict environmental protection standards, since they do not produce any emissions."
"Many car companies in both Europe and Asia have already completed the development of these vehicles and are ready to launch them onto the market."
"However, the broader distribution of these vehicles is prevented by the lack of standards defining the parameters for universal charging stations, and the hardware and software that would enable vehicles imported into Europe by different producers to be charged efficiently and rapidly in a network of these stations that is as dense as possible."
"While the European Commission investigates, ponders and makes preparations, our Japanese friends are hard at work."
"In Tokyo, a federation of electric vehicle producers has been established, which is already drawing up common standards for these vehicles and is also offering to cooperate with European producers."
"In the interests of creating a space for electric vehicles as quickly as possible, I therefore call on the Commission to join forces with the Japanese producers as soon as possible and to contribute actively to the introduction of global standards for using electric vehicles."
"(ES) Mr President, Europe 2020 and the electric car."
"Innovation and competitiveness are in themselves knowledge."
"There are many regions in advance of the states they are part of in terms of the drive and effectiveness of their innovation policies."
"As a Basque, I am proud to be able to inform you that, five years ago now, we started to build an automotive intelligence centre. Today it has more than 50 companies involved in research, development and innovation in electric mobility for the whole of Europe."
"In the Basque country there is also a consortium whose representatives have reported on their experience to this House: Hiriko, a modular electric car designed for urban travel."
"This all came about from a public-private partnership and regional support, which meant that Spain, which had not been involved in this effort until the last moment, could include these achievements in its programme and organise its innovation summit in the Basque country."
"Regions and their knowledge should, once and for all, be of central importance if we are to construct a more participative and effective Europe."
"Then, the challenges which we are posing for the future in this resolution - which we support - will be easier to achieve."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members who have applauded the initiative of the Spanish Presidency of the Council in making support for electric vehicles a priority in the Presidency's programme."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteurs who have contributed to the motion for a resolution which will be voted on tomorrow in this House, some of whom have taken the opportunity to speak."
"They include Mrs Riera, Mrs del Castillo, Mr Cramer and Mrs Matias."
"I am very grateful for their speeches which, along with others, make it clear that this is a strategic objective of the European Union, although they have also warned of the difficulties still involved in the manufacture and widespread, mass development of electric vehicles, and also of the need to be able to count on the support of all political and economic stakeholders."
"Mrs Bilbao has just referred to the regions as a key element in the development of electric vehicles."
"I am convinced that the European Union has to take all these factors into consideration in the future."
"That is why I should like to point out some of what I see as the arguments in favour of electric vehicles."
"However, I shall also refer at the end to the difficulties or obstacles which I believe we have to overcome."
"Speaking of advantages, I believe that there are two key aspects of electric vehicles which offer considerable advantages."
"One is technology and the other energy."
"As far as technology goes, electric vehicle technology already exists."
"It is working now."
"Indeed, there are already more than 90 different models of electric vehicles advertised by vehicle manufacturers to be launched on the market in the relatively near future."
"And it is also the case that, at the same time, we must accept that some of these technologies need to be fully developed as they still have some limitations at the present time, as is the case with batteries, recharging or the warning which Mr Zasada gave us about the absence of noise and the dangers that can involve for pedestrians."
"I think that it is very important to take his views into account."
"What is more, the technology used by electric vehicles is the most efficient and best for the environment."
"The efficiency of electric vehicle technology can reach 60%, whereas traditional motors have an efficiency of 20%."
"Furthermore, as far as energy is concerned, electric vehicles objectively help us reach those goals which we spoke about this very afternoon when we talked about Europe 2020 and the fight against climate change, known as the 20/20/20 objectives."
"With their storage capacity, electric vehicles have technology that helps to mitigate one of the problems, negative points or weak spots of renewable energies."
"Electric vehicles help renewable energies, which have a weak spot: they are irregular."
"Electric vehicles compensate for this irregularity through their own special features."
"Furthermore, they also contribute as far as energy security is concerned."
"For example, there are many countries in Europe which do not have oil reserves, and electric vehicles could compensate for this lack, and make a contribution to something that is also a strategic objective of the Union: the struggle for energy security which, as we have seen, sometimes makes our societies extremely vulnerable."
"Finally, in spite of that, in spite of those advantages, electric vehicles will clearly require us to change many of our manufacturing systems, and also many of the technologies that I mentioned earlier, people's habits and power distribution networks, and it will also even make it necessary to move towards a new communications strategy, as Mr van Nistelrooj quite rightly pointed out."
"In other words, electric vehicles have a great deal of advantages but there are also obstacles and difficulties, and that clearly means that we must approach it from a positively European perspective; it means that the governments of Europe, the Commission and this Parliament, which will vote tomorrow on a series of resolutions, must pay particular attention to it."
"That is why it is so important that these three institutions of the Union - the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament - should work together on the strategic line they should adopt in relation to electric vehicles."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the Spanish Presidency has correctly situated the electric car strategy in a broad - broader - context that relates not only to electric cars but also to the development and protection of the car industry, in the context of European industrial policy."
"In this way it is considering how industry, industrial development and job creation will look in the decades to come."
"Therefore, this decision, which the Commission supports, targets - through a two-pronged strategy, which certainly does not rule out a serious effort to reduce CO2 emissions from traditional vehicles - two areas: combustion-engine cars, which must be improved, and technology and research, because, as Mrs Bilbao Barandica and Mr Pallone were saying, it is only right that we focus on technology and research if we want to overcome the challenge on the global market."
"We cannot conceive of having a competitive European car industry if strong action is not taken in the fields of innovation and research: any initiatives and support from Parliament in this area are therefore very welcome."
"Choosing an electric car does not mean excluding other options: I say this to Mr Cancian, who stressed the importance of hybrid cars, of hydrogen cars."
"Electric cars are an important resource that have already gained broad support and obtained positive results."
"Many Member States, in fact, are choosing them."
"However, I repeat - because I have also heard some MEPs oppose the principle of electric cars, which are the subject of this evening's debate - that electric cars are an extraordinary opportunity but are not the only opportunity, because our objective is to have a European industry that is more competitive on the international markets and to reduce pollution and CO2 emissions in the transport system, including in the urban transport system."
"I would point out to Mr van Nistelrooij that, during the last parliamentary term, the European Commission presented the urban action plan, which accords huge importance to electric transport in this context."
"Of course, it takes a great deal of work to produce a competitive electric car."
"Someone raised the issue of standardisation: in the Commission document the Union's standardisation bodies have already been given the task, in 2010, of developing a harmonised European standard for electric vehicle recharging systems by next year."
"We have already responded to these concerns, just as we have also responded, in the document approved by the College, to the concerns expressed by Mrs Merkies about the issue of raw materials."
"She raised the issue of lithium, along with other MEPs who have spoken about batteries during this debate."
"Precisely because it recognises the problem, the Commission has decided to include in its work programme - and we also spoke about this during a recent meeting with Mrs Merkies - a communication on the problem of raw materials, which is a priority for us."
"Some MEPs - Mr Belet, Mrs Matias - mentioned the problem of employment, but many other MEPs also spoke about the retraining of workers, because if we are to have an industrial system in the car industry which is highly innovative, which is focused not only on electric vehicles but also on the development of a transformed combustion engine - less-polluting combustion engines but all the other opportunities too - then we must focus on retraining workers as well, because our aim is to comply with the Treaty of Lisbon, which regards the market as the best vehicle for creating social policy."
"However, the concerns that have been raised by some Members are already addressed in the text of the Commission communication, in which it is explicitly stated that the Commission is willing to allocate resources from the European Social Fund to specific initiatives to retrain and provide vocational refresher training for workers, precisely so that they too can be instrumental in achieving this innovation, which should make European industry more competitive."
"I believe that Europe has a strategy."
"Mrs Stassen is opposed to electric cars: they are an opportunity, but it is ultimately up to the market to decide."
"There is also the option not to buy electric cars; no one is forcing Europeans to buy them."
"However, Mr Zasada presented another problem, which concerns the safety of transport: without doubt, when it comes to marketing, we will have to assess in every way possible the future problems in relation to both noise pollution and polluting substances, as well as the full impact of car manufacturing and scrapping on the environment."
"We have explained this problem clearly and, in fact, we are convinced that having electric cars will enable us to make progress, including in the area of safety."
"However, we must provide the manufacturers in the sector with specific guidelines, so that it really is possible to have a non-polluting electric car."
"I have tried to answer almost all of the questions that have been put by the MEPs, and I shall also reply to Mr Lange, who mentioned CARS 21."
"In the communication that was approved by the Commission and subsequently presented to Parliament and the Council, it is expressly stated, on the final few pages, that we are anxious to revive the CARS 21 high-level group."
"The latter was an extraordinary opportunity to work with the stakeholders and it must remain as such, especially since we believe - in unison with the Spanish Presidency and with the vast majority of the MEPs, Mr President, who have spoken during this debate - that the car industry is an extraordinary asset, which must certainly be adapted and in some cases restructured, which will certainly have to be modernised, but which has extraordinary potential and which is the jewel in the crown of the European industrial and entrepreneurial system."
"For this reason we are all committed to ensuring - and this evening's debate proves it - that this industrial sector can become more competitive."
"We are more competitive if we focus on innovation and research."
"I believe that choosing to commit ourselves to electric cars, too, is a good way of ensuring that European industry can compete on the global market."
"To conclude the debate I have received one motion for a resolution from six political groups, pursuant to Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (RO) Against the backdrop of climate change, green vehicles offer an effective way of reducing carbon emissions."
"However, their development must be included as part of a future policy on sustainable mobility."
"Romania would like to introduce electric cars gradually on its domestic market."
"With this in mind, Prime Minister Emil Boc decided recently to set up an interministerial group to devise a national strategy for manufacturing electric cars."
"In countries like Denmark or Israel, charging stations, which will be officially launched by the end of 2011, are being installed and tested."
"Furthermore, the French, Spanish and Irish Governments are awarding grants to anyone wishing to purchase vehicles of this kind."
"At the moment, the cost of an electric car is high, as it is basically determined by the cost of the battery."
"With the aim of supporting electric car production in the European Union, the charging infrastructures and technologies need to be standardised to facilitate cross-border electric mobility."
"In this respect, the Commission must provide financial support to Member States."
"Green cars offer significant benefits."
"They help combat climate change, reduce Europe's dependency on oil and help achieve the Europe 2020 strategy's objectives."
"This is why I believe that we must encourage the use of electric cars."
"In April the Commission issued the communication on clean and energy-efficient vehicles, which is to say on the European strategy for encouraging the development and eventual widespread use of vehicles that are 'clean and efficient' in terms of low emissions of carbon dioxide and pollutants."
"According to recent estimates, in 2020 electric vehicles will account for 1-2% of the market; in other words, they will make up less than 4% of all vehicles: clearly, the majority of the vehicles of the future will continue to be powered by internal combustion engines, and they must be supported rather than penalised as they undergo improvements."
"I believe, therefore, that attention should be paid to certain factors of interest to the European branch of the industry: spearheading the infrastructure standardisation process, especially in terms of timescales in relation to our competitors - China, the United States, Japan, Korea - and preventing the proliferation of measures aimed at providing incentives for electric cars in the areas of available funds, urban access and public procurement."
"In fact, by exclusively promoting electric cars, we are liable to decrease the widespread use of traditional or alternative (methane or biogas) combustion vehicles, thereby distorting the internal market and curbing the competitiveness of the car industry."
"The Commission has just submitted a communication on clean and energy-efficient vehicles that sets out a neutral opinion as regards electric vehicles, giving no particular priority to any of the available options, whether they are electric, hybrid or hydrogen-fuelled vehicles."
"Nevertheless, at the informal meeting of the Council in San Sebastian in February it was agreed that the EU must lead a common strategy regarding electric vehicles."
"This means that the Commission has to prioritise solving the problems that still afflict electric vehicle production, such as the cost of the batteries, the need for more research and development to improve features, and, most important, the harmonisation of electric vehicles and charge points, both globally and across Europe, in order to ensure a high level of competitiveness in the market, so that electric vehicles can compete with traditional internal-combustion engines on a level playing field."
"I would remind the Commission of the need to prioritise the financial resources for this purpose, especially because of the simple fact that electric vehicles have the additional benefit of having an excellent energy storage capacity, which the other options do not have and which is so necessary for our energy independence."
"in writing. - (RO) Using electric vehicles offers a number of major benefits for sustainable mobility."
"We can mention among them: the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and improvement of air quality, the reduction in dependence on imported fossil fuels and electric cars' increased efficiency compared to the other transport technologies."
"On a global scale, the EU's competitors are investing in the research and development of new technologies for reducing carbon emissions and are launching programmes supporting the transition to green road transport."
"In order to enable Europe's car industry to retain its global competitiveness and to ensure it plays an important role in green technologies, the European Union must create a suitable framework for promoting innovative technologies, encouraging research and developing the infrastructure required to support the transition to an efficient economy based on low carbon resources and emissions."
"I support the European Commission's measures on this and I welcome the publication of the plan aimed at promoting the establishment of a European network of rapid charging stations for electric cars by 2011, as well as common technical and safety standards to apply to it."
"The transition to a sustainable, energy-efficient transport system has become a priority for the EU against the backdrop of climate change and fluctuating fuel prices."
"Developing electric vehicles across Europe to replace conventional vehicles is a viable solution, with increased market potential."
"To achieve this, Member States must coordinate their actions so that they can decide on a European standard, for example, for the systems used for charging and storing energy, including smart grids and on-board metering systems and interoperability."
"The EU must also give stronger backing to research and innovation, with the particular aim of improving battery and engine technology, as well as in terms of offering incentives for the manufacture of electric vehicles."
"I call on the European Commission to take specific measures to anticipate the changes in the car sector and supply chain and to support harmonisation of national policies in this area."
"It is time for the EU to boost competitiveness in the mobility industry by cutting development costs for manufacturers and gradually reducing the CO2 levels generated by road transport."
"in writing. - I welcome the Commission's recent strategy on clean and energy-efficient vehicles, and especially the new focus on electric cars instead of biofuels as part of the shift to greener transport."
"However, just as biofuels are controversial and not without problems, there are significant challenges with electric cars which must be overcome before they become a realistic option for European citizens, and before they deliver real environmental benefits."
"The additional demand for electric power for transport must be met by low-carbon sources if these cars are to realise their full environmental potential."
"I am concerned that the EU's development of these sources will not be sufficient to match the demand which will arise from increased use of electric transport."
"This needs to be considered as part of the EU's energy strategy as we move towards a low-carbon economy and reduced dependence on oil supplies from third countries."
"A network of standardised charging points must also be put in place, and I encourage the Commission and Member States to work towards this standardised infrastructure to make electric cars viable for consumers and car manufacturers alike."
"If these key challenges can be overcome, we can look forward to low-carbon, low-pollutant transport and all the associated benefits to the environment and human health."
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is one-minute speeches under Rule 150."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 5 May, is the Fight against Paedophilia and Child Pornography Day in Italy."
"It is a moment of important reflection, introduced by Act 41 of 2009, on what is, unfortunately, a widespread and increasingly serious phenomenon, because today paedophiles are not old men who trick children in parks but people who circulate within an internationally organised structure and who use the most modern forms of technology, such as the Internet."
"Therefore, today, young people, boys and girls, are not even safe within their own homes any more."
"That is why I hope that the European Union, too, will see fit to dedicate a day to this important subject, and it is also why I have submitted a written statement calling for the introduction of an early warning system to enable the police forces of the individual Member States to work in an organised manner and exchange a rapid flow of information."
"I hope that this initiative will be welcomed by the majority of this House."
"(ES)Mr President, last week Europe missed a great opportunity: the opportunity to be the world leader in astrophysical research for the next twenty years."
"The European Southern Observatory decided, on the basis of reports which were far from transparent, that the European Very Large Telescope would be located in Chile and not in the Canaries."
"This is a time to congratulate Chile, but also to reflect on whether in Europe everything possible was done to have a European installation, decided on by a European institution, with European funding involving an investment of more than EUR 1 billion, located in Europe rather than in the Americas."
"The European Parliament was unanimous in its support for locating it in La Palma and I am grateful for that, but what did the Council do?"
"What did the Spanish Presidency do?"
"Did it hold any meetings with the Observatory?"
"Did it hold any meetings with any of those Member States responsible for deciding on the location of the telescope?"
"Did it really support the European bid?"
"Europeans from La Palma, the Canaries and the rest of Europe are waiting for answers on this."
"At the moment they are left with the conviction that not everything was done that could have been done."
"(RO) We have proposed a resolution intended to ban the use of cyanide technologies in mining as it is our duty to take every safety measure to protect people and the environment from ecological disasters."
"If we are able to make historic commitments on cutting emissions and set the tone for the whole world in terms of environmental protection, why can we not make a basic gesture in support of a clean environment and abolish this harmful practice from the European Union?"
"The Baia Mare accident, which occurred in Romania 10 years ago, is regarded in the same way as Chernobyl, affecting three countries and destroying the ecosystems in the affected rivers over hundreds of kilometres."
"Now, again in Romania, they are intending to construct a new mining operation in Roşia Montană using cyanide technologies."
"This is why today, even more than ever, I wish to thank you for voting against the use of cyanide technologies in mining."
"The regions affected by this must be helped by the European Union to develop on a sustainable basis, utilising their full potential."
"(RO) The extremely difficult situation which Greece is in, not to mention the deeply concerning information about other European Union Member States with serious problems, highlights to us that the economic crisis has not run its course and that, in spite of some progress made by the European Union's older countries, there is still the risk of major imbalances."
"Unfortunately, in the situation where some countries are facing dwindling budget revenues, the immediate temptation is to raise taxes and duties."
"This is exactly what is in the process of happening in Romania too."
"The government is discussing at the moment increasing the flat income tax rate and VAT."
"It is wrong to believe that a sudden increase in taxes and duties will bring in more money for the budget."
"The impact of such measures is extremely damaging to the economy in the medium and long term."
"Regrettably, the European Union is finding it difficult to develop a common strategy against the economic crisis."
"However, I think that better communication and cooperation are required between the countries which have emerged from the crisis using proactive, incentive measures, rather than by raising taxes, and those facing major problems, which are in the process, out of desperation, of raising taxes and duties, thereby running the risk of sinking even deeper into crisis."
"(PT) Mr President, the attacks of financial speculators on the euro area's most vulnerable and dependent economies are getting worse."
"It is the same financial capital that has received trillions of euros from the Member States that is now speculating on the fragility of the public accounts created by these transfers and by the economic dependency of the peripheral economies."
"This dependency is caused by a monetary and exchange policy driven by the European Central Bank that is, with its sham independence, in the service of big capital and the major European powers, and is worsened by the liberalisation of the markets and by free competition in international trade."
"Against this backdrop, the Member States and the European Union have just made it quite clear what European solidarity means: sweeping the continued looting of financial capital under the carpet and, if necessary, transferring the costs of the theft onto the workers and ordinary people through measures of true social terrorism."
"However, workers and ordinary people will not be forced down the route that they are being told is inevitable, but is not."
"Their struggle is there to demonstrate this."
"We here salute the courage and determination of those in Greece, in Portugal and in several other countries."
"Mr President, it has now become clear on this tragic of days that draconian austerity measures will be imposed on Greece to preserve the euro."
"This cannot be right."
"It simply penalises the ordinary, hard-working Greek people for the profligacy of their politicians and the desire of those same politicians to prop up the doomed currency union."
"We in the UK remember our exit in September 1992 from the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the ERM, or, as the British politician Norman Tebbit called it, the 'eternal recession mechanism', membership of which had been disastrous for Britain."
"We escaped thanks to the Bundesbank's refusal to prop up sterling."
"Tough love does work."
"Whilst it remains in the eurozone, Greece has no way out."
"Free the Greeks from the shackles of the euro."
"Let the IMF do its work and watch how quickly Greece recovers, as we in Britain did on leaving the ERM."
"Do not make the Greek people pay the price for the unattainable ambition of an EU superstate!"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to talk today about the subject of air safety."
"This topic has occupied us a great deal in the last few weeks and it has affected us all."
"Human life is more important than any economic gain."
"This is precisely why I am in favour of a flight ban if there is an external risk, an ash cloud for example, to the safety of passengers, as it would be irresponsible to put lives at risk."
"I would remind you of the two near-disasters in 1982 and 1989 and the fighter jet in which glass fragments caused by the ash cloud were found."
"Test flights have been undertaken, but the evaluation is taking time."
"Experts have been consulted, but their responses do not point conclusively in any particular direction."
"The fact remains that lives are precious and should not be put at risk, and efficient and affordable alternatives to aviation ought to be implemented."
"(RO) I believe that in order to improve the operation of the food supply chain in Europe and achieve optimum transparency, a uniform legal framework is required at Community level with the task of defining the deadlines used in commercial relations between food product suppliers and retailers and more effective ways of protecting suppliers against anti-competitive agreements and practices, as well as the payment method and deadline."
"I also think it would be useful to tighten compliance with competition regulations and ensure that they are subject to a standard interpretation in all Member States."
"Taking into account the current state of commercial relations between suppliers and retailers, I think that the provisions of the competition regulations need to be assessed, which will establish a balance between the European Union's common agricultural policy and competition policies."
"Monitoring the market could include effective transparency with regard to setting prices and, in particular, profit margins in the food chain."
"(PL) Mr President, many times in this Chamber we have raised the matter of discrimination against the Polish minority in Lithuania, where the Poles who live there are not allowed to write their surnames using the original spelling, school classes which use Polish as the medium of instruction are being closed and land seized during the Soviet era is not being returned to its rightful owners just because they are Poles."
"Recently, the Chief Official Ethics Commission of Lithuania penalised Mr Tomaševski, leader of the Polish minority and a Member of the European Parliament, for putting a question - here, in this Chamber - to Mr Barroso about respect for the rights of minorities in Lithuania."
"These scandalous measures are intensifying."
"Several days ago, the Lithuanian Language Inspectorate imposed further high fines on the director of the Salcininkai local authority for using bilingual signs."
"Eighty per cent of the region's population are Poles."
"Mr President, it is high time the European Parliament put an end to these scandalous actions of the Lithuanian Government."
"We take pride in the fact that human rights are the foundation of the Union."
"It is a poor foundation if we are unable to enforce these rights in Member States."
"(EL) Mr President, millions of workers have gone on strike and are demonstrating today, with the Hellenic Workers Front, against the barbaric measures imposed by capital, the Greek Government, the European Union and the IMF."
"These measures are neither new nor temporary."
"They are a blatant application of capitalist development which leads to crisis."
"They aim to safeguard the profits of the Greek and European plutocracy and to pursue the application of the Treaty of Maastricht."
"They are included in the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy, which is why they lead to a dead end."
"However, we say that this is not a one-way street and that there is a solution."
"The solution is to re-constitute the workers' movement and to support development based on the needs of those that produce the wealth."
"The solution is to nationalise the monopolies and give power to the people."
"Neither provocateurs nor the blackmailers of the Greek Government can stop this movement, and nor can the murderous acts which were committed in Athens today and which have shocked us all."
"We believe that the Greek people will win their fight."
"Mr President, some hours ago I would have said that, in spite of the tasteless distortion of cultural emblems and despite articles of ambiguous objectivity referring to outdated stereotypes, although the Council failed to apprehend the Greek economic crisis as a major European issue and the Commission failed to use it as a crash test for European cohesion, the Greek people were ready to support their new Socialist government in their struggle for economic and social recovery."
"Now, in light of the tragic events of the last few hours in Athens, where three people died because of the violence which arose due to the hard economic measures, I recall Mr Rasmussen's recent words: the downgrading of Greece's sovereign credit to junk status is an indictment of the policy of prevarication."
"I think that it is most urgent for the Members of the European Parliament to strengthen their struggle for cohesion."
"I hope that what happened to Greece today just a few hours ago will not be contagious, and I hope that this may mark, on the contrary, the beginning of a unanimous effort for the formation of the European identity through solidarity and through partnership."
"(PT) Mr President, a few days ago it was the 120th anniversary of 1 May as International Workers Day."
"They have been 120 years of incessant, hard and heroic struggle by workers worldwide for their rights and for the emancipation of labour, for a society in which labour, finally free of exploitation, constitutes the full realisation of human beings' creative abilities."
"They have been 120 years of brilliant advances, of painful setbacks and of tenacious resistance by workers."
"The first of May and its universal watchwords were historically built on the most violent repression at the cost of innumerable struggles, sacrifices and lives lost."
"It was consolidated at every step taken by the people in winning freedom, and it has suffered and still suffers setbacks every time that the circumstances of history allow big capital to go on the offensive."
"That is currently being experienced in the European Union, and it is being seen in Greece, Portugal and so many other countries."
"Consideration must be given to these struggles and the worsening of exploitation must stop."
"It is time to respect the dignity of those who work and create wealth."
"Mr President, I wish to draw the House's attention to a matter of very serious urgency."
"A young Irishman and EU citizen, Michael Dwyer, was shot dead in Bolivia just over a year ago."
"Many observers believe he was murdered."
"As yet, Michael's family, who are present in the House with us here tonight, have no answers as to how and why he died."
"The only official information which has been given out is that he died as a result of being involved in a supposed plot to assassinate the President of Bolivia."
"This is very much out of character for someone who came from a loving, caring and apolitical family."
"However, the real issue here is that the information coming from the Bolivian authorities cannot be trusted."
"Their versions of events totally contradict each other, whether it is in forensic evidence, ballistic evidence or the very arguments that they put forward."
"So I urge this House and the EU's new High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton, to support the Irish Government's efforts to have an independent investigation established immediately."
"I do so with the support of Irish MEPs across parties, who will be writing to her in the near future."
"(BG) I must draw your attention to a problem in my country."
"Bulgaria is being governed by an incompetent, but populist government, which is using methods typical of the 1930s."
"Indicative of this is the fact that the most popular politicians at the moment are the Interior Minister, followed by the former Chief Secretary of this ministry, who is now prime minister."
"In the wake of the elections, hundreds of representatives of the opposition were sacked for political reasons."
"Pressure has been exerted on the main media."
"Politicians are being arrested in a brutal and blatant manner or ridiculous charges are being made."
"Prosecutors are publicly flouting the presumption of innocence, while ministers are exerting pressure on courts and pronouncing sentences from the TV."
"A new law permits sentence to be passed solely on the basis of information obtained by phone-tapping and evidence provided by an anonymous witness."
"Arrangements are being made to set up an extraordinary court, officially called a 'specialised court'."
"Fear is spreading."
"For years on end Bulgaria was required to make greater efforts in the fight against crime."
"At present, efforts are being made, but the fight against crime is spilling over into a battle against democracy."
"The European Parliament is sensitive to the violation of democracy, freedom and human rights around the world."
"It also needs to be just as sensitive when this is happening in Member States."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis, unemployment and the growing State budget deficit and debt constitute the greatest challenges to the nations of Europe today."
"I would, however, like to call attention to the corruption that is typical of Central European countries but in Hungary is of particularly serious scope, and which has further aggravated the crisis and thrown our country into even greater debt as a result of the additional loans it has taken out."
"The outgoing Hungarian socialist government placed the Hungarian economy in an untenable situation, since no public investment or state contract was free of corruption, whether for motorways, bridge renovations, parking, health care, domestic financing or EU tenders."
"Jobbik calls upon the newly elected Hungarian government to adopt and implement strict anti-corruption legislation and, in light of the crisis, we urge every EU Member State to do likewise."
"Jobbik believes that it is possible to rid political life of corruption."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President."
"On 8 May, Europe celebrates victory over Nazism."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, I have some unpleasant news."
"This year in Latvia, on 16 March, with the tacit approval of the authorities, Waffen SS veterans staged a march with flags in Riga in commemoration of the day on which the Latvian SS legion was founded."
"For 20 years now, we in the opposition have not been able to do anything about it."
"The leaders of European states pretend that nothing is going on."
"In Latvia, SS punishment battalions destroyed 130 villages and killed more than 150 000 people in Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia."
"Today, however, they are commemorated as heroes in Latvia."
"This timorous silence in European Union Member States is a crime against the millions of people who perished during the Second World War."
"This is extremely important."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, history has shown us that crises can generate progress."
"Under pressure, new ideas can emerge, creating innovative mechanisms in order to induce development and avoid the errors that led to the crisis."
"I would like to highlight two such ideas that could result in meaningful instruments."
"If we want the EU to remain a relevant global player, a European monetary fund and a European rating agency should be created."
"Despite the major institutional effort needed, it is still an exercise worth undertaking if we consider our long-term interest."
"We can all bet on the fact that the future will bring new crises."
"The European social market economy and the common currency are cornerstones of the world economy and the global financial system."
"The establishment of a 'European IMF' could enforce the Stability and Growth Pact, and the European rating agency would make its assessments based upon a true understanding of European economies."
"Both ideas should be debated seriously, and, in my opinion, the positive decision would be the wise one."
"(RO) We have witnessed recently the alarming rise of the extreme right and the adoption of more radical xenophobic and racist attitudes."
"The regional elections in Italy and France, as well as the general elections in Hungary have confirmed the growing success of extremist movements spreading a dangerous nationalist, anti-European and aggressive message, targeted either at national minorities or neighbouring states."
"This is not what we wanted for a united Europe, nor do I believe that this is the solution to its citizens' problems."
"I wish to express my alarm about the hostile messages being spread about Eastern Europeans, and Romanians in particular, in the foreign media, which has taken the form up until now of extremist rhetoric."
"French television insults Romanians in a general manner, while a candidate from the Spanish People's Party promoted his electoral campaign during the Barcelona municipal elections under the slogan 'We don't want Romanians'."
"I wish to take this opportunity to issue an appeal to all responsible political groups in the European Parliament to join forces and tackle this dangerous phenomenon in the European Union."
"(EL) First of all, I should like to express my condolences to the families of the victims of today's attacks in Athens."
"To come back to the subject of climate change, the 35 000 representatives of the world peoples who met in Cochabamba in Bolivia did not beat about the bush."
"They want us to agree at the Mexico conference to legally binding reductions in our emissions."
"They are right."
"We cannot put off this decision any longer."
"The European Union must immediately and officially commit to a 30% reduction in emissions by 2020."
"This will change the dynamic in the negotiations which, it is true, have become bogged down, with the risk that the decision on reducing emissions will be postponed until after Mexico, with no specific date and with no specific timetable."
"We can also do much more in Parliament."
"A 30% reduction in the European Parliament's footprint by 2020 has already been agreed."
"We need to set an example to the Member States by reducing our footprint by 50%."
"We all know that there are large margins for energy savings in our daily workplace and for reducing our environmental footprint and we can and we must do so."
"(DE) Mr President, the European Parliament has today granted discharge to the Commission for 2008, and that is a good thing."
"The irregularity rate for the EU funds paid out has never been as low as in this year."
"In the last three years it has been possible to halve the areas in which the irregularity rate was above 5% and therefore above the tolerance limit."
"The area of cohesion alone leaves a great deal to be desired."
"More effort needs to be made particularly in this area in the future."
"The area of agriculture and natural resources needs to be highlighted in particular."
"The irregularity rate in this area was below 2% and was therefore very clearly in the green zone."
"The monitoring and control systems are effective."
"In this context, however, I would also like to mention the pre-accession aid for Turkey referred to in the discharge report."
"An increase in the funds for Turkey is highly questionable in view of the lack of measureable criteria."
"It is unacceptable to give EU funds to third countries without any established indicators."
"Direct control of the payments and how the funds are used is essential."
"Only then can the aid actually have the desired effect."
"(HU) Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights defines the right to engage in trade union activities as a human right."
"In direct contravention of this legal provision, the Hungarian Military Court passed a severe sentence last week on Judit Szima, the leader of a union representing ten thousand police officers, for activity which, whether from a lay perspective or from the professional point of view of a lawyer, was exclusively a defence of employee rights and the pursuit of trade union activity."
"I emphasise that this happened not in some sort of developing world banana republic, but in one of the Member States of the European Union."
"In this House as well as in the various committees, we are constantly talking about the fact that with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union's commitment to human rights has increased and the defence of rights has become more effective."
"I ask that the case of Judit Szima be made a test case, a case study, and we should all follow attentively how, by the enforcement of the European human rights legislation, this brave woman might be vindicated and regain the dignity and livelihood she has lost."
"(PL) Mr President, a camouflaged form of human trafficking is flourishing in Poland."
"This is happening because of the absolute priority of the liberal, anti-humanitarian law of the market."
"In recent years, numerous flats and entire residential blocks belonging to state-owned companies have been sold together with their tenants as part of privatisation of the assets of the former People's Republic of Poland."
"The tenants are most often elderly people, often also ill, who were not given the opportunity of pre-emptive purchase."
"Under pressure from rocketing rents, they fall into debt and are often evicted."
"Fundamental human rights are being violated."
"What is needed are appropriate legal and executive instruments which allow the authorities of EU Member States to act effectively to ensure protection of the tenants of privatised flats which formerly belonged to state-owned companies."
"Urgent aid from public funds is also necessary to help the victims of anti-humanitarian privatisation."
"(BG) Thank you, Mr President."
"I am taking the floor so that I can expose an injustice."
"Fellow Members, let us not delude ourselves that ordinary Greeks are totally blameless for what has happened in Greece."
"The reason for what has happened there, and contributed to the financial crisis, is the 14th, 15th and 16th month salary, along with pensions and privileges which do not exist anywhere else in the European Union, and are just completely unknown."
"Greece has been lying to the European Central Bank for the last 10 years about the state of its economy."
"However, now, at this precise juncture, European leaders have voted to give Greece a EUR 110 billion reward for all these lies and this deception."
"At the same time, countries which have managed their finances in exemplary fashion, like Bulgaria and Estonia, will be punished for this crisis which has occurred, resulting more than likely in the postponement of their entry into the euro area."
"This is the application of double standards, which is not worthy of either the euro area or the European Union."
"It is fair that the guilty are punished and the leaders of the euro area must ask Greece to leave it."
"That concludes this item."
"Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Commission on the protection of consumer interests in competition rules for the motor vehicle sector in the internal market, by Malcolm Harbour, Andreas Schwab, Evelyne Gebhardt, Cristian Silviu Buşoi, Adam Bielan, Heide Rühle and Kyriacos Triantaphyllides, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (O-0044/201 - B7-0209/2010); and"
"the oral question to the Commission on the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, by Sharon Bowles, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - B7-0210/2010)."
"deputising for the author. - Mr President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has put forward this question because it has followed with interest the review procedure of the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, and some careful thinking has to be done."
"As you know, block exemption regulations are very important instruments to the business community."
"This Regulation was adopted in 2002."
"At that time the Commission considered that there was an oligopolistic situation in the European car market, the six largest manufacturers in Europe having together a market share of 75%."
"Against this background, the Commission considers that the motor vehicle sector should not be brought within the General Vertical Block Exemption Regulation, and therefore adopted a specific regulation."
"This Regulation will expire on 31 May 2010."
"The Commission now considers that the markets for new vehicles sales are highly competitive and that concentration levels have been declining."
"As a consequence of this assessment, the Commission proposes that a specific block exemption is no longer needed for the sale of new cars and commercial vehicles."
"It proposes to adopt a special block exemption regulation only for repair and maintenance services, as well as for the spare-parts distribution."
"Parliament is concerned about this reform."
"As you know, the EU is currently facing an exceptional financial and economic crisis, and unemployment rates are high."
"The European automotive industry is a key sector of the European economy, contributing to employment, innovation and the competitiveness of the whole economy."
"We believe that it is necessary to establish general conditions to make this sector sustainable and enable it to remain economically efficient and green."
"There is also a need to ensure that the small and medium-sized players in this market enjoy favourable conditions."
"We cannot forget the importance of SMEs as job providers and as suppliers of proximity."
"However, several motor vehicle dealers and repair businesses have expressed serious concerns about the new regulatory framework, arguing that it will lead to a further deterioration of the power balance between manufacturers and the rest of the automotive value chain."
"Therefore, Commissioner Almunia, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would like to ask you, firstly: which results of market analysis led the Commission to conclude that the primary market is currently competitive and the after-sales market is still problematic?"
"Secondly, how does the Commission evaluate the balance of power between car manufacturers and car dealers under the current Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, and under the proposed legislative framework?"
"Are there players with a simple or collective dominant position?"
"Thirdly, how does the Commission intend to monitor the evolution of market power in the primary and after-sales markets?"
"Which measure does the Commission envisage, should it appear that the competitive conditions, in particular in the primary market, have significantly worsened?"
"Fourthly, what is the expected impact of the new legislative framework on consumers, in particular as regards prices and conditions offered?"
"Fifthly, which comments received from stakeholders, namely during the consultation, does the Commission intend to incorporate in the final legislative framework?"
"Finally, does the Commission agree to consider proposing harmonising legislation in the area of distribution, for instance by amending the Commercial Agency Directive, in order to ensure that all dealers benefit from the same high level of contractual protection in every EU Member State?"
"author. - Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I am very pleased to be here this evening to present our aspect of the question, and I particularly want to thank our colleagues on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who of course have leadership on competition issues, for working closely with us, because clearly this is an element of competition policy which also has fundamental interests for consumers, and we have been ensuring from our side that some of those consumer elements are very well represented."
"First of all, I think that the elements of the Commission's proposal relating to the sales, service and repair market are very much aligned with the consumer interests which we have raised in our committee - not specifically on issues related to DG Competition, but for example particularly in the areas related to information on service and repair where we worked, in this instance, with the Environment Committee on the provisions concerning technical information linked to environmental standards for motor vehicles."
"I think that those elements, which have been reinforced in the new proposal, are extremely welcome as regards sustaining competition between independent repairers and market access for spare parts with equivalent quality markings: the opening up of that market is very welcome."
"I think the one reservation which we would draw to your attention, which is contained in the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow, concerns the issues about the availability of information."
"We are not convinced - you may wish to convince us, but we are not convinced - that the guidelines you published are necessarily sufficiently strong or enforceable to ensure that this technical information is available, particularly because it will be possible for car manufacturers to make that information available in an electronic format, which, without appropriate software and searching capability, may not be so valuable to the service repairer as we would expect it to be."
"Having said that, I now want to turn to the issue of sales, which we just heard eloquently addressed by the Vice-Chair of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee."
"I think on sales we are much less convinced that the Commission has really taken on board the concerns of consumers."
"The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee held a very important hearing where we heard from both dealers and consumer representatives about their very real concerns that the safeguards which have been put in place to ensure competition in the sales market, which were put there clearly in 2002 - many of them, I have to say, in response to concerns raised by this Parliament - have simply been swept away by what seems to us to be rather excessive zeal on your part to simplify issues and make life rather easier for you, as an administration, to deal with it."
"There may be problems with that, but I would suggest to you - and I would like you to look at the evidence which was placed before us in our hearing - that dealers and consumers do have serious concerns about bringing automotive distribution straight away into the general block exemption."
"There were clear safeguards built in back in 2002 - not that long ago in the cycle of car distribution - to redress the balance of power between independent dealers and manufacturers."
"I think the dealers would say that this has actually worked rather well over that time."
"Indeed, if you look at what has happened in the marketplace, they would feel that that was the case."
"Perhaps I might also remind you, Commissioner, because I think you were not around at the time, that there was a lot of lobbying by the car manufacturers that these provisions were excessive, but the dealers were in favour of them."
"What do we have now?"
"We have the dealers saying to us: these provisions are too weak and the manufacturers saying: we like them very much."
"I think you need to look at this."
"I am not saying that we should stop this process - I think it is the right thing to do now, given that we are now only a few days away from implementing these - but what we are saying to you in the resolution tomorrow is: please look at the up-to-date data, look at the information."
"I would also say that, within the Commission, Commissioner Barnier is about to produce a report about competition in the retail supply chain."
"The automotive sector should be part of that, and you need to look at that because we need some consistent policy from the Commission."
"Secondly, the papers which I have seen from your services say: do you think this is a preparation for the new generation of green cars, electric vehicles, and low-emission vehicles?"
"There is nothing in your analysis whatsoever that has picked up any of that."
"We now have Mr Tajani's paper."
"Can I ask you, within the next year, to look at Mr Tajani's paper, look at Mr Barnier's paper and assure us that this is the right thing to do?"
"I think that if you do that you will restore some credibility here, because I think that we remain unconvinced on that side about what you are planning to do."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the current Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation expires on 1 June this year, and we need to adopt a new regulation before that date."
"The College of Commissioners has placed this issue on the agenda of our meeting of 26 May."
"The proposal that is now being discussed within our services and, in a few days, with our cabinets - preparing the collegial discussions - is the result of an in-depth analysis of the sector."
"The public consultation process started in June 2006."
"Three and a half years later, in December last year, the Commission published the draft block exemption and guidelines."
"Throughout this process, stakeholders, the European Parliament and the Member States have all been closely involved, and a lot of arguments have been taken into consideration."
"A number of debates, workshops and initiatives have also taken place, including here in Parliament."
"The latest took place on 12 April this year at the ECON Committee."
"What are the main conclusions of this long consultation process?"
"First, we learned something positive: that consumers in Europe enjoy vigorous competition in the car sales market."
"In our annual car price reports we have been reporting on 80 car models from around 25 manufacturers - and prices are not the only factor which tells us that competition is healthy."
"There is also more choice than there was 10 years ago, with more brands available for each type of car."
"In these circumstances it would be difficult to suggest that any carmaker would be able to exercise a dominant position, be it individually or collectively."
"The current regimes contain sector-specific rules that made sense at that time (in 2002) when a wave of consolidation was expected in the vehicle sector."
"This consolidation period did not materialise, and instead what we have today is a very competitive market."
"By allowing more flexibility for the distribution of vehicles, the proposed changes will restore manufacturers' incentives to reduce the cost of selling cars."
"Allow me to recall that distribution costs make up, on average, 30% of the price of a new car."
"By reducing those costs, manufacturers will improve their competitive position, with resulting benefits for consumers."
"I am perfectly aware that there are some concerns about proposed changes relating to multi-brand sales and contractual protection for dealers, and both of you have mentioned these concerns."
"Let me stress that multi-branding exists - and will continue to exist - where market reality calls for it."
"This is the case in countries with very large dealers that have the capacity to distribute several brands - for example in the UK - and it is also the case in sparsely-populated areas, where it makes economic sense for the dealers to sell different brands from the same site."
"This was the reality before the current block exemption was adopted in 2002, and it remains the reality eight years later, but then, as now, single branding was the most common distribution model."
"What we have observed is that carmakers have increasingly resorted to other forms of distribution, including manufacturer-owned outlets."
"The evolution of distribution in Germany, for instance, is symptomatic of this trend, with 67% of cars sold through dealer networks, as opposed to 90% before the Regulation came into effect in 2002."
"Nonetheless, we have responded to concerns expressed during the consultations, including the consultations that took place here in the Parliament, and a number of safeguards have been introduced with regard to multi-brand dealerships."
"Let me also underline that we propose a transitional phase, during which the current regulation will be in force until the end of 2013 for the car distribution market, to allow sufficient time for dealers who invested in multi-branding to amortise their investments."
"Concerning the reason why we are proposing to do away with clauses granting contractual protection to dealers, it is simply because competition law is not the appropriate instrument to address eventual imbalances between contractual parties."
"These issues, as was discussed when we were preparing Regulation (EC) No 1/2003, belong to the sphere of commercial law."
"In a competitive market such as the car market, competition law should not interfere with the balance of powers between the different contracting parties."
"To do so would be intrusive."
"We have to be proportionate when we interfere in how markets work."
"In the process of consultation we also learned some other, maybe less positive things: unlike car prices, the cost of the average repair job has actually risen over the past years."
"Repair and maintenance is very important for consumers: not only for reasons of safety and reliability, but also because repair bills account for 40% of the total cost of owning a car."
"Unfortunately, the ability of independent garages to compete with authorised repairers is still impaired by a number of restrictions, including limited access to spare parts and to technical information."
"Therefore, our reform intends to allow independent garages better access to spare parts and technical information and to prevent them from being shut out of the market by other, newer practices."
"This will result in better-quality repair services and lower prices."
"To conclude, I strongly believe the new framework will be more favourable to consumers."
"Our main priority is to increase competition in the after-sales market - in repairs and servicing - where it is most lacking."
"Although vehicle manufacturers may be in a strong commercial position vis-à-vis dealers, they compete fiercely with each other, and today there is no need to deviate, to preserve competition on these kind of agreements, from the Block Exemption Regulation for Vertical Agreements, which was adopted recently by the Commission and will also come into force at the end of this month."
"Indeed, the Commission, and in particular my services, DG Competition, will monitor the sector very carefully, and there should be no doubt about the Commission's determination to enforce competition rules and take necessary steps if any serious breaches or shortcomings are identified."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now heard a great deal."
"With this oral question and resolution we wanted to give car dealers and the small and medium-sized enterprises a voice, because the Commission has not paid sufficient attention to this voice in recent years."
"During the hearing, concerns and anxieties were expressed above all on the part of car dealers on account of unequal treatment in relation to manufacturers."
"Legal uncertainty was brought up, as was a reduction in competition as a result of problems experienced by small car dealers."
"However, we have not received a response."
"I appeal to you - at one minute to 12 - to utilise the 21 days up to 26 May to incorporate the resolution to be adopted tomorrow by Parliament into your Regulation in order to meet car dealers half way without jeopardising the direction the Commission wishes to take."
"Please take Parliament and the concerns of the car dealers seriously and incorporate their concerns and those of the small and medium-sized enterprises into the Regulation."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (SV) Mr President, I should like to highlight four issues in this debate."
"Firstly, there is an unfortunate tendency to put small and large companies in the automobile industry up against each other."
"To a certain extent they have different interests, but what we primarily need to focus on is creating a system of regulations that enables them to work effectively together."
"Secondly, it is a very positive sign that competition on the new-car market has improved over the last year."
"This is a good example of the fact that no market is impossible and that, in the long term, it is possible to achieve a great deal by means of measures to strengthen competition."
"Hopefully, we shall in future see an equally positive development on the after-sales market."
"Thirdly, it is important for the Commission to very actively follow developments with regard to competition on the new-car market."
"This should be continually monitored."
"All interested parties should receive definitive information as early as possible regarding the rules that will apply from June 2013."
"Fourthly, we ought to intensify our discussions on how we are going to go about switching to green, more environmentally friendly cars."
"It is an absolutely essential process."
"On one hand, competition rules will need to be flexible in relation to the subsidies needed to enable electric cars and other environmentally friendly alternatives to get established on the market and, on the other hand, the rules must ensure that environmentally friendly cars are not placed at a disadvantage in the retail sector or on the after-sales market."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the purchase and maintenance of a car is considered to be one of the most important costs for households."
"The very aim of competition policy is to ensure consumers' freedom of choice and access to products at lower and more affordable prices."
"As a Member of this House, and consequently a representative of EU citizens who are also consumers in the car market, I am deeply concerned about the review of the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation and its impact on consumers."
"The Commission - and I listened very carefully and attentively to the arguments from the Commissioner - argues that this sector's specific regulation is no longer needed for the sales market, since there is evidence that the competition objectives have been achieved and a proper level of competition has been reached."
"In principle I would not be against the removal of the specific sector block exemption if there were no risk for consumers."
"We should use the three-year transitional period to assess the impact of the decision to exclude sales from the motor vehicle block exemption regulation."
"There is an undeniable phenomenon of predominance of large car manufacturers."
"I would like to hear the views of the Commission on the ways to ensure that they will not take advantage of their market share, and limit the choice that consumers should have on their market."
"I would also like to express my support for the proposal to maintain the specific block exemption for repair and maintenance, which proved to be less competitive than the sales market."
"My concern regarding the after-market is particularly related to those cases where consumers are unnecessarily tied to a specific operator for repairing their car."
"This can either be because independent repairers do not have proper access to the necessary technical information or because car manufacturers interpret warranty terms in an abusive way."
"This is an unacceptable limitation of the choice consumers ought to have, and I expect the Commission to bring solutions to change this type of situation."
"I therefore invite the Commission to bring some clarification concerning the measures it intends to take in order to avoid this situation, which is detrimental to consumers."
"Mr President, Mr Almunia, 80% of the components of every new car are manufactured by independent producers."
"On the other hand, the producers of the cars themselves have an enormous commercial advantage over the producers of components and independent service stations."
"We must do everything, today, so that the European motor market does not start to resemble an oligopoly again."
"Our citizens must be guaranteed the right to choose both car parts and independent service stations."
"Guarantees of access to technical information are needed."
"We must take action to counter the abuse of guarantees by producers."
"Authorised service stations, too, must have the right to buy parts from independent producers, as well as the tools and equipment used in their workshops."
"Without a clearly defined guarantee in the new regulation, the right of choice for European clients, which is fundamental for the market, will continue to be a fiction."
"(DE) Mr President, in the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, it is, of course, also important to protect small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Commissioner, competition is not an end in itself."
"If we look at the situation of small dealerships and small workshops, we need to increase their economic ability to act, otherwise one day we will only have large dealerships and large workshop chains."
"This includes, firstly, genuine authorisation for multi-branding."
"It includes allowing workshops and dealerships to have unrestricted access to information on vehicles and repair options."
"Thirdly, it includes providing the necessary opportunities for gaining qualifications."
"We talked earlier about electromobility."
"They also need to be in a position to maintain electric cars."
"Fourthly, they need investment security, in other words contractual protection and no more revisions."
"They need to be able to make safe investments over a long period."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, let us talk about the reality of car dealers."
"Car dealers, in my country as in others, are worried about the glaring discrepancy between their scope for action and that of manufacturers."
"Regulation (EC) No 1400/2002 reduced this discrepancy."
"Without it, the car distribution sector, which has already suffered as a result of the crisis, would face growing uncertainty as regards its investments and its commercial objectives."
"The demands made on dealers by manufacturers will become quite simply unbearable and unmanageable for a large number of modest garage owners."
"In any case, Commissioner, it is not competition that is at stake here."
"Competition would increase between car manufacturers and not between dealers or between dealers and manufacturers."
"Local garage owners cannot pose a threat to free competition in Europe."
"You talk about market domination, potential domination."
"Let us talk about it, then!"
"This domination does not exist in the case of competing manufacturers."
"It does not exist in respect of other producers."
"It exists between car manufacturers and distributors, and that is a reality that has been proven throughout the European Union."
"The Commission is adopting a scientific position based on large companies to deal with a huge number of minor players, who want only one thing: a bit of freedom and a bit of security in their dealings with car manufacturers, whose practices with regard to their dealers are becoming frankly appalling in some cases."
"It is David versus Goliath, except that, this time, the Commission seems to want to ensure that it is definitely Goliath who wins."
"The position and the reasoning behind the abolition of the exemption regulation are misguided. They are wrong; they are aimed at the wrong people."
"Reducing the scope for action, legal certainty and willingness to invest of garage owners will not further the internal market, and it certainly will not further consumers' interests."
"(RO) The automotive industry in the European Union, including both car manufacturers and car part manufacturers, must remain economically efficient and innovative."
"Given that road safety is influenced by the competitive conditions in the automotive sector's spare parts market, we urge the Commission to promote efficient competition on the spare parts market so that prices for any type of spare part are affordable."
"Customers should be able to purchase a vehicle at competitive prices and choose the supplier they want to carry out the repair and maintenance services, no matter which distribution system is chosen by the supplier."
"The forthcoming legislative framework should guarantee that SMEs in the automotive sector supply chain are able to enjoy favourable conditions and prevent any growing dependency on major manufacturers."
"In addition, the new provisions of the regulations concerning the general block exemption regime in the automotive sector should be extended and include the definition of end users in order to take into account leasing as well."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, it is very clear from previous speeches that Parliament is very worried specifically about the balance between car dealers and car manufacturers, which is also inevitably reflected in the services that consumers receive."
"This balance needs to be evident in particular in small markets and sparsely populated areas, such as Finland and elsewhere in Scandinavia."
"For us, permitting the sales and purchases of multibrand dealerships takes priority and is the main prerequisite for guaranteeing that consumers have adequate access to the services of the automobile sector."
"The population of Finland is five million, and around 100 000 cars will be sold this year."
"That probably sounds a ridiculously tiny number, and that is why it is extremely important that these changes do not in any way jeopardise multibranding."
"The previous regulation that guaranteed multibranding in the car trade was an excellent one, and so we are bound to ask why it is being amended at this stage."
"Another major impact will be that dealers' hopes of catering for consumers in sparsely populated areas will possibly be dashed and it will probably make it hard for consumers to acquire vehicles locally."
"It might also mean that smaller brands will not be represented at all in areas other than large population centres, and, consequently, consumers will have significantly less choice among makes of vehicle."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, you have now listened to us and you could almost think of it as the difference between theory and practice."
"I can only repeat the plea that I made to the President of the Commission back in spring 2009."
"We have unresolved issues for vehicle dealers, for the small and medium-sized enterprises, a financial and economic crisis and an uncertain growth and employment market."
"The best thing to do would be to extend the existing regulation rather than creating a new one that will just compound all of these problems."
"We have the problem of different national regulations if only single branding remains."
"We are opposed to a non-mandatory code of conduct and in favour of an efficient enforcement mechanism."
"We want the 30% limit for the purchase of replacement parts to be left as it is, because it allows authorised car dealers greater freedom of choice."
"The guidelines are not clear enough to ensure that there is access to technical information as there was before."
"There are important contractual clauses that you have simply left out, namely those concerning the notice provisions and notice periods, multi-branding, the transfer of businesses and the settlement of disputes."
"Please stand up for small and medium-sized enterprises, too."
"Multi-branding is part of competition and helps to protect consumers."
"We want more competition."
"Restricting the options of small and medium-sized enterprises and car dealers will reduce competition."
"Please give serious consideration to the market, the enterprises and Parliament's resolution and use the 21 days that remain available to you."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, all of the speakers in Parliament have actually now spoken out in favour of an SME-friendly regulation."
"We need a strong distribution system."
"Small distributors employ a lot of people."
"It is important for them that competition within the system remains, just as it is for the dealers - regardless of whether they are large or small."
"Competition must work."
"I believe that, in the car sector in particular, consumers also have a right to competition that works, so that they are not faced with very one-sided systems in which there is no longer freedom of choice."
"It is precisely this freedom of choice that will be important in the future, particularly for rural areas, and we need to ensure that rural areas are comprehensively provided for."
"I therefore believe that Mr Karas was absolutely right when he said that we have very little time left and we should therefore use it efficiently."
"Mr President, firstly I just want to say that everybody would agree at this stage that the car is no longer a luxury: it is a necessity."
"This was brought home very clearly to me two weeks ago when the volcanic ash struck."
"I had to go across Europe, across England, by car and train and ferry, and I never felt so independent and happy as when I sat in my own car."
"So anything you can do to help the consumer to have choice etc. is very important, but not at the expense of the small to medium-sized car dealer."
"Most of these are family-owned enterprises in local towns and local villages."
"They are doing a good deal for everybody, trying to satisfy the market and compete, obviously, in very difficult circumstances, so I agree totally with Mr Karas and other speakers that these people have to be taken into consideration to ensure their viability as we go forward."
"- (SK) Firstly, I would like to say that I understand the efforts to secure freedom of choice for consumers over the selection of the garage they would like to use."
"On the other hand, however, I can see the objective limits to absolute freedom in this area."
"Just as it would not occur to any of you to send a European Airbus to a Tupolev workshop for servicing, so the owner of a given make of vehicle is dependent on the technology and work procedures of the producer of the vehicle when it comes to servicing."
"If a vehicle producer provides the customer with a guarantee for the vehicle, he has the right to demand of the customer that servicing is performed in accordance with his specified instructions."
"If a consumer takes a vehicle for maintenance to a garage where the employees do not have the necessary expertise and skills, there is a risk that they will not do the job well, and even that the vehicle may be damaged."
"If we want to protect the consumer, therefore, we cannot expect that all garages will be equally capable of providing services for all makes of vehicle."
"As a consumer I would prefer to see well equipped garages with well-trained staff for a specific make of vehicle."
"Specialisation and a balanced relationship with the producer are also the best way forward for the customer."
"Mr President, I first want to thank you for your superb chairmanship of this sitting and also all the Members who have spoken in this debate."
"I would like to extend my very sincere thanks to all of you not only for your speeches here today, but for all your extraordinarily interesting and valuable contributions throughout what has, as I said in my speech, been a lengthy consultation process, in all directions, if I may say so."
"There has not just been consultation with Parliament, its Members and its committees responsible for car-related issues, competition amongst dealers and consumers, but also consultation with the Member States and consultation with all stakeholders and anyone else who has wished to express their opinion."
"The aim of any regulation or decision regarding competition is to benefit the consumer."
"That is the objective, our central concern and principal aim of our regulation."
"When consumers are preparing for the important decision of going to a dealer - because, as one of you said, it is a major expense for all consumers and households - they want to find out about prices and quality, to be able to make comparisons, and they can do that."
"They can probably do it more easily now than at any time in the past."
"They want to be able to make their choice without hindrance and without any obstacles arising from a lack of competition."
"We believe that, with the new regulation, this opportunity for choice will be extended; it will not be reduced, rather it will be extended."
"They can and must be able to choose - as many of you have said - after-sales services, the repair garage for their vehicle and the service garage for their vehicle; they want these garages, whether or not they belong or are linked to the vehicle manufacturer, to have the correct technical information and the spare parts and specifications they need."
"The current proposal by the Commission improves all of that."
"All that is improved."
"Please look at what it says in the text that you have seen, the draft and the guidelines that accompany it."
"In all these respects, the future regulation will give consumers more benefits than the current one."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises: what has happened there?"
"It is important to listen to people's opinions and we listen to them with a great deal of attention and interest."
"I mean everybody's opinions, including yours, of course."
"What has happened to small dealers in recent years?"
"Have they increased or declined in number?"
"Have they benefited and found it easier to enter the distribution circuit, the distribution market, or have they found themselves adversely affected or come up against obstacles?"
"It has been mostly the latter."
"That is the truth of it."
"That was not, of course, the intention of those who drew up and decided on the Regulation in 2002 but that is what experience has taught us in recent years."
"That is what we wish to rectify."
"What has been happening up until now or is still happening with certain garages and certain spare parts manufacturers?"
"They have problems which will disappear under the new regulation and the new guidelines."
"We are therefore proposing a regulation and guidelines which will increase the range of choice and opportunities for small enterprises throughout the whole chain, from the manufacture of spare parts to vehicle repair."
"The dealers, whom many of you have mentioned and whom I have listened to directly, and not just through the texts of written consultations or of meetings in which I have not taken part; I have spent time with them and I have spent time talking with them, in an extraordinarily constructive meeting."
"Not all dealers share the same interests."
"There are large dealers, who have a strong presence in the market in some of the Member States, and there are also many small dealers who are happier with what we are currently proposing than with what has been in place since 2002, because they have seen that certain aspects, not intended by the legislator in 2002, have not been in their interest, but rather have made it difficult for them to withstand competition from the major dealers."
"Finally, the deadlines for cancellation."
"We establish protection; we even create exceptions for each instance when we consider that competition is suffering under the current regulations, both the regulation on vehicles and the General Vertical Block Exemption Regulation, in spite of our intentions as legislators; and we can waive application of the Regulation if we see that it is not protecting competition."
"We can do so in the General Vertical Block Exemption Regulation and we shall be able to do so with the specific regulation on vehicles."
"I therefore share your concerns."
"The fact is that I believe that they are addressed better under the proposed regulation than they have been until now, not because we are any more intelligent than eight years ago, but simply because we all learn from experience."
"It is important to listen to people's views, but it is also important to learn from experience."
"To conclude the debate, I have received one motion for a resolutionpursuant to Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Buying a car is often the biggest expenditure households in the European Union have, after buying a house."
"The European Commission is proposing through the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation to remove the current exemption in the automotive sector and introduce general competition rules."
"I believe that, once certain clauses in the current regulation in the sector have been removed, specifically those concerning the freedom to make up to 70% of sales through intermediaries selling several brands of car, the risk arises of increasing the dependency of the manufacturer intermediaries, restricting competition and limiting the options available to consumers on the European car market."
"We are in a situation where a large number of intermediaries in the automotive sector, especially the small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector, which are more vulnerable, could disappear from the European market, thereby undermining the whole European automotive market."
"Consequently, I call on the Commission to assess the consequences of its proposals, by taking into consideration the structure of the European automotive sector in which small and medium-sized enterprises play a fundamental role, as well as to submit, if this becomes necessary, a new regulation at the end of the three-year extension to the current regulation."
"in writing. - (PL) In contributing to today's debate about the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation, I would like to recall that in 2009 the European Commission published its communication on the future competition law framework applicable to the motor vehicle sector, in which it specifies the legal strategy concerning the distribution of motor vehicles and after-sales services after the expiry of Regulation (EC) No 1400/2002."
"Therefore, the problem now arises of an appropriate reaction from competition protection agencies concerning access to technical information, spare parts and authorised service stations, and also concerning the abuse of guarantees."
"I ask, therefore, whether the Commission is sure the solution it has applied will ensure comprehensive protection of competition in the sector?"
"The Motor Vehicles Block Exemption Regulation is an extremely important document for the European Union, because it directly affects over 3.5 million people employed in the automotive sector in Europe in both the primary and secondary markets."
"This regulation brought in advantageous operating conditions which strengthened competition in the automotive market."
"It caused the creation of new jobs and enabled effective and stable development of the market, which lies in the interests of consumers, large automotive concerns and independent businesses."
"Also very significant is the fact that it ensures European consumers extensive access to services and goods in the automotive market."
"The document is of special significance to independent car service stations, which require access to technical information to be able to compete effectively with authorised service stations, as well as to independent producers of car parts."
"I was all the more pleased to hear that the European Commission has decided to prolong this regulation."
"In resolution B7 0245/2010, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to clarify the matters which I raised in a written question to the Commission of 16 April this year, such as access to technical information for independent producers, and to explain precisely the concepts 'parts of comparable quality', 'original parts' and 'technical information'."
"Those to whom the MVBER is addressed, in view of their not insignificant role in the economy, need clear and precisely worded legislation."
"Commission communication on Action against Cancer: European Partnership (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Peterle, on behalf of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission communication on 'Action against Cancer: European Partnership' -."
"rapporteur. - (SL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this report we are taking a stance on one of the most difficult problems of the European Union."
"The epidemic spread of cancer is making it the number one disease in the Union and one in three citizens of the Union will encounter it."
"I am pleased that, at the beginning of this term of office, it is not necessary to call on the Commission and the Council to take basic steps in order to combat cancer because we have the Council's clear conclusions of June 2008 and an ambitious project, the European Partnership for Action against Cancer, which the Commission presented in September 2009 and which forms the subject of this report."
"It is important to note that action is already underway."
"With this report we are supporting one of the most ambitious goals of the Commission, that we reduce the burden of cancer by 15% over a period of ten years."
"I am also pleased that the partnership was developed in accordance with our health strategy resolution 'Together for Health: A Strategic Approach for the EU 2008-2013'."
"In that resolution, we upheld the importance of health for all and of health in all policies and placed major emphasis on cancer prevention."
"It is an astonishing and worrying fact that, on average, Member States invest a mere 3% of their health budgets in cancer prevention."
"While it might appear to be a statistical error, this figure means that the health policies of Member States do not take prevention very seriously."
"What we really need is a paradigm shift towards more prevention in our strategic, technical, organisational and financial approaches."
"We know this and also we know, and it has been proven, that early detection of cancer can significantly reduce cancer mortality."
"The second key word in the report is inequality, and several types of inequality at that."
"The most significant type is known as 'the Iron Curtain between the East and the West' in terms of major differences between the survival prospects of cancer patients, but we are also aware of significant differences within Member States themselves."
"Besides the differences in the success rates of treatments, we also have significant differences in the frequency, or scope, of early cancer detection, differences in palliative care and differences in the effectiveness of rehabilitation of cancer patients."
"The Citizens of the European Union find it difficult to accept that there are such differences in the level of organisation of the fight against cancer given that some Member States have national programmes, while others do not."
"Differences exist in the acquisition of cancer data, too."
"Although even the Treaty of Lisbon only allows the European Union to take support measures, a coordinated and well-organised approach at this level is extremely important if we are to combat cancer effectively."
"The exchange of good practice would be unimaginable without encouragement from Community institutions."
"The third key word in the report is partnership."
"We will be able to get closer to the Commission's ambitious goal only if we join forces both vertically and horizontally."
"The prerequisite for that is ensuring that the fight against cancer remains firmly on the political agenda of European and national institutions."
"A close relationship between doctor and patient is not enough."
"It is our task to contribute to a strong political partnership, to a political will, which will provide impetus for a faster momentum throughout the European Union."
"On this occasion, I would like to place particular emphasis on the issue of rehabilitation of cancer patients."
"We ought to pay a great deal more attention to people who have beaten cancer."
"They must not be stigmatised or written-off, but given the opportunity to reintegrate fully into social life and to continue their professional careers."
"A key element in the fight against cancer in Europe today is proximity to the citizens."
"I would just like to thank the shadow rapporteurs who have helped in the drafting of this report for their considerable assistance."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased to see that Parliament continues to be enthusiastic and supportive of the Commission's work in the field of cancer prevention and control."
"I am grateful for the efforts that have been made in preparing this report, in particular by the rapporteur, Mr Peterle."
"Strong action at European level can have an important knock-on effect at national, regional and local level."
"This underlines the potential of the European Partnership for Action against Cancer."
"The success of the Partnership largely depends on the active participation of its numerous and diverse partners."
"So far, Member States, health professionals, cancer institutions, NGOs, patient organisations and industry representatives have taken part in the preparation of concrete proposals for action to be carried out by the end of 2013."
"It remains to be seen, however, whether this new means of cooperation will result in more sustainable action to tackle cancer."
"I sincerely hope that it will."
"The broad aim is to achieve more long-term goals and to make better use of available resources. This depends on the commitment of all partners and of course on adequate financial input."
"Parliament's support for the necessary resources to be secured in the future Community budget for health will be crucial."
"The report refers to a range of actions for a comprehensive approach towards cancer prevention and control, many of which have already been taken into account in the development of the Partnership, based on the Commission's communication."
"The Partnership has five main pillars: health promotion and prevention, including promotion of the European Code against Cancer; screening and early diagnosis aiming at improved implementation of the Council recommendation on cancer screening; exchange of best practices in cancer care; cooperation and coordination in cancer research; and making available comparative information and data on cancer."
"A key task of the Partnership will be to help Member States improve the development and implementation of their cancer plans."
"By the end of the Partnership, the objective is for all Member States to have integrated cancer plans."
"Some actions will build on the result of the good work done so far."
"Other actions will require additional help."
"The Commission stands ready to provide all the necessary support."
"In addition, the Commission will continue its close collaboration with the International Agency for Research on Cancer as regards its contribution to the Partnership."
"I should also mention the overarching objective of seeking to ensure better integration of health concerns into all our policy initiatives, which I shall take forward with relevant colleagues within the Commission."
"Of course we will continue our strong focus on prevention through our policies on health determinants as part of the fight against cancer."
"We will try to achieve the maximum possible with the limited resources available and I welcome vey much the strong support of the European Parliament for these efforts."
"Mr President, Mr Dalli, this draft report, which was presented just now by Mr Peterle, restates very firmly the guidelines from the European Commission communication and is also inspired by the European Parliament resolution of 10 April 2008 on combating cancer in our European Union."
"I would like to take this opportunity to endorse the aims of the European partnership envisaged by the European Commission in order to combat cancer more effectively, whether it be in terms of the importance of prevention and early detection, the creation of a new cancer prevention model or, above all, a reduction in the inequalities within the Member States."
"I share the concerns and anxieties expressed in the European Commission communication and in the draft report."
"I should like to commend the work done by the rapporteur, Mr Peterle, in drafting this report, and the compromise proposals tabled for the purposes of including the various amendments."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I wished, among other things, to highlight the following issues: firstly, the increase in annual cancer-related deaths caused by exposure to carcinogens in the workplace, but also the importance of better access to information on medication for cancer patients; the implementation of the REACH Regulation and the regular updating of the list of substances of very high concern, which covers carcinogens; the support for initiatives seeking to prevent imports of goods containing cancer-producing chemicals and to intensify checks to detect such chemicals within the European Union; and, lastly, the drafting of guidelines for a common definition of disability covering persons suffering from chronic diseases or from cancer."
"Those are the issues that we wished to raise, while at the same time lending our support to this draft report."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all let me give my congratulations to Mr Peterle for his great work on this report, making sure that the fight against cancer remains a top priority on our public health agenda."
"There is no need to repeat the figures; we all know what the public-health, social and economic costs for the Union will be if we do not address this issue consistently and make the appropriate resources available, especially in order to overcome the disparities between the Member States."
"The burden of cancer is a threat for the sustainability of our public health systems, and the EU should definitely take the lead in responding to it adequately."
"Whether we speak about prevention, diagnosis, treatment, research or information, of course we speak about partnership, but we will manage to combat effectively the burden of cancer in Europe only if we make sure that all stakeholders - and particularly patients' groups - are involved in the long run, if we ensure an efficient exchange of good practices between Member States and if we guarantee that the functioning of such a partnership will be closely monitored and supported."
"I hope that the Commission will play its role and make sure the partnership delivers its objectives."
"I would like to stress one particular point: the call on the Commission to use the existing ECDC and to add non-communicable diseases to its mandate."
"I believe this could definitely strengthen the expertise and recommendations."
"Finally, the issue of timely and equal access to prevention, diagnosis and care should be closely looked at if we want to ensure that the fight against cancer also contributes to the objective that we should all keep in mind the reduction of health inequalities in Europe."
"Commissioner, I look forward to seeing you tomorrow at Patients' Rights Day, because this is extremely important for all patients' groups, and your commitment matters to all of us."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner and rapporteur."
"Cancer is a horrific disease, a disease about which, at its worst, nothing can be done."
"Fortunately, however, we can do something."
"We are living longer and, unfortunately, the longer we live, the greater the risk that we will develop cancer."
"The older the population, the more cases of cancer can be expected."
"That is why all Member States have to do their utmost to pursue an effective and socially-focused health policy."
"Targeted, preventive action through preventive screening programmes and affordable anti-cancer drugs - that should be the focus of our attention."
"Another point about which we can do something is the large number of carcinogenic substances in the environment."
"We have toxins everywhere in our homes: just think of asbestos, kitchen utensils and even toxins in our food."
"The EU needs to protect its citizens from such toxins, whether or not that is to the detriment of industrial interests."
"The interests of citizens and the health of citizens is paramount!"
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Mr President, cancer is a widespread disease that, thanks to some intensive research, we are starting to know a great deal about."
"We now know that a person can be genetically disposed to developing cancer and that at least one enzyme is involved in triggering the disease."
"Stress, lifestyle, chemicals and viruses can also cause cancer."
"This year, almost two million European citizens are expected to die of this disease."
"Thus, cancer does not stop at national borders."
"I am therefore pleased that the Commission has taken the initiative to draw up an ambitious plan for action against cancer at European level."
"I have two questions. Where does the Commission stand with regard to research?"
"Can the financial resources that have been allocated ensure effective research and what level of priority is it being given?"
"The Commission points out that the screening volume is low in relation to the Council's recommendation. Therefore my second question is how will the ambitious target be converted into real patients in our countries?"
"Can we realistically double the effectiveness of our screening throughout Europe?"
"(RO) I wish to begin by expressing my thanks to Mr Peterle for the effort he has put into this report."
"According to the medical data, cancer is the second biggest cause of mortality in Europe, affecting men and women equally."
"The European Commission's involvement in the partnership created to promote action against cancer offers a new chance of life to those affected by this terrible disease and to their families."
"It is vital for us to continue to combine all our efforts to establish permanent cooperation in terms of both increasing specialist knowledge and devising solutions to the new challenges arising in such cases."
"The European partnership for action against cancer must therefore ensure the proper use of the resources, skills, not to mention funds which are available to all Member States."
"It must ensure that the results from the progress made in the battle against cancer in the European Union's various countries are made available to the whole of Europe."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, the fight against cancer must be a priority."
"Almost 30% of cancers can be avoided and their consequences alleviated through early detection and treatment."
"Some types of cancer affect women and men differently."
"Every year in the European Union there are more than 275 000 women with breast cancer and it has been shown to be increasing, even among younger women."
"Every year, 50 000 European women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 25 000 die from this disease."
"Nevertheless, cervical cancer can be practically eliminated by making vaccination and scanning programmes widely available."
"That is why it is urgent that all Member States extend their vaccination and scanning programmes to all women who are in the right age group to benefit from them."
"It is also necessary that they promote health-education campaigns, make the public aware of the importance of early diagnosis and inform people about the available programmes and services."
"I therefore welcome this initiative by the Commission."
"(RO) I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the fine job he has done."
"According to the Commission Communication to Parliament, the number of cancer screening tests carried out in the European Union is less than half the minimum annual number of investigations which could have been carried out."
"I think that we must ensure that cancer screening is accessible to as many people as possible so that achieving the target number becomes feasible."
"Research in this field has made progress in terms of reducing the costs for tests and of increasing the accuracy of cancer screening through the use of biomarkers."
"A recent invention, awarded a prize at the International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva, makes it possible to screen for certain types of cancer in less than six minutes at a cost of less than one euro."
"It is a sensor invented by Romanian researcher Raluca-Ioana van Stade, which can screen for types of cancer before the symptoms appear, providing the most accurate method available on the market, thereby facilitating a higher rate of treatment success."
"I hope that the Commission, through the Joint Research Centre, shows an interest in this invention and that it will be eligible to be recommended for introduction in diagnostic programmes."
"(RO) The partnership established by the European Commission last year is a vitally important instrument, given that cancer is the most common cause of death after circulatory disease."
"Unfortunately, there are large discrepancies between Member States in terms of quality of medical care and access to treatment."
"Some recent statistics highlighted that men living in the countries of south-eastern Europe are two times more likely to die of cancer than men in the Nordic countries, for instance."
"I think that intervention is needed at European level for the benefit of Europe's citizens in order to prevent great differences in terms of diagnostics and treatment in EU Member States."
"The European Commission must allocate funds for research in this area."
"Successes like the invention by the Romanian Raluca-Ioana van Stade, which is a sensor that can determine the presence of cancer in the human body at molecular level, directly from a person's blood, using a simple procedure lasting less than six minutes, must be supported and capitalised on to the full."
"- (CS) As many previous speakers have already said, an effective fight against cancer must include the full spectrum of measures, from prevention to screening, including diagnostics, special treatments and palliative care."
"I would like, however, to mention one other very important aspect of this disease: the families of patients who are losing the fight against cancer."
"The family should be a place of relief, support and encouragement for its members."
"However, it is enormously difficult to be faced with a progressive disease, and families must not be left alone in this predicament."
"Therefore, when we talk about the struggle against cancer, we must also think about the conditions for a dignified end."
"This should take the form both of systematic care and advice for families facing arduous long-term care in the home, as well as a system of accessible specialised facilities providing expert and above all humane care for patients in the final stages of this disease."
"Mr President, it is estimated that 3.2 million European citizens are diagnosed with cancer each year, and, as the European population ages, current trends would indicate that the number of citizens diagnosed each year is likely to double - unfortunately - over the next 20 years."
"We must, of course, address the plague of cancer."
"Cancer is caused by many factors."
"I want to outline what I believe: that smoking, being overweight, low fruit and vegetable intake, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption are contributory factors."
"It is essential that health promotion strategies at European level and, indeed, at national level are strengthened and properly resourced."
"Early detection is vital, and we have seen when we have early detection that it is so important that many people are still alive who would not have been if not for early detection."
"Through cancer research, the European Union can play a leading role: importantly, over EUR 750 million has been devoted to cancer research under the seventh Framework Programme, and I would hope that more funding could be made available over the coming years."
"In conclusion I want to pay tribute to all of those, particularly to those in my own country, who provide such exceptional care to cancer patients."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, health is a precious thing that it is important to preserve."
"Cancer is a global problem that continues to persist, despite medical advances."
"According to estimates by the World Health Organisation, in 2004 13% of all deaths were caused by cancer."
"In the EU, around 3.2 million people develop cancer each year."
"The main types of cancer are lung, bowel and breast cancer."
"Screening, particularly as we get older, also plays an important part in maintaining health."
"The principle that prevention is better than cure has proven to be true here."
"The most cost-effective strategy with the best prospects of success is screening."
"(GA) Mr President, without a doubt cancer is a terrible disease, and as they say in my own country, it is killing the country, as both young and old people are dying from the disease every day."
"The statistic which shows that one in every three people may get cancer would terrify anyone."
"At the same time, professors, nurses and doctors who deal with this disease have made great progress."
"In the future, however, it will be important to spend more money, particularly on research."
"The European Union has an important role in relation to this: first of all, in providing money for research, and secondly in organising this research, and in particular, in encouraging cooperation between institutes who are carrying out this research."
"If we do that, we will have made better progress in the future, and fewer people will contract cancer and will die as a result of it."
"(HU) Please forgive me for the unusually personal note, but while we have been discussing the programme against cancer and many people emphasised what a terrible illness this really is and how many people die of it, I could not help remembering that four years ago I too was suffering from this illness, and at this very time of year I think I managed to set some sort of record, according to the oncology department."
"From head to foot I had 14 tubes dangling out from me, and spent weeks in intensive care; however, I am now here, I am a Member of the European Parliament, I am raising my three children and I am able to live a full life."
"I would like to use my story to encourage women, in particular, as well as all European citizens to go for screenings."
"Based on my experience, I would like to send a message to all those who are suffering from the illness, to their friends and families and their physicians to never to give up hope."
"I wish them all the best, and my thoughts are with them."
"Member of the Commission - (MT) Mr President, I am very satisfied with the enthusiasm exhibited in Parliament today towards coming together in this concerted struggle against cancer."
"I would like to thank Mr Peterle for the report he has drawn up, and I would also like to thank Mrs Morvai, who has just delivered her speech, for having shared with us the aspect of hope, and the positive aspects; all is not lost when one contracts this disease."
"Many points have been raised; many of the thoughts you expressed in Parliament were given consideration in the Commission's communication, and I assure you that the suggestions you are putting forward today, and those you mentioned in the report, will be given very careful consideration in our programme of activities."
"With regard to the environmental aspect, I can state that the environment is a truly important factor - indeed a determining one - in the struggle against cancer."
"However, one must also state that the high standards we currently enjoy in Europe are of great help in lowering the incidence of this disease."
"Therefore, we should increase our efforts to ensure that these high environmental standards are maintained."
"We must also keep stressing the importance of research."
"Now that the pharmaceutical industry is part of my portfolio and of my responsibilities as Commissioner, there is a much greater opportunity for working with the industry and possibly coordinating research in a better way, thus ensuring its efficacy."
"One of the pillars which I would like to build my work upon in the coming five years is the widest possible accessibility to medicines available on the market; one of the biggest problems we have in Europe - it was mentioned here today as well - is the inequality in the health sector."
"This is something we must especially ensure: accessibility to medicines that come onto the market."
"I would like to thank you once again."
"By way of conclusion, may I reiterate that we must all work as hard as possible to convince people of the importance of prevention, for example, of the importance of screening for breast cancer which was repeatedly mentioned today."
"It is important that, since this facility exists in many, if not all, parts of Europe, we must strongly encourage all women to undergo this procedure."
"rapporteur. - (SL) I must say that I really enjoyed the debate this evening and I offer you my sincere thanks for your support and thoughtful words."
"I am pleased that we have been speaking the same language to such a great extent and that we share the same objectives."
"We share an awareness of the wider context and of the causes of this disease, just as we share an awareness of the need for a united fight against cancer in partnership with each other."
"Due to the time constraint, I had no time earlier on to say a few words about a healthy lifestyle."
"I firmly believe that we politicians could play a major role here in leading by example and we need to promote a healthy lifestyle."
"As I myself have been diagnosed with a condition similar to that of Mrs Morvai, I would like to congratulate her even more warmly on her victory."
"I believe that in this way we are showing that cancer does not necessarily have to be synonymous with a death sentence."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Dalli, in particular, for his attention and for announcing more rapid action, because cancer has its own dynamic and so we, too, need to act dynamically."
"I offer my services to the Commissioner for close cooperation in the future, too."
"I think that our cooperation so far has been exemplary and that together we can achieve a lot more."
"I would also like to say that we will shortly be re-establishing the members' group for the fight against cancer which was known under the acronym MAC (Members Against Cancer) during the previous term."
"I think that this time, perhaps with an even stronger group, we will be placing particular emphasis on prevention and on the dynamism of our fight. Thank you and I wish you all a good night."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I cannot but welcome the Commission proposal for a partnership on the fight against cancer, which is a serious public health concern in the EU."
"I fully support the approach of the rapporteur who places a special emphasis on the preventive action."
"In this perspective I strongly believe that comprehensive national cancer plans are more than welcome."
"I would also favour the cooperation on this topic in the field of research."
"We need to clearly identify the main causes generating this disease so that we can also identify the main elements on which we need to focus within our prevention efforts."
"This is absolutely necessary for an effective preventive action."
"I also believe that it would be reasonable to build our future action upon existing initiatives such as the European Code against Cancer or the Council Recommendations on screening for breast, cervical and colon cancer, which are already a good basis for action."
"Of course, prevention can't be done without a proper level of financial resources."
"I therefore call on the Member states to allocate the necessary funds to the prevention plans so that the 15% target for the reduction of the number of new cases remains realistic."
"in writing. - I warmly welcome this initiative and the possibilities it affords to the many millions of Europeans predicted to be affected by cancer in the years to come."
"One of the most significant targets contained in the report is to dramatically reduce the burden of cancer by achieving 100% coverage in terms of screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer by 2015, by providing 125 million examinations to EU citizens per year."
"The onus must also pass to us as MEPs to use our access to the media and to our constituents to implore Europeans to avail themselves of these crucial checks."
"There continues to be an alarming lack of knowledge both of the risks of cancer and of the opportunity for cancer screenings, and only through continuous education of these facts will this initiative enjoy the success that it and European citizens badly need."
"The effort is global. However, despite the continued improvement in knowledge and the progress in terms of treatment, the fight against cancer is still, today, an ongoing challenge."
"It is a challenge to which we must continue to rise by putting our best resources forward, because the effects of this disease are devastating in terms of mortality but so too are the psychological, social and economic aspects associated with it."
"It is clear that the approach must be global not only in terms of research and treatment, but also in terms of prevention."
"We need to achieve a critical mass, creating the conditions to ensure that the result of one person becomes the legacy of us all."
"That is why it is important to create a European partnership for action against cancer that will facilitate the exchange of information and coordination among the individual Member States."
"The work carried out within networks should concern not only research and health, but also education, diet, communication and the environment."
"It should seek the participation and contribution of civil society, including in an effort to introduce people to healthy habits and healthy lifestyles."
"The Commission's ambitious target of reducing the burden of neoplastic diseases by 15% between now and 2020 can be considered realistic only if this methodology is applied and bolstered by adequate funding."
"in writing. - (FI) The report on the Commission's communication entitled 'Action Against Cancer: European Partnership' is very important and relevant to the times."
"At present cancer is the second biggest cause of death and illness in Europe."
"More cooperation and resources for the study of cancer and preventive treatment are very important."
"Member States need to take carcinogenic chemicals off the market and replace them with harmless ones."
"Preventive screening is necessary and effective, and adequate sums of money must be set aside for this."
"Information campaigns should also be focused on educational institutions."
"The fight against cancer needs clear goals, which the Commission and the Member States need to work towards together."
"The Commission and the Member States need to have the courage to commit to investment in the future, research into cancer and its prevention, because both money and human life will be saved in the long term."
"in writing. - (ET) Cancer is a very costly disease for society, a disease which is becoming considerably more expensive to diagnose and treat, and which often causes long-term disability, invalidity and premature death."
"Despite the many achievements of medicine, the spread of cancer in the world today is nevertheless very much on an epidemic scale."
"Every third European will be diagnosed with cancer in his or her lifetime, and every fourth European will die as a result of this disease."
"The Member States, and in particular their national strategy for preventing cancer, have an important role in stopping the spread of the disease."
"Since, in the fight against cancer, it will only be possible to achieve the results laid out in the strategy through long-term and consistent action, I call on all Member States in the present economic crisis not to cut financial resources for the fight against cancer and for the needs of both primary and secondary prevention."
"Parsimony today may lead to all kinds of expenses tomorrow."
"Preventative methods play a large role in the fight against cancer, as a third of cancer cases can be avoided with the help of preventative action."
"Another important matter concerning preventative action, in my opinion, is the raising of awareness in the area of gender-specific forms of cancer; we need to raise standards of prevention as well as to advance screening studies of these diseases."
"To finish my speech, I would like to welcome the Commission's proposals to relaunch the European partnership initiative for adopting anti-cancer measures in the period 2009-2013, in order to support the anti-cancer action taken by the Member States."
"Only through collective effort can we achieve success in fighting an enemy like cancer."
"Mobilising Information and Communication Technologies to facilitate the transition to an energy-efficient, low-carbon economy (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Toia, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on mobilising information and communication technologies to facilitate the transition to an energy-efficient, low-carbon economy -."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report which we are debating this evening and on which we shall vote tomorrow is part of a major effort to implement the 20/20/20 package, which I believe is still one of the most far-sighted and significant things to have come out of the last European parliamentary term."
"If asked what I would save from the last five years, I would definitely place the 20/20/20 package at the top of the list."
"I believe that it is important to add that some very intense work went into this report, on the part of both the European Commission - a communication and a recommendation preceded this report - and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and others."
"They enriched the initial report and our work with many suggestions, additions and amendments."
"I believe that there is still a slight difference of opinion within Parliament over one point, and I hope that it can be overcome with tomorrow's vote."
"It concerns the more or less binding nature that we wish to attribute to the contents of this report, which I would like to make a point of saying was drafted in a context of great understanding and great unanimity."
"Information and communication technologies (ICTs) represent an important sector, not least, in fact, because of the weight they carry in the European economy: they account for 7% of the labour force - of the European labour force - and 6% of GDP, thus a significant share of the European economy and of the European productive and labour force too."
"They are also very important not only, precisely, for what they represent, but also for the contribution they can make and for the essential, significant role that they can play in terms of trying to achieve this transition from our economy to a situation in which the economy, though still developed, produces fewer emissions and has a lower carbon content and will thus pollute less for our future and for that of the generations to come."
"In short, they can represent - not in words, but in concrete actions - changes that can lead to a way of producing, living, travelling and consuming in our society, and to that industrial revolution that, for many, will actually characterise the future of social and economic life, not only on our continent but throughout the entire world."
"How can ICTs make this major contribution to transforming our economy?"
"Firstly, by changing the sector itself: the report is intended to demonstrate how this sector can, first and foremost, look within itself to see how it can produce communication, microelectronic and other instruments that consume less energy, and are thus inherently more efficient."
"Next, they can make an enormous contribution in the major sectors, in the housing and transport sectors."
"The latter two - I am quoting data from the Commission - are sectors in which greater efficiency, according to the European rules and the targets also laid down by the 20/20/20 package, can lead to a very substantial reduction in these emissions - since, today, the transport sector consumes 26% of the energy in Europe, and 40% is consumed in homes for heating and cooling, depending on the season - and can achieve very high levels of efficiency."
"This is without mentioning that the scope, in the case of the major sectors, affects our lives in very significant areas."
"I am thinking of the entire banking sector, of the relationships within public administration, of the entire e-government sector and of all the services, in short, which, with the application of these technologies, will be able not only to reduce their carbon emissions but also to save time, with a consequent improvement in the quality of life of Europeans and in the quality of social life."
"This is, therefore, highly significant."
"However, I believe that this report will be all the more significant if Parliament approves its binding character tomorrow."
"I would like to offer just two examples, Mr President, if I may: smart meters and the smart grid, and smart cities."
"Only yesterday, 700 European mayors concluded a new agreement in this House, before our President and the European Commissioner, aimed precisely at improving the efficiency of cities, which are home to more than 70% of European citizens and which can thus make a major contribution to increasing efficiency and economic and social development."
"(RO) I wish to welcome the conclusions of the European Council meeting held on 25 and 26 March 2010, which clearly stipulate for the first time as a European Union objective a 20% increase in energy efficiency."
"Energy efficiency can be improved in the buildings sector by using information and communications technologies and efficient metering systems, and in the transport sector by implementing intelligent transport systems at a European level."
"In fact, ICT-based systems can cut energy consumption in buildings by up to 17% and emissions from the transport sector by up to 27%."
"I believe that in order to achieve a 20% cut in energy consumption by 2020, electricity networks should become smart, offering a flexible power flow, while being controlled by and based on the use of ICT."
"The EU must make boosting the European economy a priority through investments in the development of online services, new technologies and, in particular, through the development of broadband communications in all Member States."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes your interest, support and valuable recommendations on mobilising ICT to facilitate the transition to an energy-efficient, low-carbon economy, and has read the Toia report with care."
"It is important to recognise the significant role the ICT sector can play as an enabler to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and we need to make sure that this potential is embraced and made a reality."
"The Commission intends to make a priority of this issue under the European Digital Agenda which will be adopted soon by the European Commission."
"As you mention in the report, ICT can help to significantly improve energy efficiency in other areas, such as buildings and transport in particular."
"We also concur with you that smart grids and the roll-out of smart meters by Member States are key to realising this potential."
"The roll-out needs to be driven forward within Member States, so as to deliver more active consumers who can exploit renewable generation and energy-efficient technology."
"A common measurement framework for the ICT industry's own emissions is also essential."
"A rigorous measurement framework, widely agreed and adopted by the industry, is a must to quantify the real benefits of information and communication technologies."
"This must be taken into account in considering the beneficial impact of ICT used."
"Since the adoption of the recommendation on this topic in October 2009, the Commission has undertaken a number of actions with stakeholders to drive the agenda forward."
"Let me mention a few that address concerns raised in your report."
"In February 2010 the ICT for Energy Efficiency Forum was launched."
"The Forum brings together leading EU, Japanese and US high-tech industry associations."
"They will set targets on the basis of a common measurement framework for the ICT sector's own energy and carbon footprints, to be developed by the end of 2010."
"The Forum is also looking at the contribution the ICT sector can make to improve the efficiency of other sectors, such as building and transport."
"Major European cities have signed up to the Green Digital Charter."
"These cities commit to reducing their own ICT carbon footprints by 30% by 2020, and to deploying five large-scale ICT pilots per city by 2015."
"The total number of cities committed to the Green Digital Charter has increased from 14 to 21."
"Energy retail market issues are becoming increasingly important, as markets move closer to consumers, to the introduction of new technology and systems in the form of smart meters and smart grids."
"Work with the Commission's Smart Grids Task Force is also advancing."
"The aim is to advise the Commission on policy, a regulatory framework, as well as to coordinate the first steps towards the implementation of smart grids under the provisions of the Third Energy Package."
"A set of recommendations is expected by the end of 2011."
"To conclude, let me emphasise that the Commission is very committed to contributing to achieve the 20-20-20 targets by 2020 as set by the Heads of State and Government, and ICT has an important role to play in this."
"We thank you for the valuable input provided by your report and look forward to cooperating with you to ensure that we adopt a good policy to achieve these targets."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Protection of the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual Report 2008 (debate)"
"The last item is the report by Mr Cozzolino, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud - Annual report 2008."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is giving Europe a more incisive role in the lives of millions of Europeans, the challenge of transparency and legality is crucial."
"Hence the report that we are presenting is the result of a highly coordinated effort."
"The work was confined, first and foremost, to the scenario outlined by the Court of Auditors, whereby the financial impact of irregularities fell from more than EUR 1 billion in 2007 to EUR 783 million in 2008."
"The fall concerns all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds."
"Areas of major concern still exist in relation to the Structural Funds too."
"However, absolute amounts and values alone do not tell us where the urgent problems are hidden and where the situation is under control."
"Our analyses and meetings over recent months have led us to prioritise two requirements."
"Firstly, the urgent need to make the Member States more responsible for identifying fraud and irregularities, and for sharing the information needed to combat fraud, waste and distortions in expenditure and in the collection of taxes."
"Secondly, the importance of presenting proposals and working hypotheses in order to make it easier to implement measures in the Member States, with administrative procedures and management strategies that give priority to the quality of the projects and to their impact on the living and working conditions of European citizens."
"In order to achieve these objectives, we propose that Parliament insist on certain priorities: firstly, we propose that OLAF draw up 27 profiles, analysing with due care and attention the strategies followed by each individual Member State in combating fraud and irregularities in the use of European resources, with a precise map of the authorities responsible for performing checks in each individual country and data on the quantity and quality of the checks performed and on their effects."
"Secondly, reducing the number of irregularities and significantly improving the regulations."
"We are embarking on a legislative and regulatory simplification programme, intended in particular for the Structural Funds."
"Moreover, the fight against corruption, financial crime and breaches of public procurement rules must be stepped up."
"In this year's report we have made progress on this point with the support of the entire committee."
"Thanks to an intense, concerted effort, proposals have been drafted on the main problems in this area."
"From the relationship between the EU and tax havens, to the databases on beneficiaries of European funds, the report makes a practical contribution to increasing the transparency of expenditure and to strengthening the anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategies."
"Lastly, with regard to OLAF, it is crucially important to guarantee its full operational independence, the full cooperation of the Member States and an appropriate human resources strategy, which it most definitely needs."
"We must keep the debate alive and kicking in Europe so as to establish the role of a single European Prosecutor."
"To conclude, I believe it is vitally important to fight together for the transparent and efficient management of European resources."
"In this regard we must ensure that the problems that do exist are not exploited in any way in order to call into question instruments of fundamental importance to the European project, such as cohesion policy and development aid."
"Rather, we must look clearly at the problems, at the distortions that still exist in the various European spending areas and use these data to take new, determined steps forward, thereby making the management of our finances more efficient and transparent."
"I believe that, by making this effort, the various European institutions really will make progress in the construction of a Europe that is stronger, more integrated and able to better satisfy the needs of Europeans."
"- (RO) I think that European funds must be made accessible to citizens in a fair, transparent manner."
"One feasible method for possibly eradicating corruption in public procurement is to introduce a transparent system in the form of an online tender system."
"According to the Commission's report, the declining financial impact of irregularities in 2008 indicates that some of the legislative and institutional measures aimed at discouraging fraud were implemented successfully by Member States."
"Greater financial control is still required, along with effective legislation for combating tax fraud, especially relating to VAT."
"The protection of the European Union's financial interests is a priority for the Romanian Government as well."
"As part of this, the Fight Against Fraud Department was set up. It provides the single point of contact in Romania with OLAF for European funds."
"Mr President, as EPP shadow rapporteur I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to the rapporteur and to the other colleagues from the political groups for their excellent cooperation."
"We paid particular attention to increasing transparency and better rules for public procurement, as this is the area most vulnerable to fraud and corruption which distort the market and increase the prices paid by consumers."
"Moreover, beneficiaries of EU funds from all Member States should be published on one website and based on the same criteria."
"I also called for the mutual recognition of disqualifications, such as the exclusion of fraudulent offenders from acting as chief executives."
"OLAF's activities should be supported; we ask for statistics and reasons in cases where national authorities did not file indictments following reports by OLAF, which happens in 73% of the cases initiated by OLAF."
"The report also proposes to ban companies which operate through offshore havens from concluding business agreements with companies residing in the Union if their offshore location has unilaterally delayed the adoption of cooperation agreements with the Union."
"Let me conclude by saying that the Union must treat fraud and corruption as interlinked and as a matter of priority."
"Mr President, I think it is not an exaggeration to say that the current economic crisis was brought about by a moderate crisis initially, a moderate crisis that saw greed triumph over generosity, corruption triumph over integrity and self-interest triumph over solidarity; and until we get back to generosity, integrity and solidarity being at the heart of corporate and government affairs we will never get out of the trouble we are in at the minute."
"I agree totally with every effort made to fight fraud."
"I have seen programmes in Ireland showing people who were claiming social welfare in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and England every week, people flying in to Cork airport and out again having claimed social welfare."
"The worst of all was the banks - Allied Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide - playing ping-pong with accounting practices to hide their true situation."
"This has landed us in terrible trouble in Ireland, and every effort must go to ensure that fraud is stopped."
"The message has to go out loud and clear that it is going to be pursued and dealt with very strongly at European level and at every level."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Šemeta, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for his constructive report and the proposals put forward for improving the protection of the Union's financial interests."
"The Commission appreciates that Parliament strongly underlines the joint responsibility of the EU institutions and the Member States in this respect."
"Let me just make a couple of remarks."
"Regarding the reporting of irregularities by the Member States, OLAF has established a new web-based reporting system called IMS: Irregularities Management System."
"This has brought about considerable improvements in the reporting of irregularities by Member States, including those which you criticise in your report."
"The Structural Funds is an area of particular concern both for the Parliament and the Commission."
"The Commission has taken strong actions to remedy weaknesses in the most affected areas and programmes in the framework of the action plan for structural actions in 2008, including a vast simplification exercise."
"With his fellow commissioners, my colleague Commissioner Šemeta, will pursue efforts aiming at reducing further the error rate in cohesion policy."
"The Commission will assist and monitor the Member States for the closure of the 2000-2006 programmes and will make sure that the management and control systems under the new programming period will deliver their benefit."
"Moreover, the Commission will liaise with the Member States' authorities to ensure that they fully assume their responsibility in shared management as reinforced by the new provisions in the Lisbon Treaty."
"Considerable progress has been achieved concerning transparency about the beneficiaries of EU funds."
"In the area of agriculture the Council has agreed that publication of the beneficiaries of funds is the responsibility of the Member States."
"The information has to be made available on a single website in each Member State, in line with the principle of shared management."
"To provide an overview and facilitate access to the Member States' websites, the links to these websites are linked on the Europa web page."
"I come now to OLAF. I thank the rapporteur for the strong support he explicitly states for the work of OLAF."
"My colleague Commissioner Šemeta fully agrees that the office should concentrate on its core tasks of conducting investigations, although OLAF also has other important duties to fulfil, in particular in the area of fraud prevention."
"He also agrees that the focus for OLAF should be on the more important cases and that small-scale fraud should be handled by other bodies."
"In 2008 OLAF revised the financial follow-up procedures relating to OLAF cases by establishing de minimis thresholds."
"Commissioner Šemeta has taken good note of your comments on the need for OLAF to work together with the internal audit services, which he fully shares."
"OLAF and IAS have been cooperating closely since 2003."
"They exchange information and provide each other with specific training to improve their respective staff knowledge on issues of mutual interest."
"OLAF is willing to cooperate still more closely with the IAS."
"Regarding procedural rights, the new OLAF manual adopted in December 2009, which has been transmitted to Parliament, already provides comprehensive guidance for OLAF investigators."
"More detailed rules on procedural rights will be included in the legislative proposal for revision of the OLAF regulation."
"In this respect the Commission would also recall that the reflection paper on the legislative reform of OLAF will be submitted to Parliament and the Council before the summer break."
"Commissioner Šemeta looks forward to presenting this paper to the Committee on Budgetary Control at its meeting in July."
"Finally, he looks forward very much to working with Parliament as an ally in the task of improving the efficiency of OLAF and the protection of EU taxpayers' money."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The fight against fraud is a crucial challenge that the European Union and the Member States must take up."
"The importance of the public funds pledged under the heading of cohesion policy demands the utmost vigilance given the potential for misappropriation of those funds."
"The credibility of the Structural Funds among Europeans is at stake."
"In this connection, I welcome the efforts made by the European Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to combat fraud more effectively."
"As the rapporteur points out, the financial impact of irregularities on structural actions has decreased significantly."
"Furthermore, the increase in the number of irregularities reported to the Commission testifies to the progress of the fraud prevention systems."
"It is important for the Commission and the Member States to continue this fight as rigorously as possible."
"However, it is also essential not to discourage potential beneficiaries of the Structural Funds with overly harsh restrictions."
"Intentional fraud is one thing; a lack of precision when organising projects is quite another."
"While the former must be considered as a criminal activity, it is important to simplify the procedures in order to limit the impact of the latter."
"in writing. - (HU) The crisis unfolding in some countries of the euro area presents an unprecedented warning to European decision makers to unconditionally protect public funds and the Community's finances."
"The economy and the international markets react with exceptional sensitivity to any measure taken by the European Union, such as, for instance, the rescue packages adopted in recent days."
"Entire national economies could be threatened if crisis management is not handled appropriately and on a European level."
"Therefore I would not be exaggerating when I say that the eyes of the whole world are on our finance ministers and on the European institutions."
"To this day, the governments of certain Member States, by pursuing their personal interests and functioning like oligarchies, have brought their own economies to the brink of bankruptcy and made any future prospects unattainable for entrepreneurs, families and qualified young people."
"Because of this we can only welcome the rapporteur's intention to increase the accountability of Member States."
"Today this is one of the key issues for successful crisis management."
"Rigorous monitoring, in order to end the era of corrupt governments, is more important than ever in this critical period."
"in writing. - (DE) The report on the fight against fraud indicates a fundamentally positive development."
"From 2007 to 2008 there was a reduction in the negative financial effects of irregularities in all sectors."
"However, this was not the case with regard to pre-accession aid."
"Here the negative effects have increased by 90.6%."
"In this regard, I would point out that since 2002 the EU has been providing financial support for Turkey's 'efforts' towards EU accession, with successively higher amounts being paid out each year."
"For the period 2007 to 2013, Turkey will receive the sum of EUR 4.84 billion."
"This is the case even though the Commission is aware that Turkey is making nowhere near the required amount of progress in respect of the accession criteria."
"The money is continuing to flow nevertheless and in ever higher amounts."
"The most recent special report by the European Court of Auditors states, in addition, that with regard to the accession aid for Turkey in particular the money is being invested without sufficiently explicit objectives and benchmarks."
"Without a clear strategy, money is being used with no specific plan and in an unconstructive way."
"We must put an end to this madness."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Kyrgyzstan (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"European Investment Bank (EIB) - Annual Report 2008 (debate)"
"The first item is the report by Mr Deutsch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the European Investment Bank's annual report for 2008 (2009/2166 (INI))."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Maystadt, European Investment Bank - Annual Report 2008."
"This is the title of our current agenda item."
"This report, however, is about much more than the analysis of the European Investment Bank's activities of two years ago."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we hear it day after day and I believe it should be reinforced that the Union has arrived at the end of an era and the beginning of a new one."
"The coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon around six months ago on the one hand, and the global financial and economic crisis, its impact and the reaction of the European Union to it on the other, definitely mean that we have arrived at the end of an era in the life of the Union and the beginning of a new one."
"In other words, in the second decade of the 21st century, a new era has begun in the life of the European Union."
"This report was created in this new era, and I believe we in the European Parliament and the European Investment Bank will have to respond to the most important questions and challenges of this new era."
"The report is about the activities of a bank, of a financial institution two years ago, and, unusually, we can say that in spite of the circumstances of the global financial and economic crisis, it is possible to be appreciative of a bank's, a financial institution's activities."
"Two years ago, the European Investment Bank responded rapidly and efficiently to the unfolding global financial and economic crisis by strengthening its lending activities, primarily by increasing loans provided to small and medium-sized enterprises, and on the other hand by participating with all the capacity available to it in the implementation of the European Union's Economic Recovery Plan."
"The Treaty of Lisbon came into force six months ago."
"This provides the means and opportunity to further strengthen the renewal process of the European Investment Bank's organisational, supervisory and core structure."
"The Bank made significant progress in this respect as early as 2008, before the Treaty of Lisbon came into force."
"It is equally noticeable that the European Investment Bank is preparing consciously for the European Union's post-2014 financial perspective, with the opportunity of joining in the financing of macro-regional strategies and by supporting rural development, new energy sources, green investments and infrastructure development."
"Another aspect we feel is important, and is therefore featured in the report, is that the European Investment Bank should participate in the financing of the EU 2020 Strategy pending ratification, which focuses on job creation."
"In fact, it was the consideration of supporting job creation that led the European Investment Bank in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Finally, I would like to draw your attention to two issues."
"I consider it vital that the European Investment Bank continues to support the elimination of infrastructural inequalities within the European Union."
"It is important to support programmes that help balance the infrastructural standards within the EU."
"Last but not least, in the past years the European Investment Bank has always received the support required for its activity from the European Parliament."
"Based on the preparatory work carried out over the past few months, I believe that with the constructive criticisms included in the report the Bank will continue to receive the support required for its activity from the European Parliament."
"Thank you for your attention and I look forward to the debate with interest."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all thank you for doing me the honour of inviting me to speak in plenary."
"This is the continuation of a tradition begun a few years ago."
"I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Deutsch, for the fine quality of his report."
"In particular, I appreciated the fact that Mr Deutsch, as well as other members of the committee, Mr Berman and Mr Kalfin, made the effort to come to the European Investment Bank to ask some very specific questions."
"I welcome this excellent cooperation with Parliament."
"In reality, the European Investment Bank is the only international financial institution that answers voluntarily and that is accountable to a parliamentary institution."
"I believe it is an excellent thing: in my opinion, strengthening the dialogue with the European Parliament is in fact absolutely essential to allow us to fulfil our role, our specific mission, which is to be a bank, but not an ordinary bank, serving the policies of the European Union."
"As Mr Deutsch has already pointed out, this is what we have been trying hard to do in response to the crisis."
"As of September 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Ecofin Council asked us to increase the volume of our loans for the real economy."
"We set to work, acting on this order from the Council, and I think I can say that we have in fact fulfilled our commitments, since in 2009 the volume of our loans went from 58 billion to 79 billion, that is, an increase of 37% of the volume of our loans in the European Union."
"This increase mainly concerned the three sectors that the Council and Parliament had told us were priorities."
"The first area was to make a special effort for the countries and the regions that were most severely affected by the crisis."
"This increase largely concerns what we call the convergence regions and especially certain countries that experienced particular difficulties in 2009."
"Thus we have never before lent so much to countries such as Hungary, Lithuania and Romania."
"Furthermore, this also explains why this year we are going to make a special effort for Greece: I was in Athens last week and, with the Greek Government, we agreed that we would increase considerably the volume of our loans in Greece, as a sign of support and a contribution to the general effort to get the Greek economy back on its feet."
"The second area that was prioritised is support for small and medium-sized enterprises: we increased our loans to the banks so that they continue to lend to small and medium-sized enterprises, with a new product that will allow us to have better control over the actual use of the funds that we lend."
"Last year we lent more than EUR 12 billion to the banks for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The third area that we were asked to prioritise is the fight against climate change."
"Last year, we provided close to EUR 17 billion in funding for projects that contribute directly to reducing the volume of greenhouse gas emissions."
"I think I can say that in 2009 we achieved what was expected of us; in other words, we made our contribution to the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"Of course, we need to continue along these lines, and I would like very briefly to mention the three great challenges that we face in the coming months and years."
"The first, as your rapporteur quite rightly stressed, is to continue to contribute to the European Union's priorities."
"That means, therefore, that we, as the EIB, must make our contribution to the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"As you know, the Commission has launched this new strategy, which is currently under discussion with the Council and Parliament."
"The EIB is ready to make its contribution, in particular using innovative financial instruments that would allow us to increase the leverage of some funds from the European budget."
"These are, therefore, joint instruments between the Commission and the Bank that we would like to put into action."
"The second major challenge that we face is the renewal of the EIB's external mandates."
"We will have the opportunity to discuss this with Parliament."
"The Commission has just presented a proposal that is fully in line with the report by a committee of wise men chaired by Mr Camdessus."
"The key element of this proposal is to make the system even more effective."
"As you know, we benefit from a European Union guarantee for operations that are included in its external mandates."
"The aim, therefore, is to use them as best we can, and the Commission proposes a simplification, a harmonisation of our external mandates."
"The Commission also proposes that EUR 2 billion that was set aside be allocated to projects contributing to the fight against climate change."
"That leads me to the third challenge that I would like to underline: the need for the European Investment Bank, along with other institutions, to make its contribution, in particular, to fulfilling the commitment made by the European Union in Copenhagen."
"As you know, the European Union made some major commitments to support what we call fast track financing."
"In this context we think that the EIB, which has developed unquestionable expertise in these matters, can make an important contribution."
"That is why we proposed to work with other national financial institutions to set up a network, a European platform that could coordinate and, therefore, optimise the funding of projects in developing countries."
"The French Development Agency and the German KfW have already shown interest in this initiative, and I hope that, together with the Commission, we will be able to help finalise this instrument in the coming weeks."
"Those, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, are the three major challenges for the months and years ahead that I wanted to draw your attention to."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank Mr Deutsch for an excellent report, and also to welcome President Philip Maystadt to your plenary and congratulate him for the huge efforts the EIB has made to counter the economic crisis and to support the EU's recovery plan."
"In the extraordinary circumstances we made an extraordinary call to the Bank, and it responded immediately by accelerating its lending to record highs."
"Due to its excellent financial standing, it was able to do so even at a time when it was difficult to raise finance from the markets."
"The increased volumes targeted especially those areas which we feel - and I trust Parliament shares this view - are a priority, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, energy and climate change, as well as investments in the convergence regions of the Union which have been particularly hard hit by the economic slowdown."
"Furthermore, the EIB, in a joint initiative with the EBRD and the World Bank, was able to increase its support to the financial sector in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, which are also experiencing an especially difficult situation."
"The EIB will have a very important role to play in the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy in supporting investments in infrastructure, green technologies, innovation and SMEs."
"We are also laying the groundwork to enhance the combined use of EU grants with the EIB financial instruments both inside and outside the Union, including in the convergence regions, where the EIB can play an important role in improving the absorption of structural funds."
"In the external field, I am very satisfied with the mid-term review of the EIB external mandate, supported by the Camdessus report, which concluded that the EU guarantee to the EIB is an efficient and forceful instrument with high financial and political leverage."
"The Camdessus report also contained a number of good suggestions on increased alignment of EIB external activity with EU policies, and on how to enhance the cooperation of the EIB and the EBRD, building on Parliament's resolution on the EIB and EBRD Annual Reports for 2007."
"Parliament had called for a better mutual understanding between the two banks."
"I have been very pleased to see that the EIB and the EBRD have reached an agreement on their cooperation in common countries of cooperation."
"This will form the basis for a more global tripartite agreement with the Commission replacing the existing regionally based agreements."
"The main outcome of the mid-term review is the legislative proposal which the Commission has just submitted to Parliament and the Council for amendment of the EIB mandate for the remainder of the current financial perspective."
"I trust that you will find it a solid and balanced proposal which takes into account Parliament's recommendations and concerns."
"It aims at reinforcing the focus of the external mandate on the key policy areas where the EIB has a well-proven track record, especially climate change, social and economic infrastructure and local private sector development, but also at placing more emphasis on development aspects of EIB financing."
"So, in conclusion, we are looking forward to constructive and productive discussions with you and with the Council over the next months on this proposal."
"We hope that once again we could see an agreement at first reading, so that legal stability can continue to be ensured for an external mandate that allows us to effectively and efficiently pursue the EU's external policy objectives."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (HU) Ladies and gentlemen, in their opinion on the report, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs stated that the European Investment Bank did well in crisis management in 2008."
"What can be expected from an investment bank during a crisis?"
"Mainly that it tries to compensate the decline in the lending activities of the commercial banks by creating liquidity."
"It can be stated that the EIB has been increasing the volume of loans with favourable interest terms continuously since 2008, and pledged to make available an additional annual amount of EUR 15 billion in extra funds for small and medium-sized enterprises in 2009 and 2010."
"Why is this so important?"
"Obviously because these are the largest creators of jobs, and at the moment, our greatest problems here in Europe are represented by employment issues."
"We have to create jobs."
"The Bank also did well, in this very respect, in restructuring certain target areas."
"The bank turned towards small and medium-sized enterprises to a significant extent, and helped them find their footing as soon as possible."
"The Committee would recommend to President Maystadt three areas where the Bank's operations could become more efficient or transparent."
"The first is that the Bank should focus even more on the countries most severely affected by the crisis, thus further increasing the inner cohesion of the Union."
"The second is that the Bank should not only enter into partnership agreements with large commercial banks for the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises, but should also include regional banks and savings banks into the partnerships, as these financial institutions know the markets best."
"Finally, the third point is that we believe it would be essential that financial institutions included in the partnerships are obliged to transfer to financed SMEs at least 20% of the profits resulting from the complete 50% EIB financing, in other words, a larger percentage than required by the current contracts."
"On the whole, we can say that the EIB did well, and still leads the way in providing appropriate responses to the crisis, but further joint efforts will be required to be able to move forward with the European Commission and European Investment Bank, particularly in terms of job creation."
"Mr President, Mr Rehn, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I would first of all like to express my gratitude for the report and I would also like to thank the rapporteur."
"The committee welcomes the high capital adequacy ratio of the European Investment Bank (EIB)."
"We are pleased that economic and social cohesion and convergence and the convergence pillar of the EU's cohesion policy in particular represent a core target for the EIB."
"We also appreciate very much the contribution which the EIB made to achieving the convergence objectives by lending EUR 21 billion, 41% of total EIB lending in the EU, for convergence projects."
"Furthermore, I would like to emphasise the added value of undertaking actions in cooperation with the Commission and the EIB's strategy of providing additional support and leverage to structural fund interventions."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome you, President Maystadt, and to tell you what a joy it is to see you again, since I worked on an identical report some time ago."
"I would also like to welcome the Commissioner and to tell the rapporteur and the rapporteurs for the other groups that they have done a tremendous job, and I would like to welcome them too."
"Mr President, it is regrettable that the Council's seat is empty, because the EIB is an intergovernmental instrument."
"It is the Member States that are the partners of the EIB."
"Furthermore, I welcome, once again, the concern that President Maystadt and his colleagues show for Parliament in all these matters."
"I would like to speak first of all about supervision, which is a subject close to my heart, since I think that the nature of the European Investment Bank's tasks mean that it should have prudential supervision."
"It does not have it because it is an international entity that is not subject to national audit authorities."
"I have tabled an amendment so that our European Banking Authority, which we are hoping to set up, has a remit enabling it to perform prudential supervision tasks."
"Commissioner, I would like you to support this idea."
"I am told that the Member States are against it."
"The Member States will be unable to entrust tasks to the EIB on a long-term basis or to ensure that it has prudential supervision."
"I would like to conclude now with investment and the role of the EIB."
"The European Union is not investing enough, and we know today that, whether we are talking about transport network interconnections, energy, high-speed trains, motorways, universities, water, space or health, we must invest more."
"However, the European Investment Bank is right: it is a bank and it must protect its triple A rating."
"That is why I propose that, in the 2020 Strategy, we at least have an objective of EUR 1 trillion in investments."
"It is possible, but we must have an investment budget within the European Union and we must cooperate with the EIB through the use of innovative instruments."
"I propose that the European Union become the Bank's partner, since this would create a better synergy between the Union and this instrument, which is absolutely crucial to the future of our Europe."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (RO) I believe we all agree that the European Investment Bank features among the European projects which we can describe as successful European projects."
"I must also congratulate it at this point for the fact that, during a crisis, it has managed to retain its AAA rating, which is excellent."
"In another respect, however, the current economic situation in Europe means that the European Investment Bank needs to carry out a wide-ranging review of its mission."
"I will mention here just three important points."
"First of all, loans which are given must support the Europe 2020 agenda."
"Secondly, the loans that it gives must be used to support large-scale investment projects so that Europe's economies can start to function again."
"Lastly, the European Investment Bank can and must support the creation of a much more stable and powerful European economic framework."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Maystadt, I should like to thank the rapporteur very much for an interesting and excellent report."
"On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I should like to start by praising the bank for its excellent work."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) was rapid and resolute in taking action when the financial crisis hit with full force."
"The bank demonstrated its ability to handle the huge challenges that it faced when the global economic crisis reached the economies in the European Union."
"It increased the money supply and ensured that the lending volume increased significantly."
"This lessened the deepening of the financial crisis and was important for enabling any sort of recovery to occur."
"The important role of the EIB in supporting the small and medium-sized enterprises, which has been mentioned here, ought to be highlighted and cannot be emphasised enough."
"These investments were able to alleviate the crisis significantly."
"Small enterprises are, of course, the engine of our economy."
"They make up 99% of all our companies in Europe and employ 100 million people."
"The fact that the EIB has a strategy for ensuring sustainable long-term growth in the European Union is, of course, extremely important, and this has been said many times; with green development, including investment in the Trans-European Network projects."
"A well-functioning Trans-European Transport Network is one of the most important components of the European growth initiative; the volcano in Iceland has perhaps taught us a lesson."
"Evening out the differences in Europe is another important part of the EIB's work."
"It is beneficial to the EU to have stable and economically strong neighbours."
"In this context, we can view the EIB's work as particularly important from a strategic point of view."
"Openness, transparency and the combating of fraud are particularly important subject areas."
"In the Liberal ALDE Group, we are pleased that the EIB has actually followed the recommendations that Parliament has put forward for so many years."
"We think that this is very good."
"Here the EIB can function as a beacon for openness for other EU institutions."
"So, finally I come to a blot on the EIB's Protocol."
"It is very disappointing that equality within the EIB is still so poor."
"Women are still seriously under-represented, Mr Maystadt, in particular among the EIB's higher officials and directors, and make up only around 20% of the workforce."
"The EIB must improve in this area."
"This is something we can read about in its Diversity Strategy from December 2008."
"In summary, therefore, there are three good points and one less good, or we could even say bad, point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Maystadt, fellow countrymen, we need a bank like yours."
"Yes, we need it at a time when private banks, like industry, have shown that they are working against the general interest, that they are no longer doing their job of providing society with credit."
"We need public lending instruments, and even more so at European level."
"For that reason alone, therefore, I believe - and we believe - that the EIB should assume an increasingly important role."
"What role should you play in our opinion, though?"
"That of a catalyst, of course."
"A public bank like yours cannot respond to all the needs of the market, but you should be a catalyst: a catalyst to help our societies and economies transform, so that they can rise to the two crucial challenges of our time, which are not only to learn to live within the physical limits of our planet - that is, of course, the climate issue and that of the exhaustion of resources - but also to rise to this growing challenge of social cohesion, both within the European Union and on the planet as a whole, since you have a significant mission in the area of development."
"From that point of view, allow me to quote just one figure."
"When we see the energy investments that you were funding in 2009, three quarters went towards 19th- and 20th-century technologies and only one quarter towards renewable energy."
"Therefore, the challenge that we are setting you, Mr Maystadt, and the EIB, is to reverse these proportions, it is to ensure that, in 2010 and beyond, three quarters of your investments - and all of them in the long term - go towards this transformation."
"I think that this is how you will play your role as catalyst."
"Mr Maystadt, you have often been top of the class; we ask you to ensure that the EIB really is top of the class at global level."
"Mr President, most of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Deutsch, for his very good work."
"I think that increasing the volume of lending by the amount which the report mentions is a very ambitious objective."
"I think that, in fact, from the perspective of the European taxpayer and the European voter, a European investment pact is basically only important insofar as it is a financial 'tap' for small and medium-sized businesses."
"The increased financial commitment should be appreciated, here, as it is fairly significant in this area."
"Support for this sector is especially valuable, particularly in times of crisis."
"As a representative of Central and Eastern Europe, and as a Pole, I must say that it is an extremely important matter for us that the bank should support transformation in our region of Europe and reduce the present divisions."
"I am glad, too, that the bank is showing significant commitment as far as relations with European funds are concerned."
"This, too, is of indirect significance for us."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, when I look at the projects the EIB finances I am struck by how many involve large companies and how few involve the SMEs they are supposed to help."
"Do companies such as General Motors, Electrolux and Arcelor Mittal really need to use the EIB except for the soft terms they offer?"
"And what have such loans done for the European economy?"
"Have they created jobs?"
"No, they have exported jobs, sometimes to cheaper European countries and sometimes outside the EU altogether."
"Electrolux is an example of EIB success."
"Lent EUR 250 million for capacity enhancement, they built new factories in Poland, Romania and Hungary."
"As soon as these were completed they transferred production there from the UK with the loss of almost 2 000 jobs in Spennymoor, England, so I think we can all agree that the EIB plays a very important role in the economy of Europe, particularly on the balance of trade: it exports our jobs and imports unemployment."
"(DE) Mr President, it is pleasing to read in the annual report that the European Investment Bank (EIB) has responded rapidly to the crisis by making a significant increase in the funds available."
"Lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular must remain one of its central priorities and, where possible, must be extended."
"However, it is important to ensure that the businesspeople in question actually receive the loans."
"With regard to the monitoring and supervisory system, I support the proposal for the establishment of a European Banking Authority."
"However, in order to be able to function efficiently, this authority must be given far-reaching powers and must also have the mandate to monitor banks which operate across national borders."
"As far as the objectives of the European Investment Bank are concerned, I would like to see a greater focus on its activities within Europe."
"This is urgently needed in the light of the ongoing financial and economic crisis and it would also allow duplication of effort and conflicts of interest with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to be avoided."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Maystadt, Mr Rehn, I would first like to thank Mr Deutsch for his work."
"However, I would also like to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB) for Europe and for the citizens of Europe and to highlight the fact that we must make greater use of this unique institution, in particular in times of economic crisis."
"From the perspective of budgetary control, which in modern terms also covers the actual output and performance of European programmes and institutions, the EIB has definitely earned its high rating, in particular with regard to political reliability."
"It creates real added value for the people of Europe by means of the investments made in its six main programmes, ranging from the Trans-European Networks to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and its special programmes, such as the project to combat climate change."
"I am sure that this will receive broad support in the European Parliament."
"However, this also means that Parliament must in future extend its own supervisory procedures."
"I am referring here, for example, to the investment facility."
"Finally, I would like to make one further point which is particularly important to my group and which is aimed directly at the EIB."
"We welcome the fact that the EIB has revised its policy on offshore financial centres."
"However, we also need the assurance that income produced from EIB funds will not make its way into tax havens of this kind, otherwise the EIB would risk damaging the reputation and the rating that it has built up."
"(FR) Mr President, the European Investment Bank is both a bank and an institution."
"As a bank it cannot forget that it is an institution, and as an institution it cannot forget that it is a bank."
"Therefore, it must respond to the demands of the European Union, on the one hand, without neglecting its refinancing capacity, on the other."
"From this point of view, we do not have the right to make it take unnecessary risks, particularly in its interventions in developing countries."
"That is why it is important to favour a kind of agreement between the Member States and the European Commission, on the one hand, and the European Investment Bank, on the other, whereby institutional donors have the opportunity to intervene with donations, while the European Investment Bank, by virtue of its role, can grant loans."
"This precaution would protect us from the setbacks experienced by the World Bank, which a few years ago had to cancel 50 billion worth of debt that would not have been repaid in any case."
"I believe we can avoid such an experience with the prudence shown in the European Investment Bank's operations, and I would like to encourage it to further develop its interventions in developing countries, because there is certainly still some margin for manoeuvre there."
"(FR) Mr President, President of the European Investment Bank, in the EIB's 2008 report, Parliament insisted that the bank's external activities comply with the general objectives of the European Union."
"That is why the project to finance a nuclear power station in Jordan would go against the foundations of Article 3(5) of the Treaty on European Union."
"I quote, 'In its relations with the wider world, the Union shall contribute to the sustainable development of the Earth'."
"In February 2009, the Jordanian authorities contacted the EIB seeking support for their nuclear energy development project, which involves, in particular, the construction of a nuclear power station by 2016."
"It is therefore with some satisfaction that I have received the assurance of your services that the European Investment Bank did not grant this request and that it considers that its job is to support projects in Jordan aimed at developing wind and solar power, which are energies of the future for our planet because they are renewable."
"Will this position be pursued for other requests to finance nuclear power stations?"
"(PL) Mr President, the stability of Ukraine is a natural objective for all EU Member States, partly because Ukraine is one of our most important and largest partners."
"As we look on, Ukraine is going through a crisis."
"The stability of Ukraine's budget will be decisive for the social and political situation as well as for the country's future."
"The more help and political support we give to Ukraine, the more we will be entitled to expect reforms in the Ukrainian economy in favour of a free market."
"The economic crisis in Ukraine is not just a crisis for Ukraine, but is also a matter for all of us."
"Today, in the difficult situation of Ukraine, it is becoming apparent how much we can help."
"Therefore, I support macrofinancial aid for Ukraine."
"I think we should say, today, that it ought to be greater, and that the greater it is, the greater and more ambitious can be our expectations of Ukraine."
"(EL) Mr President, without doubt, the European Investment Bank has been a success since it was founded 52 years ago, especially in achieving and strengthening the objectives of the European Union and financing small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the mainstay of business in the European Union and the mainstay of those businesses that need to be maintained during the course of the current economic crisis in order to maintain jobs and social calm in the Union."
"As we all know, today the Union is dealing with the Greek crisis."
"Of course, I do not know if future historians will call it the 'Greek crisis' or the 'financial crisis' or perhaps they will call it the 'monetary crisis'."
"What I do know is that, if he were alive today, Galileo would not say that the world is turning, he would say that 'the world is running', because events are running away with us and, as the European Union, we must follow them and find the necessary solutions."
"I think that everyone here believes that, if life is to proceed smoothly in the Union, we need to speed up the completion of political and economic union."
"That being so, I consider that the EIB has the expertise and the objective capability of taking more action and I propose - and I address this proposal specifically to Mr Olli Rehn, whom I respect immensely for the gravitas with which he addresses various issues - that the possibility should be examined of the EIB's paying a role in the future in assessing the credit rating of the Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, the previous speakers have rightly highlighted the importance of the European Investment Bank (EIB)."
"Mrs Kadenbach, for example, has referred to its essential contribution to social convergence."
"I would like to put that in a political context."
"We are very concerned to see that parties of the extreme right are gaining popularity in more and more countries."
"This is because social convergence in the European Union is not working in the way in which we would all have liked."
"These radical right-wingers are very often wolves in sheep's clothing, which allows them to conceal their massive and cynical contempt for humanity."
"My final example, Mr President - and I am aware of your political leanings - concerns what Mr Mölzer has just done."
"He has made a nice little speech, but in the meantime he has called one of his political opponents - in other words, me - a psychopath."
"That is the language of Hitler's fascism."
"This is the way in which these people work, by branding their political opponents as monsters."
"I would like to ask you to take the necessary measures and I would also like to ask the staff of the EIB to continue with their work, in particular in the area of transparency."
"They should make what they do even more transparent, because this approach will help to combat the new rise of fascism."
"(FR) Mr President, with the European Investment Bank's 2008 report we are celebrating an anniversary: the EIB has now been actively contributing to the economic development of our continent for more than 50 years."
"As a European Union bank providing long-term loans, it plays a decisive role in combating the crisis we are experiencing today."
"We should pay tribute to the responsiveness that it has shown since autumn 2008."
"In 2008 alone, the EIB paid out EUR 10 billion more than it anticipated."
"As a member of Parliament's Committee on Regional Development and Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I am particularly interested in the EIB's assistance for Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises."
"To me it seems extremely important to continue to develop initiatives such as JEREMIE."
"Enterprises need equity, venture capital, guarantees, loans and the technical assistance proposed by JEREMIE."
"A year ago, the Auvergne region - a part of my 'Euro constituency' which Mr Audy, who is here, knows well - launched this aid mechanism for SMEs."
"It is worth EUR 25 million, EUR 18 million of which comes from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and it will help small enterprises, support innovation and contribute to overcoming the crisis."
"I am pleased to see this constructive cooperation between the EIB, the European Investment Fund and our local authorities."
"Mr Maystadt, I am convinced that we must continue along these lines."
"Mr President, within the EU in 2008 the EIB reacted swiftly and accurately to the financial crisis by increasing its capital and almost doubling investments and disbursements compared to previous years, and in particular towards SMEs."
"However, under the EIB's external mandate, this sense of urgency for counter-cyclical action has not been shown by the EIB in developing countries."
"The EIB even decreased its investment significantly in ACP countries, in Asia and in Latin America."
"The annual report painfully shows that, for developing countries, the EIB's response to the crisis has been far too slow."
"The main task of the EIB as a public institution in developing countries should not only be to invest in heavy infrastructure; another and equally important task is providing capital in times of scarcity, supporting markets where private banks are reluctant."
"Under the external mandate the EIB should invest more in financial services, offering better access to loans and savings for citizens and SMEs."
"That leads to sustainable growth here and in developing countries."
"(EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I welcome President Maystadt to the European Parliament and before I congratulate him both on the successes of the European Investment Bank and on its ambitious business plan, I should like to express my horror about the murderous arson attack on three of my fellow citizens in Athens yesterday, at their place of work, and to express my deepest condolences to their families."
"Without doubt, the current economic crisis has highlighted the important work of the European Investment Bank."
"Additional financial support by the EIB has allowed fast disbursements and helped to support the real economy, especially by protecting useful projects and helping viable undertakings in these exceptionally difficult times."
"The EIB has also played an important pivotal role in the core programme on competitiveness in Europe under which, via the JASPERS and JEREMIE initiatives, the EIB has promoted instruments to give even more essential support to innovation."
"The role of the EIB is becoming more and more important, not only within the framework of the cohesion objectives, but also in the implementation of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The smart financial mechanism instruments which it is constantly developing and the more recent European Local Energy Assistance or ELENA initiative are expected to make a decisive contribution towards employment through important investments in sectors such as sustainability and security of energy supply, which have a direct impact on local economic development and on improving the quality of life of our citizens."
"(LT) President Adamkus, after Europe was struck by the financial and economic crisis, the support provided by the European Investment Bank to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) became especially necessary."
"I view as positive the decision adopted by the bank in 2008 to allocate 42% more loans than in the previous year to SMEs, since they make up 99% of all of the European Union's companies and employ more than 100 million people."
"Given that the economic crisis is not yet over and the level of unemployment is still rising, we must ensure that the European Investment Bank further increases borrowing opportunities for SMEs, improves access to capital and simplifies the complicated bureaucratic rules so that projects can be funded more quickly and more effectively, particularly in those Member States and sectors that have suffered most from the crisis."
"As well as support for the companies I have mentioned, the European Investment Bank should also continue devoting significant attention to funding the development of a sustainable, competitive and secure energy infrastructure and a harmonious transport sector infrastructure."
"Mr President, if we did not have the European Investment Bank, we would right now be desperately trying to set it up."
"I welcome the proposal to greatly increase the amount of loans and also support its role in helping non-EU developing countries."
"We are, however - I believe - wasting this valuable resource by not drawing on its expertise in the wider financial crisis."
"We urgently need a European mechanism for financial stability."
"By setting up a trust fund, as proposed by the Party of European Socialists, we would ensure that Member States coming under attack from unscrupulous speculators could be supported without direct recourse to taxpayers and could ensure lower spreads."
"This would demonstrate clearly to the market - particularly the unscrupulous speculators - that we are not prepared to allow any Member State to be brought down and destroyed, as is happening at this point in time with Greece and is likely to happen to other Member States, not least my own, in Ireland."
"(RO) Against the backdrop of the crisis, the European Investment Bank has managed to change its priorities quickly in terms of granting loans, in order to provide support to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are exposed the most to the risks triggered by the crisis and the increased costs associated with lending."
"It is important for us to see to what extent the Bank can provide cofinancing for projects financed from Structural Funds in Member States in the East because, as you are aware, a number of SMEs and local authorities are experiencing major difficulties in accessing European funds for which no cofinancing is available on the financial and banking market."
"I believe that during the forthcoming period the Bank's activities must be focused on the countries hit hard by the crisis, which are failing to kick-start their economies, in order to support cohesion and prevent the continuing economic and social decline."
"The European Investment Bank has a special place in the financial mechanism available to the EU for relaunching economic growth."
"This is why I support the recommendation that the EU, as a legal entity, can become a shareholder of the Bank, along with the Member States, which would help strengthen cooperation."
"I am going to give the floor for half a minute to Mr Mölzer, who felt he was alluded to in a speech by another Member."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement under Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure, following the serious accusations made against me by Mr Martin in his speech."
"I must point out that I want nothing to do with this Member of Parliament."
"His political approach is to denounce his colleagues, to denounce the entire Parliament in the media and to claim that the officials in Parliament are lazy, idle and incapable."
"I will not talk to a man who uses secret service methods, such as keyhole cameras, miniature cameras and other secret equipment, to spy on people."
"I have not spoken to him today and I will not do so in future."
"I do not want anything to do with a person of this kind."
"I reject Mr Martin's assertion and, in my opinion, he should withdraw it."
"Mr Mölzer, your words have therefore been recorded in the verbatim record of today's sitting."
"(RO) I must begin by congratulating the European Investment Bank for the efforts it has made aimed at achieving the Community objectives."
"This institution has played and continues to play a crucial role during the current financial and economic crisis."
"The convergence objective receives considerable support from the Structural and Cohesion Funds as it is one of the Bank's key objectives."
"EUR 21 billion, approximately 41% of the total sum of EIB loans in the European Union, have funded loans for projects with this objective in mind."
"I think that poorer regions cannot be developed until after the infrastructure providing accessibility, as well as the right social and educational infrastructure have been created, based on the common standards for all European Union citizens."
"This is why I am actually encouraging the European Investment Bank to continue the measures aimed at promoting economic and social cohesion in the European Union and the measures to combat the financial crisis by increasing..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) The European Investment Bank plays a major role in increasing the level of convergence across the European Union, a vital contribution during the economic recession which has hit investments hard, especially in public infrastructure."
"I think that the EIB has responded very promptly to the challenges presented by the crisis, for instance, by granting funding to Romania, amounting to a total of almost EUR 1.5 billion for 2009."
"These loans highlight the versatile extent of the Bank's involvement in accelerating the process of bridging the development gaps during the post-accession period."
"As my fellow Members have said, a significant proportion of the loans are for supporting SMEs."
"I believe that improving these enterprises' access to capital can play a key role in boosting the European economy and combating unemployment."
"In this respect, it would be useful for assessments to be carried out every year on the accessibility and effectiveness of these loans to ensure greater transparency in terms of their final destination and improve the administrative process."
"Mr President, we should applaud the important role the European Investment Bank plays in the reconstruction of our economies in the difficult times most of our countries are facing."
"My country, Lithuania, is a case in point."
"The EIB plays a role in the national stimulus package, especially when it comes to enhancing financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, but also financing renewable-energy and transport projects."
"I would nevertheless urge European governments to provide the EIB with a more significant lending capacity to our neighbours, especially those in the east, that are also suffering from the effects of the crisis and are highly in need of loans and investments."
"Especially needed are investments in the hard sectors, such as transport, environment and, last but not least, energy."
"The last one is of particular importance, especially knowing the energy infrastructure problems that..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"(PL) Mr President, I, too, would like to add my voice to the propitious expressions of thanks to Mr Maystadt and the European Investment Bank, and also to Mr Deutsch, who drafted the report."
"Two objectives, in fact, have been discernible during the debate: firstly, development, and secondly, stabilisation, or the other way round - the order is not important."
"In the European Union and its Member States we are thinking, principally, of development in the area of cohesion."
"Here, I want to emphasise in particular the role which can be played by financing the small and medium-sized enterprise sector."
"We have already said, in the Lisbon Agenda, that without the small and medium-sized enterprise sector and without regional cooperation it will not be possible to develop cohesion."
"We have countries outside the Union, which are neighbours of the European Union, the Eastern Partnership countries, where without the help of the European Investment Bank - Mr Kowal also spoke about this, and so did Mrs Andrikien- it will not be possible..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Maystadt, I would be interested to know what effect the discussion on Basel III is having on the bank and, in particular, on the European Investment Fund (EIF)."
"Do you believe that we have the necessary creditworthiness to provide effective support in an economic crisis or do you think that our creditworthiness needs to be improved?"
"What opportunities do you see in future for making more risk capital available in crises like the one which we are currently experiencing?"
"The support of the EIF is of great importance in particular to small and medium-sized enterprises in difficult times."
"I would like to thank the European Investment Bank (EIB) for its successful collaboration with the EIF and for the fact that it has made major progress in focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises and, above all, on the Trans-European Networks."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their comments."
"Of course, some of the issues raised deserve to be discussed in more detail."
"I can only give a few answers here, and I will distinguish between questions that concern our operational priorities, on the one hand, and those that are more about supervision and governance, on the other."
"As far as our operational priorities are concerned, one has held the attention of a number of you, and it is the support that should be provided to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Mrs Győri and Mr Schmidt, in particular, underlined this."
"I think that they are quite right to stress the importance of support for SMEs."
"As you doubtless know, in 2008, we launched a new product for loans to banks for small and medium-sized enterprises, which allows us to monitor the use of the funds that we lend more effectively."
"Thus I can tell you that, from the last quarter of 2008 until the end of 2009, we signed loans worth EUR 21 billion, of which EUR 16 billion have actually been spent."
"Moreover, at the end of last year, more than 90% of these funds had already actually been lent to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I therefore think that we can provide significant support in this way, going through commercial banks, and using, as Mrs Győri stressed, not just traditional commercial banks as intermediaries, but also regional banks and savings banks."
"We have diversified the range of our intermediaries."
"We are also trying to work in close cooperation with our subsidiary, the European Investment Fund, in combined actions, since this fund is able to provide guarantees for the portfolio of loans granted to SMEs."
"Mrs Auconie gave a very specific example of this participation, and I am grateful for her words of support in this regard."
"The second operational priority that captured your interest is, of course, convergence, and I can confirm that the European Investment Bank is striving to further increase its operations in the so-called convergence regions."
"Thus you will see that, in 2009, the volume of our loans grew more in the new Member States than in the old ones."
"This is part of our determined effort to try to help reduce the gap between the Member States, since that is indeed the spirit of convergence."
"In this context, as Mrs Kadenbach and Mr Czarnecki, in particular, underlined, it is important to have good cooperation with the Commission regarding the use of the Structural Funds, and I can tell you that this is indeed the case."
"Furthermore, together with the Commission we have finalised several joint programmes: JASPERS, to provide technical assistance in the preparation of projects that may be eligible for aid from the Structural Funds;"
"JEREMIE, which is an original idea aimed at transforming the Structural Funds into financial instruments with a revolving character (we can use the same amounts several times); and, finally, JESSICA, which is the same idea of using the Structural Funds for funding in the area of urban renewal."
"The third operational priority is energy and the fight against climate change."
"We will perhaps have the opportunity to discuss this in more detail, but I can assure you that the idea is to put more emphasis on renewable energies and energy efficiency, in accordance with the strategy adopted at European level."
"Mr Lamberts quoted figures for the period 2002-2008, but if you look at the most recent figures, in particular those of 2009, you will see that the proportion is in the process of being reversed, since in 2009 we funded renewable energy projects worth more than EUR 4 billion, which represents more than 70% of our funding for electricity generation."
"The intention, then, is to pursue this reversal of the proportion by providing more funding for renewable energies and energy efficiency, and here I would like to thank Mr Stavrakakis, who alluded in his speech to the ELENA programme, which once again is a joint programme with the Commission to provide technical assistance in the area of energy efficiency."
"Still on energy, I would like to say to Mrs Benarab-Attou that we respect the choice of each Member State as far as policy mix is concerned."
"If a Member State decides to use nuclear energy, it is not for the EIB to oppose this, but I confirm that, in the case of Jordan, we are only discussing the funding of renewable energies."
"I shall be brief now, and address a few issues regarding supervision and governance."
"As far as supervision is concerned, Mr Audy has gone over this, he knows our position; we are completely open, we are already supervised to a large extent by an independent audit committee, by the European Court of Auditors, when we use the European budget, by OLAF and by the European Ombudsman."
"I think we are already the most supervised international financial institution."
"That said, I acknowledge that having banking supervision could be useful, and we are therefore completely open to proposals that could be made on the subject, in particular via the new European Banking Authority."
"As far as Basel III is concerned, I would simply say to Mr Rübig that we are following the work closely."
"It is too early to give an opinion on the impact that that could have, since we are only at the stage of consultation on Basel III and the parameters have not yet been decided."
"As for offshore financial centres, I would say to Mr Geier that it is something that we are very interested in."
"If he wishes, we could explain our new policy in more detail, but, really, the main concern is to prevent tax avoidance when offshore financial centres are used."
"Finally, a specific point raised by Mr Schmidt."
"He is right, we still have some progress to make in terms of gender equality."
"The figure that he quoted concerns only managerial staff."
"It is true that we have too few women in the EIB's managerial staff."
"We have implemented an action plan and we hope to rectify this situation in the next few years, but I want to assure him of our will in this regard; we want to improve a situation which, as it stands today, is in fact unacceptable."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I want to thank you for a very professional and constructive debate, and Mr Deutsch for his excellent report."
"I wish to say three things on the matter."
"Firstly, I am confident that this debate and report will provide a sound basis for the prompt adoption of the European Investment Bank's external mandate."
"This is important for us to be able to ensure that we effectively implement the EU's common objectives in foreign policy and development cooperation."
"Secondly, the European Investment Bank is a vitally important partner for the European Commission, especially if we are to achieve the Europa 2020 goals, specifically in the areas of sustainable growth and employment."
"The EIB holds the keys to the development of infrastructure, innovations and small enterprises, and we are cooperating closely and seamlessly in this."
"Many of you have, understandably, referred to the situation in Greece."
"Yesterday, on behalf of the Commission, I sent commiserations to the relatives and friends of those who lost their lives in Athens as a result of the violence."
"Fierce debate is a feature of democracy, but violence can never be tolerated and there has to be a very strict limit to behaviour of this sort."
"The Commission has been actively involved in the construction of a stabilisation programme for the Greek economy and the adoption of a huge financial rescue package to support financial stability throughout the euro area and to ensure the stability of the Greek economy."
"At the end of last week we proposed to the Eurogroup a huge financial rescue package and a stabilisation programme worth EUR 110 billion in all."
"The finance ministers in the Eurogroup took a decision last Sunday, with reference to a proposal by the Commission, the ECB and the IMF."
"It was a difficult, but at the same time, necessary and responsible decision."
"Now it is crucially important that all the national parliaments finalise their decisions soon."
"I, for one, am confident of your support in achieving this objective."
"This is not just about Greece, but the stability of the entire eurozone economy."
"It is vital to stop the bushfire in Greece before it turns into a forest fire that spreads across Europe."
"I am sure that we can do this, but it will mean acting responsibly."
"Now is not the time to score popularity points: it is a time for responsible and determined action."
"The euro is not just a technical arrangement: it is perhaps the European Union's most important joint political project."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, President Maystadt, Commissioner Rehn, please allow me to express my thanks to my fellow Members, the President and the Commissioner for this valuable debate."
"Before we vote, please allow me to make three remarks at the end of several months of thorough and in my view valuable preparatory work."
"As Montecuccoli said several hundred years ago, a successful war, fighting a successful war requires money, money and money."
"It is clear that in order to solve the economic problems that affect us all, we need job creation, job creation and job creation."
"It is important that the European Investment Bank has always considered this to be a vital objective, and today's debate also reassures us all that it will continue to work in partnership with the European Parliament, Commission and Council in striving towards these goals."
"I feel that the remarks made by fellow Members urging the European Investment Bank to pay more attention to the Member States most affected by the crisis are important."
"I believe that in this respect, as well, we are knocking on open doors."
"Last but not least, as regards the European Investment Bank's external mandate, I feel that the remarks made here, in the plenary debate, emphasising the importance of providing support and credit to European countries bordering the European Union, are also important."
"Ukraine was mentioned, as well as the Balkan regions."
"I myself agree."
"Last but not least, allow me to mention the names of two gentlemen here, at the end of the debate."
"On such occasions it is usually the leaders of institutions who get the praise."
"I would naturally like to congratulate President Maystadt on the work he has done so far, but please allow me to also thank Mr de Crayencour and Mr Brito, who have been excellent partners of the European Parliament, for their work."
"Last but not least, please allow me to thank my fellow Members for their cooperation."
"It was a joint effort, and the success is also shared."
"Mr Hans-Peter Martin has asked for the floor due to personal allusions."
"His compatriot Mr Mölzer alluded to Mr Hans-Peter Martin, his past and his conduct, and therefore pursuant to Rule 151 he has the right to reply."
"These speeches regarding personal allusions cannot turn into a ping-pong match in which one person alludes to the other and the other alludes to the first; therefore after Mr Martin's speech I shall consider this matter to be completely resolved."
"Mr Martin is going to have a minute to speak, and I ask him to adhere strictly to Rule 151 and advise him that after exactly one minute I shall cut him off."
"(DE) Mr President, it is sad that I have to bring this up in plenary."
"I have to tell you that what Mr Mölzer has said is untrue."
"On the way in here he did indeed call me a psychopath."
"In recent years he has often told me that I should see a psychiatrist."
"That is the way in which radical right-wingers work."
"Last year the leader of the social democratic group said, 'I believe Hein-Christian Strache is a Nazi'."
"This is the man whose party Mr Mölzer belongs to and whom he works closely with."
"I really believe that, on the basis of what we have repeatedly experienced here, we should not only be discussing the economic crisis, the financial crisis and what can now be referred to as a money war."
"We should also be dealing with the dangerous rise of right-wing radicalism."
"If you were to sit here at the back, Mr President, with your political past, you would recognise the dangerous trends emerging once again in Hungary, in Austria and elsewhere."
"This must be stopped before it gets out of hand."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"(GA) The European Investment Bank has a vitally important role in relation to the small and medium-sized enterprises which are trying to survive the current economic crisis."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises provide 70% of European employment, and as a result, they have a central role in the operation of the European economy."
"The greatest difficulty these businesses currently face is in accessing funding and capital."
"The central role of the EIB as regards providing aid to small and medium-sized enterprises must be welcomed, and the Bank should be supported in its efforts."
"EUR 30 billion has been earmarked for small and medium-sized enterprises for the period 2008-2011 and more than 50 000 businesses in the EU benefited from EIB funding in 2009."
"I welcome the report's recommendations with regard to improving the transparency of the system whereby loans are provided through the EIB's financial intermediaries."
"The financial intermediaries must pass these loans on to the small businesses."
"The Bank's monitoring system in relation to these loans must be improved to ensure the effectiveness of these loans."
"I greatly appreciate the continued support expressed by the European Investment Bank (EIB) for Ireland during the economic crisis."
"The EIB has responded admirably to the serious liquidity constraints and the tight credit conditions resulting in serious problems in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the declining confidence in the financial markets."
"The EIB has also played an important role in the European Economic Recovery Plan, especially with regard to the enhanced financing for SMEs, energy from renewable sources and clean transport."
"It is crucial that the EIB applies bolder risk-taking in its lending policy towards SMEs in order to allow SMEs to access capital for risk-taking projects."
"Last year the EIB provided Ireland with EUR 1.02 billion for six operations, the highest level ever achieved in Ireland."
"I welcome the fact that banks acting as intermediaries are contractually obliged to lend to SMEs at least twice the amount of their loan from the EIB, to ensure that the benefits derived from EIB funding are passed on to SMEs."
"However, this regulation needs close supervision as many SMEs in Ireland struggle to borrow from Irish banks in receipt of EIB loans."
"In 2008, the European Investment Bank celebrated its 50th anniversary."
"Throughout this period, it has contributed considerably to the development of integration, balanced and lasting development and economic and social cohesion by supporting investment projects in Europe and lending to the public and private sectors using the financial markets as well as its own funds."
"The year 2008 also saw the beginning of the world financial and economic crisis which devastated the European economy."
"Given the limited liquidity, stricter lending policy and capital restrictions of the banks, the European Investment Bank came to the rescue of many endangered investments and projects."
"In reacting to the crisis, the EIB significantly increased its lending volume to businesses in 2008."
"This was extremely important, especially for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, which was hit exceptionally hard by the crisis."
"Often faced by severe restrictions on their access to capital from banks which were engulfed in problems, the EIB was the last hope."
"The positive role played by the EIB during the crisis is incontrovertible."
"However, it is worth thinking about how the resources at the bank's disposal could be put to even better use."
"The best way for this is to simplify the complicated bureaucracy and create clear procedures."
"Mass atrocities in Jos, Nigeria, in January and March (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the mass atrocities in Jos (Nigeria) in January and March."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we learnt with great sadness that former President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua died last night."
"He made a great contribution to the political and democratic life of Nigeria and through his policies contributed to the stability in particular of the subregion of West Africa."
"According to the Constitution, acting President Jonathan automatically becomes the substantive President."
"We understand that he will be sworn in shortly, possibly by tonight, by Nigeria's Chief of Justice."
"He in turn will be expected to swear in a Vice-President from the north of the country, which opens new speculations on the political scene in Nigeria."
"The European Union has been a committed partner of Nigeria and has continued to give strong and constructive support during the recent difficult months of political uncertainty."
"The violent conflicts in Jos and surrounding villages in January and March this year, during which hundreds of citizens are reported to have been massacred or seriously injured, have been particularly devastating."
"Thousands have been left homeless and are currently in camps."
"I fully share the concerns expressed by honourable Members on the mass atrocities in Jos and I would like to assure you that they triggered a resolute EU response."
"As soon as news emerged about the events in January and March, the Commission was in contact with the International Red Cross in Nigeria and other local agencies, which confirmed that the humanitarian needs of most victims were being met and that hospitals were able to cope with the inflow of causalities."
"The EU was amongst the first of Nigeria's international partners to make public its views on the violence."
"In January, High Representative/Vice-President Catherine Ashton issued a joint statement with Hillary Clinton, David Miliband and Bernard Kouchner expressing deep regret at the violence and tragic loss of lives."
"All parties were urged to exercise restraint and seek peaceful means to resolve differences, and called on the Federal Government to bring the perpetrators of violence to justice."
"The EU issued further declarations on Nigeria in February and March; they conducted a diplomatic démarche with the Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to convey condemnation of the most recent outbreaks of violence."
"The EU requested that the Federal Government of Nigeria conduct a full investigation of the causes of the most recent violence and bring the perpetrators of violence to justice."
"In the last 10 years violent conflicts have caused the death of over 14 000 people in Nigeria and left over three million internally displaced people."
"It is not possible to put Muslim or Christian communities in the role of either aggressor or victim, since historically they have, unfortunately, been both."
"It is apparent, however, that the conflict always involves extremely poor people."
"Conflicts presented as religiously motivated are often triggered by other causes, including conflicts between traditional rulers, land and resource struggles among communities, political in-fighting, and tensions between state and federal authorities."
"Religious differences often fuel and amplify existing differences, leading to larger clashes."
"Measures being undertaken by the EU in Nigeria combine diplomacy with longer-term development cooperation."
"Under the EDF we support development cooperation in Nigeria."
"The two most important sectors are peace and security, and governance and human rights."
"We also actively promote peace and security through regular political dialogue with Nigeria under the Cotonou agreement and we engage in regular dialogue with Nigeria on human rights and democratic principles including ethnic, religious and racial discrimination."
"Finally, I believe it is essential that we remain attentive to the issue of recurring intercommunal violence in Nigeria."
"I propose that it should be addressed as a priority for dialogue in the next EU-Nigeria ministerial meeting in the autumn of this year."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, may I join with the Commissioner in expressing my sympathy to the people of Nigeria on the death of President Umaru Yar'Adua."
"The recent outbreaks of violence in Nigeria are emblematic of a wider problem that faces the country."
"The incidents that have taken place in Jos, a city that has a history of violence, are very alarming."
"The city lies at a crossroads between the Muslim north and the Christian south, a fact that has led many to believe that the incidents are solely based on religious hatred."
"In our joint motion for a resolution we have called for a wider examination of the root causes of the conflict."
"Coming from Ireland I know that for far too long people spoke of the Northern Ireland conflict as a conflict between Catholics and Protestants, whereas in fact it was a much more nuanced thing than that and there were much more serious issues, including civil rights issues, at the heart of the problem."
"It is imperative that we should avoid simplistic assertions that these atrocious killings are the results of religious hatred alone."
"There are social, political and economic factors that must be considered before we reach conclusions."
"The ethnic rivalry between the Hausa and the Berom people must also be recognised as a factor in the violence."
"The killings are similar in method and consequence to previous clashes in 2001, 2004 and 2008."
"Violence has been used in the past to settle differences and has once again triumphed over dialogue."
"It is extremely disappointing that a country like Nigeria, which is the eighth-largest producer of oil in the world, has such a large proportion of the population living below the poverty line."
"It is only by ensuring peace and security, democracy and political stability, that Nigeria can haul itself out of poverty and create a wealth and social justice which will in turn lead people away from violence as a method of conflict resolution."
"I urge the Commission to continue dialogue with Nigeria under the Cotonou Agreement, to examine the root causes of this conflict and to give every assistance necessary to ensure that these atrocities are not repeated."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, our S&D Group joins Commissioner Rehn in expressing our condolences after the death of the Nigerian President, Umaru Yar'Adua."
"The violence between the Muslim and Christian population in Jos, Nigeria, in January and March this year, shows the tense and explosive state of this region."
"Although the obvious reason seems to lie in the religious dimension, we must also focus on other underlying causes, as my colleague Gay Mitchell rightly pointed out as well."
"Most importantly, the region suffers from scarce resources and the unequal access of different groups to these resources."
"Also, the struggle for fertile farmland is an important root cause for the violent conflicts between Christians and Muslim settlers."
"Indigenous farmers feel threatened by settlers looking for pasture for their livestock."
"We therefore call for a wider examination of the causes of this conflict."
"If nothing is done about the poverty and discrimination, these clashes will continue."
"This means that the whole population needs equal opportunities and equal access to essential goods such as proper education or access to political power."
"A long-term and lasting solution can only be found if all these factors are taken into account."
"We call for a fair and transparent prosecution of the perpetrators of the violence, but we are shocked to hear that local governors are now threatening to execute death row inmates only in order to ease the overcrowding in Nigerian prisons, where people have to wait for years before they even see a judge."
"The Nigerian state governors should do better by addressing the many underlying problems in the criminal justice system."
"Only then can the perpetrators of the violent clashes have a fair and transparent trial."
"Mr President, we have only just learnt of the death of Umaru Yar'Adua."
"On behalf of my group, I too would like to express our condolences following the untimely death of the President of Nigeria."
"His death comes at a time when the division between Muslims and Christians is taking a particularly dreadful turn."
"The 200 Christians killed in the Jos region are the reason for this current resolution."
"We could go over and over this barbarism to note, yet again, that it clearly stems from a religious divide."
"We might also note, yet again, that poverty does not help at all."
"That it is the result, among others, of the political authorities' inability to overcome corruption."
"We might also mention, yet again, the disputes over some scarce natural resources, in particular the fertile land situated in that region, as well as climate change, which also exacerbates the factors that I have just mentioned."
"What can the European Union do in such circumstances?"
"Of course, it can cite Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement to strengthen the dialogue with the political authorities of that country."
"We will do this."
"We can also condemn the atrocities."
"We will do that in the present resolution."
"We can, of course, deplore the fact that this rich country - the leading oil-exporting country in Africa - is unable to invest this wealth to combat poverty."
"In fact, we can do everything it takes; we can condemn all this time and again."
"I think there is a glimmer of hope, and it is Nigeria itself that must lead a movement to get the country back on track."
"The interim President, Goodluck Jonathan, has all the qualities needed to fight the problems that I have just mentioned in a courageous way."
"It is up to the country itself to recover, and I think that people of his calibre are rare."
"We should wish him luck and lucidity and give our support to this extraordinary figure who is the interim president in that country."
"Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would also like to echo the condolences that were just expressed by our fellow Members."
"We support wholeheartedly the resolution on the mass atrocities in Nigeria, which unfortunately represent only one aspect of the bleak human rights picture in that country."
"I would like, in the time I have been allotted, to speak about Nigeria's prisons, which are full of prisoners whose rights are systematically violated."
"As a 2008 report by Amnesty International revealed, 65% of the prisoners in that country have never been found guilty of any crime."
"Some have been waiting to be tried for 10 years."
"The problems are such that Nigeria has no choice but to recognise them and to promise to reform the system."
"We are still waiting for this reform."
"I am focusing my speech on the prisons because the current situation has once again reminded us of just how little value is put on the life of a human being in Nigeria, and even more so in the prisons."
"The National Economic Council of Nigeria has announced its plan to execute hundreds of death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in the prisons: killing to reduce prison overpopulation."
"There is nothing more shocking, especially when it is certain that many of these death-row inmates are innocent and the majority of them did not have the right to a fair trial, and particularly as in February 2009 the Nigerian Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs declared before the UN that his country was applying a de facto moratorium on the death penalty."
"This is why, during the vote, I will table an oral amendment to denounce this recent move by several Nigerian governors."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - (NL) Mr President, I too wish to extend my group's sympathy to the Nigerian people on the death of their president."
"Mr President, the atrocities committed in and around Jos defy description and, sadly, are not isolated incidents."
"They will be repeated in the future unless something is done."
"Violence still erupts almost daily and Christians, in particular, are at the receiving end."
"Nigeria needs to do four things."
"Firstly, without delay, it must open an independent investigation and look into the role of the army, which has patently failed to afford citizens effective protection."
"Secondly, it must bring the perpetrators to justice."
"Dreadful occurrences of this kind cannot be tolerated."
"Thirdly, it must encourage dialogue between the ethnic and religious groups."
"Fourthly, it must seek a solution to the tensions between the various population groups laying claim to the same areas of land."
"Europe must assist Nigeria with these measures, of course, but it must also put pressure on the country, as the spiral of violence absolutely has to be stopped."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would clearly also like to add my condolences to those that have just been expressed to the Nigerian people following the death of their president."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left will not vote in favour of the proposal for a joint resolution that has been put to us today, and it refuses to be associated with it."
"Indeed, we believe that the resolution, contrary to some of the things that I have just heard said, does not really tackle the causes of the recurring violence in that country and addresses them only in part, even though we denounce this violence and in fact demand that its perpetrators be brought to trial."
"Nigeria is a great African country, with a rich secular history, and with its 140 million inhabitants it is by far the most highly populated country in the continent."
"One might even say that it should be a rich country, since oilfields have been discovered there."
"The value of its GDP puts it in second place in Africa, after South Africa and before Algeria."
"However, the majority of its population live below the poverty line, and it is the only oil-rich country in the world with a budget deficit."
"The most ironic thing of all is that Nigeria imports almost all of the oil products its economy needs because of its inadequate refining capacities."
"It should be pointed out that its three main refineries are out of action and, worse still, its oil production has decreased considerably in recent years due to the constant attacks on its oil installations."
"Why is Nigeria in this situation?"
"Because this country is a clear example of the seizure of Africa's resources by some international companies, in this case oil companies, and by one in particular, which exploits 40% of Nigeria's oil, in complicity with some of our governments."
"These companies make and break governments according to their own needs and to the detriment of the needs of the country's population."
"The Niger Delta, the flora and fauna of which were once among the most beautiful in the world, has become a veritable dump."
"This is not just because of oil exploitation, it is also because, each month, 500 containers filled with the most varied toxic waste enter the port and are left in huge open tips."
"Nigeria is one of the most corrupt countries in the world."
"The sponsors of the successive juntas have pocketed more than USD 325 billion of the USD 400 billion that oil has brought the country."
"Where are these dollars?"
"In bank accounts in Switzerland, the United Kingdom and France."
"Personally, I find this situation intolerable and I feel that the resolution that we are adopting is unequal to the challenges that an expression of international solidarity by the European Union towards Africa involves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we know how difficult peaceful coexistence is between the various religious groups in Nigeria, particularly in the relationships between Christians of various faiths and Muslims."
"As the resolution we will be voting on reminds us, the situation is extremely critical: more than 14 000 people have been killed in religious or ethnic conflicts since the end of the military rule in 1999."
"There is talk of over 500 deaths in the past three months."
"Unfortunately, Nigeria is not the only country where there are conflicts and tensions between religious groups."
"It would therefore be desirable to draw up a yearly European Parliament report on religious freedom in the world which responds in a structured way to a problem that is crucial to the stability of many countries."
"I would like to make reference to a statement by Commissioner Rehn, whom I personally esteem, who said that Nigeria is a very poor country: that is not true, Nigeria is a very rich country but it is afflicted by a corrupt and inept ruling class that has plundered the country's resources leaving millions of citizens impoverished."
"Hence this is the true problem, and social and economic renewal in this country, as in many other African countries, depends on having a new ruling class that is conscientious towards the citizens' needs."
"(DE) Mr President, after the forthcoming Football World Cup in South Africa the spotlight of our African policy will once again fall on Nigeria."
"It is a large, wealthy country with huge social inequalities."
"Of course, it also finds itself caught up in the conflict between the Chinese route and the European route towards globalisation."
"I am firmly convinced that we must stay on the European route, which means opposing abuses and violations of human rights and making those people who have been imprisoned into our partners, rather than the corrupt leaders of certain cliques and groups in government which offer us short-term benefits."
"In this case we must support the resolution and also what Mrs Vergiat has said."
"It does go far enough, but it is important that the EU stands for human rights."
"We must not tolerate what China is intending to do in Nigeria and its disregard for human rights."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, violence does not resolve conflicts; it only increases their tragic consequences."
"Beyond being wrong, immoral, unjust and inhumane, violence is not worthwhile: it is not advantageous."
"It is the least effective manner for finding a solution to the problems that affect an entire region because, if the element that provokes the violence between the Christian minority and the Muslims is not only religious fundamentalism, but a lack of economic development, which gives rise to resentment and tension between the various ethnic groups, then what the European Union, together with the African Union and the entire international community must make the federal government in Nigeria (which is responsible for many facets of this situation) understand, is that favouring the civilised and peaceful coexistence between the various ethnicities and groups in the country is an advantageous factor for everyone and for the entire population."
"Beyond the implementation of a suitable investigation system, as many have requested, and the repression of those responsible for the appalling bloodshed of the past months - I would dare say of the past years - it requires that every possible initiative is made to support interethnic and interfaith dialogue on one side, and on the other, as many have suggested, to form a new ruling class."
"With this resolution we hope to definitively make it understood that the solution to conflicts, especially for a country as rich in raw materials - especially oil - as Nigeria, would mean improving access to the resources and distributing them better, and I believe that the agreement signed on 12 December 2009 between the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the European Commission can give a good push in this direction."
"Today, therefore, security lies at the heart of the uncountable problems in this country, and the primary threat is not the conflict itself but the reasons that created and generated the conflict: that is where action is needed in order to help Nigeria on its way towards true economic and democratic development."
"(RO) I too wish to join those who have expressed their condolences to the Nigerian people whose president died last night."
"Unfortunately, as a result of this, we have a new risk factor added to the already existing tensions: the loss of a centre of authority in a country severely affected by violence."
"As you are aware, at the beginning of this year, more than 300 Muslims were massacred."
"Not even two months later, a similar number of Christians were murdered in just two hours."
"At the moment, only the army's presence in the streets is delaying the plans of some Christians and Muslims for taking revenge."
"In my view, the main problem just now is how to maintain order so as to prevent any new atrocities."
"With this in mind, I think that an international presence is needed."
"Secondly, we have the problem of impunity, which also applies in general in Africa's conflict zones."
"As soon as an ever-increasing number of mass criminals are arrested and convicted, we will see a drop in the level of violence."
"The international community needs to be specifically involved once again."
"It has proved to be sensitive to the problems in the Balkans and Middle East, but turns a blind eye to the sufferings of Africa."
"- Mr President, as a boy I remember vividly seeing on television the pictures of the horrific civil war in the Nigerian region of Biafra."
"Forty years on, sadly, little seems to have changed."
"The sickening images from Jos, where hundreds of innocent people were hacked to death in an act of savagery, remind us that Nigeria is a chronically unstable country."
"Ethnic, religious, particularly Christian versus Muslim, tribal, cultural and economic tensions appear to be endemic in Nigeria."
"The current uncertainty following the death yesterday of the President - I send my condolences to the Nigerian people - will inevitably result in a power struggle and this will follow on to compound the instability in that large Africa country."
"I am therefore worried about the long-term sustainability of Nigeria as a unitary state."
"Some, including the maverick President Gaddafi of Libya, have controversially suggested that Nigeria should be split into two."
"Certainly Sudan, another country divided between a Muslim north and a Christian South, looks probably set to separate into two parts next year."
"That likely division will set a precedent that colonial boundaries in Africa are no longer sacrosanct, which raises many interesting questions for the future of Africa."
"- Mr President, the horrific massacre in Plateau State in Nigeria in January and March has left hundreds of innocent victims and especially very many women and children."
"Although sectarian and tribal divisions are factors in this and other horrific massacres, we have to look deeper for the real causes."
"Past colonial interference and brutal conquest in Africa, often exploiting communal and tribal divisions, have left a lasting legacy."
"The BBC's news analysis recently declared that, although the violence is between Muslim and Christian, analysts say underlying causes are political and economic, referring to the dire poverty of the masses of the Nigerian people and the outright corruption of the ruling elites."
"Nigeria is one of the most gifted countries on earth in terms of natural and mineral resources, including oil."
"Unfortunately the corrupt local elites and foreign multinationals, including Shell Oil, take the lion's share of this wealth, leaving a huge swathe of the Nigerian people living in abject poverty."
"I stand with my colleagues form the Democratic Socialist movement in Nigeria who demand that the wealth of Nigeria is taken into public ownership and democratic control of the majority of the population, workers and poor."
"On the basis of this wealth it is entirely possible to build a decent life for all the people of Nigeria and on that basis also overcome the communal divisions."
"The alternative is indeed a break-up of Nigeria and further barbaric horrors inflicted on the people."
"(PL) Mr President, Nigeria is an important country - a very important country."
"This is why we are taking an interest in what happened on 7 March near the city of Jos."
"The problem in Central Nigeria is not only that the people who are being killed there are Christians, because in January this year it was Muslims who were killed."
"In Nigeria's case, religious divisions are compounded by a number of other divisions, and some of these have already been mentioned: economic, ethnic and social."
"However, there are also two other kinds of division: historical - because in that part of the country Christians are considered as locals, and Muslims as outsiders, despite the fact that they have lived there for two or three generations - and even political differences."
"As a rule, Christians support the ruling People's Democratic Party, and Muslims usually support the opposition All Nigeria People's Party."
"So there are very many differences and we must not treat these events as clear examples of religious persecution."
"The Nigerian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion: freedom of confession, freedom of worship and the right to change one's religion."
"You may think my reference to the Nigerian Constitution is a naive approach, but I would like to remind everyone that the values stemming from the oldest written constitution - the American Constitution - and from the oldest written constitution in Europe - the Polish Constitution - are values which are still relevant and of lasting value."
"Therefore, we call upon the Federal Government of Nigeria, as well as governors and local authorities, to solve this problem, not only in the name of our values, but in the name of the values and principles written in their own constitution."
"I think it is important to refer to their own documents."
"- Mr President, I would like to express my deep regret at the violence that broke out in the area of Jos and caused the deaths of several hundred people."
"This has been just another example of the importance of the reconciliation process that has to be enacted to enable peaceful coexistence between the northern Muslim population and the southern Christian population."
"I would like to let you know that, in large part, the atrocities take place because of the hardships and the oppression of those inhabitants that live in the oil-rich areas and do not benefit from the overall development of the country."
"We urge the Nigerian authorities to make sure that more equitable and democratic development of all social groups in the country is ensured and that basic human rights are protected and enforced."
"Finally, especially today, my sympathy goes to the Nigerian people on the death of their President."
"(RO) I too wish to join those who have expressed their condolences to the Nigerian people following the death of President Umaru Yar'Adua."
"I would like to raise two points in my speech."
"First of all, I would like to start with a point made by an inhabitant of Nigeria who was asked what the cause of the evil in this country was."
"He said quite clearly: 'we see people guilty of atrocities and crimes being charged and then,' he continued, 'they disappear to the capital and we never see them again'."
"In other words, there is never any sign of public accountability for the crimes committed."
"Secondly, I would like to stress that we must bear in mind the religious aspect to the conflict."
"Several speakers so far have seemed to say that there is a religious aspect, but that everything is basically to do with social and economic matters."
"In fact, Acting President Jonathan Goodluck has taken this aspect into consideration and invited religious leaders to a dialogue."
"We must support him on this."
"(PL) Mr President, the images which we saw not very long ago in different television broadcasts were shocking."
"The scenes of what looked like a victorious display of people who had been murdered in and around Jos were shocking."
"As Mr Mauro has said, no justification can be found for violence, because violence is, of itself, an evil."
"As European society and as Members of the European Parliament, we must not ignore what has happened."
"This is why I wholeheartedly support the resolution."
"Irrespective of the causes which lie at the root of the conflict and which are being seen as the background of the violence, we want to react so that human rights and civic freedoms will be respected in Nigeria, a country which is, after all, dear to us."
"I would also like to take the opportunity to express my condolences to the Nigerian people in connection with the death of the president."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you for a very serious and responsible debate today."
"Many of you have highlighted the complexity of societal problems in Nigeria."
"I agree with you, and the Commission is aware of the complexity of these problems."
"We continue our committed partnership with Nigeria, and I can only agree with you on how important it is to fight corruption and impunity, because corruption is unfortunately deeply rooted and hinders societal progress and the democratic process in this resource-rich country, and thus damages the lives of ordinary people."
"We actively give strong and constructive support to Nigeria."
"We use a wide array of instruments from diplomacy to development and the Commission remains attentive and committed to containing the violence in Nigeria with the diplomatic means we have at our disposal."
"The next forum to address this very important issue at a high level is the EU-Nigeria ministerial meeting in the autumn, and we shall certainly discuss this matter on that occasion."
"To conclude the debate, I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 110(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"For too many years now this land, which has so many natural resources, has been the scene of just as many humanitarian tragedies, mass killings and inter-ethnic clashes occurring for economic and social reasons."
"I would just like to recall, however, the words of a Catholic missionary who has lived and worked in Nigeria: Father Piero Gheddo recently pointed out that, only 20 years ago, relations between Muslims and Christians in the central and northern areas of Nigeria were undoubtedly difficult and characterised by forms of anti-Christian discrimination, but that it never reached the stage where there was the mass violence that we have seen over the last decade."
"However, the priest made it clear that, although the situation has worsened in recent years, it is also because the influence of Islamic extremism as expressed by the ideology of Al-Qaida has spread to Nigeria, and in particular to 12 states in the north that have adopted sharia as the law of the land."
"We therefore agree that the various ethnic groups in Nigeria find in their different religious faiths the ideal pretext for perpetrating acts of mass violence against one another."
"Let us remember, however, that the densely populated African state, which for years has also been the victim of ongoing political instability, has played host over the years to a wave of Islamic extremism that we must not ignore."
"If the supreme value of the European Union is to be the right to self-determination, in other words the right to respect the principles and values of one's own conscience, then all manifestations of intolerance and hatred, which lead directly to murders and massacres motivated by race, ethnic origin or religion, should be met with our immediate and unequivocal condemnation."
"However, this condemnation should not be limited just to words."
"It should include action which will guarantee peaceful coexistence in the future."
"Mr President, at the outset I would like to express my profound sadness at the information about the disturbances in Jos, in Nigeria, in January and March, in which hundreds of Christians and Muslims died."
"It should be remembered that this is not the first time such terrible events have taken place in Jos."
"The fighting between adherents of these two religions has been going on since 2001."
"The fact that the tension, which from time to time turns into open clashes, has lasted for a decade now is confirmation of the important role to be played by the state in promoting reconciliation processes."
"The complicated background to the conflict shows the depth of the divisions involved."
"Nigerian Christians and Nigerian Muslims differ not only with respect to religion."
"On top of this basic division lies a historical division, because in the region where the disturbances are taking place the Christians are considered to be local people and the Muslims are thought of as strangers."
"These two divisions translate into support by Christians and Muslims for different political groups, which is, as it were, an extension of the conflict."
"However, to cut a long story short, the sources of the conflict are religious differences and the incompetence of the authorities or their inability to bring about peaceful existence between the two groups."
"This autumn an EU-Nigeria ministerial form is to be held, and I think this problem should be on the agenda of the meeting."
"In addition, the Commission should make every effort to use the diplomatic instruments at its disposal to improve the situation in Nigeria."

"(FR) Mr President, as I indicated during the debate, I propose adding the following oral amendment to paragraph 6: 'Calls on the Nigerian authorities to reverse the recent move by some Nigerian state governors to execute death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in prisons, which would constitute a gross violation of human rights; calls on the state governors to exercise restraint and continue the de facto moratorium; recalls that the use of the death penalty is contrary to Nigeria's commitments at international level'."
"(PL) Mr President, the amendment is about making questions of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief the subject of dialogue between the European Union and Nigeria, in the context - and these are the additional words - of political dialogue based on the Cotonou Agreement."
"Voting time"
"Explanations of vote"
"- Let us proceed to the explanations of votes."
"- (ET) Following repeated demands from Parliament, the Commission has submitted a regulation on the financing of security fees."
"I supported the adoption of this legal act because it is important for all passengers that firm, transparent principles are followed in determining security fees."
"The consumer needs to be sure that revenue obtained from security fees is used exclusively for covering security expenses."
"- (SK) In my opinion, it is right for the European Commission and the European Parliament to be involved in regulating charges for passenger safety and protection in air transport."
"However, I have to say that I consider the current approach of establishing bodies to perform such controls to be nonsensical and incorrect."
"At a time when Europe needs money to help Greece, and at a time when Europe needs money for economic development, establishing new bodies that will do practically nothing beyond some kind of supervision is playing fast and loose with EU citizens' money, and I believe that it will not produce a successful result."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at being able to vote in favour of extending the force of the regulation as it concerns spare parts for cars, in terms of access of car users both to certified and uncertified parts."
"We have done this at the last minute, but we have responded to the needs of our citizens."
"We are guaranteeing good quality parts at reasonable prices."
"(IT) Mr President, yesterday we did well to finish the first reading of the recast dossier for the TEN-T networks."
"However, there is a very important aspect of this recast, this codification, that relates to all of the restructuring of TEN-T networks over the next decade."
"This restructuring must be completely rethought, simplified and rationalised within Europe in such a way that interoperability is truly implemented."
"Then, considering the current unfavourable economic situation we are living in, we have to think about the development of this network, or part of it, and not only with the budget resources that we have available."
"We must come up with a new path and work to pick the economy back up through these networks."
"Hence it is more urgent than ever that over and above the step taken yesterday, we try to work in this direction."
"(ET) I voted in favour of the amendment to this legal act, because it will help us meet the objectives agreed upon in the context of the European Economic Recovery Plan adopted in 2008."
"I think that the simplification of financing will speed up cofinancing investments in the Member States and the regions, and will increase the effect that the measures have on the economy as a whole, though mainly on medium-sized entrepreneurs and employers."
"The simplification of the rules for the Cohesion Policy, arising from practical needs, and their clarification, will certainly have a positive effect on the speed of implementation of the plan and on our handling of new problems."
"(LT) Many countries have been badly shaken by this economic downturn and the decline of the economies of many of the European Union Member States has exceeded 10%."
"Therefore, the European Union's attention is very important not only for the old European Union Member States, but also for those that have recently joined the European Union and that are benefiting from support from the Structural Funds and the European Social Fund."
"The Structural Funds are an important instrument that can help those Member States that have experienced a severe economic downturn recover."
"Therefore, once the requirements for obtaining Structural Funds have been simplified, I believe it will be possible to do this more effectively."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund have demonstrated that they are valid instruments and are very useful in territorial development and for responding to the consequences of the economic crisis that has been raging in Europe and the world for some time."
"In relation to that, I welcome the proposal to simplify the procedures for decommitment of funding and to facilitate payments to the beneficiaries of the various programmes implemented with the funds I mentioned."
"I am, furthermore, in favour of the provision for an additional pre-financing instalment for 2010 for those Member States that have been worst hit by the economic crisis."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of Mr Szájer's report and I would like to thank him for the excellent analytical work he performed in light of the innovations introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Considering the extensive and multiple implications that delegated acts will have in the legislative procedure, I particularly agree with Parliament's desire to make those delegated acts subject to well specified and clear conditions, in order to guarantee effective democratic control by this House."
"I believe that, above all, it will also be necessary to verify in practice how that new system will function, in order to make any necessary adjustments."
"- Mr President, I should just like to say that I fully support this report, which is about animal welfare."
"However, I have some reservations about how this Parliament and the EU legislate on this matter."
"I would prefer that we had a science-based approach to animal welfare rather than one driven by emotion."
"We have brought in legislation which, in many cases, is not scientifically based, and we are placing European producers, European farmers, at a huge disadvantage."
"Can I add my distress and disgust at the fact that this week the Commission has decided to reopen talks with the Mercosur countries."
"By that decision they are placing at risk the future of Europe's farmers, specifically beef, poultry-meat and pig producers."
"I would ask the Commission whether it is going to apply the same animal-welfare standards and production standards to imported products from third countries as it enforces within the European Union."
"If they do not, we are a disgrace."
"(DE) Mr President, animal welfare is indivisible."
"It must be standardised and we need a global definition of it."
"On the subject of standardisation, we should take a break from introducing new regulations and standards and, first of all, make sure that we are applying the existing regulations in a uniform way within the European Union."
"As far as globalisation is concerned, we must make a greater effort to ensure that the same standards and guidelines apply to imports to the European Union from third countries as apply within the European Union itself."
"Consumers have a right to buy not only healthy food, but also food which has been produced healthily."
"Mr President, lest I forget, I do have a visitors' group in the gallery, and I would like to welcome them from the Ireland-East constituency."
"I think it is very important that our visitors and citizens see how this Parliament works and, as you can see, they are awake and interested this morning!"
"On this particular report, the Le Foll report, this Chamber hosted one of the Beatles recently telling us that we should eat less meat."
"Well, I think that what we need to do in relation to agriculture and climate change is to use the best available technologies to reduce the emissions which come from agriculture, because we all know that we need to produce more food globally rather than less."
"We will need to do that with fewer resources, less soil, less water and with the pressures of climate change, and what we need is the best possible research;"
"I believe it needs to be publicly funded and with private partnerships, so that our farmers and food industry can produce food in a climate-friendly way."
"Mrs McGuinness, thank you, and many greetings to your visitors' group."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make three brief remarks about the report."
"Firstly, agriculture is not the problem in the case of climate change, it is the solution."
"Secondly, we are in the early stages of our research into climate change, despite the fact that the media sometimes give the opposite impression."
"In the course of our climate research we should also take into consideration and follow up theories and results which are not part of mainstream thinking."
"Thirdly, we should take all the necessary and appropriate measures that do not involve additional red tape and we should make sure that these measures are effective in economic terms."
"For example, against this background a European framework directive on the protection of soil is counterproductive and will not bring the desired results."
"- Mr President, I hope everybody in the visitors' gallery is impressed!"
"I have to say it is unusual for us to get so much speaking time but these reports are of particular concern to me in the agriculture and food production area."
"This report is about how we manage to keep farmers in areas where land and conditions are extremely difficult because we know that farmers are the best managers of the landscape, but they do need money to survive in these areas."
"The concern I would have is that the eight biophysical criteria proposed by the Commission might be too restrictive when they are adopted."
"We need to take account of different soil conditions across the European Union."
"In my own Member State, Ireland, there are concerns that, if we apply these criteria in the Atlantic region, there could be problems for farmers who live in that area."
"I want to ask the Commission to take into account these concerns when they prepare their legislative text."
"The Commission has said that farmers manage the landscape better and more cheaply than any other option we have, so let us make sure they are allowed to survive in these regions."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution on the new Digital Agenda for Europe because I believe that guaranteeing easy and affordable broadband access to the entire population is a strategic priority for the European Union."
"Extending Internet use means broadening and developing citizens' freedom of expression, favouring their participation in democratic life and permitting the dissemination of knowledge and innovations."
"What I would like to highlight is that the spread of broadband in Europe would guarantee broader freedom of information."
"As noted by Eurostat, we must not forget that Europe also has two or possibly three speeds as regards the spread of the Internet."
"Italy, especially in some regions, as well as Greece, Romania, Bulgaria and Portugal, are the least developed States in this sense."
"It is no accident that in the Freedom of the Press index for 2009 drawn up by Freedom House, Italy was listed among the partially free states, in last place in western Europe together with Turkey, and 72nd in the world together with Benin and India and preceded by Tonga."
"I also hope that thanks to these resolutions and the principles that have been mentioned, the Italian Government will decide to release the investment of EUR 800 million as soon as possible which was intended to break down the digital divide in Italy and which, according to a statement by Gianni Letta, the Deputy Secretary to the Italian Council of Ministers, is not a priority at the moment."
"I would like to emphasise that the quality of the service in Italy is inadequate for current needs and that for years consumer associations have been complaining that the access costs are among the least competitive in Europe."
"For your information for next time, we have only one minute for the explanations of vote."
"I give the floor to our best speaker today, and that is Mrs McGuinness."
"- Mr President, thank you for the endorsement."
"I should say to our visitors that we normally ask for silence but I think we are being lenient today, and I thank Mr Higgins for giving me the opportunity to speak."
"I have spoken about this already and I feel that this Parliament did not realise yesterday, in the Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra report, the implications of supporting that, which I did not do."
"I am most concerned about the decision to reopen bilateral talks with the Mercosur countries on two different levels."
"First of all, it is in advance of the potential reopening of world trade talks, and the bilateral deal may be worse than that at WTO level."
"But secondly - and they are linked - there are real concerns about the selling-out on agriculture in the European Union."
"These are not just my own concerns driven from an emotional basis: the Commission itself has said that there are severe implications for European agriculture if we do a deal in these talks with Mercosur."
"Again, the beef sector, the poultry sector and the pigmeat sector will be most affected."
"I could not support this report on that basis, and I warn colleagues about its implications."
"(IT) Commissioner, water is an asset for everyone and it cannot be an asset for only a select few."
"That is what we, the Italian IDV (Italy of Values) delegation of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, wanted to affirm in relation to Amendment 10, which opposed any attempt to privatise the water distribution systems, as this is part of the overall economic and trade agreement, and conversely we declared our support for the Canadian communities which are committed to stopping the privatisation of water."
"The Italian IDV delegation felt the need to vote in favour of the text because it represents our values, the values that lead us to affirm the necessary indissoluble public nature of water usage."
"That is why I would like to repeat that in recent days we have proposed a signed petition for a public referendum against the privatisation of water and we are receiving a great deal of support in our country."
"Welcome"
"- Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to inform you that, within the framework of the inter-parliamentary sessions, a delegation from the Moroccan Parliament, led by the Speaker of the Parliament, Mr Abdel Wahid Al-Radi, and the President of the Chamber of Councillors, Mr Mohamed Sheikh Biadillah, is currently on a working visit to the European Parliament, the aim of which is the inaugural meeting of the EU-Morocco Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"I would like to extend a very warm welcome to all members of this delegation."
"The co-presidents of this first joint body between our assembly and one of the Maghreb countries are Mrs Mbarka Bouaida, Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, National Defence and Islamic Affairs, and Mr Panzeri, Member of the European Parliament."
"The European Parliament is delighted to state that relations between the EU and Morocco are excellent, as evidenced by the adoption of the joint document establishing the advanced status of Morocco."
"This new framework for dialogue further strengthens relations with the delegations of the European Parliament for relations with the Maghreb countries, and makes it possible to broaden talks between the EU and Morocco on matters of common interest."
"I hope and trust that the meeting which took place in the European Parliament was fruitful and that it will actively contribute towards bringing the two parliaments closer together."
"Explanations of vote (continuation)"
"- (HU) I would like to see the ban on the use of cyanide in mining extended throughout the European Union."
"I would like us to be able to eliminate these technologies altogether in the future, in order to prevent further serious natural disasters, where various toxic materials enter our water sources."
"There has been such a case in Hungary, where almost all life in the river Tisza died out 10 years ago."
"Slovakia is also affected in this issue as the accident occurred near the border, and it intends to open mines in the near future where the same technology would be used for gold mining."
"This and similar issues are not disputes between two EU countries; it is our common interest to have a more sustainable environmental policy."
"This is why I voted in favour, this is why I would like to join the supporters of this measure."
"(IT) Mr President, we are about to proceed with the ban on the use of cyanide mining technologies, because - as my fellow Members mentioned a short time ago - they have caused and continue to cause severe environmental effects and they pose critical dangers to human and animal health."
"Our vote was intended to express the clear desire of the Italian IDV (Italy of Values) delegation of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe not to negotiate fundamental rights like the health of citizens and the natural environment by subjecting them to the economic interests of a few system manufacturers."
"On this point, let me say that since this deals with systems for mining gold and certainly not potatoes, the proprietor companies could easily allocate adequate economic and financial resources to researching technologies that are compatible with the environment and health safety."
"(RO) I wish to thank almost 500 of our fellow Members who voted overwhelmingly yesterday against the use of cyanide technologies in mining."
"The word 'cyanide' is synonymous with 'death'."
"This outright vote will do us Romanians, in particular, a big favour."
"One of the largest natural fields in the world is located in Transylvania."
"Experts estimate that it contains 300 tonnes of high purity uranium, 800 tonnes of gold and 2 000 tonnes of silver, not to mention huge quantities of other precious metals and elements."
"Greedy mafia gangs, both local and cross-border, are prowling around these treasures, continually increasing the aggressive tone of their propaganda, full of the most ridiculous lies."
"The use of cyanide technologies would have caused a huge disaster by poisoning the environment, resulting in four mountains being blown up, nine cemeteries being destroyed and eight Christian churches being demolished."
"This is without mentioning the disappearance of 1 700 km of Roman galleries, with the ruins of the Roman citadel Alburnus Maior being wiped off the face of the earth, an archaeological gem described by UNESCO as a unique cultural heritage site in the world."
"Europe has had enough of one Chernobyl and does not need another one."
"(RO) I voted against the motion for a resolution yesterday because I was asked to do so by the local communities which regard this ban as a threat to the area's development."
"In fact, I believe that the amendment suggested by me and more than 40 of my fellow Members, which called for a study to be carried out to clarify the impact issue, would have been an honourable and reasonable gesture."
"Otherwise, the passions expressed here have only served to destroy certain communities' chance of development."
"- Mr President, may I ask you why so many Members are allowed to speak loudly and rudely in private conversations when other Members are trying to express themselves?"
"(Applause)"
"I abstained on the resolution on Kyrgyzstan."
"Five years ago the people of Kyrgyzstan mobilised for the Tulip Revolution against the corrupt regime and for a better life for themselves."
"The Bakiyev government that came to power unfortunately dismally betrayed the hopes of a better life for the masses, instituting a corrupt and authoritarian regime."
"The new government is made up, unfortunately, of cronies of Bakiyev and has no credence in terms of a new life for the people of the region."
"I support my fellow socialists from the Committee for Workers International in the region who call for elections to a new parliament but make clear that nothing will change unless workers and the rural masses have their own candidates and independent working class party to reverse the disastrous privatisations of the last 20 years, to tackle neoliberal capitalism and to institute real democratic change and new institutions controlled by working people and with genuine planning of the economy and a Socialist Federation of Central Asia."
"- (LT) I am very pleased that this document was adopted by a large majority, that is to say there was hardly any opposition to it."
"This in itself is quite understandable since health affects all of us and those closest to us."
"I also congratulate the European Parliament and all citizens of the European Union as well as the rapporteur for taking such decisions today that should advance more specific and targeted actions not only to cure those suffering from cancer, but also to ensure the prevention of cancer."
"Unfortunately, the prognosis in terms of cancer is really terrifying, and we must concentrate our efforts to overcome it."
"I voted for the adoption of this document, because I believe that an integrated view of cancer cases and fighting them should be regarded as particularly important as part of the health strategy of both the European Community and Member States."
"Collective and coordinated work by Member States is required to reduce the risk in the area of cancer cases."
"- (SK) The report on measures to combat cancer talks about the importance of prevention in the fight against this disease."
"We know that early diagnosis of this disease will increase the chances of a successful cure."
"The incidence of some kinds of cancer can be predicted by genetic predisposition, lifestyle and so on. In my opinion, therefore, more extensive screening could be the first effective and rapid step towards preventing many deaths."
"A further important step would be the transfer and dissemination of successful methods of treatment to all countries of the European Union, including centres with less experience in the treatment of cancer, in order to improve the provision of effective treatment."
"In any case, however, we must applaud the work of Mr Peterle in the hope that the EU will take more extensive measures in the fight against this disease."
"(IT) Mr President I would like to express my appreciation of the work carried out by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Peterle."
"This development of a partnership in the battle against cancer, on a subject as sensitive as that which we faced, honours Parliament as a whole."
"According to data from the World Health Organisation, around 2 million European citizens die every year from a tumour and in around 10% of the cases it was caused by being exposed to carcinogenic substances at work."
"I am convinced that the goal of reducing new cases by 15% by 2020 should also be pursued through joint action with the Member States."
"Europe must demonstrate that it is united in this area as well."
"In my opinion Article 66, which can guarantee the availability of medicines to everyone in every country, responds to this fundamental principle."
"Mr President, that is why I voted in favour of the report."
"- (HU) Ladies and gentlemen, in the past years we have seen an explosive development of information and communication technologies."
"The significant development and results seen in the ICT sector contributed to the development of other, previously stagnating sectors, such as mechatronics, nanotechnology, control and measurement technology."
"Therefore the initiative of the Commission to use ICT to meet EU 2020 goals should be applauded."
"I welcome the fact that we accepted this programme and I am glad that I, too, was able to vote for it."
"It is vital that we meet our planned targets by 2020, that is, we decrease carbon dioxide emissions and increase energy efficiency."
"The information and communication technology sector may be of strategic importance in the energy saving programme of the European Union and in increasing the competitiveness of European industry."
"However, in order to achieve it, support is needed for the standardisation of measuring devices as soon as possible, for starting research projects, and for passing a package of measures aimed at decreasing consumption and improving production and service supply management."
"(IT) Mr President, I voted for and support the valuable work presented by Mr Prodi, in conclusion of the significant work carried out by the European Commission."
"I represent southern Italy, which is located in the south of Europe in the Mediterranean basin."
"Our people have put their faith in us and deserve not to find themselves unprepared for the effects of climate change in our regions and our countryside, which depends primarily on agriculture, fishing and tourism and is largely made up of more vulnerable communities and social groups."
"Hence I believe that solidarity among the different States and areas is fundamental, not least in the response to this new strategy that we are putting into action."
"Obviously it is very difficult to speak with all this confusion; in any case I am finishing."
"I applaud the implementation of the Solidarity Fund instrument, for which I am the rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), as additional support for a prompt and effective answer to the effects of climate change."
"It really is impossible to speak."
"- Mr President, I support the Commission's white paper and the report by Mr Prodi."
"I think that such a white paper is especially needed in the aftermath of the Copenhagen climate change talks."
"The results that we saw in Copenhagen are definitely not enough."
"The non-binding document that was agreed in Copenhagen to halt global warming at +2°C would still mean a warming scenario for Europe, something that would be marked by extreme regional climate changes."
"We need to pay special attention to the way we produce our energy."
"We need to make stronger efforts to set up a tangible common energy policy."
"We must support research into environmentally friendly technologies, but also set up clear policy frameworks on how renewable-energy technologies can be introduced and mainstreamed in our economies."
"I hope this white paper will push the EU in the right direction and will result in some tangible policy action."
"(DE) Mr President, I support the motion which Mr Prodi has tabled today."
"However, the amendment to this report tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and, in particular, by Mr Seeber, which has unfortunately been adopted by plenary, seems to me to be more questionable."
"I am concerned that the conservatives are using this method to reintroduce nuclear power by the back door."
"Promoting low-carbon energy sources is a well-known argument used by the nuclear lobby."
"I would like to emphasise the fact that the Prodi report is definitely going in a different direction."
"As an Austrian, I do not regard nuclear power as renewable energy."
"It is very important for me to make it clear that I have not voted in favour of this paragraph today."
"Formal sitting"
"- Mr Vice President, Excellencies, dear colleagues, dear friends, it is a great privilege for me to welcome to the European Parliament Mr Joseph Biden, the 47th Vice President of the United States."
"(Applause)"
"Vice President Biden has been a key figure in American politics and a friend to colleagues in this Chamber for many years."
"He was first elected to the US Senate in 1972, serving as one of the youngest senators in his country's history."
"He was elected six times before becoming Vice President of the United States in November 2008."
"A former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, he is known to speak his mind, sometimes to defend causes which are far from popular at the time."
"He leads opinion; he does not follow opinion."
"This is one reason why your speech at the European Parliament today, Mr Vice President, is so important, so crucial, for all of us."
"Let me thank you once again for the very warm invitation and the very constructive and fruitful discussions last Wednesday in Washington."
"Dear colleagues, in today's multilateral, multipolar world, Europe and America can and should work together in a partnership for global stability and the enlightened values in which we believe."
"Vice President Biden's visit to the European Union today demonstrates this commitment."
"Without a strong and effective transatlantic partnership as equal partners - the United States and the European Union - we cannot find lasting solutions to the many challenges we face: climate change, energy security, the economic crisis still hitting all of us, terrorism, or promoting human rights, defending free trade and improving global governance."
"Colleagues, 25 years ago, almost to the day, President Ronald Reagan addressed this Parliament, on 8 May 1985."
"This was the last and so far the only time that a US President has spoken to the democratically elected representatives of the people of Europe."
"Your presence in this Chamber today, Mr Vice President, is a symbol of the renewal of that dialogue at the highest level between our two continents."
"Here in Europe we have a new Treaty, which gives us in the European Parliament new strength and the possibility to act and which is so important for the whole of the European Union."
"In America, after one year under President Obama's leadership, there is new hope for the world."
"Mr Vice President, the timing of your address could not be better."
"Mr Vice President, it is a great pleasure to welcome you here this afternoon to Europe's Parliament."
"The floor is yours."
"(Applause)"
"Vice President of the United States of America. - Mr President, thank you for that welcome."
"It was a delight to have you in Washington and at the White House, and it is a great honour - and, I might add, a privilege - to be able to address such an esteemed body."
"I served in a parliament that only had 435 members total; this is even a greater honour."
"I remember President Reagan's speech here in 1985, and to quote an Irish poet - William Butler Yeats - speaking of his Ireland, in a poem called Easter Sunday 1916 he said: 'All's changed, changed utterly; a terrible beauty has been born'."
"Much has changed since 1985, much has changed, and a terrible beauty has been born."
"As you already know, ladies and gentlemen, not only am I pleased to be back here in Brussels for the second time as Vice President, as you probably know, some American politicians and American journalists refer to Washington DC as the capital of the free world."
"But it seems to me that in this great city, which boasts one thousand years of history and which serves as the capital of Belgium, the home of the European Union and the headquarters for NATO, this city has its own legitimate claim to that title."
"As a lawmaker for more than 36 years in our parliament, I feel particularly honoured to address the European Parliament."
"President Obama and I were the first running mates in the last 50 years in America to make it to the White House from our legislative bodies, so we both come to our executive jobs with a deep appreciation for the work you do here in the bastion of European democracy."
"Together with my former colleagues in the United States Congress, you and I represent more than 800 million people."
"Stop and think about that for a moment."
"Two elected bodies that shape the laws for almost one eighth of the planet's population: that is truly remarkable."
"Now, under the Lisbon Treaty, you have taken on more powers and a broader responsibility that comes with that increased influence, and we welcome it."
"We welcome that because we, the United States, need strong allies and alliances to help us tackle the problems of the 21st century, many which are the same - but so many are different - than the last century."
"Let me state it as plainly as I can."
"The Obama/Biden administration has no doubt about the need for, and strongly supports, a vibrant European Union."
"We believe it is absolutely essential to American prosperity and long-term security."
"So have no doubt about that."
"When I chaired the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee for all those years, I had the opportunity to meet many European lawmakers from the national legislative bodies, including some of you who are in this room today."
"So I appreciate, after all those years, what a consequential step it has been to build the only multinational parliament in the world elected by universal suffrage."
"So much has changed."
"I am pleased that, through the Transatlantic Legislative Dialogue, you are building a strong relationship with the United States Congress, and I hope that the office you opened in Washington last month is going to enhance those ties."
"Folks, 65 years ago this week, less than 200 km south of here, Nazi leaders signed an unconditional surrender that brought an end to the Second World War in Europe."
"The next day, celebrations erupted in Times Square and Piccadilly Circus; cheering crowds danced along the Champs-Elysées and the town squares throughout the allied world."
"Here in Brussels, at a thanksgiving service, churchgoers sang the national anthems of Britain, Belgium and the United States."
"On that joyous day, 8 May 1945, this continent lay in ruins, ravaged twice by total wars in less than 30 years."
"At that moment, a peaceful United Europe, a European Parliament, must have seemed like a fantasy to anyone alive."
"Yet, through the will of your fellow citizens and statesmen like Paul-Henri Spaak, for whom this great hall is named, and Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet, and the visions that gave birth to a parliament and earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Lyndon Johnson, here we are: assembled in this hall."
"Here you are."
"What began as a simple pact among a half a dozen nations to create a common market for coal and steel grew into an economic and political powerhouse."
"A Community dedicated to free thought, free movement and free enterprise."
"A Europe that one historian has called 'Not so much a place but an idea'."
"I am here to reaffirm that President Obama and I believe in this idea, and in a better world and a better Europe it has already helped to bring about."
"A Europe where all Member States benefit by negotiating trade agreements and fighting environmental degradation with one unified voice; a Europe that bolsters the cultural and political values that my country shares with all of you."
"A Europe that is whole, a Europe that is free and a Europe that is at peace."
"(Applause)"
"As President Obama said in Prague a little more than a year ago, a strong Europe makes a stronger partner for the United States - and we need strong partners."
"That is why we will do everything we can to support this great endeavour of yours."
"Because the past 65 years have shown that, when Americans and Europeans devote their energies to common purpose, there is almost nothing we are unable to accomplish."
"Together, through the Marshall Plan, we rebuilt Europe and made perhaps the greatest investment in human history."
"Together we built the world's most enduring security alliance, NATO, and a military and political force that tied America and Europe and brought us even closer in the ensuing decades."
"Together we established the greatest commercial relationship in the world's history, comprising about 40% of global trade and helping usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and technological innovation."
"Together we have provided relief and hope for those suffering humanitarian catastrophes in more places than I can mention, from the Western Balkans to the Congo, to our ongoing work in Haiti today."
"To those sceptics who, in spite of all these accomplishments, continue to question the state of transatlantic relationships or my country's attitude toward a United Europe, my answer is this: even if the United States and the nations all of you represent were not united by shared values and common heritage of many millions of our citizens, myself included, our global interests alone would inexorably bind us together."
"The relationship between my country and Europe is today as strong and as important to all of us as it has ever been."
"This century has unleashed new challenges, no less dangerous than those that came before, in the 20th century, and together - together - we are taking them on, one by one."
"They are difficult; there will be disagreement, but we are taking them on jointly."
"Climate change: one of the greatest threats our planet faces."
"The United States and Europe are working to ensure that all countries, and especially the major economies, are contributing to a global solution."
"We all looked to, and we did take, a major step forward in Copenhagen."
"Now we have to carry out those emission cuts, the financing and the transparency called for in that accord, and we must help the most vulnerable nations, from the Arctic north to the Pacific islands, that are the harbingers of this looming crisis."
"Across the troubled landscape of Afghanistan and Pakistan, we are working together to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al-Qa'ida and the Taliban fighters and to train an Afghan army and police force so that their government can eventually protect its own people and not be a threat to its neighbours."
"In order to build Afghanistan's governing capacity, the United States, the European Union and its member nations are deploying significant financial resources and civilian resources as well."
"While sustaining these important missions has not always been popular, you all know - as I do - it is required."
"As leaders we have an obligation to make the case to our populations that this is necessary for our collective security - although, believe me, as a politician who has stood for office for the last 38 years, I understand it is not easy."
"I assure you it is no more popular in my country than it is in any of one of yours."
"That is also why the United States and Europe are standing side by side to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons: a development that would endanger the citizens and menace its neighbours, including some of our closest allies."
"Together we embarked on an unprecedented path of engagement with the Iranian leaders and, ladies and gentlemen,"
"(Applause)"
"despite what some sceptics thought, the President meant what he said: that we will reach out our hand to any party that will unclench their fist."
"At the outset of this administration, President Obama stated that we are prepared to deal with Iran on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect."
"With our allies we have made clear to Iran's leaders how they can begin to rebuild confidence within the international community, including by granting access to their previously undeclared enrichment facilities and exchanging low-enriched uranium for fuel to power a research reactor."
"But, as the world has now watched and seen, Iranian leaders spurned our collective good faith efforts and continue to take actions that threaten regional stability."
"Let me state it flatly: Iran's nuclear programme violates its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and risks sparking a nuclear arms race in the Middle East."
"Wouldn't it be ironic - wouldn't it be ironic - as the Iron Curtain fell and the mutual threats of mutually assured destruction diminished among the superpowers, that a new arms race would emerge in some of the most unstable parts of the world."
"That would be an irony that our children, our grandchildren and great-grandchildren would not forgive us, in my view, for allowing to come to pass."
"In addition, the Iranian leadership supports terrorism organisations, and that support continues unabated, and it continues unconscionably to persecute those of its citizens who peacefully take to the streets in a quest for justice: a betrayal of the duty of all governments in terms of what they owe their citizens."
"Tehran faces a stark choice: abide by international rules and rejoin the community of responsible nations - which we hope for - or face further consequences and increasing isolation."
"In the face of the threat Iran poses, we are committed to the security of our allies."
"That is why we deployed the phased adaptive missile defence programme: to deter and defend against missile attacks on this continent."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are also working together inside NATO to prepare for a range of future security threats, including energy security and cyber-security, and we continue to support close security cooperation between NATO and the EU."
"Last year the United States and Europe acted quickly and decisively when the world was reeling from a financial crisis more dire than any since the Great Depression."
"In doing so, collectively we helped prevent what people were predicting: the total collapse of the world economy."
"Today President Obama and I are closely following the economic and financial crisis in Greece and the European Union's efforts to deal with it."
"We welcome the support package that Europe is considering in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, and we will be supportive - both directly and through the IMF - of your efforts as you rescue Greece."
"These examples, and many others I could have mentioned, show why Europe continues not just to be America's largest trading partner but our most important ally."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, our predecessors came together more than six decades ago this week to begin to build institutions designed to ensure that the 20th century's darkest chapters would not be repeated in the remainder of that century or in the 21st century."
"Those institutions - this institution - have been a great success, but now we have to set our sights on the challenges of this new century I referenced in the beginning."
"The world has changed."
"It has changed utterly."
"A terrible beauty has been born."
"Perhaps the most complex threat we face today is that posed to our own citizens by non-state actors and violent extremists, particularly if - God forbid - those violent extremists were able to get their hands on any weapons of mass destruction."
"The scourge has no respect for borders - none."
"No single nation, no matter how strong or how wealthy, how organised or how capable, can meet this threat alone."
"It can only be successfully contained if we make common cause, and that is precisely what we must do."
"The new powers granted this Parliament in the Lisbon Treaty gave you a greater role in that struggle and a greater imperative to govern responsibly."
"The U.S. Government and this Parliament have struggled over how best to protect citizens without yielding the foundational rights on which all of our societies are built."
"I am absolutely confident that we must - and can - both protect our citizens and preserve our liberties."
"Since taking office last year, President Obama and I have been guided by our Constitution's imperative to seek more perfect union."
"Toward that end, one of our first official actions was to end the interrogation practices that produced few results and that we could not, in good conscience, continue."
"(Applause)"
"We ordered the closure of the detention centre at Guantánamo Bay, which had become a symbol of injustice and a rallying cry for terrorists."
"(Applause)"
"And we appreciate the support - difficult as it has been for you to take - that so many of you have provided in this effort."
"We did these things because, like you, President Obama and I reject the false choice between safety and our ideals."
"We believe that upholding our principles only makes us stronger and that compromising them actually undermines our effort in the broader struggle against violent extremism."
"For what is their purpose?"
"Their purpose is to change what we value - change how we conduct ourselves."
"Eight days after the September 11 attack, I told a group of thousands of university students in my country that they cannot allow the tragedy of 9/11 to end our way of life, because that is exactly what the terrorists sought."
"I also told them that America cannot prevail in this new struggle by acting alone."
"Those words not only fit the tenor of that time, but I think they have proven to be true - and they are no less true today."
"I do not need to tell this audience about Europe's proud tradition of protecting citizens from government invasion of their privacy - a commitment grounded in respect for the inherent dignity of all people."
"We call them inalienable rights."
"We wrote them into our Constitution, and America's commitment to privacy is also profound - as profound as yours."
"Our Constitution's Fourth Amendment protects individuals against unreasonable search and seizures by the State, which one of our most famous jurists once dubbed 'the right to be let alone'."
"The Supreme Court of the United States has made clear that privacy is a constitutionally protected and fundamental right."
"Like the EU, the Supreme Court has characterised this right as a matter of personal dignity."
"On a personal level, I have, for 36 years of my career, defended privacy rights."
"In the United States Senate every year, organisations rate those most committed to civil liberties, and every year I - and later, President Obama - characterise one of those four people picked."
"The reason I bother to tell you this is not about me but about the commitment of our Administration to individual rights."
"To change now would make a lie of everything I have said I stood for in my country for the past 37 years."
"When I led the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is responsible for confirming the President's judicial nominees, as I said, I was consistently ranked among the staunchest advocates of civil liberties, and I made it a priority to determine prospective judges' views on privacy before deciding whether or not they could go on the Court."
"President Obama and I also believe that government's primary, most fundamental and most solemn duty is to protect its citizens - the citizens it serves - as well as the rights they hold."
"President Obama has said that keeping our country safe is the first thing he thinks about when he wakes up in the morning and the last thing he thinks about before he goes to bed at night."
"I suspect that is how every world leader looks at their role."
"Indeed, no less than privacy, physical safety is also an inalienable right."
"A government that abdicates its duty to ensure the safety of its citizens violates their rights no less than a government that silences dissidents or imprisons accused criminals without trial."
"So folks, even as we gather today, our enemies are employing every tool they can muster to conduct new and devastating attacks like the ones that struck New York, London, Madrid and many other places around the globe."
"To stop them we must use every legitimate tool available - law enforcement, military intelligence technology - that is consistent with our laws and our values."
"We are fighting on many fronts, from the brave men and women serving abroad in our militaries to the patient and tireless law enforcement professionals investigating complex and suspicious financial networks."
"Just this week, our customs and border protection, using passenger information data, apprehended a suspect in the attempted bombing of New York's Times Square as he sought to flee the country."
"It is vital that we maintain every capacity we have under the law to stop such attacks."
"For that reason, we believe that the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme is essential to our security as well as to Europe's - it is presumptive of me to say."
"It has provided critical leads to counterterrorism investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, disrupting plots and ultimately saving lives."
"It has built-in redundancies that ensure personal information is respected and used only for counterterrorism purposes."
"But I do not blame you for questioning it."
"We understand your concerns."
"As a consequence, we are working together to address them, and I am absolutely confident that we can succeed to both use the tool and guarantee privacy."
"It is important that we do so, and it is important that we do so as quickly as possible."
"As a former United States Senator, I also know how hard it can be to make the hard choices required by global challenges while staying true to local values."
"All of you are going through that every time you vote in this Parliament, I suspect."
"The longer we are without an agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme, the greater the risk of a terrorist attack that could have been prevented."
"As leaders, we share responsibility to do everything we can within the law to protect the 800 million people we collectively serve."
"We have disagreed before, we will surely disagree again, but I am equally convinced that the United States and Europe can meet the challenges of the 21st century - as we did in the 20th century - if we talk and listen to one another; if we are honest with one another."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, courage, Winston Churchill taught us, is what it takes to stand up and to speak."
"Courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen."
"This afternoon I have done all the speaking."
"Be assured that I, my Government and my President are back in the business of listening to our allies."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, it is no accident that Europe was my first overseas destination as Vice President, and also the President's."
"It is no accident that we have already returned several times since then."
"The United States needs Europe, and I respectfully submit that Europe needs the United States."
"We need each other more now than we ever have."
"(Applause)"
"So I view this week's anniversary as providing a welcome opportunity to reaffirm the bond our peoples forged long ago in the fires of adversity."
"Now, as then, in the pursuit of ideals and in the search for partners, Europeans and Americans look to each other before they look to anyone else."
"Now, as then, we are honoured and grateful to be by your side in the struggles yet to come."
"So again, I am here to state unequivocally: President Obama and Joe Biden strongly support a united, a free, an open Europe."
"We strongly support what you are about here."
"We wish you God-speed, and may God bless you all and may God protect all of our troops."
"Thank you very, very much."
"(Applause)"
"- Mr Vice President, thank you very much."
"It was a great basis for future cooperation and our future talks."
"As you said, listen and talk to each other."
"That is very important."
"I would like to thank you for repeating the most important words from last week: Europe needs America."
"We remember the 20th century - the First World War, the Second World War, the Iron Curtain - we were fighting side by side, achieving victory together, as democracies."
"As you added today, America needs Europe."
"We will remember that."
"It is a good beginning to our partnership and cooperation."
"Mr Vice President, once again, thank you very much."
"(Applause)"
"Explanations of vote (continuation)"
"We still have three explanations of votes remaining."
"- Mr President, I welcome the fact that the total amount of irregularities in the way European funds are being used is declining."
"The fact that the amount of irregularities in the agricultural sector fell so dramatically by 34% is especially encouraging."
"A strong and competitive role for OLAF is among the factors that helped to improve the situation."
"I welcome the proposal enshrined in our resolution to increase cooperation among EU Member States in the area of taxation."
"However, I want to express my deep concern about the fact that fraudulent activities increased in the new Member States, especially Romania and Bulgaria."
"In EU-10 they grew by 8% while debt for the EU-2 increased by 152%."
"I want to express my strong support for the calls on Romania and Bulgaria to build up their administrative capacity to manage EU funding and improve the supervision and transparency of public procurement procedures at all levels."
"- Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Deutsch for his excellent report."
"Today's substantive discussion and our resolution, which I supported, is an excellent starting point for the future activities of the European Investment Bank, especially taking into account the EU 2020 Strategy."
"In addition, I would like once again to urge the European governments to provide the EIB with a more significant lending capacity to our neighbours, especially those in the east, who are highly in need of loans and investments, and who are also suffering from the effects of the crisis."
"Compatibility between the policy goals of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the lending directions of the EIB should be ensured in the future even more than before."
"Mr President, in January and March we witnessed mass atrocities in Nigeria which caused the deaths of several hundred people, including women and children."
"What is necessary for Nigeria is first of all a reconciliation process and the peaceful coexistence between Muslims living in the north and Christians living in the south."
"Secondly, taking into account that, despite Nigeria being one of the biggest oil producers in the world, most of its people still live in poverty."
"They do not benefit from the overall development of the country so corruption, which is widespread, has to be challenged and fought effectively and seriously."
"Thirdly, European Union assistance to Nigeria should address the most important problems, the most sensitive issues in order to achieve at least some visible progress in this country."
"(NL) Mr President, the latest news I received this week about Christians in Jos sounds extremely worrying."
"In recent weeks, too, our co-religionists - Christians, that is - have been found murdered in various places in this Nigerian city."
"For example, on Saturday 24 April, members of a gang of Muslim youths stabbed to death two journalists working for a Christian monthly."
"The perpetrators used the mobile phones of their victims to call the latter's unsuspecting friends and relatives and say, 'We have killed them all, come and see.'"
"Mr President, this is typical of an atmosphere of violence with impunity in Nigeria of which Christians are the main victims, and which has resulted in hundreds of deaths in and around Jos since the start of this year."
"Significantly, one observer has spoken of systematic religious persecution."
"Hence his appeal to the international community - and thus also to the European institutions - to recognise Islamic extremism as a key explanation for the explosive situation in Nigeria, particularly in the case of Jos, which lies at the crossroads between the Muslim north and the Christian south."
"Unfortunately - and this is also my criticism today - this is what the joint motion for a resolution explicitly does not do (see paragraph 5)."
"The motion for a resolution fails to take a firm line on the Islamic extremism prevailing in Nigeria; worse still, it opposes - and I quote - 'simplistic explanations based only on religion'."
"I too oppose single-cause explanations, but this oversimplification on the part of the EU, of this House, does not help the Nigerian Christians, whose lives are poised between hope and fear these days, in the slightest."
"That is my criticism, and that is why I abstained."
"- Mr President, I think it is appalling that a country with such massive oil reserves as Nigeria should be involved in such mass atrocities, but at the same time, taking our cue from the Vice President of the United States, the solution has to be in dialogue, dialogue, dialogue, allied with education, education, education, so that peace can be brought to the country."
"I appreciated Joe Biden referring to the line by the Irish poet William Butler Yeats: 'a terrible beauty is born'."
"We hope that terrible beauty may be turned into a wonderful beauty in Nigeria, where peace and prosperity will prevail."
"The European Union has an important role to play in that - and, indeed, in the discussion today - and in the vote we have set out a marker."
"I appreciate that very much."
"- The Minutes from this sitting will be presented to Parliament for approval at the start of the next part-session."
"If there are no objections, the resolutions adopted at today's sitting will be handed over to the recipients and bodies named in them immediately."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for this recommendation since it highlights the innovative, constructive and democratic character of the convening of Conventions for the revision of the Treaties (for example, the Convention held from 1999-2000, which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and the Convention held from 2002-2003, which prepared the draft treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe), while recognising the altogether exceptional character of the revision of the Treaties currently made necessary by the implementation of transitional measures concerning the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"In summary, the Convention system must be used since we are talking about revisions of the Treaties that go beyond simple provisional, technical adjustments."
"Therefore, following the example of the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo, I think it is good that the European Parliament 'approved the European Council's proposal to amend Protocol No 36 by means of an Intergovernmental Conference, without convening a Convention'."
"in writing. - (GA) Pat the Cope Gallagher MEP and Liam Aylward MEP have drawn attention to the fact that only Ireland and Malta use the system of proportional representation to elect Members of the European Parliament."
"Northern Ireland also uses the system of proportional representation for European elections."
"We are completely against the implementation of uniform or identical electoral systems for the election of Members of the European Parliament."
"Since the founding of the Irish State, it has been demonstrated that the proportional representation system is a fair and equal system."
"in writing. - This vote concerned the possibility of convening a Convention for the revision of the Treaties in view of transitional measures to do with the composition of the European Parliament."
"When taking into consideration various factors such as the Convention held from 22 February 2002 to 18 June 2003, as well as that which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, I am in agreement with the view of the rapporteur to support the Council's proposal to amend Protocol No 36 through holding an intergovernmental conference rather than convening a convention."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has changed the composition of the European Parliament, which is going from having 736 Members to having 751."
"There will be 18 new Members from 12 Member States."
"Since the Treaty of Lisbon sets an upper limit on the number of MEPs from each Member State, Germany has three fewer seats."
"As it is not possible to curtail an MEP's mandate during a term, this means that Parliament will temporarily have 754 Members, making it necessary to change the Treaty so as to temporarily lift the limit of 751 Members."
"I believe that it would have been preferable to apply this new composition in the 2014 elections and not in the current parliamentary term, but I recognise that there is a broad consensus on putting these changes into effect immediately."
"For this reason, I agree that the Intergovernmental Conference, which will be convened just to adopt the transitional provisions relating to the remainder of this parliamentary term, should not be preceded by a Convention; this must not, however, constitute a precedent for the future."
"The sin of Europe's system of Conventions, recalling the French and US experiences, was presuming to have a legitimacy that it still did not, in fact, have at that time."
"I therefore think that the Convention that adopted the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe ended up extrapolating the powers that had been conferred on it."
"I wish wholeheartedly that the results had been otherwise, but the circumstances at the time did not permit it."
"I therefore think that the return to the formula of intergovernmental conferences is the most realistic way of ensuring dialogue among Member States' governments, and it should focus on the specific problems that it is being called on to solve, such as that on which we voted."
"I voted for the decision not to convene a Convention for the revision of the Treaties with regard to the transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament."
"I voted that way because I believe that it seems unnecessary to convene a Convention to approve an amendment of the provisions of the Treaty on European Union."
"I agree that the Council should amend Protocol No 36 within the framework of an Intergovernmental Conference, without convening a Convention."
"I agree completely with the author of the report, and would like once again to recall that in the decided majority of Member States new Members of Parliament have already been appointed in accordance with current regulations."
"We await, therefore, introduction of the Council proposal on modification of protocol No 36."
"This will enable the additional Members to come to Parliament as observers immediately after approval of the amendment to the protocol, and with its entry into force our new fellow Members will be able to start work as full Members of the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (DE) The rapporteur is opposed to a Convention, because the treaty changes are only transitional measures."
"I do not see the situation in the same way, as it also concerns democratic problems."
"France has a different electoral system and therefore does not have the option of 'moving up' democratically and directly elected members from a list."
"It is for that reason that I have voted against this report."
"in writing. - (ET) If we look at this precisely and from a legal point of view, the decision we are taking will amend the Treaty of Lisbon, which envisages the convening of a Convention."
"However, as the action is limited in scope and restricted to the transitional amendment, I relied on the principle of proportionality and supported the transitional solution nominated by 479 colleagues: that is, to give the right of decision to an Intergovernmental Conference rather than convening a Convention."
"in writing. - I voted against this report because I am against not convening a Convention for the revision of Treaties."
"The decision not to convene a Convention was one of the most difficult decisions related to the introduction of the 18 new Members to Parliament."
"We have made this decision precisely out of respect for this instrument, whose objective is to increase the legitimacy of decisions concerning fundamental EU law."
"It is not a precedent for the future."
"All important matters concerning changes to the Treaties, such as electoral procedure, will still require a Convention to be convened."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo, and the coordinators for making this decision, because it was not easy."
"We have a problem with the appointment of the 18 new Members, because some Member States have not used the appropriate procedure."
"However, we have decided that the most important principle is representativeness."
"This House should have, above all, a balanced representation as quickly as possible."
"Therefore, we call on Member States to complete this process as quickly as possible, assuming at the same time that all Members will be chosen in direct elections."
"I voted for the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"A transitional measure must in fact be found to reconcile respect for the Treaty of Lisbon with Article 5 of the 1976 Act concerning the election of the Members of the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage."
"It is therefore necessary to increase the number of MEPs to 754 for the rest of the 2009-2014 parliamentary term."
"Furthermore, I am pleased with the wording of paragraph 6 of this report, which calls for a uniform system for electing MEPs: 'Notifies the European Council that it intends shortly to draw up proposals to lay down the provisions necessary for the election of its Members by direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure in all Member States and in accordance with principles common to all Member States, and that Parliament will initiate such electoral reform under Article 48(2) of the Treaty on European Union and Article 223 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; insists, further, that a Convention devoted to the reform of the European Parliament will be called to prepare the revision of the Treaties'."
"The European Parliament has agreed to 18 MEPs joining the Chamber during the parliamentary term."
"This agreement means that Parliament, elected in June 2009 under the procedure of the Treaty of Nice, is in conformity with the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009."
"I voted against, and did so for one reason which in my opinion is crucially important: during the European elections of June 2009, most of the Member States believed it very probable that the Treaty of Lisbon would be ratified imminently."
"Consequently, they adapted the way in which the elections were held."
"This is not the case with France, which did not make any arrangements to ensure a smooth transition from 72 to 74 MEPs."
"The solution found in the end - the appointment of two members of the National Assembly - is unacceptable."
"Since 1979, MEPs have been elected by direct universal suffrage by European citizens, and not appointed by national assemblies."
"It is thanks to direct universal suffrage that we can rightfully speak on behalf of all Europeans."
"The fact that Parliament has accepted the French compromise sets a worrying precedent in terms of its failure to comply with the Treaties."
"in writing. - We welcome measures to allow the 18 additional Members to take up their seats in the European Parliament."
"However, they should not enjoy observer status until the transitional measures enter into force and they can take their seats as full Members of Parliament."
"As observers, the incoming Members would be entitled to their salaries and expenses before they are entitled to vote."
"That is wrong, and it is why our delegation has voted against this report."
"I must express the strongest criticism of France's decision as regards the appointment of the two additional MEPs called to take their seats in the European Parliament, by virtue of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Unlike the 11 other European countries affected by this reform, which anticipated the election and which have of course relied on the results of the European elections of June 2009, the French Government, for its part, has decided to simply appoint members from its national parliament: this is a disgrace to democracy."
"Furthermore, we French socialists did not think that the other 16 MEPs should have to pay the price for this complete lack of preparation on the part of France, and in the end we therefore advocated the launch of an IGC (Intergovernmental Conference) that will enable these elected MEPs - firstly as observers - to come and play their role as representatives of the European citizens who elected them with this sole aim in mind."
"The last European elections (2009) took place before the Treaty of Lisbon had entered into force, so Parliament's composition was still the same as that established by the Treaty of Nice (736 Members)."
"The European Council agreed with the draft composition proposed by Parliament in 2007, increasing the number from 750 to 751."
"I considered it preferable for the new composition of the European Parliament to be applied only in the next European elections in 2014."
"Nonetheless, there is a broad consensus that it should be done now."
"It will, therefore, be necessary to regulate how the 18 new Members (shared between 12 Member States) will be elected."
"The new Treaty sets an upper limit on the number of MEPs from each Member State, meaning that Germany will lose three seats."
"As it is not possible to curtail an MEP's mandate during a term, this means that Parliament will temporarily have 754 Members."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Mendez de Vigo, when he recommends that the new Members take up their posts on the same day, to avoid regional distortions to representation in Parliament."
"I do not agree with the possibility that the new Members be appointed by their national authorities."
"I believe that Members only acquire legitimacy through election."
"The Treaty of Lisbon increases the number of MEPs from 736 to 751."
"However, as the 2009 elections took place before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, only 736 MEPs were elected."
"Our Parliament therefore had to adopt new provisions concerning its composition for the rest of the parliamentary term."
"The Democratic Movement delegation did not vote in favour of this text for two reasons."
"It cannot agree to the Council's proposal to convene an Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) without having a Convention composed of representatives of the national parliaments, Heads of State or Government, Parliament and the Commission."
"This accelerated procedure 'violates' not only the spirit, but also the letter, of the Treaties."
"It also sets an unfortunate precedent."
"The appointment of two members of the French national parliament among the 18 additional MEPs constitutes a serious attack on the primary legislation, which stipulates that MEPs must be elected by direct universal suffrage and not appointed by their national parliaments."
"This only positive result of this episode will be that it has drawn attention to the need to reform Parliament's electoral procedure in the long term and, more specifically, to the demand that we have long been making for a proportion of MEPs to be elected to a European constituency."
"I voted for this report because it argues that the 18 additional MEPs, from 12 Member States, can take their seats after being elected."
"It is regrettable that the Council did not adopt the necessary measures in time to allow these Members to take their seats immediately after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The fact that the Treaty of Lisbon did not enter into force in time to be immediately applicable to the elections for the 2009-2014 term of the European Parliament led to a problem that has ended up, I believe, being resolved sensibly and in a way that reflects the inevitable difficulties of transition periods."
"Therefore, while it would not make sense or be legitimate to strip elected Members of their mandates, it would also not be reasonable to prevent the Member States that are benefiting from an increase in the number of their representatives from appointing them in accordance with the legislation governing their respective electoral systems."
"The exceptional circumstances fully justify the exceptional solutions adopted."
"An increase in the total number of MEPs by 15 (from the 736 stipulated in the Treaty of Nice to 751), with 18 additional seats to be distributed among 12 Member States, has been adopted."
"Germany has been allocated three fewer seats in view of the maximum number laid down in the EU Treaty."
"The Treaty of Lisbon had not entered into force before the 2009 European elections, so the latter were held in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, meaning that the European Parliament currently has 736 Members rather than 751."
"On the other hand, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon means that the 18 additional MEPs from the 12 Member States concerned can legitimately take their seats."
"It is not possible to curtail an MEP's mandate during a parliamentary term or, therefore, to reduce the current number of MEPs in the German delegation by three."
"I therefore take the view that the amendment of Protocol No 36 requested by the European Council stems directly from the new provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, and is a valid solution that will enable all those Member States entitled to additional seats to designate the MEPs concerned."
"These 18 MEPs must take up their seats in Parliament at the same time in order not to upset the balance of nationalities in the House."
"As we have been asserting and as can be seen from this report, the Treaty of Lisbon not only implements neoliberal, militarist and federalist policies but is an instrument full of ambiguities and contradictions, such as those expressed in Protocol (No 36) on provisions concerning the composition of the European Parliament."
"The arrogance of those promoting the Treaty was so great that it prevented them from making these provisions flexible, because they had done everything to avoid referendums from being held in order to escape a vote by the peoples of the EU's countries and a repeat of the No by the French and Dutch peoples to the so-called 'Constitutional Treaty'."
"The Irish people also said no to this travesty of a text, and it was only after much pressure and blackmail that their vote was obtained, but already after the European elections."
"This report has shown the attempt by some MEPs to entrench the EU's federalist trajectory by invoking a democratic legitimacy that the Treaty does not have."
"These Members are also attempting to further subordinate national legislations to the EU's interests with proposals that seek a uniform electoral procedure in all Member States, which is a sovereign competency of each Member State, and are demanding that a Convention be convened charged with the reform of the European Parliament to prepare for the revision of the Treaties."
"Whether the Treaties are revised by way of an Intergovernmental Conference or by way of a Convention changes absolutely nothing as far as the crux of the problem is concerned."
"Whether through incompetence, negligence or political miscalculation, one single country, France, refused to anticipate the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for its representation in the European Parliament, in spite of the repeated demands of several political groups, including my own."
"Consequently, today, France is the only one of the 27 that intends to appoint two new MEPs by the indirect means of a decision by a national parliament of which the voting system is thoroughly unjust."
"All of this is in violation of the Treaties themselves, and in violation of the Act of 1976, which provides for the election of MEPs by direct universal suffrage."
"Moreover, complicit in this is the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which, despite having been dealt a severe blow in the 2009 elections, will inherit one of the two extra seats."
"This is scheming between friends, with the support of this Parliament."
"Unfortunately, in order to pass off this anomaly, the rapporteur is hiding behind the temporary nature of the measure."
"Temporary?"
"The new French MEPs will sit for four years, which is more than 80% of the parliamentary term."
"I would have expected our fellow Member to have been firmer in terms of both the value of words and the defence of democratic principles."
"I voted for several amendments aimed at underlining the unacceptable nature of the choice made by France, which is appointing members of its national parliament to sit in the European Parliament alongside 16 others, who for their part stood in the election of 7 June 2009."
"In my opinion, this choice, which was clearly made amid a total lack of preparation, runs counter to fundamental democratic principles and raises important questions about the democratic legitimacy of the European Parliament."
"On the other hand, we must not block the arrival of the other MEPs, whose appointment is perfectly in accordance with the spirit of the Treaties."
"This issue demonstrates just how necessary it is for us to provide ourselves in future with a uniform method of appointing MEPs by direct universal suffrage, with this reform to be carried out by means of a convention."
"in writing. - I voted against this report because of our main amendment, in which we claimed that Members of the European Parliament should be elected by direct universal suffrage."
"I have cast my vote, which is categorically in favour of the two reports drafted by Mr Méndez de Vigo."
"I am satisfied for two reasons: the committee that I chair acted promptly, reaching a provisional agreement, and that agreement paved the way for the one reached today in plenary by a very large majority."
"From this perspective, I have endorsed the idea of voting against paragraph 5, introduced by an amendment of mine tabled in committee, to emphasise that the appointment of the 18 new Members will have to comply as far as possible with the provisions of the 1976 Electoral Act, which requires that Members be elected directly by the European citizens."
"Therefore, the preference will have to be for an automatic method that allows the candidates who received the most votes of those who were not elected during the last European elections to join Parliament."
"If, however, the national electoral system does not allow for such a calculation, we can resort to appointment by the national parliaments."
"The political crisis in Kyrgyzstan is yet another episode in the destabilisation of the Central Asia region, a region that we know is crucial to Europe given the importance of the issue of where we source our energy and raw materials from, and to the United States and Russia, in view of the country's strategic position."
"This, unfortunately, is the disappointing outcome of the 2005 revolution, which had raised hopes of a real change in the political dynamics of the small, former Soviet republic and which seemed to herald, together with the events of the same years in Ukraine and Georgia, a calmer geopolitical future in the region as a whole."
"Unfortunately, today, Kyrgyzstan is reaping the bitter fruits of a change that did not happen, and the resolution on which we are voting contains the necessary and appropriate guidelines that this House should give to the European bodies that will be directly involved in the Kyrgyz issue in international and diplomatic forums."
"The hope is that the Commission and the Council will work consistently with one another on these guidelines, and, above all, will do so with a sense of urgency which, unfortunately, has been inexcusably lacking in other, even recent, cases."
"It was with the sincere hope that European action will have a positive impact on the stabilisation of Kyrgyzstan that I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution."
"A product of the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan is being disputed by the great powers and it seems to have declined into a process of political agitation and disintegration of the political and social fabric, which needs to be better monitored by European institutions and the governments of Member States."
"Europe's relative lack of knowledge of the Central Asian republics must be remedied, and channels for relations and communication sought that enable better access to more information and more detailed monitoring of their respective situations."
"I welcome the European Union's firmness in making the issues of freedom, democracy and human rights central to its agenda for Kyrgyzstan."
"I also hope that the provisional government shows itself to be as good as its word and undertakes reforms that do not fail to take these issues into account."
"The announcement of the calling of elections and of a constitutional referendum constitute an encouraging sign for the near future."
"According to independent observers, last year's presidential elections in Kyrgyzstan in which Kurmanbek Bakiyev was re-elected were tainted by massive fraud."
"Furthermore, after his initial democratic undertakings Bakiyev's rule turned authoritarian."
"Following mass demonstrations, President Bakiyev was forced to flee the capital and his place was taken by a provisional government led by the opposition leader Roza Otunbayeva, who issued a decree on power succession and an order of compliance with the Kyrgyz Constitution."
"Meanwhile, Bakiyev fled the country to seek refuge in Kazakhstan."
"Kyrgyzstan attracts special interest from the United States and Russia because of its strategic location in the middle of Central Asia."
"The EU and Central Asia have common challenges in terms of energy, the fight against climate change, drug trafficking control and the fight against terrorism."
"For this reason, the EU must engage actively with the provisional government, with a view to exploring and exploiting possibilities to promote good governance, the independence of the judiciary and other EU policy objectives laid down in the Central Asia Strategy."
"As co-author of the European Parliament motion for a resolution on Kyrgyzstan, I want to express my thanks to fellow Members who voted in favour of this document, today."
"Worthy of particular note is the intention announced by the interim Kyrgyzstani Government to begin work on constitutional reform and the rapid creation of the foundations for conducting democratic parliamentary elections."
"This explains the appeal to the interim government to meet Kyrgyzstan's international obligations and to ensure that the electoral process will be free and fair."
"We follow events in Kyrgyzstan with anxiety, and this includes the maintenance of an uninterrupted supply corridor for NATO and other international forces which are part of the mission in Afghanistan."
"It is essential that the European Union and the European Parliament monitor the situation in Kyrgyzstan very carefully, that essential assistance is given and that dialogue between all groups of Kyrgyzstani society is supported."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on Kyrgyzstan, because I think that as a member of the delegation to Central Asia I am obliged to give at least this support to a nation which in recent weeks has found itself in such a difficult situation."
"The resolution calls for an end to violence, for dialogue between the parties to the conflict and for respect for the right to freedom, human rights and the principles of a state of law, and stresses the importance of a coherent and stable constitutional framework for ensuring democracy."
"I think, therefore, that the international aid programme should be brought into being as quickly as possible, and that the EU should assume the role of leader in the programme."
"The situation that is currently being experienced in Kyrgyzstan is concerning, all the more so because it is country situated in a very important part of Central Asia, with a geostrategic location near Afghanistan and adjacent to the Ferghana Valley."
"A United Nations-led international investigation into the events is needed, in order to identify responsibilities."
"It is important that the Special Representative for Central Asia follows the situation very closely, working closely with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European Commission."
"European Parliament motion for a resolution No of 6 May 2010 on the situation in Kyrgyzstan is the common voice of Europe directed to Kyrgyzstan and its authorities."
"The motion for a resolution on Kyrgyzstan is an important signal from the European Union and the whole of Europe. We should show both the citizens and the Kyrgyzstani authorities, and not just by resolutions like this one, that we support the strengthening of democracy and the development of society, the security of the population and sustainable growth."
"The European Parliament must be an institution which supports all prospects for democracy and does not accept any deviations from that route."
"The changes in Kyrgyzstan are a consequence of the last few years and the transitory nature of the hopes associated with the Tulip Revolution."
"Electoral fraud and the mild form of authoritarianism which has begun to operate in Kyrgyzstan cannot and will not be a matter of indifference."
"The only measures which we can and will support are democratic measures, because they are the foundation of the European Union."
"There can be no consent, on our part, to other measures."
"I hope the resolution on Kyrgyzstan is one of many steps we will take."
"The whole of Europe expects this of us."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution, together with the big majority, including the two oral amendments made during the vote."
"in writing. - (ET) The events that took place in Kyrgyzstan at the start of April, already a month ago, have had a serious impact both upon the country's internal governmental situation and upon international relations."
"Thanks to this, Russia has increased its influence in Kyrgyzstan, both militarily and also economically, which was to be expected given the previous economic ties between these two countries."
"At the same time, Russia has promised to give economic aid both through direct financial support and also by selling gas and oil products at a favourable price."
"Today's report largely draws attention to the fact that the European Union and the UN must help ensure that a democratic government is elected and that human rights violations come to an end in this country."
"It is certainly true that there is a desire to reduce corruption both in the public sector and in the justice system, which will perhaps make it necessary to reform the public sector and guarantee the independence of the justice system."
"Yet this is all directly connected with the country's economic situation, and therefore cooperation is necessary between the EU, the UN and Russia, because otherwise Kyrgyzstan will not be given priority; instead, all the 'great powers' will attempt to use this situation to their own ends."
"Therefore, I support this resolution, which calls on all parties to cooperate to ensure the observance of human rights and the development of democracy, as well as the reform of the public sector and the independence of the justice system."
"I believe, however, that it will be some time before this country reaches the desired level of democracy, since in order for that to happen, appointments will have to be made through open competitions rather than being allocated to relatives."
"I welcome the recent communication on clean and efficient vehicles."
"Putting electric cars on the market could represent a competitive advantage for European industry."
"We must not, however, forget that Europe is currently the world leader in the automotive sector, and we cannot put this competitive advantage at risk."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to develop the conditions necessary to create an internal market in electric vehicles."
"I would also warn of the need to harmonise the standards for batteries and compatible charge points in the various Member States."
"It is also important to create tax incentives, with appropriate electricity prices for consumers."
"Another essential factor will be the modernisation of electricity grids."
"I call for greater investment in research and development into smart grids and battery technology, in order to make more efficient use of primary materials."
"I ask, therefore, that all efforts be made to maintain Europe's world leadership in the automotive industry."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted for the motion for a resolution because I believe that electric vehicles can contribute to achieving the priorities for the Europe 2020 Strategy, which consist of developing an economy that is based on knowledge and innovation, and promoting an economy that is more efficient in terms of use of resources; in other words, one that is more environmentally friendly and competitive."
"At a time when debate about CO2 emissions has become unavoidable because it is central to discussion of climate change, and when the volatility of fuel prices has made the continuation of the current dependence on petroleum and its derivatives unsustainable, at least in the long term, it is important to find alternatives."
"For that reason, innovation put at the service of economic and social needs must seek solutions that are scientifically and economically viable."
"Electric vehicles are a significant innovation with high market potential, particularly in the long term, as they are responsible for reduced emissions of CO2 and other pollutants, and for improved energy efficiency and the promotion of innovation based on technological leadership."
"Given the above, there must be a European strategy for electric vehicles, supporting industry in developing clean and viable technology and supporting the creation of a single market in electric vehicles."
"Nevertheless, I must once again warn that the setting of a European strategy must not mean the creation of a complex mass of regulations weighing heavily on the industry, putting its development and viability at risk."
"The challenges posed by climate change, CO2 emissions and other pollutants, and the volatility of fuel prices have created a positive climate for the worldwide development of electric vehicles."
"Electric vehicles contribute to achieving the 'Europe 2020' priorities of fostering innovation and knowledge (smart growth), promoting a more resource-efficient and greener economy (sustainable growth), and allowing the economy to grow by creating jobs (inclusive growth)."
"It is important that the high cost of electric vehicles - caused mostly by the cost of batteries - decreases, which requires research and innovation."
"I therefore welcome the priority given to the development of electric vehicles by the Spanish Presidency in the context of the fight against climate change, and the Commission's Communication on a European strategy on clean and energy-efficient vehicles of 27 April 2010."
"I believe that the necessary conditions for the existence of a single electric vehicle market must be created, while at the same time guaranteeing efficient coordination of policies at EU level, in order to avoid negative impacts, particularly on employment."
"This coordination also encourages compatibility and interoperability."
"We believe the development of electric cars to be necessary as an alternative to vehicles that use fossil fuels."
"Faced with the atmospheric pollution associated with such vehicles, and the inexorable exhaustion of fossil-fuel reserves, particularly oil, within a few decades in the unfortunately likely event that the current energy paradigm persists, the development of electric vehicles stands out as an important option to consider."
"Nevertheless, the limitations and problems that are still associated with these vehicles, and which we mentioned during the debate, must not be ignored."
"These problems and limitations, as we said, make it inadvisable to take commercial or advertising risks."
"Instead, they warn of the 'the need for further R&D to improve the characteristics, and reduce the costs, of electric vehicles'."
"Above all, the 'goal of a largely decarbonised transportation system by 2050' that is mentioned in the report, must involve significantly increasing development of various types of mass and public transport and promoting their use to make them accessible to all; electric vehicles must be strongly represented in this process."
"I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution, which makes it possible, among other things, to standardise chargers for electric cars, since the European Union and our fellow citizens have everything to gain from the development of a European electric vehicle market, and even from the creation of a global market."
"Therefore, these measures strengthen the EU's position within the framework of combating pollution and protecting the environment, by facilitating the use of clean vehicles, whatever the vehicle type."
"They also facilitate support for research and innovation, thus having positive consequences for the competitiveness of the European Union in the field of technology."
"The adoption of this motion for a resolution is likely to herald the beginning of a new model of society that takes the various challenges (environmental, social, technological, demographic, and so on) into account."
"I am relying on the other European institutions to support us in this undertaking."
"in writing. - (RO) I support the promotion of electric vehicles as a medium- and long-term priority."
"We must identify ways of encouraging Member States to implement a common strategy on standardising electric vehicles."
"The success of this strategy will definitely reduce costs for users, thereby making electric vehicles more attractive."
"A lack of coordination at European level means that not only users have to pay high costs."
"Industrial manufacturers will need to standardise their various industrial specifications, which will have a direct impact on costs."
"This is why, if we want to move in the desired direction, I believe that we must focus on standardisation procedures."
"We must find ways of encouraging European consumers towards using electric cars."
"I think that local authorities have an important role to play in this."
"They will be able to encourage European consumers through their example, as well as through providing infrastructure facilities and benefits associated with the various charges, such as for parking or pollution."
"I believe that the use of electric cars by Europe's institutions would set an example and send out a very positive signal."
"By way of an experiment, a mini fleet of electric cars should be created as soon as possible as an alternative to the current modes of transport."
"The growing concern for CO2 emissions and climate change has created an urgent need for rapid development to make it possible for electric vehicles to be a valid alternative to those currently in use."
"Increased use of this mode of transport makes a very positive contribution to achieving the objectives set out in the 'Europe 2020' Strategy."
"The EU must, therefore, invest significantly in creating a supply network that effectively covers Europe's territory."
"Decisive steps must also be taken to remove a series of obstacles that currently make this mode of transport unattractive."
"in writing. - (DE) In the context of our shrinking resources, electric vehicles definitely have the potential to become a genuinely climate-friendly alternative, provided that we continue to develop them."
"However, this will only be the case if both the manufacturing processes and the operation of the cars are genuinely non-resource-intensive and environmentally friendly."
"Electric and hybrid drive systems are currently still in their infancy and we need to put in place a standardised framework without giving this technology priority over other alternative drive systems."
"In the current proposal too little attention is paid to other alternative drive systems, which is why I have abstained."
"Support for the development of electric vehicles may have numerous benefits."
"Promoting electric cars will help significantly in combating climate change, by switching to cleaner and more advanced technologies, in promoting innovation and in limiting our energy dependency."
"The development of this technology also includes certain aspects to which due consideration will need to be given, such as the removal of administrative and other obstacles which might have a negative effect on the circulation of green cars and the provision of incentives for retraining people working in the automotive industry, so that they can acquire the necessary skills."
"I think that the motion for a resolution is a very balanced text, because it addresses all the above issues, which is why I voted for it."
"In order to assess the impact of the measures discussed, we need to analyse the statistics quoted by the Commission."
"In fact, in 2007, 72% of the European population lived in urban areas, which are the key to growth and employment."
"Cities need efficient transport systems in order to support the economy and to ensure the well-being of their residents."
"Approximately 85% of the EU's GDP is generated in cities."
"Urban areas have the task, today, of making transport sustainable in environmental (CO2, air pollution, noise), competition (congestion) and social (demographic changes, inclusion, health) terms."
"Our rising to this challenge is also crucial to the success of the EU's overall strategy to combat climate change, to achieve the 20/20/20 target and to promote cohesion."
"Nine out of 10 EU citizens believe that the traffic situation in their area should be improved."
"I am convinced that coordinated action at EU level can help to strengthen the markets in new technologies for clean vehicles and in alternative fuels."
"In this way, we can encourage users to opt, in the long term, for cleaner vehicles or modes of transport, to use less congested infrastructure or to travel at different times."
"I wholeheartedly support these initiatives, which aim, in the medium to long term, to improve our habits in line with the economic and industrial development of the Union as a whole."
"in writing. - I followed my group in voting in favour of this resolution, although our amendment on speeding up a review of type-approval legislation was not adopted."
"In Europe 380 000 businesses are involved in motor vehicle distribution and services."
"Almost all of these are small and medium-sized enterprises, employing 2.8 million people."
"Since 1985, the motor vehicle sector has been governed by a block exemption regulation in the context of European competition law, in order to take into account its specific characteristics: the oligopolistic situation, and the highly technical nature and long life span of products."
"Today, however, the Commission is proposing to abolish the existing exemption for the sale of new vehicles."
"Only the secondary market (repair and maintenance services and supply of spare parts) would remain subject to a specific exemption regime."
"This motion for a resolution, which I already supported in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and which I voted for again today in plenary, carries a clear message on the part of the European Parliament."
"It follows detailed consultations with the motor vehicle sector."
"It calls on the Commission to take into account several elements that are likely to destabilise the balance of power between motor vehicle manufacturers and distributors, to the detriment of consumers."
"I decided to vote for this motion for a resolution as it highlights the problems inherent in the European Commission's proposal on the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation."
"The recommendation from the European executive to amend certain clauses in the current regulation in this field, by specifically imposing the obligation on car intermediaries to make up to 80% of their sales from a single car make, could increase the latter's dependency on manufacturers, with the risk of restricting competition in the sector and having a detrimental impact on the options available to consumers."
"As the European Commission has started the process of reviewing the legislation applicable to motor vehicles, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1400/2002 ('MVBER') and Regulation (EC) No 2790/1999 ('GBER'), it is important to note that the Union and its Member States are currently facing an unprecedented economic and financial crisis that has had a real and profound impact on the automotive industry."
"This industry continues to be fundamental to the European economy, contributing to employment, technological innovation and competitiveness."
"With this in mind, the new regulations must take into account the need, in the medium and long terms, to create conditions for the sustainability of the European automotive industry, allowing it to remain at the forefront of technology and innovation, and economically sustainable."
"In view of what we have just voted on regarding electric vehicles, the new regulatory framework must incentivise the manufacture and use of this type of vehicle, as well as environmental research and the development of automobiles with less environmental impact and lower emissions."
"We voted against this motion for a resolution, which welcomes, in principle, the current revision of the competition rules applicable to distribution and repairs in the motor vehicle sector."
"In fact, it welcomes the abolition of the exemption and the application of the general law of competition."
"As usual, under the cover of a preliminary consultation, it will be those lobbies that are the most influential or effective, but not necessarily representative of the industry, that will prevail, to say nothing of the dogma of beneficial competition for all."
"On the other hand, the efforts made by professionals to adapt to the legislation in force today will be undone."
"Admittedly, whether doing or undoing, one is still taking action."
"The question is whether the objective of the Commission, and in particular of the Directorate-General for Competition, is to justify its existence by producing laws, rather than implementing regulations that satisfy demands for quality and safety of services and products, demands that are necessary everywhere, but particularly in the motor vehicle sector."
"in writing. - (DE) The Commission's proposed changes are contrary to the interests in particular of small and medium-sized businesses in the motor vehicle sector."
"In addition, this sector is governed by a large number of complex regulations (relating to safety and the environment, for example) and therefore competition law must be based on the specific features of this market."
"For this reason, I have voted against the Commission proposal."
"In July 2002 the Commission adopted a block exemption regulation on motor vehicle distribution agreements, to replace Regulation (EC) No 1475/95."
"The main objective of the Commission's competition policy is to enable the companies involved to benefit from a safety zone through the adoption of block exemption regulations designed to guarantee proper supervision of the markets."
"Block exemptions contribute, therefore, to legal certainty and to the consistent application of European rules."
"I must point out that the importance of this debate consists, in fact, in outlining the guidelines underpinning the future legal framework which, following the expiry of the regulation, should govern the agreements on the distribution of motor vehicles and on the associated after-sales services."
"Therefore, in order to decide on an appropriate scope for the block exemption applicable to the car industry, I urge the Commission to take account of the conditions of competition on the major markets and of the need to make a fundamental distinction between the markets for the sale of new motor vehicles and those for repair and maintenance services and/or for the distribution of spare parts."
"I would reiterate the importance of supporting such proposals."
"They discourage individual initiatives in favour of competition among dealers and repairers and encourage the development of the sector."
"The so-called 'block exemption' regulation, introduced at European level in 2002 to increase competition in the motor vehicle sector and bring tangible benefits to consumers, is reaching its expiry date."
"In its proposal for revision, the Commission is introducing changes that will have worrying consequences for consumers, in terms of variety of choice, quality and price."
"This is why we are using this motion for a resolution, which I supported, to clearly state our reservations about some of the proposals on the table."
"In particular I am thinking of the 'single branding' obligation, which will have a negative impact on consumer choice and the independence of dealers with regard to manufacturers."
"I would also like to express my concern as regards the absence of a guarantee of appropriate access for all stakeholders to technical information and spare parts, which will in fact limit the freedom of choice of the dealer or the garage owner to whom the consumer might turn."
"Finally, let us recall that the Commission must urgently tackle new forms of anti-competitive customer tying measures, such as after-sales services being contingent upon the exclusive repair or maintenance of a vehicle within the brand-specific network."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution, together with the big majority of the Chamber."
"Cancer is one of the biggest health challenges faced by Europe: it is the second most important cause of death in the EU, with 3 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths every year."
"According to the World Health Organisation, at least one third of all cases of cancer are preventable."
"It is therefore essential that relevant stakeholders across the European Union engage in a collective effort to address cancer."
"One of the purposes of the proposal presented by the Commission for a 'European Partnership for Action Against Cancer - 2009-2013' is to support the Member States in their efforts to tackle cancer by providing a framework for identifying and sharing information, capacity and expertise in cancer prevention and control and by engaging relevant stakeholders across the EU in a collective effort."
"I welcome the objective of reducing the cancer burden by introducing 100% population screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancers by 2013, urging the Member States implement the aforementioned guidelines."
"For the above reasons, I voted in favour of the report 'Action Against Cancer: European Partnership'."
"in writing. - (LT) I voted for this report, since the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer for the period 2009-2013 proposed by the European Commission is an excellent initiative to combat this terrible disease more effectively."
"Cancer is one of the main areas of Community action in the field of public health, since every year 3.2 million Europeans are diagnosed with cancer, which represents the second most frequent cause of death after heart disease."
"The Partnership proposed by the Commission aims to support the Member States in their efforts to tackle cancer by providing a framework for identifying and sharing information, capacity and expertise in cancer prevention and control."
"I would like to stress that only by engaging all the relevant stakeholders across the European Union in a collective effort to address cancer, can we remarkably reduce the number of cancer cases in Europe."
"I agree with the European Parliament's call for the Commission and Member States to further develop and consolidate initiatives that provide cancer sufferers with support either directly or indirectly."
"I also agree that the Commission and the Member States must ensure that in all Member States there is equal access to cancer drugs for all patients who need them."
"Therefore, this partnership to combat cancer initiated by the Commission is a very important step towards a common social and political partnership for all of Europe that aims to reduce the European burden of cancer."
"The predictions about an exponential rise in the number of cancer cases diagnosed are intended to sound a loud alarm bell for the international community."
"One European in three will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime."
"In fact, this cruel disease is the second most common cause of death in Europe."
"The European Parliament is using the motion for a resolution it has adopted to draw attention to the fact that there are still unacceptable disparities across Europe in terms of cancer screening and treatment."
"One third of the cancers diagnosed have a fatal outcome for the patient because they were diagnosed too late."
"This is a reality which Europe must change through information programmes, educating the public and facilitating access to high-quality medical services."
"Last but not least, the EU is doing too little at the moment in terms of research into this disease about which too little is still known."
"Research and prevention are the main lines of attack against this disease."
"This will yield results in the medium term."
"The incidence of cancer cases must start to decrease so that Europe can achieve the ambitious target set by the European Commission. This is to cut the number of new cancer cases by 2020 by 15%, taking into account the rising trend caused by population growth and the ageing population."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal to set up a European Partnership for Action Against Cancer for the period 2009-2013 because I believe that the fight against cancer is an essential part of the Health Strategy."
"Nevertheless, as a form of primary prevention, I call for the implementation of measures to encourage healthy lifestyles as an essential factor in improving health."
"Environmental factors also affect health, so it is necessary to tackle environmental problems that are responsible for the development of specific types of cancer."
"This is why it is important that there be a cross-cutting and integrated approach in fields of action such as education, the environment, research, and social issues, as well as greater coordination between the various cancer-research centres in the EU."
"I would draw attention to the need to make better use of the finance aimed at combating cancer under the Seventh Framework Programme as well as the need for large-scale research programmes."
"It would also be important to include funding to promote cancer prevention in the financial perspective."
"A new comprehensive cancer approach is essential, because the disease is growing at almost epidemic rates at global level and is one of the main causes of death in the world, responsible for almost 13% of the total number of deaths in 2004 (nearly 1.7 million deaths every year); because it was the second-largest cause of death in 2006, with the majority of deaths resulting from lung cancer, colorectal cancer and breast cancer; and because one in three Europeans is still confronted with a diagnosis of cancer during their lifetime, and one in four Europeans ends up dying from it."
"A clear commitment to prevention and national screening plans is necessary, since we know that adequate prevention and early treatment will allow almost 30% of cases to be avoided."
"It is also essential to reduce inequalities in treatment."
"I would draw attention to the unacceptable situation in Portugal, where innovative and effective cancer-treatment drugs,specifically for lung cancer and breast cancer, are being refused to patients for purely financial reasons."
"Cancer is one of the biggest health challenges we are facing worldwide."
"It is currently the second most important cause of death in Europe, with 3 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths every year."
"The European Commission proposes a European Partnership for Action Against Cancer for the period 2009-2013."
"As a social and political problem, cancer requires joint actions at European, national, regional and local level."
"The Treaty of Lisbon defines precisely that the Union shall have competence to carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States."
"One of the areas of such action, at European level, is protection and improvement of human health (Article 2E)."
"The European Union has already agreed two important evidence-based instruments for prevention: the European Code Against Cancer and the Council Recommendations on screening for breast, cervical and colon cancer."
"I therefore welcome this motion for a resolution's recommendation to mobilise the public sector in general to invest in a robust and consistent effort for cancer prevention."
"Cancer is one of the main causes of death in the world and cases have been increasing at an alarming rate."
"We therefore consider the EU's support for the Member States' efforts at fighting cancer, as mentioned in the report, as well as the promotion of a collective effort in the sharing of information, capacity and expertise in cancer prevention and control, to be important."
"The reduced number of cases of cancer in some countries resulting from the adoption of policies to improve prevention and treatment shows that this is a good path to follow."
"The report refers to various significant issues, including: the need for primary prevention and control of diseases that can develop into cancer; the importance of screening; the insufficiency of the funding that is currently available to the fight against cancer in the EU, particularly public funding; the need to reduce occupational and environmental exposure to carcinogens; the need to update the lists of carcinogenic substances; and the protection of cancer patients and chronically sick people in the workplace."
"It could have gone further on other issues, such as the elimination - rather than reduction - of inequalities in access to cancer treatments and associated care."
"As the author of written declaration no 71/2009 on the fight against breast cancer in the European Union, which has been adopted by Parliament, I am exceedingly pleased by the Commission communication on Action Against Cancer: European Partnership."
"In this document, the problem of cancer in the EU has been diagnosed and objectives set in the fight against cancer."
"Despite the fact that the health service is de facto managed by the Member States, the EU can, nevertheless, act to extend health care and be, for example, an excellent platform for the exchange of good practices."
"It will be up to the Member States if they make use of this additional tool prepared by the Commission."
"The proposal contains a very specific goal, namely reducing the burden of cancer in the EU by 15% by 2020."
"To put this programme into effect, it is necessary to achieve integration of all Member States' plans in the fight against cancer by 2013."
"The next step is to reduce by 70% the disproportion in mortality from cancer among Europeans being treated for these conditions."
"The differences between the Member States with the best and the worst results in the EU are still too great."
"The communication also contains an emphasis on prophylaxis and includes the introduction of 100% population screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancers."
"I am pleased that our recent appeal, contained in written declaration no 71/2009, came at a favourable moment in the Commission's work, which - I hope - augurs well for its rapid and reliable implementation."
"I voted for this report concerning the setting up of a European Partnership for Action against Cancer for the period 2009-2013."
"The aim of this partnership is to establish a framework for identifying and sharing information, capacity and expertise in cancer prevention and control."
"The Member States must act together, particularly in the area of screening."
"In Europe, one in three people will develop cancer during their lifetime."
"However, one third of all cancers are preventable, and prevention offers the most cost-effective, long-term strategy for reducing the burden of cancer."
"I am pleased that the majority of this House voted in favour of the proposals that I made as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, such as the need to give greater encouragement to public-private partnerships to stimulate research and screening, particularly in the field of medical imaging."
"Even though health is the responsibility of each Member State, we have everything to gain from adopting a global approach to cancer prevention and treatment, and that is what I am supporting here."
"In this way, Europe will be able to enable closer cooperation with the stakeholders involved (civil society, various organisations and others) in order to disseminate as effectively as possible best practice in the area, and in particular to improve the effectiveness of patient care by taking patients' psychosocial and mental well-being into consideration."
"This partnership would also help ensure that associated problems, such as the inequalities faced by patients with the disease, are taken into account."
"This is fundamental to improving patients' everyday life."
"I also welcome the adoption, on 19 April, of a written statement, which I supported, calling on all EU Member States to introduce breast cancer screening nationwide and the Commission to draw up a follow-up report every two years."
"Breast cancer remains the main cause of death among women aged 35 to 59."
"According to the World Health Organization, cancer is the main cause of death worldwide."
"Currently, one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer, and one in four Europeans dies from this disease."
"Unfortunately, the aging of society will also contribute to an increase in the incidence of cancer in the next few decades."
"I think that in order to tackle this growth we must improve national plans for the fight against cancer and run an even more effective information campaign for people in the EU."
"Children should be taught a healthy lifestyle from their earliest years, which in the future will result in a reduced number of cases."
"According to the experts, one third of cases can be prevented, but for this to happen, the EU must increase funding for the fight against cancer."
"This would make it possible to carry out scientific research and a wide-ranging programme of anti-cancer prophylactic measures in all the countries of the Union."
"Public health is one of the EU's priorities."
"The fight against all forms of cancer is part of this, as this disease is responsible for the deaths of millions of European citizens every year."
"We all know that prevention and early diagnosis are essential to effectively fighting cancer, so the vast majority of efforts must be focused on these areas."
"It is very important to develop efforts in the fight against the three types of cancer that cause the most deaths - lung cancer, colon cancer and breast cancer - without neglecting the others."
"in writing. - (DE) Throughout Europe cancer is the greatest threat to health and the death rates from cancer are high."
"Out of 3 million new sufferers, 1.7 million will not survive."
"Early diagnosis and treatment could reduce this figure significantly."
"We must not only invest in treatment across Europe, but also provide support for preventive measures."
"We must make transnational cooperation our priority, so that we can permanently stop the spread of cancer."
"This report should been seen as a positive step in the right direction and that is why I have voted in favour of it."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on Action Against Cancer: European Partnership."
"All measures intended to fight cancer and minimise its effects should be supported."
"Medical science is still unable to stop cancer, which is becoming one of the greatest plagues of humanity."
"The knowledge that, in 2006, cancer was the second most common cause of death is horrifying."
"There are many causes of cancer, or often the causes cannot be defined and diagnosed."
"However, it is possible to prevent cancer and limit its effects in about 30% of cases. To achieve this, suitable national testing programmes are needed."
"The European Union, acting in the interests of its citizens and because of the need to ensure their safety, must provide for the development of appropriate methods of early diagnosis of disease, preventative measures and advanced therapy."
"In many Member States it has been possible to achieve progress in the fight against cancer in different ways, including use of anti-smoking strategies and specific methods of prevention."
"Similar measures should be put in place throughout the Union, but with greater intensity and effectiveness."
"The forecasts for the coming years, in terms of cancer incidence and mortality, are not optimistic."
"The knowledge that in spite of various methods of diagnosis and treatment, very many people are going to die of cancer, is always bitter and sad."
"However, let us take care that our citizens are aware that in this matter they have full support."
"Reducing cancer cases in the European Union by 15% between now and 2020: that is the ambitious objective of the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer for the period 2009-2013."
"It is an objective that is supported today by the European Parliament vote on the Peterle report."
"It is a response that is up to the challenge, even though, according to the World Health Organisation, in 2010 cancer will become the main cause of death in the world, ahead of cardiovascular diseases."
"In 2010 alone, 3 million Europeans will develop cancer, and nearly 2 million people will die of the disease."
"We urgently need to do more in the area of systematic screening of the most common cancers: lung cancer, colorectal cancer and breast cancer."
"Encouraging a revolution in oncology also means promoting research into the carcinostatic properties of some foods, and encouraging early screening of tumours through the state-of-the-art biomarker technique: complex urinary or blood tests."
"These are all measures resolutely aimed at diversifying the provision of patient care so that 2010 is the year of reaction and so that the European Union not only supports, but also inspires national programmes for action against cancer."
"in writing. - I voted in favour, of course, of this important report, crucial for preventing cancer."
"I strongly support the European Parliament report on the Commission communication on Action Against Cancer: European Partnership."
"According to estimates by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, one in three Europeans is diagnosed with cancer, and one in four Europeans dies from this disease."
"This year, 3 million Europeans will develop cancer and nearly 2 million are expected to die of cancer."
"In Poland, about 100 000 people fall victim to cancer every year, and 70 000 die."
"The fight against cancer is one of the permanent areas of EU action in the field of public health."
"The Treaty of Lisbon stressed the competence of the Union to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States for the protection and improvement of health."
"Specific action on these intentions is found in the Commission initiative entitled European Partnership for Action Against Cancer for the period 2009-2013."
"The objectives of the partnership, and in particular its prophylactic measures, are essential to limit the incidence of cancer."
"The restrictions placed on the financial resources for these objectives are disturbing."
"In the communication, goals have been set for a 10-year period, whereas the Community budget ensures only short-term financial support."
"Therefore, I appeal for: increased subsidies, especially for prophylactic programmes in the area of regional policy and the European Social Fund; more effective use of resources available in the Seventh Framework Programme, for example for better coordination of scientific research; and increased resources to be planned in the new Financial Perspective."
"in writing. - (LT) Cancer is the biggest health problem in Europe and indeed worldwide."
"Sadly, today cancer is still epidemically increasing."
"With more than 3 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths in the EU each year, cancer represents the second most important cause of death and morbidity."
"Currently one in three people in the EU will be diagnosed with cancer during their life-time and experts predict that the cancer burden will increase sharply due to the ageing population."
"Urgent action must be taken to improve cancer control and prevention in the EU."
"The situation is particularly serious in Lithuania."
"Statistical indicators for the various types of cancer are among the worst in the whole of the EU."
"Therefore, I particularly welcome the European Parliament Resolution on combating cancer in the enlarged EU and the European Commission's European Partnership for Action Against Cancer for the period 2009-2013, a new attempt to join all the stakeholders to work together in the spirit of fruitful partnership."
"Cancer is a social and political problem, not just a health problem."
"To solve it there need to be joint actions at European, national, regional and local level."
"I would like to stress that the Treaty of Lisbon clearly defines the Union's competence to support, coordinate or supplement the actions of the Member States."
"The objective we all share is to help Member States combat cancer and provide a framework for identifying and sharing information, capacity and expertise in cancer prevention and control."
"Today, we voted on the motion for a resolution drafted by my Slovenian colleague Mr Peterle, of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), on the fight against cancer."
"Of course, I endorsed adoption of the motion of the European Commission to set up a European Partnership for Action Against Cancer for the period 2009-2013."
"This new form of cooperation is intended to support the efforts of Member States in the fight against cancer."
"Medical statistics show that over 3 million new cases and 1.7 million deaths are recorded every year in Europe."
"This means that every year cancer holds second place among the most serious diseases and causes of death."
"As part of the European Partnership, Member States should prepare, as quickly as possible, integrated plans for fighting this cruel disease, so that it will be possible to reduce incidence by 15% by 2020."
"However, it must not be forgotten that in this uneven fight the most important factor is prevention."
"This is the most cost-effective measure, because one third of cancer cases can be avoided."
"Therefore, preventative measures should be supported both as part of medical practice and in the context of ever more healthy lifestyles."
"The importance of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be attributed to their crucial role in starting a veritable revolution in the world of science, not only by proclaiming the birth of the knowledge-based society, but also by making a sustainable approach to the use of natural resources possible."
"In the light of these considerations, it is impossible, in the specific case of new technologies dedicated to energy efficiency, to ignore the fact that ICTs are an important resource for ensuring that progress goes hand in hand with respect for the planet, guaranteeing as they do that households and industry can both benefit economically from savings."
"The policy of energy saving will characterise the sustainability of the European social model, which is why I decided to vote in favour of the report."
"Switching to smart metering may reduce energy consumption by up to 10% at European level because it would facilitate the two-way transfer of information between network operators, energy suppliers and consumers."
"The analyses show that the smart use of information and communications technology (ICT) can reduce energy consumption in buildings, which currently account for 40% of the total energy consumption in Europe, by up to 17%."
"All these figures amount to the reduction of carbon emissions by up to 27% in the transport sector alone."
"All these forecasts only serve to encourage us towards making full use of state-of-the-art technologies."
"Even though it will not be possible to implement these technologies in the short term throughout the European Union in a uniform manner, it is important that all Member States are aware of the option of using state-of-the-art technologies to cut carbon emissions, bearing in mind the extremely ambitious targets for the Europe 2020 agenda."
"The construction and transport sectors feature among the large consumers of energy and may accelerate the implementation of state-of-the-art technological systems."
"In the same way, the use of natural resources may be less harmful to the environment and produce less carbon with the help of the new technologies."
"Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) play an essential role in promoting European economic growth."
"Their influence on the energy sector also involves a profound change in our society, making it more decentralised and flexible, with distribution as a byword for greater wealth."
"The use of ICT and grid technologies allows us to improve the efficiency of our energy consumption by, for example, developing electricity distribution grids, smart buildings, smart homes and smart metering as well as eco-efficient transport."
"It is, however, important to continue to make use of the opportunities for innovation that ICT offer us."
"The development of an innovative European smart grid is essential, with instruments to measure and monitor the efficiency of energy consumption, implementing smart metering in accordance with the timetable set out in the third energy market package."
"In this way, consumers will be able to manage their energy consumption, evening out the demand curve."
"ICT can also play an important role in measuring and quantifying the global effects of climate change and evaluating climate protection measures, thereby contributing to the fine-tuning of climate policy."
"I voted for the report on mobilising Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to facilitate the transition to an energy-efficient, low-carbon economy."
"ICT could acquire an important role in alleviating the effects of climate change by reducing energy consumption, increasing energy efficiency and integrating renewable energies."
"At a time when reducing emissions of CO2 and greenhouse gases along with investment in renewable energy and 'green' technology are priorities, this report is extremely timely."
"It is therefore essential to consider the presentation of measures for the mobilisation of information and communications technologies, in order to make the transition to a more efficient energy economy possible at the least possible cost to the public and to companies."
"It is truly crucial to promote sustainable growth that is reflected in the well-being of the current population and economy, and also in solidarity towards future generations."
"Information and communication technologies can make a significant contribution to the EU economy's energy efficiency, notably in the buildings and transport sector."
"In this context, I welcome the Commission's efforts to promote smart metering and smart grids in energy production, distribution and use."
"I would stress, in particular, the call on the Member States to facilitate the availability of broadband internet to all EU citizens in order to ensure equal access to online services."
"There can be no doubt that mobilising information and communication technologies (ICT) can facilitate the transition to an energy-efficient economy, since this is also a way of reducing energy consumption, increasing energy security and helping to curb environmental damage, particularly greenhouse-gas emissions."
"Nonetheless, we know that progress is slow in harnessing the potential of energy efficiency and energy savings, not only because existing economic interest groups are looking after their own interests, but also because of the low level of aid for the necessary changes."
"We therefore support various proposals included in the report, specifically those that incentivise the harnessing of ICT in the planning of a new transport policy and increase intermodality in the transport sector, or those that call on the Commission to develop a different vision for aid priorities, taking into account these issues of mobilisation of ICT to facilitate the transition to an energy-efficient economy in various areas beyond transport and mobility, such as industry, health and housing."
"For some years now, the European Union has been setting itself important objectives in relation to energy saving and the reduction of carbon emissions."
"The information and communication technologies (ICT) sector is without doubt one means of improving the energy efficiency of the individual Member States."
"ICTs can, in fact, help to monitor and manage energy consumption, and to provide new applications and technologies to improve the use of natural resources and foster the use of cleaner production and industrial processes."
"The broad public consultation process launched by the European Commission clarified the manner in which ICTs can help to improve energy efficiency."
"The European Commission has calculated that ICT-based systems can cut energy consumption in buildings - currently put at some 40% of overall energy consumption in Europe - by up to 17%, and transport carbon emissions by up to 27%."
"Urban organisation achieved through the use of ICTs can substantially reduce the energy impact of urban areas."
"Therefore, action should be taken to disseminate good practice and raise awareness among local decision makers of the benefits that ICTs have to offer."
"The European Union has reaffirmed its commitment to a 20% reduction in carbon emissions by 2020."
"It will be difficult to maintain this commitment without fully exploiting the potential offered by ICTs."
"ICTs can, in actual fact, significantly reduce CO2 emissions."
"ICTs are responsible for 1.75% of the carbon emissions in the services sector in Europe and produce 0.25% of the emissions associated with the production of ICT-based equipment and of electronic consumer goods."
"The remaining 98% of emissions come from other sectors of the economy and of society."
"It is therefore a good idea to harmonise the methods for measuring and quantifying energy performance so as to have data that enable us to develop innovative energy-saving strategies and to prevent the phenomenon of 'green disinformation'."
"I should like to point out, in this context, that ICTs can play a vital role in the achievement of fundamental objectives, insofar as they are present in nearly every sector of the economy and help to increase productivity by more than 40%."
"For these reasons I reaffirm my full support for this strategy, which combines appropriate economic and industrial development with an environmentally sustainable strategy."
"in writing. - (RO) Information and communications technologies (ICT) offer in every Member State a means of increasing energy efficiency and provide new applications and technologies for improving the use of natural resources and for transforming industrial production and processes into an eco-efficient economy."
"ICT-based systems can reduce energy consumption in buildings, which currently account for 40% of the total energy consumed in Europe, by up to 17%, as well as carbon emissions in the transport sector by up to 27%."
"The ICT sector employs 6.6 million people in the 27 EU Member States, stimulates the innovative capacity of every sector and contributes more than 40% of the global increase in productivity."
"The European Commission and Committee of the Regions must urgently produce the 'practical guide for local and regional authorities' on how to improve energy performance through the innovative use of ICT."
"This will set out the way in which the authorities can use ICT as part of their plans for climate change. It will also describe how the cohesion funds can support business partnerships for creating innovative ICT applications in order to encourage and support cities and municipalities in the use of ICT for reducing emissions."
"in writing. - We, Greens, voted in favour of this report."
"All the original parts of the text that some groups wanted to delete remained in."
"in writing. - I was rapporteur for the Environment Committee's opinion for this report, and I am acutely aware of the potential for the ICT sector to deliver considerable energy savings in the European Union, particularly in buildings and the transport sector."
"But we must also bear in mind the effects of the so-called 'digital divide', which can be seen both within and between Member States."
"It perpetuates social and economic inequality and it reduces the capacity of ICT to deliver wide-reaching benefits in terms of energy efficiency."
"The importance of access to high-speed internet for everyone is paramount."
"Member States, with the assistance of the Commission, should make more efforts to roll out the necessary infrastructure to ensure that all European citizens and businesses can benefit from the available technologies."
"This would directly address the inequality and injustice created by the digital divide, and is the only way to ensure that the energy-efficient potential of ICT is fully realised."
"Taking into account the fact that the measures put in place to achieve the objective of 20% energy savings by 2020 are working too slowly, there is a need to increase and accelerate innovativeness in information and communication technologies and to achieve a significant increase in the proportion of energy obtained from renewable sources."
"It should be noted that when the transport sector grows, carbon dioxide emissions also rise rapidly."
"Therefore, emphasis should be placed on applying information and communication technologies in this very sector, in order not only to reduce the level of emissions, but also to prevent it from rising."
"ICT solutions must be included when planning the new European transport policy."
"This can bring about a reduction in traffic density in transport, which will have beneficial effects on the natural environment."
"All of these measures will not only bring measurable benefits for the climate, but will also reduce the costs associated with energy use and will lead to the creation of environment-friendly jobs."
"However, it should be borne in mind that the new Member States are not able to adapt so quickly to the requirements introduced by the European Union."
"We should also take account of the interests of these countries, because they constitute a significant group which still uses traditional sources of energy."
"Time and financial resources are needed to change this."
"in writing. - (LT) I support the European Commission's initiative to use information and communications technologies (ICT) in order to improve the Union's energy efficiency and increase the competitiveness of European industry."
"According to the calculations presented by the European Commission, the use of ICT is an excellent measure allowing us to reduce energy consumption and at the same time reduce the amount of carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 27%, something which is very important."
"This would also reduce damage to the environment."
"I completely agree with and support the position expressed by the rapporteur that the application of ICT will stimulate European industry and the new technologies market, and this would contribute to market resuscitation or the creation of new jobs."
"I believe that it is necessary to take all measures to both begin applying ICT in those Member States, where it has not yet been applied, and improve it where it is already being applied."
"In particular I would like to stress the importance of ICT in the planning of a new European transport policy."
"Logistics are an important factor in the rationalisation of transport and reduction of carbon emissions."
"It is important to recognise the need to increase public and private investment in ICT tools in order to develop smart energy infrastructures for transport."
"The use of intelligent transport systems (ITS) applied to road transport and interfaced with other transport modes can help reduce congestion and its harmful effects on the environment."
"As a member of the Committee on Regional Development (REGI), I would like to stress that we must encourage Member States to disseminate good practice and raise awareness among local decision makers of the benefits that ICTs have to offer."
"The European Commission White Paper on adapting to climate change contains many ideas on which we must focus, now and in the future, in order to curb this threat linked to global warming."
"I particularly welcome, therefore, the passage in the report that emphasises the importance of integrating the adaptation dimension into all EU policies, whether in relation to agriculture or fisheries, or linked to forest management, with a horizontal and cross-sector approach that can guarantee the consistency of the measures that will be implemented from time to time."
"Europe is going through a period when it needs to recognise the pressing urgency to take measures to reduce the impact of human activity on the climate."
"The White Paper on climate change is a step forward towards standardising the actions aimed at cutting carbon emissions at European level."
"In view of its ambitious target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, the European Union needs to move much faster than it is at the moment."
"Member States, whether new or old, are duty bound to make increased, equal efforts and realise that preventing or treating a disease in its initial stage has a higher rate of success than treating a chronic condition."
"It would be sad if Europe realises too late that climate change can affect the chance of agriculture being viable as a main source of food for both Europe's and the world's population We are already facing extreme weather conditions, drought and flooding every year."
"It is difficult to imagine at present how it could be worse than this."
"However, the experts are not very optimistic."
"This is why actions aimed at mitigating the impact of human activity on the climate are key to continuing normality."
"I welcome the European Commission's initiative to present a broad policy framework for European action on climate adaptation policy."
"However, mitigation and adaptation measures must not be separate."
"I would stress the importance of the Emission Trading System (ETS) Directive, under which Member States should earmark at least 50% of ETS revenues for both mitigation and adaptation measures."
"I also believe that additional measures must be prioritised to promote the EU's strategy aimed at achieving a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020, with a view to making this objective legally binding at Union level."
"Of the adaptation measures presented, I would stress solidarity among EU Member States towards disadvantaged regions and those most affected by climate change."
"To achieve this solidarity, it is important for the Commission to consider the reinforcement of public funds devoted to international cooperation in the forthcoming 8th Framework Programme for R&D to support its fight against climate change."
"I would also stress the importance of the role of research and technology in developing a low-carbon society, in view of the Commission's recent communication on the Strategic Energy Technology Plan, and the logic of intervention between the public and private sectors as well as between Union, national and regional financing."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of this resolution which welcomes the Commission White Paper on an EU strategy for climate change adaptation and proposes a range of measures across several policy fields."
"Even if we succeed in keeping global warming at safe levels, climate change entails unavoidable consequences which require adaptation efforts."
"Climate-proofing and adaptation need to be mainstreamed across policy areas, especially those concerning water, soil, agriculture and fisheries, and coastal areas."
"Biodiversity is at risk, but there is also a need to ensure that urban, transport and infrastructure planning does take climate change into account."
"Civil protection structures have to prioritise preparedness for floods and droughts."
"It is important to keep the social and public health implications of this challenge in mind."
"It may gravely impact on respiratory health and increase the incidence of vector-borne diseases."
"Deprived communities, poor children and elderly people are amongst the most vulnerable to climate change health risks."
"Revenue generated by the Emissions Trading Scheme must contribute to the adaptation effort and the EU budget needs to reflect the urgency of coping with such challenges."
"I voted for the report on the Commission White Paper: 'Adapting to climate change: Towards a European framework for action'."
"Adaptation measures are necessary in order to meet the challenges posed by climate change."
"I believe that adaptation to climate change is necessary and will allow us to improve current emergency management systems, management that could be more efficient by combining satellite and ground-based observations."
"As I said yesterday regarding the vote on the Le Foll report on EU agriculture and climate change, 'environmental concerns, whilst legitimate and necessary, must be duly weighed against the impact of the proposals in terms of agricultural sustainability and productivity'."
"The same is true in all sectors of activity, so it is essential that the EU create a strategy for addressing climate change, making a serious commitment to sustainable development and seeking to reduce its carbon emissions, without thereby putting its productive activities - especially industry - at risk."
"Any climate change policy must - particularly against a backdrop of economic and financial crisis -seek economic efficiency and sustainability, putting innovation and research at the service of new techniques and solutions that are more environmentally friendly and equally efficient and competitive."
"The focus must be on clean sources of energy, on the more efficient use of natural resources, and on strong investment in research and technologies that are more environmentally friendly; this will make it possible to maintain European competitiveness and will allow the creation of more jobs within a framework of sustainable development."
"The EU must retain and reinforce its leadership role in the international fight against climate change."
"Scientific research in this area is essential if we are to take a path that is right and safe, whether for combating climate change or for adapting to it."
"The issue of adaptation is cross-cutting and affects several sectoral policies."
"There must be greater political coordination by Member States in these areas."
"In fact, I advocate making national adaptation plans based on a common European framework obligatory."
"I believe that we must have common European policies in areas such as, for example, water, energy and forests; for example, I would reiterate the need for a European charter of risks for the coastal borders."
"Analysis of the risks represented by climate change to Europe's most vulnerable regions is urgently required."
"I also believe that there must be European targets for the efficiency of public water-supply systems."
"I would also highlight that natural ecosystems are the Earth's most important carbon sinks, sequestering 50% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to both mitigation and adaptation."
"This report is in keeping with the belief that climate change is global, disastrous and inevitably human in origin."
"However, just like this belief, which is now almost religious and no longer subject to dispute, it is excessive."
"Like everything excessive, it is ridiculous."
"Thus, without even waiting for any scientific assessment, an absolute precautionary principle should be applied to cope with the worst possible scenarios in terms of the possible impact of so-called global warming on ecosystems, but also on habitable areas, industrial facilities, and so on. I note in passing that such prudence is rarely applied to other measures linked to the environment and human health, such as GMOs for example."
"On the basis of real or imaginary risks, ranging from diseases possibly linked to global warming to forest fires reputed to be solely due to this same phenomenon, via floods and the overheating of central power stations, we are being urged to accept the interference of the Commission and of European policies in absolutely all areas, up to and including the use of the smallest plot of land."
"It is a shame that so many trees, recognised carbon reservoirs that they are, were sacrificed to print this text."
"As the poet said: hey lumberjack, stop a moment."
"Unavoidable climate change is forcing society and the European Union economy to accommodate to a new reality."
"I think there is a need for an adaptation policy which should be appropriate to the character and type of changes which are taking place, and should also include a strategy for the protection of areas which are most at risk."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur and think that in order to coordinate these measures better it is extremely important to implement a system of information exchange and monitoring at international level, but also at regional and local levels."
"I am pleased, above all, by the emphasis on the significant role of the common agricultural policy, which in the process of adaptation to climate change plays a key role as a guardian of ecosystems and biological diversity."
"Therefore, I think projects which prevent or alleviate the effects of droughts and floods, supporting farmers who work in difficult conditions, are very important."
"I voted in favour of the entire motion for a resolution on the Commission White Paper entitled 'Adapting to climate change: Towards a European framework for action' because I believe that it is of special interest to Europe, in general, and to Italy, in particular, due to its geoclimatic characteristics."
"There are, in fact, obvious difficulties in managing Italy's hydrologic resources, as is clear not only from the frequent droughts in the south during the summer months, but also from certain episodes of flooding, such as the one that occurred in December with the River Serchio in Tuscany."
"In Italy we also have the terrible problem of summer fires, and that is why it is absolutely crucial to improve safety conditions."
"Although the draft White Paper is at present only an initial framework of reference, I believe that it certainly makes a significant contribution, especially where the management of emergencies is concerned."
"At the same time it outlines a general strategic approach on increasing the resilience of the EU to the impacts of climate change."
"A large proportion of Parliament, like the Spanish delegation of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, has formally opposed paragraph 41 of this resolution, which asks for the principle of subsidiarity to be applied to land policy."
"We all recognise the diversity that exists between the different regions of the Union, but it is precisely for this reason that, as the resolution states, Southern Europe suffers much more from the pressure of climate change, and needs Europe and its common policies."
"This is a question of solidarity that the whole of the EU would benefit from."
"We therefore deeply regret the disappearance of the first proposal from the text, in which Mr Prodi asked for the Directive on land to be unblocked in the Council."
"It is crucial that we launch this legislative instrument, which is essential for adaptation and, in particular, for tackling the risk of deterioration and desertification."
"It is true that the risk is more present in Southern Europe, but let us not forget that climate change affects all of Europe's environmental assets."
"Those to whom this resolution is addressed should know that a large proportion of Parliament is still calling for a supportive and common policy."
"in writing. - We, as Greens, voted in favour of this report."
"The good new is that the amendment to delete the focus on nuclear safety was defeated."
"The results of work conducted by scientists show that the effects of climate change are going to have an increasing influence on the natural environment and the economy as well as on our daily lives."
"Therefore, taking action intended to adapt to the present and future effects of climate change is a serious challenge for society throughout the world."
"Decisions concerning the best ways of adapting to climate change must be made based on reliable scientific and economic analyses, but not all regions have access to information of the right quality."
"Therefore, the idea to create a climate change monitoring platform would seem to be a good one."
"The platform would be useful for the exchange of information, experience and best practices at European, regional and local levels."
"However, I am not certain if in assuming the role of leader in the international fight against global climate warming, as is recommended in the document, the EU is not trying to take on too much responsibility for global affairs."
"It seems to me that when we are having to deal with challenges such as the economic crisis and the need to create growth, we should not be treating expenditure on the fight against global climate warming as a priority."
"Irrespective of the measures which will be put in place for adapting to climate change, it should also be borne in mind that some countries will be exposed to exceptionally high costs of implementation of the adaptation policy, and leaving these countries without any financial support may lead to an increase in the differences in development of different Member States."
"In my report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I regretted the lack of consideration given to the transport sector in the European strategy for adapting to climate change, when it is of considerable economic importance and one of the principal sources of CO2 emissions."
"I therefore welcome the fact that this report places transport once again at the heart of this problem."
"We must make substantial efforts to successfully help enterprises and users adapt to climate change."
"The success of our policy depends on adequate and innovative methods of funding being mobilised to limit as much as possible the impact on people, ecological balance and economic activities."
"Furthermore, our strategy must take into account sensitive geographical areas, such as coastal, marine and mountain areas, which are particularly vulnerable and will bear the brunt of climate change if we fail to take suitable protection measures."
"Our Parliament must urgently adopt effective adaptation mechanisms for the transport sector, which must no longer simply be the cause of the problem but must become a solution in the fight against climate change."
"in writing. - Securing value for money, effective management, and the elimination of fraud are key priorities of the ECR Group for the EU budget. We therefore support the thrust of the Cozzolino report and most of its conclusions."
"The ECR group cannot, however, endorse the concept of a European Public Prosecutor."
"This office risks being a dangerous first step towards European competence for aspects of criminal law and the focus on its creation is a distraction from making existing systems and bodies work effectively."
"As the ECR amendment to remove the paragraph supporting progress towards a European Public Prosecutor was rejected, the ECR abstained on the final vote."
"Although I, like the rapporteur, consider it positive that the number of financial irregularities reported to the Commission by the Member States fell from EUR 1 024 million in 2007 to EUR 783.2 million in 2008, I believe that the goal will be to achieve a level of EUR 0 million of financial irregularities per annum."
"In order to achieve that, I consider it essential to adopt measures that establish greater transparency in the fight against tax fraud - especially in VAT - and all financial crimes; greater cooperation between governments in the case of cross-border fraud; improvements in the quality of data and constant updating of national databases; and rapid responses by governments to requests for information."
"There must also be better administration and monitoring of applications for cohesion funds, and there must be provision for applying sanctions to Member States that do not make good use of these funds."
"I would also stress the essential contribution of the European Anti-Fraud Office to reducing these figures."
"The annual report on the protection of the Communities' financial interests for 2008 records that the financial impact of irregularities, as far as they have been identified, fell from EUR 1 024 million in 2007 to EUR 783.2 million in 2008, with reductions being recorded in all spending areas except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds."
"I would stress, in particular, the need to include information on irregularities that will clarify the proportion of the total resources affected by errors and suspected cases of fraud."
"Combating fraud and corruption is an important duty of the European institutions and all Member States, which must provide all necessary resources to combat these scourges effectively so as to protect the financial interests of the Union and its taxpayers."
"At this time of economic and financial crisis, not a single euro of the EU budget can be wasted, and this is even truer when such waste is a result of fraud that leads to Union funds being paid out inappropriately."
"Over the years we have seen irregularities decrease significantly."
"Nevertheless, we cannot be satisfied with reducing these irregularities to marginal amounts or to almost zero."
"The EU has to adopt budgetary control mechanisms that are effective at early prevention and detection of fraud, so that public funds are only made available when they are actually going to be used correctly, notwithstanding effective punishment for those who break the rules by attempting to illegitimately appropriate such funds, which are scarce by nature."
"in writing. - (DE) For me the fight against fraud is a very important concern, in particular with regard to the regional funds and the pre-accession funds."
"However, the proposed measures for combating fraud have too much of a centralist focus."
"I have therefore abstained from voting."
"I am pleased that the financial impact of irregularities, as far as they have been identified, fell from EUR 1 024 million in 2007 to EUR 783.2 million in 2008 (the fall affected all spending areas, except direct expenditure and pre-accession funds)."
"I fully support the work done by the Commission, and I would point out that the fight against fraud and corruption is a clear duty of the European institutions and of all the Member States."
"Given the particular economic situation plaguing the whole of Europe, I agree on the need to safeguard the Union's financial interests and to combat organised crime which, according to national indicators, is increasing its capacity for collusion within institutions, precisely by means of fraud against the EU budget."
"I therefore think it crucial to enact effective legislation to improve administrative cooperation in tackling harmful tax practices and to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market."
"In this sense, I support the proposal for a Council directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation, while stressing the importance of increasing the responsibility of the Member States, starting with the quality of the information entered into databases."
"in writing. - In the final vote, I said in favour."
"The amendment by the ECR Group, which I voted against, was defeated."
"It is worth noting that in 2008 there was a significant fall in irregularities in comparison with the previous year."
"The greatest improvement occurred in the area of spending on agriculture."
"The report shows that the estimated amount of irregularities fell by 34%."
"However, the greatest growth was recorded in the area of pre-accession funds, where the wrong spending of resources rose by as much as 90.6%, but it should be remembered that they are not Member States and they lack experience."
"Despite this improvement in the situation in 2008, a certain part of EU budgetary resources is still being badly spent."
"To a certain extent, this results from a lack of effective mechanisms of control and supervision."
"The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which has existed since 1999, has had many successes in the fight against embezzlement."
"However, it is essential to guarantee its full operational independence."
"I support the rapporteur's proposal to enable OLAF to draw more extensively on internal audits carried out by the Commission, rather than relying only on information provided by officials or Member States."
"What role should be played by Member States and their systems of supervision and auditing?"
"Combating fraud in European projects should be a priority for us."
"Honesty and responsibility in spending the limited means of the EU budget will allow us to save funds, which can then be used in fighting the consequences of the recession."
"We must not forget that the resources in the EU budget belong to all of us - to the taxpayers."
"Therefore, we should guarantee that they are spent in the most effective way."
"I would like to stress that combating fraud and corruption is an important duty of the European institutions and all Member States."
"However, I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that in some countries corruption in the distribution of European Union funds is directly linked to the discrediting of policies conducted within these countries."
"Separate political and financial clans are forming in these countries that aim to control the distribution of European Union funds."
"Therefore, the European Parliament, the European Commission and other important European Union institutions should draw attention to discrimination against and discrediting of policies, political organisations, political opponents and opposition leaders at national level."
"The European Union that fosters democracy must firstly ensure that the opposition parties of its Member States have the opportunity to work and express themselves freely and control actions for corruption prevention."
"I would also like to draw attention to the fact that European Union money should be used to improve the infrastructure of Member States, to educate people and such things. Investing European money purely in infrastructure would benefit both the country and its trade."
"There would no longer be 'poor' business people who ask for but do not receive support."
"Furthermore, in this way we would not need to control the distribution of European Union funds to thousands of stakeholders, that is aid recipients, which would mean that thousands of racketed subjects would also disappear."
"Therefore, all the attention should be directed at the public use of that money."
"I wish to take this important opportunity to comment on the vote on the Luxembourg-based European Investment Bank's annual report in order to insist, as I have already done in some questions, on the importance of increasing the budget for the EIB's financial instruments in support of the city centre development and regeneration plans."
"The instruments that currently exist, such as the JESSICA Fund, are one of the few financial engineering instruments that a region or municipality can use to finance urban development projects."
"The interventions also extend to council housing, but only in relation to areas that complement the project and to the energy renovation and improvement of buildings."
"I therefore take this opportunity to stress that, in my opinion, the JESSICA Fund should be extended to the financing of new (obviously environmentally friendly) buildings too, since in this way it would help local authorities to address the housing problem in our cities as well."
"I welcome the 2008 annual report of the European Investment Bank (EIB), and encourage it to continue its activities to promote the development of the European economy and foster growth, stimulate employment, and promote interregional and social cohesion."
"I also welcome the importance given by the EIB to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to sustainable energy and the mitigation of climate change, and to the investments in the convergence regions of the EU particularly hard hit by the recent economic slowdown."
"The EIB responded quickly to the global economic crisis, in particular through the Economic Recovery Plan, and for those Member States which have been most severely hit by the crisis."
"I call, however, for future reports to detail major loans supplementing European Regional Development Fund grants to regions implementing technologically advanced programmes or programmes related to renewable or clean energy supplies."
"In the same way, the reports on the investment facility should include information on the results of programmes financed."
"By making adequate funding available, the EIB should play a greater role in supporting infrastructure investment, green technologies, innovation and SMEs, as part of the Europe 2020 Strategy."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) plays an essential role in helping Member States face up to the serious economic, financial and social crisis."
"With this in mind, I believe that the increased funds allocated, in particular, to the European Union's cohesion policy have been crucial in reducing the impact on the least-favoured and worst-hit regions."
"The increased funding for small and medium-sized enterprises, which represent the majority of Europe's enterprise, and the extra funding for research and development would help to further alleviate the effects of this crisis."
"Therefore, bearing in mind that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force and the current and future challenges that are emerging for a European Union that is in a difficult economic and social situation, it is essential to reinforce the activities of the European Investment Bank, make its activities more transparent and set the right priorities for it."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) was established in 1958 by the Treaty of Rome."
"The EIB, as the long-term lending bank of the European Union, lends money to the public and private sectors for projects of European interest, using the financial markets and its own funds."
"Its main target is to contribute to the integration, a balanced and sustainable development as well as an economic and social cohesion of the EU Member States."
"In 2008, the EIB had to face unprecedented challenges, as the global economic crisis has reached the European Union's economies as well."
"In terms of crisis management, I am pleased to highlight the EIB's quick response to the global economic crisis by self-financing an increase of its capital and hence raising its volume of lending in support of the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"I therefore welcome the EIB's annual report for 2008 and the adoption of this report, which encourages it to continue its activities to promote the development of the European economy and foster growth, stimulate employment, and promote interregional and social cohesion."
"The European Investment Bank (EIB) plays a very important role in the EU's economy, because it is the guarantor of funding for operations inside Europe that are connected to the following: ensuring economic and social cohesion; preparing for the knowledge economy; developing trans-European transport and access networks; supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); protecting and improving the environment; and ensuring sustainable, competitive and secure energy."
"It will not be possible to implement the 'Europe 2020' Strategy without the support of the EIB, which will have to make available the funds necessary to carry out projects in the areas of infrastructure, green technology, innovation and SMEs."
"The EIB has seen its role expand in 2008 as a result of the financial crisis."
"Against the backdrop of a liquidity crisis, the EIB has continued to grant loans to the public and private sectors for projects of European interest, using the financial markets and own resources."
"In addition to stimulating the national economies, the EU also took a decision concerning the European Economic Recovery Plan, assigning an important role to the EIB, especially with regard to the enhanced financing for SMEs, energy from renewable sources and clean transport."
"As a response to the crisis, the EIB has significantly revised upwards its targets: in order to help businesses and to encourage economic recovery, the EIB has substantially increased the volume of its lending, disbursing EUR 10 billion more than expected."
"In particular, loans to SMEs have increased by 42%."
"Furthermore, the Bank has developed new risk-sharing financial instruments, simplified lending procedures and accelerated the implementation of projects in the Member States and in the sectors that are most severely affected by the crisis."
"The report stresses the positive effects of these measures, while at the same time calls for a thorough follow-up of the real effects of the support programmes provided for SMEs."
"in writing. - That was an easy one."
"I voted in favour in the final vote."
"The joint motion for a resolution on the recent inter-ethnic atrocities in Nigeria, on which we are voting, seems satisfactory from the point of view of the principles and the guidelines that our House wishes to pass on to the other European institutions that are responsible for the EU's external action."
"We have to take action to ensure the political stabilisation of Nigeria and to create solid foundations for its economic and social development: we are fully aware of the general considerations; there is no shortage of them, given the wealth of natural resources in Nigeria."
"Solving the political, economic and social issues can make the environment peaceful, less subject to inter-ethnic tension and able to reject the acts of violence that, tragically, we have seen become more frequent over the last decade."
"As well as recognising the fact that the responsibility for the mass violence between Christians and Muslims should be ascribed to both ethnic groups, we ought perhaps to have made it clear that another worrying factor, which also relates to the episodes of violence that have occurred, is the gradual penetration in Nigeria of radical Islam, a very clear expression of which is the adoption by 12 of the 36 states of sharia as the law of the land."
"However, for the general reasons stated, I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution."
"I deeply regret the recent events that took place this January and March in Jos, where hundreds of people were the victims of religious and ethnic confrontations."
"The conflict in Nigeria has roots in religious, economic, ethnic, social, historical and political reasons."
"Given that Nigeria is the eighth-largest oil producer in the world, it is regrettable that the majority of the country's inhabitants live below the poverty line."
"The adverse effects of climate change have also been contributing to the worsening of the situation in Nigeria."
"I believe that, in a country as oil-rich as Nigeria, equal access to resources and income redistribution are necessary for the peaceful resolution of these conflicts."
"I call on the Federal Government of Nigeria to ensure equal rights for all citizens, to fight the problems of control of fertile land, access to resources, unemployment, poverty, and to mitigate climate change."
"I call on the Commission to pursue dialogue with Nigeria under the Cotonou Agreement, to examine the deeper causes of the conflict, whilst giving consideration to issues that are fundamental to sustainable development, such as climate change, energy security, capacity building and education."
"I voted for the European Parliament motion for a resolution on the mass atrocities in Jos, Nigeria."
"I strongly condemn the recent violence in and around Jos, when many hundreds of people were killed in ethnic and religious clashes."
"The EU must pursue political dialogue with Nigeria, under Article 8 of the revised Cotonou Agreement, and urgently tackle issues relating to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief, as enshrined in universal, regional and national human rights instruments."
"This is not the first time that Nigeria has suffered a conflict that has threatened to split the country."
"In this respect, I would point out the civil war that ravaged the country for three years, between 1967 and 1970, and almost led to the independence of the south-east of the country."
"Although the Igbo revolt was crushed because the military power of the central government prevented Biafran independence, the truth is that the ethnic, cultural and religious differences persist and are on the increase there, making the country a classic case of a state that is under permanent threat of disintegration."
"Nigeria's borders were drawn up by the colonial powers, which paid no attention to the aforementioned differences."
"That does not, however, mean that responsibility for the country's conflicts lies essentially with Europeans."
"It is time for African leaders to abandon this tired old excuse and try to serve their own citizens lucidly and capably in both projects and proposals."
"Africa will be able to be what Africans yearn for it to be as soon as they have leaders that are up to the challenge."
"The massacres in Jos are another profoundly sad, regrettable and bloody page in the history of a country that is accumulating them at too quick a pace."
"I think that there was an urgent need for the European Parliament to condemn the ongoing massacres in Nigeria and to call for a return to peace."
"Given the instability and the fragility of the most highly populated country in Africa, where the majority of the population suffer from poverty, this motion for a resolution may act as a foundation for strengthening the political dialogue between the European Union and Nigeria, and for a more detailed study aimed at finding viable short- and long-term solutions to end this violence and to re-establish a lasting peace."
"As MEPs, I believe we have a role to play in the defence and promotion of human rights, which are violated on a daily basis in Nigeria."
"Therefore, in my opinion, the clause demanding that those guilty of violence be tried in a fair manner is fundamental."
"In the light of all these measures, which of course will not all be easy to apply, I was eager to vote in favour of this joint motion for a resolution."
"in writing. - (DE) In Nigeria there have been repeated outbreaks of violence between Christians and Muslims and each of these two groups represent around half of the population."
"These disturbances are now taking place even more frequently."
"Trivial matters are causing violent clashes."
"Even the curfew which has been in force since January and the stationing of troops in the area did not prevent new massacres from occurring."
"The fact that the long absence of President Yar'Adua plunged western Nigeria into a political crisis, that there were serious clashes between Christians and Muslims in the central Nigerian town of Jos and that the ceasefire in the oil-rich Niger delta has come to an end does not bode well for the future, following the death of the president."
"When Muslim nomads attacked Christian villages at the beginning of the year and at least 500 people were murdered, it is said that the army only responded hours after receiving the first report."
"What was lacking was an outcry from the EU."
"When the Swiss people voted against the building of minarets in a referendum, Muslim states threatened Switzerland with economic sanctions and jihad."
"However, when Christians are murdered because of their religion, the EU takes months to react."
"The European Union must act as an honest broker in this respect and respond more quickly."
"This is made clear in the motion for a resolution, which is why I have voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - I voted, of course, in favour of such an important resolution, and I supported very much the oral amendment proposed by my colleague Kiil-Nielsen to call on the Nigerian authorities to repeal the recent move by some Nigerian state governors to execute death row inmates."

"Statements by the President"
"To begin with, I would like to give you some information."
"Firstly, the Sixth International Day Against Homophobia is being observed in the European Union, today."
"Exactly 20 years ago, the World Health Organisation removed homosexuality from the International Classification of Diseases."
"The European Union is fighting discrimination on all fronts."
"This also includes homophobia."
"The obligation to protect the discriminated is embodied in our most important legal acts - in the treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is referred to in the treaty."
"Secondly, this month, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Schuman Declaration, and on 8 and 9 May, our Parliament held Open Days in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"Visitors were able to see the work of Parliament close up and learn about our everyday work."
"The buildings were open to all citizens."
"In all, over 33 000 citizens of the European Union visited Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg."
"We also had a meeting in this Chamber with 800 young people from all the countries of the European Union."
"There were 11 Members of the European Parliament with me."
"We talked with them, we sat together and discussed matters related to the Union."
"The third piece of information."
"Last week, on Tuesday 11 May, I had the great honour to present the Charlemagne Youth Prize in Aachen."
"First prize was won by the 'Train for Europe' project from Germany."
"Second place was won by a project from Ireland and third place by a project from Bulgaria."
"Young people from all countries of the Union entered the competition."
"The German project brought together representatives from 21 European countries, and 24 vocational schools worked together to design and build a train."
"The main Charlemagne Prize was presented on 13 May two days after the Youth Prize, also in Aachen, to the Prime Minister of Poland, Donald Tusk."
"Fourthly, last week, I took part in the Conference of Speakers of the European Union Parliaments in Stockholm."
"The speakers of all 40 national parliaments were represented."
"We spoke about future cooperation and also about the coming Belgian Presidency."
"The conference was organised by our friends from the Swedish Parliament, and also from the Spanish Parliament, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union."
"We are going to have regular meetings of parliamentary committees, amongst other things, and also joint sittings of European national parliaments."
"I would also like to express my good wishes and congratulations."
"Two European Union Member States, the United Kingdom and Hungary, have new governments."
"We wish them stability."
"In the European Union, we have a great need for stable governments."
"They are needed, amongst other things, to enable decisions to be made quickly."
"We represent the Community method of the European Union, but cooperation with governments is, to us, of fundamental significance for the efficiency of the European Union's activity and its effectiveness for the citizens."
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting"
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is just to remind you that this morning in Afghanistan, two soldiers of the Taurinense Brigade were killed in an attack."
"The European Union plays a difficult role on the stage of peace and war, and I ask, as the session opens, that Parliament should join in offering condolences and support to the families of the victims at this very difficult time."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had actually asked to be allowed to speak for a minute to say the same thing as my fellow Member, Mr Mauro, and so I join Mr Mauro in offering my condolences."
"I believe the entire Chamber is united in remembering the two Italian soldiers who were killed this morning."
"I believe that our sorrow must be tempered by indignation, solidarity with the families, support for the wounded and rejection of all forms of terrorism."
"However, there must also be renewed action by Europe along with individual nation states to ensure that the peace mission is even more effective and can occur under safer conditions."
"Thank you, gentlemen, for pointing this out to me."
"It is very important that we always express solidarity with the soldiers who, on our behalf, are fighting terrorism as well as various other forms of abuse in Afghanistan and other countries."
"We should express solidarity with their great commitment to our common cause, a cause which continues to be important throughout the world."
"This is our custom in the European Parliament."
"Thank you once again to both Members for drawing my attention to this."
"Mr President, while we are remembering the tragic losses in Afghanistan, we should also remember that, almost on a daily basis, we are losing British soldiers who are giving their lives in the NATO mission taking place in that country."
"We should recognise the tragic losses, and feel particular sympathy for the families of all our service personnel, from whichever country, who are serving under the auspices of NATO."
"I agree with you entirely."
"I think we all have the same view on this."
"They are Europeans who represent all of us in the fight against terrorism and all forms of violence around the world."
"They are our representatives."
"(FR) Mr President, I believe that it is in fact only right to pay tribute, as you have just done, to those who die in action."
"It is only right, too, that we spare a thought for all those workers who die each day at work because their employers do not provide them with the resources necessary to work in good conditions."

"Order of business"
"We will now proceed to the order of business."
"The final version of the draft order of business as adopted by the Conference of Presidents on 12 May 2010 pursuant to Rule 140 has been distributed."
"Monday - no changes."
"Tuesday - no changes."
"Wednesday:"
"I have received a letter from Mr Casini, Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, in which the Committee requests that the European Parliament consult the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the proposal for a regulation on the Citizens' Initiative under Articles 304 and 307 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"I anticipate that voting on these proposals on consultation will take place on Wednesday at 12.00."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"We will now proceed to the final establishment of the order of business."
"Concerning Monday and Tuesday, there have been no requests or submissions about amendments to the order of business."
"There is, however, one proposal about Wednesday."
"The Group of the European Peoples' Party (Christian Democrats) has requested taking a vote on Mr Czarnecki's report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2008, Section II - Council."
"Mrs Gräßle will move the request on behalf of the PPE Group."
"Mr President, this morning the Council answered the outstanding questions via the Spanish Presidency."
"One of the main conditions for a vote on the report is thereby met."
"Moreover, through the Spanish Presidency, it has raised the prospect of joint discussion and elaboration of a proper discharge procedure, thereby meeting the second main condition."
"In so doing, the Council is subjecting itself to the scrutiny of Parliament - and that is a milestone that we should recognise."
"I am therefore recommending to all groups that they vote in favour of including the decision on discharge on the agenda."
"However, the resolution itself will be dealt with during the June part-session."
"Mr President, I will be brief."
"We are able to support this motion for the reasons stated."
"An official letter is on its way to Parliament."
"I, too, see this as a good sign that the Council - or at least, so I hope - is prepared to demonstrate the transparency and willingness for consensus that it has demonstrated here, including in respect of the External Action Service."
"To this extent, I agree with Mrs Gräßle."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must say that I am surprised that the two large groups are now promising to vote on this report."
"A coordinators' meeting was held in the Committee on Budgetary Control that I myself chaired."
"This morning, documents were indeed received from the Council, and I scrutinised them."
"They include an annex that is identical to the annex to the document we received on 10 March."
"In actual fact, then, nothing has changed, and so I should like to recommend that we vote against placing the Czarnecki report on the agenda for this part-session."
"In my opinion - and I want to be very firm about this - the Council is simply taking us for a ride."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"Voting on the Czarnecki report will take place on Wednesday."
"The deadline for tabling amendments is Tuesday, 18 May at 12.00."
"The Group of the European Peoples' Party (Christian Democrats) has requested postponement of the debate on Mrs Bauer's report on working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities until the next part-session."
"The request will be moved by the rapporteur, Mrs Bauer."
"rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, on 22 March, I received a reply from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to my request that this report be tabled at the May plenary."
"The Committee stated in its reply that since there was less than a month, which is the normal cooling-off period, between 28 April, when the Committee voted on this report, and this plenary, this report could therefore not be tabled at the May plenary."
"However, without anyone asking, the Council of Ministers - presumably at the recommendation of the socialist political group - decided that it should nevertheless be tabled at this plenary, irrespective of whether or not a month had passed."
"As a result, the political groups simply have not had time to formulate their positions on or to discuss this report."
"Therefore, I ask that we postpone this until the June plenary."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - (DE) Mr President, I find it strange that Mrs Bauer - whom I otherwise hold in very high esteem - failed to mention that the report has been rejected."
"I find it just as strange that Mrs Bauer forgot to mention that she has been in contact with the Council about a report that has been rejected."
"That is not usual parliamentary procedure."
"It is therefore absolutely right to put this on the agenda."
"(Applause)"
"It is true that this Commission legislative proposal was rejected in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"However, this House has the good custom of a subsequent one-month cooling-off period to ensure we are well-prepared for the plenary session."
"Contrary to the wishes of the rapporteur, this customary law of Parliament's has been violated in this case."
"It is a very complicated proposal, and the groups, too, need time to prepare, which is impossible in two days."
"For this reason, I would ask you to support the rapporteur's suggestion that the vote on this proposal be postponed until the June plenary."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"The debate on the Bauer report will be postponed until the next part-session."
"Thursday"
"As for Thursday, there is the following proposal: the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has requested replacement of the debate on the arrest of journalist Ernest Vardanyan in Transnistria, which is scheduled for Thursday afternoon, by a debate on the situation in Thailand."
"So, instead of the debate on the arrest of the journalist Ernest Vardanyan in Transnistria, a debate on the situation in Thailand."
"The request will be explained further by Mr Preda."
"(RO) We asked for the debate on the situation of the journalist arrested illegally in Transnistria on worrying charges to be replaced by the debate on Thailand at a time when the situation in Thailand has worsened dramatically during recent days."
"We urge fellow Members from all political groups to ensure that we focus our attention on this situation in Thailand."
"We have heard an explanation of the request."
"Who would like to speak in favour of the request?"
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, the situation in Thailand is deteriorating by the hour; human lives are at stake; it appears to be a much more important item for an urgency debate for this Parliament to deal with on Thursday."
"At the same time, there are some developments to the case of Mr Ernest Vardanyan in the break-away so-called state of Transnistria, which the initiators would like to examine."
"Therefore, I move for this to be replaced with a discussion on Thailand."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that whatever we discuss and decide here will not change anything, either in Thailand or in Transnistria, so it is pointless to change things around."
"The debate on the arrest of journalist Ernest Vardanyan in Transnistria will be replaced by a debate on the situation in Thailand."
"These are urgent matters, which are discussed on Thursday afternoon."
"The order of business for our plenary sitting has been established."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"(The order of business was thus established)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance (Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure)."
"(EL) Mr President, apart from the pressure from financial quanta, the insecurity in the euro area ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker and asked for order in the House)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, please do not talk in the Chamber during the plenary sitting unless you can do so quietly."
"Colleagues on both sides of the European Parliament and in the centre, Chairs of political groups, dear colleague from Luxembourg, please sit down and stop talking."
"Colleagues, this is a plenary sitting, so please stop talking and give us the opportunity to carry on with our one-minute speeches."
"(EL) Mr President, apart from the pressure from financial quanta, the insecurity in the euro area is also the result of copious political rhetoric on the part of European institutions and politicians."
"Flawed European economic governance reacted, in my opinion, too late."
"Of course we need financial equilibrium in Europe."
"At the same time, now is the time for European political union to direct economic union via a global crisis exit strategy and to introduce a more effective regulatory framework for operating the financial markets and for protecting the euro against speculative pressures."
"I refer, for example, to the need to revise the directive on market abuse."
"By the same token, I repeat my proposal to create a European credit rating authority."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to take the opportunity in this House today, as I was unable to do so on the 'European Day for the Victims of Terrorism' on 11 March, to pay a well-deserved tribute to these victims in recognition of the enormous sacrifice made by those who have paid the ultimate price in the name of freedom."
"We urgently need to start to work on a directive to protect the rights of the victims of terrorism, who are always the ones who are overlooked and who suffer the humiliation of being unjustly equated with their murderers."
"It is high time that we within these European institutions recognise the dignity of the victims of terrorism, and help to defend their right to protection and justice."
"This right should soon be embodied in a law that honours all those who make this possible, whose first article should state that support to victims of terrorism entails recognition of their right to justice and that no government should ever pay a price for this."
"I call on all those in a position to defend the victims never to forget that true peace is a peace born of justice, and that is the only peace that those of us who believe in freedom and democracy in Europe and anywhere else in the world should defend."
"(ES) Mr President, the closure of a large part of European airspace over recent weeks following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano has had serious consequences for the entire European economy."
"This is clearly the case for the passengers, airlines and airports of the aviation sector, but it is also true for the tourism sector."
"That is what I wanted to talk to you about."
"In Spain, this is our second-largest industry."
"In the islands I hail from, it is the main industry."
"There is huge concern for the effects of the volcanic cloud on the tourist industry."
"There is talk of losses of EUR 42 million a day."
"It has dealt a serious blow to the tourism sector, which is still concerned about what the future repercussions may be."
"Mr Tajani, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship, has committed himself to study the losses in this sector."
"My request today would be for an urgent relief package both for these airlines and for the other businesses in the tourism sector, and for the tourism sector to be treated as a priority."
"(FR) Mr President, the European Union has many tools to make it a global leader in the manufacture of clean cars and, in particular, of electric cars."
"The Commission must ensure that this project is a major European objective by encouraging the large car companies on our continent to cooperate with one another, with such cooperation extending from research and development to marketing."
"It must encourage the widespread installation of accessible and interoperable charging points in Europe, starting with urban areas."
"It must draft and enforce common rules and standards - if possible, at international level, but certainly at European level - and it must do so without delay."
"Lastly, it must encourage the Member States to gradually replace their fleet of combustion vehicles with electric cars."
"(SL) Today, we are marking the International Day Against Homophobia."
"I cannot comprehend that there are still many people who turn a blind eye to violence based on sexual orientation and identity."
"I strongly condemn it, just as I condemn any form of violence based on race or ethnicity, religion or belief, age or disability."
"I am very concerned by the misleading, offensive and even hate-fuelled statements which can still be heard."
"I am shocked, time and again, by acts of violence, both verbal and physical, committed against people of same-sex orientation or members of various minorities."
"Today, most Europeans say that the burkha should be banned."
"While I agree that no one should force women to wear such clothing, I am concerned that a ban might result in an outcome the exact opposite of that intended: women who are prepared to wear the burkha going to prison."
"We cannot permit religious arguments to fuel discrimination and violence."
"Finally, we are all human beings, so we need to take a long hard look at whether it is that we really are unable to show greater tolerance to those who are different from us or that we simply do not want to."
"(ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to the 'Science and Innovation Citizens Agenda' initiative, launched by the Spanish Presidency of the Council through the Ministry of Science and Innovation."
"The European public is invited to go to the website 'www.reto2030.eu' and select which challenges in science and innovation, from those put forward by fourteen European personalities, should be solved by 2030."
"The results can be seen online and on a scoreboard in the hall of the European Council building in Brussels until 26 May."
"The Competitiveness Council will be informed of the result on that date."
"I call on you all to vote for one of these challenges and to disseminate information about this initiative in your respective countries so that, as Jean Monnet would say, our personal participation enables us to progress towards a European Union for individuals, towards a European Union for the public."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, democracy requires institutions whose task is to monitor civil rights to be independent of state and party authorities."
"The requirements in EU directives concerning regulatory bodies are identical with regard to complete independence and strong powers, impartiality and transparency."
"Unfortunately, in Bulgaria, changes are being made to some of the confirmed successes of our democratic system, such as extending the period of office beyond five years, the possibility of re-election and a rotation system for changing personnel - all measures which guarantee independence."
"Change is being brought about without any analysis or perspective, while distancing from good European practice."
"A reduction in expenditure is the only argument used for undermining the institutions which are combating discrimination, regulating the media and protecting competition."
"There is already the tendency for actions to be targeted at financial and audit institutions."
"I am warning the European Parliament and European Commission of this as I hope that this will help deter such intentions."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to highlight the importance of the written declaration on corruption that I proposed together with four other MEPs, and which half of the European Parliament, plus one, approved, with the aim of committing the Council and Commission to legislation that is truly effective in fighting corruption."
"I have returned from a visit to Greece on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control and one of the reasons behind the Greek structural crisis is certainly the squandering of public money, something which also occurs in Italy: Italy is eaten away by corruption, as we have recently seen."
"This corruption mainly hinges on the illegal management of public money, and the relationship between one political faction and a faction of businessmen and white-collar organised crime."
"It is important for the European Parliament to make its full pressure felt on the Commission and on Member States - Member States that do not conform should be penalised - and for the European institutions responsible for controlling corruption and the fight against organised crime to be strengthened."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, on the International Day Against Homophobia, I would like to ask you all to remember all those who have been victims of violence and personal insults as well as mental and physical abuse in the past year in our EU Member States on account of their sexual identity."
"Under the EU Treaty, discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is banned, yet this ban is not being consistently implemented by the Member States."
"In Member States such as Lithuania, the authorities are attempting to ban the Diversity Parade, thereby inciting an atmosphere of homophobia."
"In my country, Germany, an attempt is being made not to fight homophobia in schools."
"Mr President, it must be ensured that protection from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is respected as a human right."
"(LT) On 24 February, together with representatives from Latvia and Poland, I submitted a written declaration on equal treatment for farmers in the European Union, which draws attention to the unequal subsidising of farmers in EU Member States."
"In some Member States, subsidies are 7 times higher than the minimum, on average 4 times, and many new Member States are below the EU average."
"Such a situation falls foul of one of the Community's most important principles - the principle of solidarity."
"I call on the Council, the Commission and Parliament to equalise direct payments or at least reduce the disparities and, at the same time, end the unequal treatment of Member State farmers."
"I call on my fellow MEPs to support written declaration number 11 referred to on equal treatment for farmers in the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, I wish to draw your attention to the question of chiropractic."
"This is an independent health profession that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system and their effect on the nervous system and general health using manual therapy."
"Although chiropractic is taught on independent, harmonised university courses throughout the European Union, it has yet to be recognised uniformly in the European Union."
"In order to safeguard access to the same care and treatment for patients throughout the European Union, I call on you to sign the written statement which I have drafted, with the assistance and support of other members, to get chiropractic recognised at European Union level."
"Mr President, British taxpayers will end up contributing some GBP 10 billion to prop up the euro - a currency we resolutely rejected - as part of the GBP 215 billion hand-out from the International Monetary Fund."
"This is in addition to the GBP 8 billion if Greece defaults on its debts, and GBP 5 billion in loan guarantees to Latvia and Hungary."
"Britain may end up giving a total of GBP 23 billion to bolster the euro."
"But, if the shoe was on the other foot, I can only imagine that the Commission would rub their hands in delight at the prospect of a failing pound and a weakened London."
"The recent onerous legislation on hedge funds is the clear signal of this."
"The invocation of Article 122 of the Lisbon Treaty is the loosest interpretation of legislation I have ever witnessed and, in my opinion, demonstrates a sort of political hoodwinking that proves that every paragraph of every article of every treaty is not even worth the paper it is printed on."
"I would suggest the justification of exceptional occurrences fails to take into account the fiscal irresponsibility that created this mess."
"The latest move robs Britain of vital veto powers by allowing qualified majority voting on future bail-outs."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, it is essential to the operation of the rule of law that institutions are subject to their own laws and rules."
"Rule 24(2) of the Rules of Procedure states quite clearly: 'the non-attached Members shall delegate one of their number to attend meetings of the Conference of Presidents'."
"It does not say that the delegates shall be chosen by vote, but by what other method are joint decisions to be taken?"
"Telepathic signals, possibly?"
"The administration for the non-attached has said that the delegates should be chosen by consensus."
"However, it has not attempted to define how consensus might be established and has not attempted to arrange for a delegate to be chosen by this method."
"When attempts have been made to choose the delegate by election, these attempts have been declared to be invalid."
"What has been the response of Parliament to all of this?"
"They are going to change the rules so that the delegates - so-called - can be chosen by the President of the Parliament rather than the delegators."
"How long before the President of Parliament excises our right to vote in the plenary session?"
"I would like to remind you that the European Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs interprets this kind of situation and is certainly going to continue working on this."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the volcanic ash in the air above Europe has held up proceedings in Europe's institutions."
"It has, in particular, stymied the European Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg as almost half of MEPs have failed to get here."
"Strasbourg is presumably a difficult destination to reach, and downright impossible in exceptional circumstances."
"On this point, I would like to ask the following question: is this not yet another sign that the European Parliament needs to make a decision about having just one main site, and that to be in Brussels?"
"I assume you will all agree that against the backdrop of a financial crisis, establishing a single main site for Parliament will save millions of taxpayers' euros."
"It will also make the travelling circus, as our once-monthly move is often described, a thing of the past."
"(SK) The protection of people belonging to ethnic minorities is, quite rightly, an important component of international development and relations between states."
"We also discuss it here on the floor of the European Parliament, and we emphasise European values and the duty of governments to adhere to these values."
"In this context, I would like to talk about the political sensitivity of the issue, as there is a great possibility of abuse in this regard, particularly now, as governments are acting unilaterally in pursuing these issues, without consulting those that are affected."
"I consider it undesirable and unacceptable for these issues to be pursued in an insensitive manner with the aim of influencing the domestic political situation in another country, sometimes just before elections, as this would ordinarily be considered arrogance."
"In case anyone has not understood me, I have been talking about the current problems in Slovak-Hungarian relations."
"Mr President, corruption has been an important cause of the crisis, with powerful companies and powerful individuals misusing policies, institutions and funds for their private benefit."
"The challenges of corruption do not disappear with development: it only becomes more sophisticated."
"So far, domestic efforts have not been effective in all Member States."
"We should not ignore this reality; we should recognise it."
"We have reached the moment when the Commission and the Council must establish, as a matter of urgency, a solid anti-corruption mechanism in the Union and the Member States."
"Any delay will hurt the interests of European citizens."
"(SL) Slovenia and Croatia are two neighbouring countries, nations which, for centuries, coexisted without any serious problems."
"That is the case today, as well, and the majority of Slovenes are in favour of Croatia gaining membership of the European Union at the earliest possible opportunity."
"After 18 years of negotiations, in 2009, the two governments succeeded in resolving their border dispute and, in particular, the disagreement about the northern Adriatic sea border, which was an issue of legitimate concern for Slovenia."
"An international arbitration agreement designed to solve this problem equitably was signed in Stockholm, in the presence of the Swedish Presidency."
"The process of the agreement's ratification has effectively entered its closing stages."
"We, in Slovenia, still have to vote on this, in a referendum scheduled for 6 June this year."
"I call on European political forces, especially the European People's Party, to familiarise themselves with the campaign taking place in my country this month, and to contribute to a positive outcome, which will reinforce good neighbourly relations and enable the unstable Balkans to have a European future."
"Mr President, the eurozone came extremely close to meltdown 10 days ago, but the European rescue package has given our common future a chance."
"I believe the crisis has more to do with deep-rooted problems in some eurozone Member States than with speculators: Member States with fiscal indiscipline, inefficient labour markets and massive debts in the private sector."
"To save the eurozone, we have to reform its governance."
"Last week's governance proposal from the European Commission contained some good ideas: for instance, much more emphasis on fiscal policy and a clear coordination in fiscal policies between Member States."
"These proposals should also take into account a common programme of structural reforms."
"In Spain last week, Mr Zapatero chose the austerity programme so that he could avoid the electorally riskier labour-market reform."
"Finally, do not worry about the value of the euro: the common currency's fall is good for the eurozone economy."
"(FR) Mr President, we in Parliament have been dismayed to learn of the creation of a working group tasked with discussing an 'advanced status' for Tunisia."
"Why are we dismayed?"
"We are dismayed because not a day goes by without reports reaching us from that country illustrating the increase in threats and acts of intimidation against all those men and women who still dare to criticise the methods of that regime."
"Without going back over the most recent results of the municipal elections - 90% of the votes were in favour of those close to the seat of power - I shall cite a few examples."
"On 6 May, the journalist, Zouhair Makhlouf, was arrested and manhandled by the police while on his way to a dinner with the former president of the Bar of Paris."
"On 18 May, the journalist, Fahem Boukadous, will no doubt be sentenced to four years' imprisonment."
"What was his crime?"
"To report on the social unrest in the Gafsa Basin and on the repression that followed it."
"The lawyers Abderraouf Ayadi, Ayachi Hammami, Mohamed Abbou and Radhia Nasraoui are the victims of constant intimidation."
"The Internet is increasingly being censored."
"I shall give one example, Mr President, if I may: my blog is now censored ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, at present, practically every political debate on the economic and financial crisis is concerned only with how many billions of euro are required to plug the next black hole."
"In general, these debates are still being conducted clinging onto the skirts of Mr Ackermann and co."
"What we really need, however, is a fundamental debate on the current monetary system."
"We should at long last be debating matters such as how to rid our system of its growth imperative."
"What can we do to check the banks' urge to provide credit?"
"Should we abolish interest?"
"How can we arrive at a distinction between value and monetary value?"
"We should use money to create value for our society, not to create monetary value!"
"Before we are overtaken by events, we should use such a debate to attempt to reform the monetary system from inside."
"This will only be possible, however, if we have strong and, above all, independent policies."
"Mr President, as I am sure everyone is aware, we now have a new government in the United Kingdom, which we can call the Lib-Dem/Con coalition."
"In the agreement reached between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, it says that: 'We agree that there shall be no further transfer of sovereignty or powers over the course of the next Parliament' - i.e. to the European Union."
"Of course, anyone who knows anything about this at all knows that there will not be any more transfers of sovereignty requiring a referendum because this has all been done under the Lisbon Treaty."
"So there will be no need to ask the people of Britain, or of any other country in the Europe Union; it will all happen anyway."
"However, if Mr Cameron is really genuine about what he is saying, then he has a golden opportunity to actually keep to that pledge because, as my colleague, Trevor Coleman, pointed out a few weeks ago in this Chamber, the addition of new Members to the European Parliament means that the Lisbon Treaty will have to be re-ratified by all the Member States."
"So, in Britain's case, Mr Cameron now has a golden opportunity either not to re-ratify the treaty or to put it to a referendum of the British people."
"Let us hope he keeps to his word and does that."
"(SL) Last Saturday saw the celebration, at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna, of the 55th Anniversary of the signing of the Austrian State Treaty."
"This is, without a doubt, an important date in Austria's history, as it effectively signified the establishment of Austria's statehood and dignity."
"Acting through its ambassador, the Slovene Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Austrian Government on this occasion, or rather called its attention to the fact, that the provisions of the Austrian State Treaty concerning the rights of the Slovene minority in Austria have still to be implemented."
"Bilingual road signs in Carinthia are still a taboo topic, so to speak, and the government in Vienna has time and again yielded to the extremist views of the Carinthian nationalists."
"At the same time as congratulating the Austrians on this anniversary, I call on them to adopt a more amicable policy towards their minorities."
"(FR) Mr President, today, the International Day Against Homophobia, must be an opportunity for us to restate our commitment to universal respect for human rights throughout the world, at a time when provisions or practices involving discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity still exist in a number of countries."
"We must also condemn even more strongly the increasing number of physical assaults and the repetition of homophobic statements."
"The code of silence must end here."
"Teaching tolerance is one part of the solution, because attitudes still need to change, including in our European countries."
"We must not overlook the matter of teaching tolerance; quite the contrary."
"Lastly, European diplomacy must be harnessed to ensure that legislation decreeing that homosexuality is a crime is abolished in those countries in which it remains in force."
"I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to launch an appeal in this regard to Baroness Ashton."
"(BG) Mr President, I wish to express my view on the comments made by certain fellow Members from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who made unfounded attacks against the Bulgarian Government."
"For the first time since the start of its post-Communist transition, Bulgaria has demonstrated political will, not only in words, but in actions, too, by combating corruption and organised crime."
"The tangible results achieved in this respect are being applauded both by Bulgaria's international partners and civil society within the country."
"The support ratings for the prime minister and interior minister are 56% and 60% respectively."
"However, the question remains as to why Bulgaria has lagged behind so much and is bottom in terms of living standards in the European Union."
"The answer to this question still needs to be found in the self-seeking ambitions of the Communist elite from the late 1980s."
"They have managed, during the 20-year transition period, using the repressive State Security system and its tentacles in the state economy of that period, to turn their political power into economic power too and hand it over to their sons and grandsons, as well as retain their agents in key ministries, banks and industrial sectors in the country."
"The present government is combating the unregulated binding relationship between politics and economics, using every legal instrument permitted in a European constitutional state."
"I would simply like to end by making an appeal to fellow Members in the S&D Group to learn from the experience of their fellow German Members regarding the successors of the former communist party in the GDR."
"The BSP (Bulgarian Socialist Party) is the direct successor to the Communist Party in Bulgaria, in the same way as the Left Party in Germany."
"The difficulties in forming a government in North Rhine-Westphalia highlight how current this issue is even at the moment in Europe."
"(RO) Last week, I paid a working visit to see the communities of seasonal workers in the Huelva region in southern Spain."
"I saw some excellent things there and the Spanish authorities deserve to be congratulated on this."
"However, there are also numerous problems related to legal and illegal immigration, to work contracts which need to be signed in future in the native language of those who will be going to work in foreign countries, not to mention a huge number of problems related to working and accommodation conditions."
"I believe that the European Union directive concerning the seasonal workers scheme must reach Parliament as soon as possible so that we can deal with the problems in as helpful and efficient manner as possible."
"(BG) Mr President, on the evening of Thursday 14 May, I was handed in the town of Kardzhali in southern Bulgaria 54 000 signatures collected from citizens who want normal working conditions and strong local government."
"This petition has been collected from the seven Kardzhali municipalities in just 10 days."
"People support the fight against corruption at every level of government."
"However, they are against the strong-arm methods and actions carried out for show, which are used by the executive to relieve courts and the prosecutor's office of their duties, as well as curtail the authority of local government and repress it."
"For example, the Mayor of Kardzhali himself has been investigated 138 times during the last year, 13 times alone for the same project."
"More than 700 checks have been carried out on the 30 municipalities with DPS (Movement for Rights and Freedoms) mayors in less than a year, whereas municipalities with GERB (Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria) mayors have been spared such checks."
"In addition, the provincial governor of Kardzhali did not even allow us to hand in the petition in the actual administrative building and we were forced to meet out in the open."
"I made a commitment to inform Europe's institutions about this civil protest."
"Mr Kazak, you spoke too quickly for our interpreters."
"It was not possible for them to interpret your speech precisely."
"That concludes the item."
"Equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Astrid Lulling, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and repealing Directive 86/631/EEC (17279/3/2009 - C7-0075/2010 -."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when circumstances dictate the need for exceptionally responsive policies, the subject on which I am going to speak to you shows that perseverance is also a virtue."
"Since the early 1980s, I have been continually calling for a reform of the 1986 directive, because it did not achieve its main objective, which was to improve the status of assisting spouses in family businesses in the areas of social security and maternity protection."
"By adopting my 1997 report, Parliament had already called for the amendment of that directive, the wording of which was too timid, even though the Council of Ministers had not even endorsed the more ambitious European Commission proposal of 1984."
"In spite of numerous reminders, the Commission needed a great deal of persuading up until October 2008, when it finally proposed repealing the watered-down 1986 directive in order to replace it with a text with a more solid legal basis."
"Parliament adopted its amendments at first reading on 4 May 2009."
"In order to improve the Commission proposal, we felt, in particular, that it should be mandatory for spouses and recognised partners to become members of the social protection scheme of self-employed workers so as to ensure, among other things, that they are personally entitled to an old age pension."
"Indeed, if membership is voluntary, too many spouses tend to turn down the opportunity to create rights for themselves and find themselves - for example, after a divorce - without social protection, even if they have worked for decades in the family business and contributed to its prosperity."
"Unfortunately, this principle of mandatory membership did not obtain a majority in the Council of Ministers."
"What is more, the latter took nine months to come up with a common position."
"It was finally issued by the Spanish Presidency, which has demonstrated exceptional tact and perseverance."
"I should like to thank the Presidency and Mrs Reding's staff, with whom I have been negotiating since January."
"Thanks to their understanding and their diligence, we were able to reach an agreement with the Council that will enable the new directive to enter into force after our vote tomorrow."
"Of course, we had to make concessions, but we have the satisfaction of having served the interests of self-employed workers well."
"Accounting as they do for 16% of the labour force, with a third of this percentage being women, they represent a considerable force in Europe."
"Their spouses - women mainly - who actually help to run the family business, whether in the agricultural, craft trade, commercial or professional sector, are still too often, in some Member States, invisible workers who, if affiliated, would increase the activity rate and would also help to achieve the objectives of the 2020 strategy more quickly."
"Since I have recalled the long and difficult birth of this directive, I must mention the progress made as regards maternity protection for self-employed women and the spouses of self-employed workers."
"At their request, the new directive enables them to take 14 weeks' leave."
"As the German saying goes, Politik ist die Kunst des Erreichbaren, or politics is the art of the possible."
"I know that there are some Members in this House - fortunately they are in the minority - who believe that self-employed workers and their spouses should sort out their social security for themselves."
"I am very familiar with this argument, having heard it 20, 30 years ago in my own country, when it was made compulsory for farmers' spouses to join the agricultural pension fund."
"Today, these people are happy."
"I would also like to stress that the progress that I described upholds the principle of subsidiarity because it leaves the Member States free to decide how they arrange the social protection of spouses, in accordance with their national law, and whether they implement it on a mandatory or a voluntary basis."
"As you can see, Madam President, I do not have the time to tell you here about everything else that I like in the directive, but you can see that we are still capable of producing European directives that serve the interests of Europeans, in the social sphere, and which even have the effect of reducing distortions of competition within the single market."
"I am grateful to everyone, including my colleagues from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, who contributed to the directive."
"(Applause)"
"Mrs Lulling, I did not want to interrupt you, but you are entitled to four minutes now and two minutes at the end."
"You therefore have one minute left for the end."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am pleased to be here for Parliament's debate on the draft recommendation put forward by Ms Lulling on the Commission's proposal concerning application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women in self-employed activities."
"Our proposal sends a strong signal that we cannot stand by while women fall into poverty through a lack of social protection."
"It also takes a big step forward in terms of promoting female entrepreneurship."
"I hardly need to stress the importance of both those points in the current situation."
"I wish to pay tribute to the efforts of the rapporteur, Ms Lulling, to reach an agreement with the Spanish Presidency on this technically complex and politically sensitive matter."
"The Commission fully supports the text which the committee approved by an overwhelming majority on 3 May, and I urge Parliament to do so too."
"Adopting the text as it stands would send a clear message to the Council and pave the way for the final adoption of the proposal."
"More importantly, this would make a real difference on the ground at a time when it is very much needed."
"I would like to begin by thanking our fellow member, Astrid Lulling, for the long and systematic effort she has put into the amendment of this directive."
"In connection with the submitted opinion, I would like to emphasise three points which I consider to be important."
"In the European Union today, there is insufficient protection for self-employed women who are mothers, and there are insufficient improvements in the situation of spouses of self-employed people."
"I trust that the adopted text will apply to all sectors and not just to agriculture."
"The creation of favourable conditions for the development of family firms involves supporting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It involves creating a space for private initiative and new jobs."
"One component of such an environment is social protection for those deciding to assist in the business activities of their spouses."
"Their work is of just as much benefit to the economy as the work of an employee."
"They therefore have the same right to social protection as the state accords to employees."
"However, in looking for suitable mechanisms for this protection, we must fully respect the principle of subsidiarity."
"The choice of instruments must remain in the hands of the Member States."
"Finally, children need their mother more than anything else in the first months of life, regardless of whether they were born in France, Germany or Slovakia."
"I trust that the newly-drafted directive on maternity leave will soon extend maternity benefits to 18 weeks for all working mothers without exception."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I wish to express my thanks to the Commissioner, the representatives of the Council and, last but not least, to Mrs Lulling, with whom I have enjoyed excellent cooperation, and also to all my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"In actual fact, we are at an important juncture in the European Union, which is going through a crisis, but this directive supports female entrepreneurship."
"The European Union must develop and support entrepreneurship among women in order to help create jobs and guarantee equal opportunities on the labour market, especially at the current time."
"I wish to say that we have supported within this proposal for a directive the position that self-employed women, spouses and life partners of self-employed workers who decide to have children should enjoy social protection and paid leave."
"We support the need to ensure protection for workers' spouses in order to remove the obstacles preventing entrepreneurship among women."
"We also support the granting of clear powers to national bodies for promoting equal opportunities and treatment between men and women."
"Breaks in their involvement in the labour market during maternity leave should not be a handicap to mothers."
"In fact, Member States must find suitable means of support to help them maintain their professional role in society, with a view to balancing their family and working life."
"At the same time, I welcome the importance of finding ways in which these mothers can become reintegrated into the business environment, thereby actively contributing to supporting their own family."
"The enforcement and protection of economic, social and cultural rights and the improvement of both professional and family life are fundamental objectives which must be promoted by this new directive."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank Mrs Lulling for the endless hours she has spent achieving a good compromise and agreement with the Council."
"Regardless of the variety of opinions on the individual key issues in the directive and bearing in mind that it is still being considered at second reading, I wish to confidently state that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe concurs with the compromise decision reached so that this legislation can be introduced as quickly as possible by Member States."
"Updating this legislation enables us to guarantee equal treatment for men and women, with particular attention focused on the issue of social protection, especially protection for self-employed women."
"This new legislative framework will allow us to ensure the same degree of protection in both cases when women are self-employed and when they are only spouses and partners of self-employed workers."
"As a result of this amendment to the directive, Member States will provide standard social security entitlements, including 14 weeks' paid maternity leave for self-employed women and for the spouses or life partners of self-employed workers."
"The amendment to the directive is a sufficiently current and positive decision which will give self-employed women and the spouses or life partners of self-employed workers the opportunity to enjoy the same social security entitlements as employees do."
"The spouses and partners are not employees."
"However, it must be taken into consideration that they usually assist the self-employed worker - a practice which is widespread in my country in the agricultural sector, in small firms and in the liberal professions."
"This update to the legislation will allow Member States to decide and give self-employed women and spouses assisting self-employed workers the opportunity to join a social security scheme on a voluntary or mandatory basis."
"This should guarantee equally well social protection and rights for women when they are employed in a family agricultural business."
"Along with dealing with market risks, production and the financial crisis, they must also provide for the best scheme for their own social and health insurance."
"This is the only way to improve in real terms the situation of both self-employed women and their spouses and of female life partners, mainly with regard to their social and economic protection, independent of that of their spouse and partner."
"I believe that this comprehensive legislative text marks a small step which is, all the same, exceptionally important in terms of equal treatment for men and women."
"This is the path towards achieving the strategic aim of equality of rights for men and women and towards the programme which we recently updated - Beijing +15 Platform for Action."
"By making this small, but vital step, I believe that we will continue progressing towards better reproductive health programmes, a general market for European health care and insurance services and towards maternity protection and a good quality of life, regardless of geographical, social, cultural and ethnic differences."
"Moving in this direction provides us with the freedom to prioritise and with a helpful way of combining a career with family life, thereby establishing the sound, harmonious basis for sharing equality and responsibility between the sexes."
"Madam President, I too should, naturally, like to congratulate Mrs Lulling, as well as all those members of the Council and the Commission who have worked on this directive."
"Nonetheless, I should like to make the same point as Mrs Lulling."
"I believe that it is a matter of concern that some Member States place so many obstacles in the way of the standardisation of non-discrimination and equal treatment at European level."
"This is not the only occasion when we have witnessed this: we are also witnessing it in the case of the directive on multiple discrimination and equality of treatment in other domains, and I believe it is something which should give us pause for thought."
"We cannot appeal to subsidiarity when we have such an important and basic issue, that of the clear, fundamental rights of everyone living in the European Union."
"I believe that this can never be an excuse for allowing any person to suffer from discrimination inside the European Union."
"I believe that the directive that is about to be adopted - and I hope it will be - will now resolve part of this problem."
"I think that that is a good thing, that it is important."
"It guarantees greater equality of treatment for those individuals who are currently seeking opportunities for self-employment and, logically, for their dependents too: the wives or husbands of these self-employed persons."
"Nonetheless, there is another important issue, and this is something I think we need to stress."
"Some have called increasing maternity leave to 14 weeks progress, and indeed it is."
"However, let us not forget that there is another directive on the table which also highlights the need to extend this leave - and I insist that it is leave and not absence due to sickness - on the grounds of equality."
"This also means necessarily that there cannot be discrimination, not just between Member States, but also between the types of activity that those who wish to apply for this leave wish to carry out."
"Consequently, this need to ensure equal rights, as much between Member States as in relation to the type of activity and the type of social security coverage we have today, is - and I insist on this - a priority which goes beyond the directive which we about to adopt today."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, firstly, I would like to congratulate Ms Lulling on this report: she made a valiant effort."
"When I first heard of this report, I wondered how it would work logistically."
"The aim of the report is admirable and supports the principle of equal treatment for self-employed women and men workers and their spouses."
"But then I thought how this report would be greeted by, for example, a self-employed sole trader, such as a plumber or an electrician."
"For argument's sake, let us say his wife would be helping him in the evenings with the paperwork and answering the phone from home."
"How does the report fit in here?"
"Would he be expected to pay social contributions to cover his spouse, thus enabling her to qualify for maternity leave if needed?"
"Could this sole trader, who in today's economic climate is struggling, afford to pay this indirect tax, and indeed would he and his wife want this extra burden?"
"If they didn't see it as a benefit, would they just not pay the contributions - after all, no one really knows she is helping her husband - and is this not what married people do, help each other?"
"Then I took this scenario a step further: a few years down the line, they get divorced, as happens often enough, what happens then?"
"This poor guy will be skinned in the courts by his wife for not paying the contributions."
"Interesting times, and an interesting side-effect to our report."
"The number of self-employed workers in the United Kingdom has risen to 1.7 million. One reason for this rise is that employment opportunities are fewer these days, so people look towards starting their own work."
"Should the state not, in these circumstances, support their effort?"
"I have studied Ms Lulling's amendments and feel that she has made a valiant effort to improve what was originally a heavy-handed report on self-employment."
"However, I am still concerned about legislation in matters of employment being made in Brussels."
"I believe that this work is best left to national governments, who are best geared to evaluate the needs of their citizens - as, indeed, the report says."
"I support Ms Lulling's recommendations that the national systems should recognise the importance of protecting self-employed workers, and we should stand against all forms of discrimination, but I am still not convinced that this House is best placed to work on employment matters."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission."
"I would also like to give my sincere thanks to Mrs Lulling, as it is thanks to her great commitment and excellent work on this matter we have now reached the second reading."
"We have an agreement on the right of those in self-employment and their life partners to equal treatment and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left supports the proposal."
"The workforce that we are talking about is mostly made up of women and they have previously been invisible."
"This necessary revision of the earlier directive removes the discrimination that had previously put the self-employed and their life partners at a disadvantage."
"Women in self-employment and the partners of the self-employed clearly must be covered by the Member States' social insurance systems."
"Another important point in the directive that has been negotiated is that, in the event of a future directive on longer parental leave for employees, the Commission must inform Parliament and the Council in order to enable us to provide those in self-employment with equal rights to employees if appropriate."
"I would also like to add that, in view of the EU 2020 strategy and the efforts to increase growth within the EU, discrimination against female entrepreneurs must cease."
"They must also be entitled to parental leave and the ability to combine working life and family life - something that we discuss so often."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if any difference still exists between men and women in the employment market, we are only too well aware that this difference is even more marked among the self-employed."
"In fact, women are too often forced to sacrifice their own career ambitions for the sake of taking on a role and a workload arising out of the absurd presumption of dedication to their families."
"To resolve this problem, I believe we must implement measures - such as those contained in the directive we are discussing - whilst keeping our eyes firmly fixed on the family as our guiding star, as this is the only way that these measures will be meaningful and have a hope of success!"
"Freeing women from the agonising dilemma of choosing between the role of mother, wife, entrepreneur, means lightening the family workload and going straight to the heart of the matter, through specific positive measures to support the family."
"Unless it puts the family at the centre, any package of measures will be a ragbag of strategies that will ultimately prove fruitless."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after 24 years, it is time to update and adapt the directive on the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity."
"Two years after the Commission presented its proposal, the Spanish Presidency has now negotiated a workable and acceptable compromise with our rapporteur, Mrs Lulling."
"Naturally, it is not everything we could have wished."
"More regulation and more insurance obligations were a matter of debate."
"We had to resolve the matter of how strict the constraints should be or can be as regards the necessary social protection for women in self-employment and, in particular, assisting spouses, most of whom are women."
"If women are assisting in small and medium-sized enterprises, then they must at least have their own protection."
"This must also come from the enterprises themselves, however."
"As we know, self-employment represents an opportunity, but also a risk - particularly as regards the level of income, which often fluctuates."
"However, it is not only by private means that the risk of basic social protection can be covered."
"Each person in society should take responsibility for their own protection - to the best of their ability - in order not to become a burden on society and to be covered for all the situations that arise in life."
"I am pleased that the proposal covers all those in self-employment and is not limited in scope to those engaged in farming."
"The Member States can decide which path to take - whether they want to make this cover mandatory or voluntary."
"That is subsidiarity."
"The 14 weeks' maternity leave for self-employed women is a good decision; it will place these women on an equal footing with those in employment, and provides sufficient time for the healthy recovery of mother and child."
"This new directive is a major step towards equality and represents an important reduction in risk for men and women who take on the challenge of self-employment."
"I would like to thank everyone who contributed to it."
"(DA) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this directive on the equal treatment of men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity is of crucial importance, as it secures social conditions comparable to those of employed women for millions of European women who are self-employed, entrepreneurs or who assist their spouses."
"The most important and key element of the directive is the right to a minimum of 14 weeks' maternity leave."
"The need to secure better conditions for self-employed women becomes apparent when we look at how few women, relatively speaking, currently become self-employed."
"In the EU, only 8% of the female workforce is self-employed, whereas the figure is 16% for men."
"We must motivate more women to become self-employed and, in this respect, the directive marks a step in the right direction."
"Many women would like to become self-employed but lack the courage on account of the uncertain social conditions."
"In my opinion, this directive should be viewed in the light of the important work on a general maternity directive being carried out by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"Securing the right for all European women to take maternity leave without this diminishing their position in the labour market is a cornerstone of equality in Europe."
"If we in the EU are to achieve our goal of ensuring the welfare of our citizens, we need to give the women of the EU a proper opportunity to take maternity leave."
"If we in the EU are to achieve our goal of ensuring the welfare of our citizens we also need to increase the birth rate."
"I hope that this directive will merely be the first of two steps to achieving this."
"We are now ensuring that all European women have the right to maternity leave. The next step must be to provide paternity leave, too, so that we can ensure genuine equality."
"(FI) Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur for what is an excellent compromise."
"Recently, we in Europe have been speaking about competitiveness, especially within the framework of Europe 2020, and how we could establish this sort of competitiveness, in particular, by increasing the number of small and mediumsized enterprises."
"If we want to encourage entrepreneurship, these issues now being considered regarding the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity are of key importance and are a part of this debate."
"We need to establish a genuine alternative with regard to entrepreneurship for people, both men and women."
"Furthermore, there should be support for academic entrepreneurship, making it a component of study programmes."
"In this respect, we are a long way behind the United States of America, among others."
"When we speak of equality, we have to remember that one of the indicators that describe the situation with regard to equality is specifically the matter of entrepreneurship and the opportunities to be an entrepreneur, regardless of gender."
"If we compare the figures in Europe, we find that most entrepreneurs are still actually men."
"If we consider the matter of growth entrepreneurship and how we could support it, it grieves me to say that at the moment, the statistics show that the desire for growth among female entrepreneurs lags far behind that for men."
"Of course, there are many reasons for these figures, but the fact remains that at present, the social security systems for entrepreneurs, for example, are so unsatisfactory that they pose challenges specifically for female entrepreneurs, as we have heard in this discussion."
"Moreover, if we are to bring together issues of maternity, parenthood and entrepreneurship, it is going to take special action, because the work of a selfemployed person is often erratic in nature, the working day is long and one's livelihood is uncertain."
"This legislative text is an excellent step forward towards a more motivating and equal approach to entrepreneurship."
"(PT) Madam President, it is important that this process is drawing to a close, despite its limitations."
"It is time to ensure that all women who work - including the millions of self-employed women, and the spouses and de facto partners of self-employed workers - have the same rights, notably in terms of maternity leave."
"Although this directive is along the right lines, it does not go all the way in fighting discrimination and guaranteeing equal treatment."
"It is a positive step, which we support."
"However, we do not want to stop at 14 weeks of maternity leave, and we intend for the new directive on maternity and paternity leave to also apply to these situations in the future."
"This, of course, will be an ongoing struggle, although we welcome the progress that has been made so far and congratulate the rapporteur on her dedication throughout the process as a whole."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, today, the European Parliament is sending out a strong message to women who assist their spouses in their self-employed work."
"From now on, their social rights will be considerably enhanced, and I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Lulling, on the work she has done."
"Europe must protect."
"Under the new definition of 'assisting spouse', spouses and partners will be eligible for social protection in the event of sickness or retirement."
"Bakers' spouses will now be able to benefit from social rights."
"It is regrettable, however, that the Council did not agree to compulsory membership, but simply adopted the system of voluntary membership."
"Maternity leave is also provided for all women."
"The new text provides for a minimum period of maternity leave for self-employed women and wives of self-employed workers throughout the European Union."
"The duration of this leave is currently set at 14 weeks."
"I am the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for the directive on the health and safety at work of pregnant workers."
"I sincerely hope that, with the adoption of this text, the duration of maternity leave will be increased; and why not subsequently increase it for self-employed women?"
"To conclude, Europe has proposed some creative and pragmatic solutions to help couples to reconcile professional and family life."
"It is now time to switch to taking action and to implement the proposals as quickly as possible."
"Europe's campaign to protect women is making headway with this text."
"However, we MEPs must continue to eliminate the inequalities between men and women."
"(PT) Madam President, this directive needs to be reviewed urgently."
"This report is important because it is going to resolve the unjust and discriminatory situation of self-employed workers and, at the same time, promote entrepreneurship amongst women."
"From now on, self-employed women and the spouses and de facto partners of self-employed workers have the right to maternity pay, identical in duration and remuneration to that of salaried workers."
"There is, however, a prerequisite to contribute to social security."
"It is right and only fair that this should be the case, as salaried workers also make social security contributions."
"It is also considered fundamentally fair that the right to maternity leave should not be reduced for the agricultural sector and that it should be extended to all self-employed workers who I recall represented 10.5% of all workers in the European Union in 2007."
"This, I would say, is why it should apply to all self-employed workers, irrespective of their field of activity; be it in the craft industry, in commerce, in the liberal professions or in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We have to promote equality, so I hope that the European Parliament will adopt the proposals that have already been adopted by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"(PL) Adoption of the current measures is very important from the economic and social point of view, but also because of the values represented by protection of the family and equal opportunities."
"The current crisis and the rise in unemployment it has caused are affecting weaker groups in particular."
"One of these groups are women."
"Therefore, legal measures which provide for an equal position for the self-employed will make it easier for women to start up in business on their own."
"This is important, therefore, in view of the need to speed up economic development in Europe and reduce unemployment, but it is also important because increasing numbers of women are deciding to start up on their own."
"It is they who make the decisions, they who are in charge of their own firms, they who decide what to do and how to spend the money and they should not suffer discrimination."
"Small businesses are, therefore, a place where women can fulfil their ambitions - women who want to be professionally active but who do not want to give up their family life."
"Indeed, these measures will also allow Member States which are thinking seriously about family policy to take the opportunity to improve their own legislation."
"I would also like to draw attention to a certain group which requires further protection and needs us to give consideration to its situation."
"I am talking about women who work in the home."
"Working in the home is not treated as work, although in fact, this involves the performance of around 200 tasks every day."
"Women working in the home are often not protected by retirement pension or health care arrangements and are not entitled to any holidays."
"In relation to this, I think regulations should be brought into force which will make it easier for these women to benefit from all forms of social protection."
"(ES) Madam President, I just wanted to reiterate my thanks both to Mrs Lulling and the Spanish Presidency."
"To Mrs Lulling for her persistence, tenacity and hard work in getting to the point we are at today, and to the Spanish Presidency for allowing different and opposing points of view to be expressed within the Council, which has allowed us to have this agreement on the table today."
"In this debate, we are confronted with the amendment to Directive 86/613/EEC, which has clearly indicated that it does not comply with the objectives set for it."
"I think that it is essential to highlight the crucial importance of this agreement at a time of crisis and uncertainty in Europe, a time which has not hindered progress regarding the social protection of female, self-employed workers in the Union."
"I should like to remind you that in 2007, more than 10% of workers in the European Union were self-employed."
"The agreement we have reached may not be the best solution, but it does provide the opportunity for further progress to be made in the future."
"The main objective of this directive is for social protection to be extended to the partners of all self-employed workers, including unmarried couples, and for all self-employed workers or self-employed couples to be covered by social security, which is not offered today by all Member States."
"At this time, we are actively engaged in the design of the EU 2020 strategy where we shall define the future of the European model."
"This future cannot neglect the principle of equality of treatment, and it is therefore essential to move forward with the type of measure that guarantees this principle."
"My hope is that the step we take today, with the adoption of this proposal, is the first of many future ones."
"(PL) I am delighted at the near unanimous adoption of Mrs Lulling's report by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"The report concerns the introduction of amendments to the directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men engaged in activity in a self-employed capacity."
"It is very important that a compromise has been reached and an improvement made to the situation of self-employed people, who make up about 10% of all people in the labour market."
"Among the amendments introduced, the most important is the possibility for self-employed people and their spouses or life partners to receive social benefits, including, most importantly, the possibility to pay contributions towards their own retirement pension, and also to have paid maternity leave analogous to that which is given to women who work for an employer."
"These entitlements are to be provided for by legislation at EU level."
"They are measures which will not only help to improve the situation of women, but will also reduce the significant inequalities that exist between the self-employed and people who work for an employer."
"Millions of people who work in family businesses will at last gain the ability to benefit from voluntary social protection based on affiliation to a system of social insurance, without which they have been in a worse situation."
"This is an important step forward, all the more so because the compromise reached this year had, for many years, been impossible to achieve."
"I encourage all fellow Members to endorse this report."
"I would like, at this point, to thank Mrs Lulling very sincerely, because thanks to this report, many self-employed women will find life easier."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with this excellent report by Mrs Lulling, the European Parliament is trying to reduce still further the differences in treatment between men and women in the workplace, and I welcome this move."
"It is another step on what is still a very long road."
"Indeed, I believe it is vital to stress the importance of social protection for the assisting spouses or recognised life partners of self-employed workers."
"Let us not forget that, in many European countries, assisting spouses still do not have a status in their own right, that their work is not recognised, and that they are not covered by social security for self-employed workers."
"We are in the year 2010, and women in some Member States are still suffering a lack of recognition of their rights and are entirely dependent on their spouse's insurance."
"In these times of economic crisis, we cannot allow these assisting spouses to depend on a system that could plunge them into poverty, from one day to the next, in the event of divorce or separation, for example."
"That is why we cannot agree to the possibility of Member States maintaining national provisions limiting access to specific social protection schemes or to a certain level of funding."
"Assisting spouses must be covered as regards pensions, family allowance, health care, incapacity benefit and maternity benefits."
"Lastly, at this stage in the negotiations, it is the Member States that will decide whether this social protection should be implemented on a mandatory or voluntary basis."
"That is why I strongly urge all the Member States to do their utmost to ensure that this protection is mandatory."
"We must all combat job insecurity and the failure to recognise rights, especially in times of economic crisis."
"(CS) I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur, Astrid Lulling, for the work she has done."
"I also share her view - as do other Members - that the greater maternity protection for self-employed women and the improvements for spouses of self-employed people should not be limited by this directive just to people working in agriculture, but must, of course, also apply to other areas, including the liberal professions."
"Assisting spouses do not have their own legal statute everywhere, so their work is not always recognised and they do not have independent social security arrangements."
"It is absolutely necessary to recognise their professional status and to define their rights."
"I am pleased that the Council has recognised Parliament's opinion from the first reading that maternity payments should make it possible to take a break of at least three months, the minimum necessary for a normal course of pregnancy and for the physical recuperation of the mother after a normal birth, although for the healthy development of the child, it is optimal to have at least two years of individual care at home."
"I am sorry that the Council does not regard these three months as the absolute minimum standard that the Member States' social systems should provide automatically, and that only additional payments could be provided on a voluntary basis."
"(EL) Madam President, I, too, would like to endorse and welcome the present compromise, because it raises the question of democratic deficits which women in particular have had to face for years, when they help their self-employed husbands in trade, in handicrafts, in small and medium-sized enterprises and in the liberal professions, without any recognition over the years for their work."
"Self-employed persons and their partners, the majority of whom are women, have rights."
"They are not invisible workers; they have rights to social security, to health care, to a pension, to maternity leave, to parental leave and to paternity leave."
"Women have sacrificed themselves for years for their husbands, for their professional development, for their children and their family, by providing cheap, unpaid labour."
"Often, after divorce or the death of their husband, they are left with no insurance, with no benefits or compensation."
"The present compromise addresses some of the existing inequalities."
"However, the need is indisputably looming for further support for women, to promote the equality of female entrepreneurship, especially at a time of economic crisis and when the European Union is defining its policy for tomorrow, for the European Union in 2020."
"(DE) Madam President, thank you very much for allowing me to speak on this subject."
"Around 30% of all those in self-employment in the EU are women."
"They are particularly highly represented in small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the service sector, and, in this capacity, make a significant economic contribution to our society."
"These women should be given the same opportunities as their male colleagues without having to resort to quotas and the like."
"Self-employed women often have to grapple with the problem that becoming a mother could endanger their livelihood."
"In view of the increasingly ageing population, it is now more important than ever to ensure effective maternity provision and to give priority to families."
"Family firms where the women assist in the business also play an important part - whether in the professions, in the trades, in retail or particularly in farming."
"In all these areas, it is necessary to ensure appropriate social and legal protection."
"Nonetheless, the Member States should always retain competence in respect of social legislation and this should never be transferred to the EU."
"It is a matter of using compromises and options to take into account divergent social policy traditions, such as whether to make insurance for assisting spouses mandatory or voluntary."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join in congratulating Mrs Lulling."
"I welcome the fact that this report takes a further step towards realising the principle of equal treatment of men and women, including in the area of self-employment."
"One important cornerstone - and quite rightly so - is that it covers not just spouses, but also life partners."
"At long last, assisting partners can enjoy an equal level of social protection, and this also applies to maternity provision."
"(DE) Madam President, I, too, should very much like to congratulate Mrs Lulling."
"It gives women in particular completely new opportunities in the area of self-employment in small and medium-sized enterprises."
"In a time of crisis such as this, we should bear in mind that self-employment is fit for the future, that new jobs can be created here, and that it also allows us to develop completely new sectors."
"We have developed Girls' Day, for example, to encourage young women to take up technical occupations, because it is in these technical occupations that brand new opportunities are arising and in our present society, people are not really aware of the full spectrum of occupations available to women."
"Finally, it is also women who, time and again, ensure stability in the area of finances."
"I believe that in times of crisis, it is particularly important to ensure that the equity and venture capital in enterprises can be exploited equally by women."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, today we have made progress in the fight against poverty and for the promotion of female self-employment."
"This is not the end of the process, but it is a huge step forward."
"Subject to the Council's endorsement, for the first time ever, self-employed women will have the right to maternity leave."
"The Member States will also have a clear obligation to grant social protection to assisting spouses, on request."
"I want to thank the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, and Parliament as a whole, for all the work that has been done to achieve this success."
"Lastly, I want to say a word on Ms Lulling who, for many years, has fought personally for this issue."
"That fight has now been won, and I am deeply grateful for her commitment, which has led to this remarkable achievement."
"Madam President, I would first like to thank Mr Oettinger for representing his colleague, Mrs Reding, in such excellent English."
"(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, I am satisfied."
"I am grateful to all the Members who took the floor because they support the position held by the overwhelming majority of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, which will enable this text to be adopted tomorrow."
"I should like to reassure Mr Romeva i Rueda."
"This text is not perfect."
"It still falls short of my requirements."
"We have not yet won the war, but we have won an important battle."
"This is a step in the right direction."
"I should also like to say to Mr Romeva i Rueda and Mrs Figueiredo that they should not worry about maternity protection; what they want is provided for in Recital 17a. Read it;"
"I do not have the time to read it out."
"There is just one amendment. Were we to vote for it, it would not be possible to adopt the directive under the Spanish Presidency, and we would risk losing months, if not years, and all for nothing, because - I should like to reassure the authors - what they are proposing in their amendment is proposed, in different terms, in Amendment 4, which was adopted at first reading and taken up in its entirety by the Council."
"I therefore believe that these Members could, in good conscience, vote for the other amendments."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 18 May 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The directive on equal treatment for self-employed men and women has the aim of unifying the applicable European legislation and replacing a number of directives which address this policy on a piecemeal basis."
"Social conditions for self-employed people and employed people vary widely in the Member States, and social security provision in the event of long-term or permanent exclusion from work is practically non-existent in some cases."
"Self-employed people often do not have sickness insurance."
"They work when they are sick, because it is financially more advantageous."
"Women return to work after giving birth, and do not take maternity leave."
"Assisting spouses do not have their own social security arrangements."
"Self-employed people are essential to the functioning of the economy and they have an irreplaceable role in society."
"These people provide for themselves and their families financially, pay taxes into state coffers and pay social and health insurance."
"The state does not have to contribute to their maintenance."
"Their role is particularly irreplaceable in regions where, for various reasons, there is a shortage of jobs with so-called 'large' employers, and also in agriculture."
"It is therefore necessary to unify minimum standards that will help ensure an equal status for self-employed people as compared with employed people, and equality between self-employed men and women."
"The aim should be greater protection during maternity, recognition of leave for the purposes of caring for family members and recognition of the contribution of an assisting spouse."
"in writing. - The proposal we are debating this week is not a technical one."
"It's a matter of justice and common sense - in two ways."
"It's not only morally, but also economically clear that we need to grant the social protection and the maternity benefits to pregnant self-employed women and self-employed men's pregnant spouses or life partners."
"We cannot discriminate against those women or the partners of those men who chose to dedicate themselves to this type of work, especially when we all agree that we do need to encourage more women to enter the world of business."
"While we are trying to find our way out of the crisis, we encourage creation of work, including that of independent workers."
"This is also why we need to make sure that there is an incentive for women to start such work opportunities."
"Secondly, we cannot discriminate against the new-born children in these families."
"It is unacceptable when a child has the right to have her mother or father around (without jeopardising the living of the family) for the first weeks of his or her life, because the parent is classically employed, while the other child hasn't got this right, because the parent is self-employed."
"Energy performance of buildings (recast) (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by Silvia-Adriana Ţicău, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Council's position at first reading for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the energy performance of buildings (recast) (05386/3/2010 - C7-0095/2010 -."
"In 2008, the EU undertook to cut energy consumption by 20%, as well as to ensure that 20% of the energy consumed comes from renewable sources by 2020."
"As part of the European Council meeting held on 25 and 26 March 2010, European Union leaders set a common target of a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020."
"Buildings are responsible for 40% of the total consumption of energy, as well as for 35% of polluting emissions."
"Improving the energy performance of buildings will have a major impact on European citizens' lives."
"Across the EU, families spend, on average, 33% of their incomes on water, electricity, gas and maintenance."
"In fact, this figure can even reach 54% in the case of families with very low incomes."
"Investments in improving energy efficiency will result not only in lower energy bills, but also in creating 2.7 million jobs in the EU by 2030."
"In November 2008, the Commission tabled a legislative proposal for reforming Directive 91/2002 concerning the energy performance of buildings."
"In April 2009, the European Parliament adopted by a huge majority its position at first reading as part of the codecision procedure."
"Subsequently, Parliament and the Council conducted intense negotiations during the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the European Union."
"In November 2009, a political agreement was reached on the technical aspects of the legislative proposal."
"This agreement has the following main achievements."
"A separate article was introduced, along with several recitals and provisions concerning funding-related aspects."
"The Commission must identify the existing financial instruments and fiscal measures and table new proposals by 30 June 2011."
"These provisions are also supplemented by a declaration from the Commission."
"All new buildings must have a net energy consumption of close to zero by 31 December 2020, while the majority of energy must also come from renewable sources."
"This deadline has been brought forward by two years for the public sector."
"In the case of buildings with a net energy consumption close to zero, Member States will set clear objectives and devise action plans, which will also feature support measures."
"The energy performance of buildings which undergo major renovation or of the renovated parts of these buildings must meet the minimum energy performance requirements also applicable to the buildings' technical systems and components which have a significant impact on the building's energy performance."
"New provisions about certificates were introduced."
"A minimum amount of information must be specified in a certificate, including funding options."
"Provisions were introduced on issuing and displaying energy performance certificates."
"The energy performance indicator from the building's energy performance certificate must be included in adverts for selling or renting the building or part of it."
"There must be more information provided and greater transparency regarding the accreditation and training of experts and the provision of information to owners and tenants."
"Consultations must be held with the local authorities and they must provide support in enforcing recommendations, introducing new provisions aimed at local town planners and architects to ensure the buildings' energy efficiency is taken into consideration."
"Smart metering systems and active control systems have been introduced, such as automation, control and monitoring systems designed to save energy."
"No common methodology will be devised but, by 30 June 2011, the Commission will produce a comparative methodology framework for calculating the optimum level in terms of costs and minimum energy performance requirements."
"The directive will be reviewed by 1 January 2017."
"The Council's common position is based on the agreement signed in November 2009 between the European Parliament and Council."
"This is why I recommend its adoption."
"Mr President, honourable Members, it is rare in politics to have an opportunity to present proposals and measures as a win-win situation."
"Today, we have just such an opportunity: the forthcoming adoption of the recast version of the directive on the energy performance of buildings."
"Buildings are responsible for 40% of energy consumption and for 36% of carbon dioxide emissions in the EU."
"Implementing economic measures to reduce energy consumption in the residential sector can make a significant contribution towards achieving our 2020 goals for greenhouse gas reductions and energy saving."
"In so doing, we will, at the same time, bolster our energy security and create growth and jobs in the construction industry."
"The recast directive on the energy performance of buildings will also encourage a raising of standards in the national codes on energy efficiency in house building and will help consumers to reduce their utility bills."
"Energy efficiency is the cheapest way to combat climate change."
"I would like to highlight three elements of the recast directive which, from our point of view, represent substantial progress compared with the situation to date."
"Firstly, national requirements of new builds and renovations will result in buildings that save considerably more energy."
"This directive also covers small buildings with a useable area of less than 1 000 m² as well as minor energy-relevant renovation work, and also the replacement of boilers and windows."
"Secondly, the recast version means our citizens will be provided with better information."
"Homeowners and tenants will be well-informed, with specific details of the energy consumption and potential energy savings of a building."
"This should provide an incentive to the market to realise low-energy houses and carry out renovations on a broad front."
"Thirdly, with effect from 2020, all new builds must meet the extremely stringent near-zero energy building standard."
"In addition, Member States should draw up national action plans to raise the standard of existing buildings closer to the level of near-zero energy buildings."
"For all these reasons, the new directive is a successful achievement of European energy policy."
"I would like to thank the Members of Parliament and you, Mrs Ţicău, for your good cooperation in recent months and also for the unusually quick adoption of the directive."
"You have already emphasised that the recast version will only be able to realise its full energy-saving potential if it is transposed effectively and quickly and if there are also supporting instruments."
"To this end, we need to make better use of existing financing instruments, such as the European Regional Development Fund, which allows 4% of the budget to be used for energy efficiency measures - an opportunity that has barely been utilised by the Member States to date."
"In addition, we would like to provide the Member States with financial support for their efforts to transform the building stock."
"We are currently preparing - as announced previously in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy - the reallocation of at least EUR 150 million of unused funds from the European Economic Recovery Plan for projects in the area of renewable energy and energy efficiency."
"I am sure that Parliament's support today represents an important step."
"I would like to thank you all for your good cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ţicău, I would like to congratulate you on this report."
"I believe it to be a great step in the right direction."
"There are more than 160 million buildings in Europe, and these buildings need to be renovated in respect of their thermal efficiency in order to minimise energy consumption, thereby bringing about a corresponding reduction in overall energy consumption."
"Forty per cent of energy is used for heating and cooling buildings."
"We hope that renovation measures will allow us to achieve our goal of a 5% reduction in total energy consumption by 2020."
"However, we are also concerned with creating new jobs."
"There is no doubt that we need new training schemes for the tradesmen who will not only be renovating these existing buildings, but also building new ones."
"We need small and medium-sized enterprises that specialise in this segment and we must make it possible for them to make a profit in this area and to pay higher net wages."
"I believe that is the best way out of the crisis, because not only will it, of course, raise new tax revenue but, moreover, energy from fossil fuels will be replaced by renewable energy - thereby reducing fossil fuel consumption."
"I believe that substituting fossil fuels in consumption and production is the way ahead and naturally will also result in a noticeable reduction in household expenses."
"I also believe that these investments will pay off and that we should not continue with the levels of consumption that we have seen in recent decades."
"We should take this opportunity to start investing again."
"Investment is particularly essential in times of crisis, to enable us to overcome the crisis - and overcome it with as little bureaucracy as possible."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mrs Silvia Ţicău, for the immense work she has done in preparing this important report."
"In my opinion, the agreement reached with the Council is very ambitious and represents a new qualitative leap throughout the entire sector."
"Therefore, it is now very important for Member States to implement the provisions of the directive properly and on time."
"The issue of the energy consumption of buildings is particularly relevant in the overall context of the internal energy market."
"The buildings sector in the European Union is one of the sectors with the most opportunities for energy saving."
"That is particularly true for the populations of the new European Union Member States, because those countries have the largest number of old and energy inefficient residential buildings, while inhabitants living in them and on the very lowest incomes are forced to pay the most for communal services."
"The movement towards nearly zero energy cost in buildings means that the bar has been raised even higher for builders than hitherto planned when discussing passive house technologies."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to repeat that this is really very important and very ambitious, and hopefully it will also be put into practice."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Ţicău, who has worked with tremendous dedication on this dossier."
"We have had a big delay because of the legal adjustments that were necessary because of the Lisbon Treaty, and that has meant that there has been a lot more CO2 emitted than would have been if we had been able to do this sooner."
"In this long gestation, it is easy to forget that some of the things in this recast were actually considered quite radical when they were first raised. In particular, the dropping of the 1 000 m2 threshold which was proposed initially by Parliament in its report on the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency, and also the step of bringing in near-zero energy buildings by 2021."
"Unfortunately, this new requirement for new buildings will not help us with the 20-20-20 targets, especially because, increasingly, we realise that we need to be looking at at least a 30% greenhouse gas emission reduction."
"To have any effect on meeting our climate change targets, it is existing buildings that we need to concentrate on and the energy efficiency requirements there."
"I would suggest three key actions that we need to see in place if we are going to realise the potential for energy saving in existing buildings."
"Firstly, it is very important that the Commission comes forward with a robust cost-optimal methodology for renovation."
"The timetable is quite tight, but necessarily so because so much time has already been wasted, and it is going to be 2014 before the cost-optimal methodology will apply."
"Secondly, all Member States need to consider adopting national annual targets for improving a certain percentage of their existing buildings."
"If we had a European 'binding' target on energy efficiency, I am sure that we would see that kind of action being taken in Member States very quickly, because they would realise that one of the easiest ways to achieve an energy efficiency target is by systematically upgrading existing buildings."
"Thirdly, and vitally, Member States need to put in place upfront funding for energy-efficiency improvements and, despite all the work of the rapporteur and the shadows' best efforts, we did not get as far on this in the recast as we would have wished from Parliament's point of view."
"Therefore, it is particularly important that we now get money for energy efficiency into the economic recovery programme, and I hope the Commission will not delay with its proposal on this."
"Finally, given the comments made in the state-of-play document about the weakness of implementation of energy-efficiency legislation in the past, I would ask the Commission whether it can ensure that this directive is implemented fully and on time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many congratulations to Mrs Ţicău and the whole team of shadow reporters."
"This directive would not have turned out so successfully without a strong European Parliament."
"In my two and a half minutes, I will talk less about the directive and more about what needs to be done in the future to deal with the weaknesses of the directive, particularly as regards the existing building stock."
"What could be more appropriate at a time of crisis than to improve the way Europe's resources are exploited and increase energy productivity?"
"What we really need now from the Commission is a European buildings initiative with four central pillars."
"Firstly, assistance for national governments with transposing the directive."
"The last directive was not properly transposed."
"In your Directorate-General, Mr Oettinger, you have one full-time official - and he will be leaving in July."
"How are you going to ensure - in terms of personnel, among other things - that the directive is correctly transposed?"
"Secondly, as you have mentioned, financing models."
"What can be done in the Commission to improve the way that resources from the European Regional Development Fund are used for buildings?"
"Perhaps you could give us a few details regarding the funds left over from the European Economic Recovery Plan that you mentioned."
"Thirdly, we need greater labour productivity in construction, and for that we need more training."
"Better trained workers will increase productivity, but naturally, will also raise issues in respect of the prevailing working and pay conditions in the European construction industry."
"Consequently, we would also need an initiative from the Commission for social dialogue at European level between the construction industry and the trade unions."
"Finally, in the area of research and development, there urgently needs to be a greater focus on buildings, on the building of low-cost net zero energy or near-zero energy housing and - most importantly of all - new ways of organising building renovation."
"We will only be able to build or renovate more cheaply if the entire renovation process is better designed."
"This is another area in which European research funds could be used to provide real and substantial assistance to both the national governments and the construction industry."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I would also like to start by thanking Ms Ţicău and the other rapporteurs for the way that this directive has been negotiated."
"It has been with great warmth amongst the groups and it is very encouraging to hear that the debate on the next steps has already started."
"I do welcome this report."
"As many have mentioned, 40% of our energy is consumed in buildings."
"We need more sustainable living, not only because of the carbon challenge but also because of the concerns we all share about rising energy prices and energy security."
"Some Member States are already much more ambitious in their national codes for energy efficiency, and I hope that this directive will encourage others to follow suit."
"Energy performance certificates help to raise awareness of where energy and costs can be saved, and encouraging new buildings and newly refurbished buildings to have smart meters give consumers more control over their energy-related decisions."
"This is all good progress."
"This recast was born because the original directive was being poorly implemented."
"Going forward, Parliament and the Commission must always keep an eye on how Member States are implementing this one."
"The Commission must help: please, facilitate the transfer of best practice among Member States and also ensure that minimum energy-performance standards are compatible whilst reflecting regional differences."
"We all know that, to rise to the challenge of energy saving, it is important that consumers both in the public and private sectors acknowledge and see the benefits which directly engaging with energy-saving initiatives can bring both in environmental and economic terms, but I will give you a warning because there has been an example in my own Member State of gold-plating the directive, particularly in the requirements for energy performance certificates in public buildings, and this has added, in some cases, extra bureaucratic costs with little perceived energy saving and led to a loss of public support; that is regrettable."
"As a final point, all those who fear that the EU is facing an identity crisis at the moment should take heart from this report."
"There has been a unity of purpose and conviction from the beginning of my involvement - and I know that that goes back many years before I joined this Parliament last summer."
"Let us heed the lesson that the EU is strongest when we focus on core areas where value can be achieved by working together in a common interest."
"Mr President, I would also like to begin by congratulating Mrs Ţicău on all the hard work and dedication she has put into such a significant report, and on the work that she has done towards improving the energy performance of buildings and in support of a more sustainable Europe."
"As we know, energy use in the European Union is well above acceptable levels, and that is why it is so important to move forward with proposals of this nature."
"It is high time that we had a policy that is ambitious in European terms, and that we added further measures to this ambitious policy, especially amidst the crisis situation that we are experiencing."
"The construction sector is considered one of the sectors or markets with the greatest potential in terms of energy savings and other matters, which is why it is the sector of excellence for supporting public policies."
"I would like to finish on this, Mr President."
"We therefore anticipate taking advantage of the opportunity that is being given to invest in improving the energy efficiency of buildings and the potential to create millions of jobs in the next few years."
"Moreover, it is not just about new buildings, but also the restoration and refurbishment of existing buildings that have deteriorated or become derelict."
"So let us take the opportunity to use this legislation as an essential contribution to reviving the European economy; we must start making the most of investment, which can and must be strategic, to recover from the crisis."
"Let us also hope that there is investment from the Commission and that the Member States know how to make the most of it."
"First, I would like to say how pleased I am that the European Union has seen the potential for significant energy savings in the way that buildings are operated."
"Energy savings can be achieved relatively rapidly and efficiently by improving the heat insulation capabilities of building envelopes, even with the additional heating of older buildings."
"However, heat losses related to the heating of buildings do not represent the only waste of energy in buildings."
"From the perspective of energy consumption, water heating for personal hygiene and air-conditioning in enclosed spaces are a significant item in developed societies."
"In these areas, however, energy saving methods will be rather more difficult and more complicated."
"They will involve improving the efficiency of relatively complicated, sophisticated systems securing the regulation and exchange of energy between different media in the building itself."
"Since most buildings are, from the perspective of unification, unique entities, the internal energy regime of every building must also be adequately planned and implemented on a more or less individual basis for the workplace or household in question."
"Our objectives must therefore include a significant expansion of claims in relation to the complexity and difficulty of engineering and planning work aimed at correctly specifying intelligent energy solutions for individual buildings."
"We must therefore, Commissioner, also look for ways to encourage people working in this area to become better trained."
"Personally, I will be delighted if the aims of this directive are well implemented."
"However, I think that will be difficult in some areas."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, the construction sector is responsible for 40% of the EU's energy consumption and 35% of its emissions."
"This legislation stipulates that by 2020, new buildings must be nearly zero energy and that renovated existing buildings must meet minimum energy performance requirements."
"This legislation will therefore contribute to reduced energy dependency in Europe, decreased CO2 emissions, improved internal and external air quality, and increased well-being in cities."
"The incentive to improve the energy performance of buildings also signifies a chance to reclassify our cities, contributing to tourism, job creation and sustainable economic growth in the EU."
"However, reclassification requires increased public and private investment."
"We are talking about direct public investment, with an immediate effect on job creation and the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"A programme involving the reclassification of our cities will be a safe one that is well suited to our economic recovery."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to use the Structural Funds to reclassify buildings in environmental and energy terms, with this financing used as a catalyst for private funding."
"I also call on them to work together to find the appropriate financing model for renovating existing buildings."
"(ET) Mrs Ţicău's report is one of the most significant energy and climate policy instruments that we have adopted in recent years."
"I would like to offer my congratulations to everyone who was involved with this report, but particularly to the rapporteur, Mrs Ţicău."
"I will not repeat what has been said before, but I will focus on two points."
"First, the directive offers many new business opportunities to entrepreneurs."
"In addition to new technologies for improving the energy efficiency of buildings, in the future, there will also be increased demand for environmentally friendly building materials, a reduction in the consumption of materials and waste in the building sector, the recycling of building waste, and the development of intelligent houses."
"Therefore, European entrepreneurs, in cooperation with the European Union and the Member States, should invest today in technologies which will reduce the large effect that buildings have on the environment, because at the moment, buildings consume around 40% of the European Union's energy, emit 38% of the European Union's CO2 emissions and, in addition to this, the building sector is the most resource-heavy sector of the economy in the European Union."
"Second, the directive offers only a partial answer to the question of who will pay for all this."
"For example, the directive contains proposals saying that the European Commission should direct more of the resources in the European Union Structural Funds into financing the energy efficiency of buildings."
"I consider it extremely important, when revising the current financial perspective, not to let the opportunity slip and to find resources to increase financing for the energy efficiency of buildings."
"Energy saving is the cheapest way of producing energy, so let us use it."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the positive progress that this directive represents in the face of the urgent need to combat climate change."
"2010 is the year of the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"The European Partnership for Energy and the Environment (EPEE) estimates that between 50 and 125 million Europeans suffer from energy poverty."
"However, this new legislation concerns only new buildings and will affect only 2.7 million new homes per year, when there are 200 million old homes in the European Union."
"The fact is, at least 150 million homes will have to be renovated by 2050 in order to attain factor 4."
"Commissioner, since 2007, 4% of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has been set aside to improve the energy performance of buildings, but has been used only to a very limited extent."
"How, then, are you going to put pressure on the Member States to really use these funds, because if they go unused, they are liable to disappear from 2013, when some of them will actually have to be increased?"
"(LT) As many of you have mentioned, energy saving is the most economical way to ensure energy security and limit the amount of carbon dioxide emissions."
"I would also like to congratulate all of our colleagues, above all, the rapporteur and all our other fellow Members, for this successful review of the directive."
"This area, the buildings sector, has great unused potential, not just in the area of energy saving, but in the creation of new jobs and the implementation of new technologies as well."
"For example, in my country of Lithuania, over 80% of the buildings were built more than 20 years ago and they are very uneconomical."
"Therefore, the review of this directive on the energy performance of buildings is really very timely and necessary during the current crisis."
"The agreement reached with the Council on the wording of the new directive is well balanced and fully reflects the principle of subsidiarity."
"The directive provides for minimum requirements for buildings, both new and renovated, and will create suitable conditions to optimise the consumption of energy resources and save inhabitants' and the state's money."
"At the same time, more stringent rules on building certification and the provision of information will encourage inhabitants to change their consumption habits."
"Mr President, although it has been said several times, I would still like to underline again that the success of the directive will depend on its speedy implementation in the Member States."
"To that end, provision must be made for effective financial support measures both at Member State and EU level."
"Energy efficiency, one of the European Union's priorities, should also become a policy priority for all Member States."
"(RO) The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive will have a direct influence on the new types of investment made in the construction sector."
"Investment in new technologies, which will be aimed at cutting energy consumption, will have a significant impact on the national and regional labour market and improve the European Union's energy security."
"Financial instruments are required."
"Europe's citizens cannot bear the costs alone for modernising energy systems."
"The maximum amount of resources which can be allocated for this from the European Regional Development Fund is not sufficient and must be increased to the highest possible level."
"The Commission must provide additional support by setting up the Energy Efficiency Fund by 2014, which could be cofinanced by the European Union, the European Investment Bank and Member States."
"I encourage the European Commission to continue with the development of the Smart Cities Initiative and to examine the current mechanisms being used in Member States to spread best practice in the European Union and the exchange of knowledge and technical assistance in order to generate new financial resources for improving energy efficiency in housing."
"(HU) I congratulate Mrs Ţicău on her report and on the directive."
"However, this directive is not worth the paper it is written on if there is no money for it."
"I wish to draw Commissioner Oettinger's attention to the fact that funding sources must be guaranteed in the budget for the period after 2013 and in the Cohesion Funds."
"It is clear that in addition to European Union sources, we need funds from Member States, private capital and contributions from the population, in other words, a distinctive form of cofinancing."
"Mr Marinescu has already mentioned that we need to identify the sorts of cutting-edge practices that certain Member States have introduced using direct subsidies, credit facilities or other methods."
"In Hungary, 250 000 tower block apartments were renovated, since the condition of the old ones in the new Member States, as my Estonian and Latvian fellow members have already mentioned, is particularly dire."
"In my view, this building renovation programme must be continued and extended to the poor inhabitants of rural areas as well, as my fellow Member from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has also stated."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, there are a few things that I think we should bear in mind in the forthcoming debate."
"Firstly, the potential for energy savings in residential buildings in the coming years is disputed."
"What can be done easily has, in part, already been done."
"In contrast, renovations - particularly of listed buildings - could be very expensive."
"There is little point in renovating a building so that it is fantastically energy efficient if it then stands empty because the rent has soared."
"Even in the interests of protecting the climate, I do not believe that we should interfere with the ownership rights of citizens where renovations are concerned."
"There must be no obligation to install solar panels when building a house, carrying out reroofing works, building an extension or replacing a heating system, such as is the case in the Marburg model."
"A further point concerns zero energy buildings."
"As we know, it is only possible for a household to satisfy its electricity requirements using photovoltaics if the electricity grid remains available for periods when there is less sun."
"In other words, for the electricity grid operator, the costs will remain the same."
"Combined heat and power facilities also involve expensive dual structures."
"Even with optimal power management, many questions remain unanswered and dramatic price peaks could occur - quite apart from the fact that in most cases, we do not yet have the corresponding intelligent appliances."
"(GA) Mr President, I welcome this report and, in particular, the excellent points and recommendations made by my fellow Members."
"Without a doubt, it is clear that the majority of buildings and private houses which exist currently will still be there not only in 2020, but in 2050 as well."
"As such, we should focus on these buildings and houses immediately."
"In my own country, there are many people who are currently unemployed building houses and so on. However, thousands and thousands of houses are empty with no one living in them."
"As such, there is no need to build new houses."
"Therefore, as has been stated by my fellow Members, we should focus on the houses that are there currently."
"I agree with the Commissioner - the governments should use the structural funds, and so on, to deal with this work immediately."
"It is extremely important, and I also recommend that the plan be implemented."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Ţicău, for all her efforts on this report."
"The construction sector offers great potential for energy savings."
"It is vital to improve the energy performance of buildings in order to achieve the EU 2020 strategy objectives."
"Energy certificates are required primarily for informing purchasers about a house's energy performance."
"Romania was intending to introduce energy certificates for property transactions starting this year, but the decision to approve the draft regulatory act has been postponed."
"The main reasons for this were the insufficient number of energy auditors and the risk of increasing the price of old houses."
"They will be introduced in Romania, according to government representatives, by 1 January 2011 at the latest."
"The main benefit derived by ordinary citizens from the renovation of heating systems in residential buildings is that their maintenance costs will be reduced."
"The Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism has this year allocated RON 150 million for this purpose."
"(CS) There can be no doubt that increased energy saving in buildings - thanks in part to this directive - makes a lot of sense politically."
"It is a small piece in the mosaic of responsibility for sustainable living, while also contributing to the political independence of Europe from energy resources in third countries."
"Like you, I hope we can actually reduce emissions in ten years and, at the same time, slow down our growing dependency on the energy resources of third countries, particularly oil and gas."
"I warmly welcome this directive, which will provide a new impulse for innovation in the area of heating not just new, but also old buildings."
"Buildings account for as much as a third of greenhouse gas emissions, so our objective naturally includes active financial assistance from Member States as well."
"I also welcome the proposal from my colleague, Mr Marinescu, to set up a special fund."
"The fund would, of course, support not only heating for blocks of flats, but also for all buildings in the EU."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2008, the EU committed to a 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020."
"Improving the energy efficiency of buildings - with the goal of achieving near-zero energy houses - will not only reduce energy consumption."
"This directive will also help us to overcome the crisis."
"Its realisation requires experts and specialists, thereby creating jobs."
"Moreover, in the long term, it will reduce the household expenses of European citizens."
"Finally, I would like to mention the energy situation in the existing stock of houses and other buildings and the necessity of bringing about a corresponding improvement in their energy situation."
"Mr President, honourable Members, we are in agreement as to the important role played by the building stock, the renovation of existing buildings and the construction of new buildings in achieving our common goals of energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions."
"In other areas that we have to address - power stations, the energy mix in general or the automotive sector - there are relatively few players to approach: energy companies or the 12 to 15 car-producing enterprises of Europe."
"This means that the number of partners to be won over is manageable."
"In the area of buildings, there are a huge number of players."
"Homeowners, tenants, users, the municipalities with their town planning and urban development in general, those drawing up regional building legislation - generally the provinces or national states; in short, no other area is so important for reaching our percentage targets for energy and the climate as the construction sector, and no sector has so many millions of partners to bring on board - both horizontally and vertically."
"That is why this directive is an important step, but no doubt it is not the last word on the matter."
"I am pleased to have your suggestions and contributions, which we have been following closely."
"Believe me when I say that I consider the enforcement of this directive to be just as important as its elaboration."
"At present, the directive is on paper."
"Its value will come with its transposition."
"For that we need everyone on board - the Member States, but also the municipal administrations and the owners and users of our building stock."
"We want our energy saving measures to be implemented not just in new builds, but also in renovation work."
"In the coming weeks, we will be making a proposal for how the EUR 115 million or more can be used in specific terms in the near future."
"We are working intensively on the preparations for this."
"We want to present it as late as possible in order to know whether there is more than EUR 115 million available, but in good time to ensure that no funds are lost because of time constraints."
"We would be happy to have further discussions about this programme for renewable energy and energy efficiency in July and September with Members who are interested."
"We are currently in talks with Commissioner Hahn concerning how regional programmes can be oriented more towards energy goals in the current financial period - he has given his express support to this idea - and how we can use the forthcoming funding programmes to give greater priority to the subject of energy and buildings in the next financial period."
"I need your help in this."
"We have long been making preparations for the next financial period."
"You are familiar with the main programmes in the budget of the European Union."
"I suspect that the Member States will not want to give us more money."
"In this time of crisis and budgetary consolidation, I suspect that we will have to make do with what we already have - this percentage of GDP."
"This makes it all the more important to give priority to energy, energy research and energy saving programmes for the players on the ground and, as a supplement to this, also to infrastructure."
"In the run-up to the next financial period, I hope to debate with you how we can link local, regional and national programmes for building renovation with our goals and, where appropriate, also with a supplementary European financing programme."
"As I said, it is an important step - but not the last."
"Consequently, I welcome your suggestions."
"I am sure that you will keep a check on us to ensure that the directive can also be successfully implemented in practice."
"I would like to thank all the Members of this House, particularly the lead rapporteur."
"May I point out that this framework directive is being watched with interest in other regions of the world such as China and the US."
"Europe is at least a significant step ahead of other continents in this respect."
"I would first of all like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the support they gave."
"This is only the start of a process aimed at increasing energy efficiency in buildings, one which will involve the European Parliament as a permanent, ambitious partner and which will also require transparency when adopting delegated acts."
"Admittedly, we have indeed made a clear differentiation between new and existing buildings, taking into account both the property type, which varies from one country to another, and the current stock of buildings."
"I believe that Member States and the Commission must use the half-term review of the financial outlook, due to take place in 2010, to review the operational programmes and allocate more funds to the energy efficiency of buildings."
"Member States can use a rate of 4% of the ERDF allocation and, where they see fit, a reduced VAT rate, but this must not be less than 5% for work relating to energy efficiency in buildings."
"I would like to stress that all the funds allocated to energy efficiency in buildings will feature in jobs and in taxes and charges paid locally, regionally or nationally, bearing in mind the local nature of this work."
"Only if we increase the absorption level of the 4% ERDF allocation earmarked for energy efficiency in buildings during the 2010-2013 period will we be able to ask later on for a significant increase in this rate for the 2014-2020 financial period."
"I would suggest somewhere between 8 and 12%."
"In addition, I ask the European Commission to allow the EUR 115 million left over unspent from the European Economic Recovery Plan to be allocated to the Smart Cities Initiative."
"I believe that, especially when planning the 2014-2020 financial period, energy efficiency must be our top priority, along with programmes targeted at rural areas."
"The European Parliament has also requested at first reading for a fund to be created specifically for energy efficiency, starting in 2014."
"Commissioner, we will give you our support in creating this fund."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 18 May 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"With this package of legislative action, we are taking a quantum leap towards an environmentally friendly society."
"After all, buildings are responsible for approximately 40% of CO2 emissions."
"In the next few years, we are going to gradually drive back these emissions to zero."
"This is both great for the pockets of all consumers and, of course, good for employment, as investment in environmentally friendly buildings is labour-intensive."
"Now, in the short term, we must pull out all the stops to accelerate the renovation of existing buildings in particular, and we must help private individuals to do this."
"Special attention must be paid to the tenants of social housing in this connection."
"Social housing associations must receive encouragement and a substantial boost to ensure that they renovate the older buildings in the short term, so that the most disadvantaged tenants, too, can derive the maximum benefit from them."
"The energy performance of buildings is an area with strong potential for the European Union."
"The fall in energy consumption facilitated by the measures introduced in this text will contribute to increasing the energy independence of the EU, and takes us towards a European energy efficiency policy."
"The success of this policy also depends on the Member States, who must use financial measures such as reducing VAT, allocating the maximum authorised proportion of European funds to energy performance, and so on. At the level of the citizens, these advances will also benefit European households, who will notice a reduction in their energy spending."
"On average, this represents 33% of a household's income, and can be as much as 54% for households with more modest incomes."
"In practice, therefore, I would like the improvements in the energy performance of buildings mainly to benefit this last category of citizens."
"We must be mindful of the costs incurred by introducing new norms."
"If the costs of construction and renovation have repercussions for rents, this could make the benefits of the energy performance of buildings inaccessible to those who would need them most."
"With regard to energy-efficient buildings, I consider it very important for us to address the question of energy-efficient buildings."
"We need to treat this issue as a priority because Europe is seeing the emergence of an energy crisis."
"The European Union has committed itself to reducing its energy consumption by 20% by 2020 and to ensuring that 20% of the energy used will come from renewable energy sources."
"In addition, however, attention must also be paid to the question of energy efficiency, particularly in the construction industry, since this sector is one of the biggest energy consumers (40%), as well one of the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide."
"This focus on the construction sector is especially important in the countries of Central Europe, where the outmoded buildings inherited from the former regime means that we are wasteful in our use of available energy."
"Modernising residential buildings offers particularly important opportunities."
"Replacing doors and windows and fitting state-of-the-art insulation can help keep household energy spending down."
"In Western Europe, the construction of energy-efficient buildings is already on the upswing, their popularity being due largely to state subsidies."
"Unfortunately, in Central Europe, there is no system yet for providing greater incentives for investment in passive houses, even though such technology could help reduce the ever-increasing dependency on gas."
"This is why I consider it important to support the report, which is why I have voted in favour."
"The energy used by buildings represents almost one third of the total energy used in the European Union."
"For precisely this reason, there is significant potential in this sector for reducing energy use - not only because of obligations undertaken concerning reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but also because of the question of energy security."
"Among the more important provisions of the directive we are working on is the concept of 'nearly zero energy buildings'."
"Let us recall that by the end of 2020, all new buildings are to be nearly zero energy buildings, and this is to be achieved two years before that for the public sector, which should be leading by example."
"However, two features of the directive under discussion deserve a positive response."
"Firstly, the establishment by 2020 of the Energy Efficiency Fund, an instrument which will help increase private and public investment in projects intended to improve the energy efficiency of buildings."
"This kind of structural support affords an opportunity for the achievement of our objectives."
"Secondly, inclusion in the draft directive of a provision on the introduction of intelligent metering and active control systems (smart metering) that aim to save energy."
"Introduction of these systems on a large scale can bring benefits for consumers in terms of price, efficiency of use and energy security."
"Textile names and related labelling of textile products (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Toine Manders, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on textile names and related labelling of textile products - C6-0048/2009 -."
"I should like to start by thanking everyone for the enormously constructive cooperation we have enjoyed."
"I hope that, after tomorrow's vote, we shall be able to proceed on an equal footing, since Parliament is speaking almost with one voice to the Commission and the Council; with the ultimate aim of reaching an agreement for the benefit of European consumers, European citizens."
"In my opinion, the Commission's proposal to cast the labelling of textile products in the form of a regulation is better than incorporating this into existing directives."
"I refer, in this connection, to Mr Monti's report, which states that the problems in Europe are actually caused by the transposition of directives, which then end up with 12 or 27 different levels."
"I have always been an advocate of regulations, and I hope that the Commission will produce more proposals for regulations in future."
"The objective of this regulation is to enable new textile fibres to be placed on the market more quickly."
"This also enjoys broad support within the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, as we are seeking to optimise the internal market as far as possible."
"There is something else we have sought to do, and this is also something that concerns the European public."
"In this report, we have sought to simplify the labelling of clothing, which is also a textile product, for example, by introducing European standardisation."
"We now know that this is no longer so easy, and so we have requested a study, an impact assessment, to look into whether less can also be more; less consumer information, that is."
"Consumers can consult a website or other source for additional information if required."
"Labels must simply be shorter, so that manufacturers can target a single market and do not need to sew whole newspapers into items of clothing, thus confusing the consumer; food labelling has already shown us how far this can go."
"This is what we want to prevent."
"We have made a number of proposals asking the Commission to allow simpler labels to be affixed to textile products."
"The fact is that consumers are entitled to certain basic information, for example, 'what am I buying?', 'what is it made of?' and 'where does it come from?'."
"We believe that consumers are entitled to this information when they buy an item, and it should not be concealed."
"Thus, we find ourselves once more in the area of unfair commercial practices."
"Monitoring and enforcement are very difficult in this area, which is why we have made proposals in this regard."
"Hence, we are talking about providing very simple information and, if consumers want to know more, they can obtain information on request; if this goes well, the Commission will choose the best way to be of service to the consumer."
"We have made a number of proposals."
"If toys have a textile component in excess of 85%, we consider that they must comply with this."
"Some people say that this is all well and good but that we already have a directive on toy safety."
"Yet that specifically concerns safety rather than consumer information about what the product is made of, which is something I can imagine consumers want to know."
"Then, for example, there is an amendment along the following lines: consumers are entitled to know whether a product is made of animal-derived materials, and they need look no further: the manufacturer must indicate whether the product incorporates any animal products."
"We are talking not about the fibre but about other materials, such as pieces of fur."
"Finally, there is the famous 'Made in' issue, on which the Commission made proposals back in 2005."
"We have actually copied these word for word and hope that, with the support of the Commission and Parliament, the Council will change its mind and see things in a positive light."
"Therefore, I call on the Council to agree a compromise with the Commission and Parliament that will lead to an improvement in this regulation in the interests of consumers and of better information."
"Mr President, before speaking, may I be allowed to join in the grief that this Chamber has already expressed for the death of the two European soldiers killed this morning in Afghanistan, following a terrorist attack."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has begun to revise standards on textile names, as part of the 'Better Regulation' campaign."
"The main aim of this proposal is to improve the existing legal framework, and to simplify the procedure for adopting new textile names."
"The proposal therefore aims to promote innovation within the textile sector."
"The aim of the new regulation is therefore to allow manufacturers, users and consumers quicker access to innovative products containing new fibres; a subject close to the hearts of European consumers, sector enterprises - including both textile and clothing businesses - and also national administrations."
"I would like firstly to thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for approving the report on 8 April."
"I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and the shadow rapporteurs, for their in-depth and detailed work on this proposal, which has sparked such a lively and constructive debate on the labelling of textile products."
"Since this is a proposal to simplify the law, the Commission strayed from the provisions laid down by the directive in its original text, which must now be replaced by the regulation under discussion."
"This said, the Commission agrees with the vast majority of the amendments proposed in the report adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"We are aware that some amendments, especially those that propose widening the scope of the regulation, will be subject to Council discussion."
"We will do our best to facilitate the debate between institutions, and will work hard to achieve acceptable compromises."
"One of these amendments concerns the origin marking, the 'made in' label, which was not covered by the Commission's initial proposal: Parliament has always actively devoted great attention to this matter, which is of such great importance for consumers."
"The amendments proposed in this area relate to the proposal tabled in 2005 by the Commission, concerning the origin marking of many important product categories, including textile products."
"I will support these amendments, as I have already emphasised during a meeting with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I will adopt the same approach for the amendment that proposes labelling non-textile parts of animal origin."
"I would also like to make some observations about other amendments."
"With regard to Amendment 19, the Commission's proposal had already established that traditional tailors were exempt from labelling."
"Extending this exemption to all textile products offered to consumers as one-off products would, however, mean that an arguably excessive number of clothing products would be exempt from labelling."
"This sector effectively represents one of the main lines of development for European clothing products."
"Such products would thus be exempt from labelling, and the number of exemptions could risk becoming excessive."
"Regarding Amendment 63, which aims to remove toys from the list of products excluded from the obligation of labelling, I would like to remind you that the key issue as far as toys are concerned is safety."
"The relevant standard is sufficiently detailed and was re-examined in depth in 2009, with extended debates within the Council and the European Parliament."
"Since the question of safety has already been dealt with in the ad hoc standard on toys, our worry is that this additional burden on manufacturers risks becoming disproportionate."
"With regard to the request to examine other labelling options for textile and clothing products, I am committed to setting up a wide-ranging and open debate with interested parties on all the other issues that have been raised during discussions in the European Parliament and the Council."
"I thank you for your attention, and will listen carefully to your comments during this debate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, textiles constitute one of the key sectors in our European market."
"The proposal tabled by the European Commission is already an excellent starting point for improving and simplifying the regulatory framework that is currently in force within Member States, especially in terms of the transparency and flexibility of the law on technological developments in the textile industry."
"The work that we have carried out in Parliament to date has certainly allowed us to broaden the original scope, introducing standards for other labelling requirements that we consider absolutely indispensable."
"I would particularly like to bring your attention to standards relating to the indication of origin."
"We have proposed two different labelling systems in this case: one obligatory system for products from third countries, as already provided for in the 2005 regulation, which is currently blocked by the Council as you know; and one optional system for products made in Member States."
"In general, the systems serve a twofold purpose, though the more important of the two is undoubtedly to state the product's actual country of origin."
"Consumers must be able to make an informed choice when buying textile products."
"By using the proposed criteria for the attribution of origin, we intend to avoid labels that may contain false or misleading information, which would certainly be detrimental to consumers."
"Moreover, with these new regulations, we are also aiming to protect small and medium-sized enterprises that have decided to keep their businesses within the Member States."
"The decision to hold a plenary vote was determined by the European Parliament's desire to take a strong stance on these issues, especially taking into account the political consensus that has been reached between the three largest groups."
"I should really like to say that working with the rapporteur and the other shadow rapporteurs has been a truly excellent experience."
"Despite our different political outlooks, we have managed to find real common ground that we hope represents the best way of protecting the interests of European citizens and of the European Union itself."
"I therefore hope that tomorrow, we will have a united vote on this report, giving the Council a strong political signal for the tasks ahead of us in the second reading."
"My sincere thanks to all of you for your cooperation."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Manders and our fellow Members for their very constructive cooperation in connection with this proposal."
"This Textile Regulation is a sound proposal and a necessary one."
"In fact, it makes perfect sense to harmonise the rules for how we approve new fibres for the internal market."
"We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament therefore support the proposal as a whole."
"However, we also believe that a proposal should not benefit one side only."
"It must not benefit industry alone."
"It is also very important for us to focus on what is good for consumers."
"Therefore, in our work on this proposal, we felt it was vital to ensure that consumers receive clear information on the fibres and textiles that they purchase."
"We therefore also wanted it to contain a 100% fibre composition list."
"However, we did not want to stop there."
"We are, of course, also in favour of a study being carried out of how we generally label textiles in the EU and we have been involved in putting forward proposals to this effect."
"I believe that it is quite important for consumers to know the contents of what they are buying, where the clothing was produced, whether it contains substances that could cause an allergic reaction or whatever else they may need to know."
"I believe that many of these things - including the conditions under which they are manufactured - are quite important to consumers and will be increasingly so in future."
"It was therefore important for us to say that we believe it to be important for a more detailed investigation to be carried out into how we can create a proper labelling system for textiles that benefits consumers."
"This is also one of the reasons why we have given this proposal such clear support."
"Personally, I also believe that it is quite important for us to take a closer look at clothes sizes."
"I believe that it could generate increased trade within the internal market if we could be certain that the clothes sizes specified are the same irrespective of the country in which the clothes are bought."
"We Social Democrats fully support the proposal and believe that it could benefit the industry, but, most importantly, that it could benefit consumers, too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we should congratulate Mr Manders on this resolution and report, which seeks to bring a little order to the growing clamour of the global market."
"I am particularly interested in the issue of obligatory origin marking, which I am working on in the Committee on International Trade, my own Committee, as a shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with the rapporteur Cristiana Muscardini, and which is anticipated in some small part by the Manders report."
"In fact, in the global market within which we operate, regulations for obligatory origin marking exist in the United States, China, Australia, Mexico, Japan and many other countries."
"This creates an imbalance that greatly affects both manufacturers and consumers on our continent, leading to anomalies that must be corrected."
"This is even more true for textile products, which have a safety problem that we have already been reminded of; but they also hint in some way at their country of origin, I should say in an almost poetic way, which is particularly significant."
"Today, the situation we find ourselves in is shrouded in some confusion, because the origin marking is shown on some products because it suits the manufacturer, yet in other cases, it is not included because it does not suit the manufacturer; in other cases, it is included but under the regulations of other countries, because the products are also exported to the United States and to Japan and so they are made with these markets also in mind."
"We clearly need our own European standards on this subject."
"To this end, the European Parliament is trying, both through the report by Mr Manders that we have just heard, and by means of the work we are doing in the Committee on International Trade, to weave our web, so to speak, in order to achieve greater clarity for consumers and manufacturers alike."
"Mr President, I would particularly like to agree with the words of the previous speaker."
"We, too, are pleased that the Committee on International Trade is working in this area."
"I should also like to add my thanks to the rapporteur."
"Nonetheless, ultimately, I do not share his position and we will not be able to support him tomorrow on certain points."
"Allow me to reemphasise what the issue is here."
"We would all like to see clear country-of-origin marking."
"We all share the view that pressure must be brought to bear on the Council and we all find it regrettable that the Council has now been blocking clear country-of-origin marking for some years."
"However, this directive is a directive, not a symbolic resolution in which something like that can be stated."
"I myself, for example, have lent my support to a written declaration which expressly calls once again for action and I consider it important that we continue to work in this area."
"This directive has a different aim and purpose, however, and that is to ensure transparency and offer consumers certainty in the naming of novel fibres and novel materials."
"We now fear that if the scope of this directive is expanded, the directive will suffer exactly the same fate as the last attempt at introducing 'Made in' origin marking - in other words, that it will once again be blocked by the Council."
"We would find that regrettable, because we genuinely believe that action needs to be taken relatively quickly here."
"We support all the other actions in the area of 'Made in' origin marking - that is beyond question, we will always be allies in this - but we consider it wrong to misuse the present regulation to achieve this end."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I am speaking this evening on behalf of the shadow rapporteur for my group, Mrs McClarkin, who has also been much engaged in following this dossier."
"I want to take us back, in line with what Mrs Rühle was saying."
"I completely agree with her on how the question of country-of-origin marking is going to be handled."
"In the proposals here, there have been some significant improvements about the straightforward core of the proposal: about how fibres are labelled, about how composition is labelled and about clarity of labelling."
"However, I notice that the rapporteur conspicuously failed to mention that this is actually a crucial internal market directive as well as a consumer protection directive, with the whole objective of simplifying the legislation, making it easier to get new names recognised and to get new textiles on the market - something like 12 months more quickly - and also, in connection with the work we are about to do on standardisation, giving a significant improvement there by bringing regulations under the basis of the European Committee for Standardisation, all of which will achieve significant savings to the industry as well as improve consumer benefits."
"The real question for the rapporteur is whether we want to put all those positive benefits at risk by attaching to this proposal an issue about country-of-origin marking, which - as Mrs Rühle quite rightly points out - has already been proposed by the Commission on a whole range of products."
"I think that we should be very careful not to hold up the benefits."
"I agree we should make the political point and we should also be asking for some of the other things that he is asking for, but I think there are a number of aspects here where he has exceeded his role as rapporteur for this committee and it has become rather a Christmas tree of some of his own ideas."
"I hope that he will take that on board in the vote tomorrow so that we can deliver the benefits for consumers and for manufacturers."
"Make some political statements, but let us not hold this up unnecessarily."
"Mr President, if consumers are to be able to make the right choices and bring their might to bear, they must have access to information about products."
"This report is a first step and means that textiles are to be labelled with their country of origin; in other words, information on where the goods were manufactured."
"As consumers, we have the right to know that."
"Now we also have the opportunity to request that the Commission goes further in providing consumers with greater power."
"I am thinking, among other things, of care instructions and health and safety warnings."
"Those with allergies must not have to be exposed to goods containing traces of allergenic substances."
"Our citizens often feel that the rules of the internal market give priority to companies and industry."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, me included, considers that it is high time that consumers' requirements were put first."
"This would benefit not only consumers, but also serious companies."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the report describes itself, and I quote, as 'essentially a technical exercise without major political implications'."
"The European Commission never wastes a good crisis."
"Likewise, the European Parliament has also been adept in using technical reports to bring about a harmonised European superstate."
"It follows that the UK Independence Party regards this report with suspicion."
"However, the first part of the report brings three directives into a single regulation which would simplify."
"Later, there is even a hint of a repeal."
"Nevertheless, we strongly oppose the second part, in particular Amendment 58, which intends new labelling requirements to be introduced at Union level."
"I note especially the proposal for, and I quote, 'an EU-wide uniform size labelling system for clothing and footwear'."
"We have a completely effective system for sizing in the UK."
"It is wholly different from the system which exists in most of continental Europe."
"UK citizens know and understand it and it should not be changed for an EU-wide system."
"Once again, a European Parliament rapporteur intends to use a straightforward technical exercise to advance the wholly undemocratic goal of a European superstate."
"(DE) Mr President, in the thousands of debates on globalisation that we have had in recent decades, we keep coming back to the point where those following the debate ask what they can do."
"This always results in mention of the power of consumers."
"However, in the area where they can exercise this power - namely when buying products - unnecessary obstacles are placed in their path."
"There is a certain amount of standardisation in the area of textiles, but I feel that courage is lacking."
"Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am surprised that I am the first to mention this."
"Why have we not been much more ambitious as regards social labelling?"
"Why do we still not have it?"
"Why are we not using this ideal instrument to create transparency concerning where, how and under what conditions such products are actually being produced?"
"Why are we constantly bemoaning the loss of jobs, yet not doing what is of most interest to consumers - namely allowing them to find out what they are actually buying by providing the evidence?"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Manders, thank you very much for the good work that you have put into this regulation."
"I would also like to give particular thanks to my shadow rapporteur, since although this is indeed a technical report - as has been mentioned a number of times - it has many wide-ranging consequences for our citizens."
"After all, what we are concerned with here is allowing novel fibres to be placed on the market in the European Union."
"That is something we want to make possible."
"The European Commission is right in that."
"Not just anyhow, however; the fibres must be tested if citizens are genuinely to enjoy the consumer protection that we are always talking about."
"It is important, for example, to test whether the fibres are allergenic."
"They must also be clearly labelled, so that our citizens - who are always being described as responsible citizens - can also act accordingly."
"In this context, I must contradict the Members who have said that we should leave out country-of-origin marking."
"It is very important and absolutely right."
"Many citizens want to know where the fibres and textiles come from."
"What is their background?"
"Their background includes the way in which they were manufactured."
"It is deplorable, but in many states, child labour or even slave labour are still used."
"There are citizens who want to know this information so that they can make a responsible choice when buying products."
"It may not be the job of this regulation, but it is the job of us Members to remind the Council of this and exert pressure to ensure that the text on origin marking that has been on the table since 2005 is at last put to good use."
"It is an opportunity to turn up this pressure and we should really seize it to achieve a good regulation about which our citizens say: yes, we can certainly live with that - that is the sort of thing we expect of our representatives in Parliament."
"(FR) Mr President, if there is one industrial sector in Europe in which employment has been the victim of ruthless relocations, the free movement of capital, a strong euro, and dumping, it is the textile sector."
"As far as production and employment are concerned, today, there remain only a few niches in the mid-range/high-end, luxury and high-technology sectors."
"However, all that remains fragile and at the mercy of the counterfeiting and technological advances of emerging countries, which are too often financed by the capital of European firms."
"That is why anything that can help to protect jobs and know-how in the European textile sector is positive."
"Therefore, I am also in favour of the social labelling of textile goods in order to help consumers to choose goods on the basis of ethical criteria such as the health, safety, rights, welfare, working conditions and pay of workers."
"I am also in favour of labelling as a means of combating counterfeiting, so long as we actually provide ourselves with the human resources to combat fraud."
"We should then go further by establishing real Community preference."
"However, we can have all the labelling measures in the world, but they will be of little use without the political will to redevelop a textile industry that creates jobs in Europe."
"(DA) Mr President, the textile industry is going through a period of dramatic change."
"New fibres and fabrics are entering the market and it is difficult for consumers to understand what it is they are buying."
"Unfortunately, a large proportion of the goods are produced in countries with no form of product control whatsoever."
"For decades, we have informed consumers of the content of foods and medicines, but not of what is contained in the clothes that they wear."
"Therefore, in this 'nano' age, it is a good thing that we are starting to focus on this subject and I agree with both the Commission and the rapporteur that we need a uniform size labelling system for clothing and footwear."
"The Internet opens up totally new opportunities for both traders and purchasers to find information on a particular product using an identification number."
"However, it is particularly important to inform consumers about allergenic and hazardous substances."
"In addition, care advice, the country of manufacture, flammability and the use of chemicals in manufacture are also important."
"However, in the day-to-day handling of products, it is the use of language-independent symbols that is crucial for consumers."
"(CS) Fair competition for European trade and industry, in the same way as protection for European consumers, cannot be established in globalised commerce without defining certain standards of production, and also consumer information on producers."
"This regulation will undoubtedly do better than the old directive in bringing further improvements to the area of textile labelling, reducing the marketing of new fibres by a year and, at the same time, abolishing consumer labels."
"However, a number of conflicts persist between Parliament and the Council, for example, over combining the names of fibres with linguistically neutral symbols or the markings for non-textile animal constituents of textile products or problematic allergy tests, which is a pity."
"I am pleased, however, that there is less of a dispute over country-of-origin labelling for products and their conditions of use."
"These are mandatory for textiles imported from third countries, but no longer mandatory for textiles produced in Member States."
"This is a good sign, and European producers and consumers who care about quality have been calling for it for years."
"I hope we will soon extend this principle to products made from glass and porcelain and other commodities as well, and that we will manage to do so before European products completely disappear from our market under pressure from cheap low-quality products."
"I would like to express my opposition to those who describe this as protectionism."
"After all, information on where a substantial part of a product was produced, and under what conditions, is not worthy of concealment; on the contrary, this information will give consumers a better orientation in the globalised marketplace."
"It will reinforce the promotion of high-quality European brands, and will perhaps rightly inspire pride in citizens for what Europeans still manage to produce, despite competition from cheap labour."
"The main added value which consumers expect is the hope that it will be easier to avoid purchasing hazardous products, of which there are still very many, despite improved controls."
"I welcome the support of the Commission and I believe that a compromise will also be found with the Council."
"Mr President, firstly, I want to congratulate the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs, who displayed a positive and pro-consumer attitude to this subject at all stages of the committee."
"I feel the work is again a demonstration of the ability of this House to be among the most flexible and consensus-building institutions of the European Union."
"This is maybe the second or, possibly, third issue I have seen since joining the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, whereby this House can be more progressive than the Council and I welcome more examples of this coming to fruition in the future."
"As for the issue itself, attempting to harmonise rules when it comes to textile labelling and designating names is a very positive example of how the internal market can help the consumer and the manufacturer."
"This proposal is equally important for both the industry and the consumers."
"It is important to remember this, and sometimes I think the consumer side is not getting as much attention as is necessary."
"This proposal started off as mainly technical and non-political and was just a means to bring three directives together."
"However, considering that we rarely revisit these types of issues as a House, it makes sense that we try and make any proposals on this as comprehensive as possible."
"Consumers are entitled to accurate, relevant, understandable and comparable information on the composition of textile products."
"They are also entitled to a complete - and I mean complete - list of the fibres that are in products; this is necessary in the prevention of allergies, etc."
"I personally feel it is very important that there is transparency in production methods and conditions and that there is accurate evidence of place of origin."
"This will allow social decisions on purchasing choices to be made."
"I believe this is becoming increasingly necessary in the world we live in, given child and slave labour, etc."
"This is why I support many of the Commission's ideas but also support the calls for a more general scheme for the labelling of textile products."
"We should view this as an opportunity to have the best legislation which will deepen and enhance the internal market."
"(PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Manders on his work on this report, as well as thank the other fellow Members who worked with him on it."
"In truth, it is only because this proposal simplifies and improves the legislative framework that is in force by bringing together all the existing legislation - three basic directives on naming and labelling textile products - that it is important."
"However, in addition to that, this proposal will have a positive impact on private actors and on the public authorities, and will also allow newly developed fibres to be developed, so encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector."
"This revision will also make the process of adding new fibres to the list of harmonised fibre names more transparent."
"There no longer seem to be any doubts that this regulation will be to the advantage of the actors involved."
"Consider the textile industry, which will benefit from reduced administrative costs and the possibility of bringing new fibres to the marketplace earlier."
"For their part, the authorities in the Member States will not need to transpose the alterations to national legislation, which will enable them to significantly reduce their costs."
"Moreover, consumers will receive a guarantee that named fibres meet specific characteristics, and will also benefit from the fact that new fibres will reach the market earlier."
"The introduction of these fibres is important for European industry as a way of promoting innovation, which will mean that more information will reach consumers."
"In the current context of a globalised world and emerging economies with ever-larger markets in which millions of products produced by millions of companies are in circulation, a commitment to innovation and the speed with which this innovation reaches consumers is absolutely crucial for companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"The application of this regulation could see an increase in the competitiveness of SMEs."
"This new regulation will definitely mean that these SMEs increase their market share and it will, in this way, contribute to employment in Europe."
"(EL) Mr President, there is an expression that says 'a man's life hangs by a thread'."
"Just imagine if the thread is not strong, if it is not made from the right material; that life would be lost."
"I say that to illustrate how important thread and fabric are."
"This is not just a technical issue."
"We are not debating a technical report here."
"I consider that the excellent report drafted by Mr Manders, and I thank him for that, has a political dimension, a dimension that affects the trader and the manufacturer: with this regulation, their work will be easier and quicker."
"It has a political dimension which affects consumers and, by extension, the internal market; a political dimension that raises ethical issues."
"We need to know where a product comes from, where it was made."
"The 'made in' label is not a technical issue."
"It is, I think, above all, a highly political issue."
"When we know which country a product comes from, we have information on how it was manufactured, on the type of labour used there, on labour rights and if they are being respected."
"We here, as citizens of the European Union, are not technocrats walking around with our eyes closed."
"We are people who think, legislate and act on behalf of other people."
"Thus, the 'made in' issue is possibly a technocratic procedure with a serious political dimension and we must consolidate it."
"I think that our contribution will play a major role here."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have always been very fond of Mrs Rühle, but this is the first time in six years that she has expressed my own thoughts on a subject."
"I, too, fear that we are in the regrettable process of amalgamating two dossiers in a way which does no favours to the citizens of the European Union, to Parliament, the Commission or the Council."
"We all agree that the labelling of textile products is a topic that is high on consumers' agendas and that we need to find a solution urgently."
"However, we really must take care not to mix up two different things here."
"I have never known anything quite like this here in Parliament before: the Committee on International Trade is currently consulting on a draft regulation from the Commission, and then we slip exactly the same matter into another dossier."
"I am speaking specifically about 'Made in' origin marking."
"I will not go into detail concerning all the matters on which we will be consulting in the Committee in the coming weeks and months in the context of the 'Made in' regulation, such as what is the country of origin of a product that was designed in Italy, made with leather worked in Argentina and cotton from Turkmenistan which was woven into fabric in China, where the product is stitched together in Vietnam and then ironed and packed as a complete shirt back in Italy?"
"Where does this product come from?"
"Can we succeed in arriving at a rule for consumers?"
"I am absolutely convinced that if we are able to do so, it will not be in the context of the regulation that we are debating today, but rather under the auspices of the project for which Mrs Muscardini is responsible."
"I would be very grateful if the two matters could be rapidly disentangled again in the second reading."
"I really feel that in mixing these matters up and linking them together, we are doing no favours to consumers, to Parliament, the Commission or the Council."
"It would certainly please me if we could find a solution here that genuinely prevents the regulation from being blocked."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to the rapporteur, and also to the shadow rapporteurs, and to Commissioner Tajani, or should I say Vice-President Tajani, for the precise and accurate answers you have given us on key points."
"Eighteen years ago, the University of Barcelona carried out a study that concluded that the textile industry would have disappeared from Europe by the year 2000."
"It is now 2010 and this gloomy prophecy has not come true, and it has not come true for one simple reason: namely that the research and innovation developed in Europe and in countries that have maintained their manufacturing base - because they have not just acted as research centres, but as centres of applied research and industry - have ensured the production of new innovative fibres."
"Hence, the need for these regulations instead of a directive, to guarantee flexibility, protect consumers where labelling is concerned, and also to vouch for the country of origin."
"I believe, Vice-President Tajani, that it is worth imagining a future where we also have a European Monitoring Unit to protect health and safety, in other words, an authority to safeguard this originality."
"I believe that we must all agree on this positive aspect that has emerged from this report."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we all agree on the approach of the proposal for a regulation under discussion today, especially the aspects concerned with cutting down on bureaucracy, with promoting a more innovative industry, with clarity and, above all, with the consumer - and I must emphasise this last aspect."
"For this reason, I would like to emphasise the point about country of origin, because I believe it to be an indispensable feature: consumers today want to be informed, and surely country of origin is one of the most sensitive items of information that we can offer consumers."
"If we look at any market in any European city, I believe we will see that people are interested in what they are buying: in knowing what they are buying, what the product is made from and where that product comes from."
"It is definitely an extremely sensitive and important piece of information, and it is important because the European Union has become an added value, the European Union guarantees safety and protection for consumers."
"We know, and consumers know, that countries outside the EU have - it pains us to say it, but we know it is true, and there is no point trying to hide it, ladies and gentlemen - less stringent rules, less stringent laws that are less sensitive to many of the aspects that many of my fellow Members have already reminded us about: working conditions, protection of minors, protection of women, protection of workers, but also awareness of standards, and of substances that are used."
"All too often, newspaper stories have drawn our attention to cases of allergies in children and women."
"We speak to doctors, we speak to paediatricians, we speak to gynaecologists, and we know that the use of products and substances that are hazardous to health is unfortunately widespread."
"I would like to remind you of one more thing: this is not a matter of protectionism, rather it is a question of creating a level playing field in the global market, since so many of our partners have already adopted this type of labelling, including the United States, Canada and Japan."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I have listened to the whole of the debate on the Textile Labelling Directive and the first thing I must state is that it is important to the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) that consumers who want to have this information when purchasing textiles are indeed given it."
"The proposal by the rapporteur to make greater recourse to technology and have only an identification number in the product itself - rather than a label that becomes increasingly long - with the information being accessible in other documents, possibly via the Internet, would certainly help those looking for very detailed information."
"It would also help those who do not want this information, because they would no longer have to read all this information on the item of clothing itself."
"Secondly, the study proposed by the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs - whom I would like to take this opportunity to thank expressly once again - raises a number of questions which are individually worth looking at, but which taken as a whole are likely to result in this proposal facing great opposition in the Council."
"This is all the more regrettable since this proposal could be of particular importance to the European textile industry, as highly innovative fibres could provide us with an advantage in this fiercely competitive global market."
"If this regulation does not come about, then we will all be disadvantaged somewhat."
"We should not push aside the justified concerns adopted in the amendments in committee, but right now, we should concentrate instead on getting this proposal through in the Commission's original version."
"Perhaps we should return to the matters of origin marking and uniform sizing, as mentioned by Mr Caspary, at a later date."
"I hope that we will be able to arrive at a solution in this dossier, and do so as early as possible in the second reading."
"I also hope that we will settle the important matters in this second reading rather than spending too long looking at peripherals."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am keen to contribute to this debate because we are preparing to vote for what I believe to be an extremely important measure: it is important to rationalise the work of our enterprises, but especially to protect consumers."
"Those who buy must know what they are buying, and those who seek quality must find quality!"
"However, it is also important to have an idea of the social sustainability of what we are buying."
"Someone has already said this - but I want to stress it again because I think that this is a specific point that must emerge from this discussion in the European Parliament - I want to know whether a given product is made in a place where workers are protected;"
"I want to know whether that product involves the exploitation of children;"
"I want to know whether that product is the result of unfair competition."
"So here we have a measure that I hope will soon be extended to other manufacturing and craft sectors, because I believe and conclude that this measure will bring Europe much closer to its citizens, and for this I thank the rapporteurs who have brought this measure into being, and the Commission and Commissioner Tajani for being a driving force behind it."
"Mr President, much of this debate on textiles is echoed in debates we have about food, the origins of food and how we label food."
"It is interesting that a pizza produced, for example, in Ireland could contain ingredients that come from 60 different countries."
"It is very complex to get our labelling correct."
"One of the issues which has been mentioned is consumer concerns about how things are produced, about workers' welfare and environmental standards."
"I watched a very disturbing report on CNN about the state of the Pearl River in China."
"The denim capital of Europe is on the banks of that river, which is highly polluted because they export their cheap products to the EU, the US and other markets - and consumers buy them."
"So, although we say consumers want information to make informed choices, many consumers seem to ignore the information that they have and make choices based on price."
"I do think we need to talk more about sustainable production and sustainable consumption across all of our lines - food and, indeed, textiles."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in thanking the rapporteur, Mr Manders, and the shadow rapporteur, Mrs Comi, I would like, with all due respect, to disagree slightly with Mrs Rühle."
"She says that it is mistaken to include 'made in' standards as part of this regulation; but where else should we put these standards that consumers and small businesses operating in Europe have been eagerly anticipating for years, too many years?"
"According to her, the aim of this regulation is to open the market to new fibres, to innovation, to a faster coding system, but hide the country of origin, because the Europe of fear, the Europe of concealment, the Europe of obfuscation, the Europe that does not say where things are produced, must rightly speed up the marketing of new fibres, but must not tell consumers where textile products are made."
"What is the sense of this dual track system?"
"Why do we still need to keep alive the idea of a Europe that is bureaucratic, unclear and, even worse, incites fear, and evades clarity?"
"We want 'made in' standards and we want them soon for one simple reason - I am about to finish, Mr President - which is that, if a textile product has 'Made in Europe' written on it, this means that that product, with that label, has not been created using solvents that are toxic or harmful to the environment, that it has not been made by children reduced to virtual slavery, or by exploited women, that it has not been created by exploited workers, with gruelling working days and without any guarantee of health and safety, benefits and salaries."
"The statement 'Made in Europe' is a guarantee for the consumer, and also a guarantee about how the product has been created."
"We must be proud of this statement, and must ensure that it is introduced straight away."
"This is why we support the proposal, just as it was tabled by the relevant committee, and we can already thank Commissioner Tajani for the significant reassurance he has given this Chamber on this point."
"Mr President, I think it is good that we have a discussion on a topic which affects every citizen, because almost every citizen becomes a consumer and a purchaser of textile products."
"The labelling is also very important."
"I remember being bemused several times in my own country years ago to pick up a product and see written on it 'Deantús na hÉireann' - 'Produce of Ireland', then you could peel off the label and underneath it was 'Made in China'; in other words, consumers had been conned."
"Now we have come a long way since then, but we need to go further."
"The points made particularly by Lara Comi regarding products from third countries are very important."
"We have been far too stringent regarding our own countries, and not so with third countries."
"This also refers to the agricultural sector, and the upcoming Mercosur proposals, in particular, bear that out."
"So I welcome that."
"Finally, the suggestion about having the same sizes right across the European Union is a very good one."
"It will make it much easier for people to purchase and also create a sense of European union without creating the superstate that the good Earl is somewhat concerned about."
"(PT) Mr President, this discussion concerning the designation of origin on the labelling and packaging of textiles and clothing is very important in protecting consumer rights, but also in protecting the workforce and production of our countries' textile and clothing industries."
"We want to fight against social dumping and child labour, and protect social rights and the environment."
"Labelling must allow consumers a clear choice and involvement in a future that is better for all, whether here in the European Union or in other countries."
"It is through this process of clearly marking the origin and contents of products that we will be able to make more conscious choices; it will contribute to a better future."
"Mr President, I share the opinion of those who say that this proposal for a regulation has definite technical connotations, but it is also politically important: it is politically important in that it concerns the interests of European citizens, because we are simplifying standards, and this means making work easier for citizens, making work easier for all businesses that operate in the sector."
"We are delivering a service to citizens because Parliament now overwhelmingly favours labelling and we are therefore making it possible for citizens to know what kind of product they are buying."
"This means that we are guaranteeing their health, and inalienable rights - I agree with the ideas put forward by Mrs Gebhardt during her speech, but also with those of Mrs Figueiredo."
"We are also committed to defending the European textile industry: we cannot forget that this sector has had many job losses, sometimes because of unfair competition."
"It is our duty to defend the competitiveness of our businesses on the world market, and we must prevent dumping within the European Union."
"Defending the textile sector means defending thousands and thousands of jobs and, at the same time, defending citizens' rights."
"By approving this text, we will be safeguarding a whole set of interests, interests which, to my mind, still respect the values of our European Union."
"I believe that Mr Kelly is right, and I would like to offer some reassurance to Lord Dartmouth, even if he has left the Chamber, who voiced fears about a superstate."
"I do not think that the European Union is the modern version of Hobbes's Leviathan; it is simply an institution that embodies principles of solidarity and of subsidiarity, defends human rights, and is committed to safeguarding the social market economy, and the market itself is an instrument for creating social policy; so there is nothing here that is trying to limit anybody's freedom, we are simply defending the rights of half a billion European citizens who live within our Union."
"Commission's position on amendments by Parliament"
"Manders report"
"The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 17, 18, 20, 22, 23, 26, 29, 33, 34, 35, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 52 and 61."
"The Commission can accept Amendments 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 36, 40, 45,47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 62, 64, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70 and 72 in principle."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments 19, 37, 38, 63, 68 and 71."
"I am honoured that such a huge number of speakers are present on this Monday evening to discuss a technical report, and also that there is broad support for this report."
"Some of my fellow Members have expressed criticism, saying that the scope of the report should not be abused, should not be broadened."
"I understand this, but I should like to underline the words of my fellow Member, Mrs Gebhardt, in this connection."
"In some situations, it is necessary to make use of the situation in order to bring something about, and I take the view that it is eminently possible to proceed like this."
"It is important to have very broad support tomorrow, and I sense this support from many people's reactions."
"This will give this House an excellent point of departure, particularly for the negotiations with the Council, as I believe that, together with the Commission - and I thank the Commissioner for his clear position - Parliament will be able to create a situation tomorrow that will ultimately produce a successful conclusion to the negotiations with the Council."
"The objective of this proposal is to create better legislation for the future, as people are buying more and more over the Internet, and so we need an internal market that works, one in which 500 million consumers can obtain the information they desire in a fair manner."
"We are starting with textiles, and I hope that this is eventually extended to all products for sale on the internal market."
"The intention is to provide not more information, but clear information with a single European basis; and, if that succeeds, I shall be very pleased."
"By way of conclusion, Mr President, I should just like to mention that I made a conscious decision not to reach agreement with the Council in a single reading."
"I take the view that we should go down this ordinary path much more often and that Parliament, plenary, should pass judgment on the report tabled by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection before entering into negotiations with the Council and the Commission with a view to reaching a conclusion."
"I think that it erodes democracy if we reach an agreement even before the discussion in plenary."
"Thus, I hope that many will follow this example and that all dossiers will be dealt with ordinarily in a first and second reading."
"I hope for a good result tomorrow, and with our point of departure - one of broad support - we shall be excellently placed to win the final against the Council, to put it in football terms."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Tuesday, 18 May 2010)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The textile industry of the European Union has embarked upon a long process of restructuring and technological innovation in response to the significant economic challenges that this sector has had to face in recent years."
"In my opinion, in allowing the harmonisation and standardisation of aspects of textile-product labelling, the report under discussion both facilitates the free movement of these products in the internal market and ensures a high and uniform level of protection for consumers within the European Union."
"I therefore support the invitation addressed to the Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on any new labelling requirements within two years of implementing the new regulation."
"This will serve the twofold aim of simplifying the labelling of textile products and of providing consumers with accurate and comparable information about the ownership, origin and size of textile products."
"In achieving these objectives, I believe it is necessary to make sure that extending obligatory labelling does not involve an additional burden on business, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"At the moment, there are no satisfactory tests showing how allergenic or hazardous substances used in the manufacturing/processing of textile products affect human health."
"I therefore urge the Commission to carry out a study to evaluate their effects."
"Once again, ecological labelling promises something quite different to what it actually delivers - one only has to think of the 'Organic Cotton' scandal or the recent bio-chemicals pantomime."
"Firstly, yet another confusion of labels and marks is emerging in this organic market - which the EU could sensibly simplify once and for all, something which it usually loves doing; and secondly, it is time that the EU accepted genetically modified cotton."
"If we are still awaiting studies of the possible effects of harmful substances, then in the meantime, genetically modified cotton should at least be stated on the label."
"It is also high time that the EU did something about 'radio-frequency identification'."
"We cannot have electronic labels being applied to textiles without the knowledge of those concerned whilst we are still waiting for the requisite labelling regulations."
"If pedestrians are to be made visible by means of RFID clothing, it will be possible to monitor people's every step."
"In view of the pressure to conform to political correctness, people would soon have to be extremely careful as to the institutions they visited when wearing RFID clothing."
"Perhaps in future, however, people will simply need to delete their RFID number from Google Street View."
"Alternatively, the chips might set off security alerts at airports."
"George Orwell could not have imagined it; we have long overtaken his vision of a surveillance society."
"New developments in public procurement (short presentation)"
"The next item is the short presentation of the report by Heide Rühle, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on new developments in public procurement [2009/2175 (INI)] -."
"Mr President, I would like to include in my thanks all the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation and for the good results achieved in committee so far."
"Allow me to reiterate and highlight the main points of my report."
"Firstly, we need greater legal certainty for all those involved - contracting authorities and contractors - with a view to better regulation."
"My report stresses the particularly great significance that public procurement has in times of crisis."
"However, my report also criticises the fact that the complex interaction of European legislation and national transposition has not resulted in a simplification and debureaucratisation of public procurement, as was, in fact, the aim of the 2004 revision, but rather in more work, high external costs for legal advice and protracted procedures."
"Unfortunately, this is at the expense of innovation and quality."
"Numerous studies show this to be the case."
"Far too often, the lack of legal clarity results in the cheapest offer being selected, rather than the best tender."
"Whilst the Commission now provides assistance in the area of green procurement, there is no such assistance in the areas of socially responsible procurement, fair trade or the promotion of innovation through procurement."
"The Commission has some urgent reworking to do here."
"Better coordination within the Commission is also urgently needed."
"The European Court of Justice has removed a number of legal uncertainties in recent judgments and strengthened the role of public procurers, for example, by indicating that the scope of the directives should not be extended into areas such as urban planning."
"These judgments do not give contracting authorities a blank cheque, but rather provide them with a clear framework."
"This, too, was something I sought to reiterate in my report."
"One final point remains: the matter of the service concessions, on which opinions differed greatly within the committee."
"My position on the matter has not changed."
"The service concessions were deliberately removed from the directives on procurement in order to ensure greater flexibility in these areas and to take account of cultural differences."
"This position is also supported by all the stakeholders that I have spoken to, whether they be municipal umbrella organisations, public enterprises - particularly in the water industry, industrial associations, trade unions or, not least, NGOs."
"That is also something that I wanted clearly reiterated in my report."
"I have one further point to mention that is also very important to me: public procurement must not result in the institutions selected losing their democratic rights."
"If we find that many municipalities are now including fair trade as an important criterion in public procurement decisions - whether when buying coffee or for other products - then I think it is important to bolster this."
"In this event, it would be very important for the Commission to help the municipalities and, if they make a mistake, to be there to advise them."
"Instead, the Commission has instituted new legal proceedings against the Netherlands in respect of precisely such mistakes."
"I consider this sort of thing counterproductive because it runs counter to the political decisions made by the political bodies."
"I notice that several speakers would like to express their opinions."
"Remember that you each have one minute."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and thanking her for her in-depth work and receptiveness."
"It was a pleasure to work with her on this report."
"I believe that the result of this work is a balanced report of which the focal point is the increase in legal certainty."
"Therefore, the aim now is not to propose more legislation at any price but to make the existing legislation more accessible and intelligible."
"One specific point to be raised - Mrs Rühle has already raised it - is that of service concessions."
"This is a sensitive point that has also caused some controversy within the Commission."
"I should like to insist once again that, insofar as we know that the Commission intends to propose new items of legislation to us on this subject, it should do so by bearing in mind the need to improve the functioning of the single market."
"At this moment in time, nothing else could justify major legislative initiatives on this matter."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my group would actually have liked to support Mrs Rühle's report, because it contains a great many very positive elements."
"Unfortunately, there are three points that we consider lacking or that we are unable to accept as they stand in the report."
"Firstly, Mrs Rühle was unable to accept that we genuinely have need of a legal framework for services in the general economic interest, and secondly, she also failed to state clearly that it is a matter of greater legal certainty in the area of social services in particular."
"This is a shortcoming of the report that we naturally find very regrettable."
"One point that we are absolutely unable to accept is the rejection of service concessions."
"We cannot simply say that it is something we do not want."
"The Court of Justice has already ruled on all this."
"It is highly unpolitical."
"It is very important that we say quite clearly what we want if we know that the European Commission is preparing a legal text."
"It is important that we call upon the European Commission actually to go along with the very positive position taken by the Court of Justice on this matter, thereby also ensuring legal certainty."
"That is our demand and consequently, we have submitted an alternative resolution."
"We ask our fellow Members to support this alternative resolution."
"(RO) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for all her efforts on this report."
"I totally concur with the need to simplify European public procurement legislation and increase transparency."
"I am concerned by the large number of disputes over public procurement in numerous Member States."
"For example, in Romania, the particularly complex legislative framework leads to procedural errors, while the misapplication of public procurement regulations can impede the use of the Structural Funds."
"This is why we need a simpler, clearer legislative framework to facilitate matters on both sides."
"I would also like to comment on the problem of the lowest price."
"I agree that a public procurement contract should not be awarded simply on the basis of offering the lowest price."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that the tender's quality/price ratio and economic benefit must be the most important factors, not only the price."
"The legislative review must therefore take into account this fact and introduce far greater flexibility for public procurers."
"However, we must do this with great caution because, if we fail to establish clear criteria, we will open up a real Pandora's Box, with the risk of us triggering legal uncertainty again and even corruption."
"Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur for my group, but also as the chairman of the committee responsible, I want also to join in thanks to Heide Rühle for what is a really important report."
"Indeed, it is a shame that under the rather strange rules of this Parliament, such an important report about a key element of the single market and indeed public policy is confined only to one-minute interventions."
"I think it is welcome that Mr Tajani is here because I want to say to him that public procurement is a key instrument for encouraging innovative enterprise across the European Union."
"Mr Barnier, we know, is now going to have a look at strategy and I hope will pick up many of these things."
"But the core of the problem, colleagues, is that we have a regime which, as this report says, is confusing and complex and indeed which many public authorities regard as a bureaucratic imposition instead of an opportunity."
"We can use public procurement to drive forward areas like small and medium-sized enterprises, Commissioner, and opportunities for innovation and green products and services - and, indeed, for supporting the whole of the innovation agenda."
"That is what we have to achieve, but it will need a concerted effort by all arms of the Commission to deliver the recommendations in this report."
"(SK) Public procurement appears to be an effective way of purchasing goods and services for the public sector, making it possible to achieve reasonable prices while reducing the suspicion of corruption."
"In future, however, it would be good to work on simplifying the mechanisms of the public procurement process, and also to try and shorten the time it takes to make decisions."
"In my opinion, we should support the basic principle of that aim."
"However, experience shows that it is also a good thing to publish contracts on the Internet, as this makes it possible to familiarise the broader public with these contracts and to convince them of the advantages of the contracts."
"Experience bears this out particularly in local authorities, where handling the assets of the community was very often under the watchful eye of citizens, and when all contracts began to be published on the Internet, people were more satisfied and trusted the local authorities more."
"(CS) I believe that this report on public procurement, which was adopted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection with an absolute majority, will provide a good guideline for the work of the Commission in revising the directive."
"Our aim is to make public procurement much more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses, and for tenders to be less bureaucratic and, at the same time, easier to monitor."
"The greatest volume of public procurement from EU funds relates to buildings, where there is often a suspicion - and sometimes more than that - of corruption."
"I am sorry that we will not be voting in this report on my proposal for the Commission to set up a public portal where it would be possible to monitor price differences between the successful contracts and the actual costs of construction following implementation."
"The portal should monitor and thereby also detect suspicious price differences, for example, relating to the construction of one kilometre of motorway between Member States."
"I firmly believe that access to genuinely open public procurement will only open up for SMEs once corruption has been rooted out."
"(RO) The public procurement market at EU level is worth 16% of the EU's GDP."
"The internal market assumes that any European company can access acquisitions made in any Member State."
"The Services Directive guarantees that any European company can provide services in any other Member State, including via electronic means."
"The internal market needs to ensure interoperability between e-Government systems, therefore, also between digital signature systems and tender systems operated electronically."
"I welcome the PEPPOL pilot project launched by the Commission for online public procurement, as well as the decision about the list of accredited certification service providers and the European plan for setting up a digital signature validation service."
"I wish to draw attention to the fact that in 2005, Member State governments committed to carrying out 50% of public procurement transactions in Europe electronically by 2015."
"Romania implemented the online public procurement system back in 2002, which led to a reduction in public expenditure, a greater degree of transparency and an increase in access to the public procurement market for SMEs."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank Mrs Rühle and the shadow rapporteurs for this sterling report."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is happy with a great deal of what is contained in this report."
"We have also agreed to compromise on one or two points, because you can never have everything in a House such as this."
"Overall, the report provides a good basis for further discussion with the European Commission on a number of topics."
"Mrs Rühle has already addressed the question of how one can enable the contracting bodies, institutions and authorities to take social criteria into consideration in procurement without compromising the principles of the internal market."
"Secondly - and this has been addressed by Mr Engel - how can we design the service concessions so as to comply with the internal market in the long term?"
"I completely agree with Mr Engel and Mrs Rühle that we can only accept new legislation on the proviso that it offers a clear and recognisable advantage for the internal market."
"In view of this, we have achieved a good compromise and naturally, I would be pleased if, ultimately, the Social Democrats were also able to support it."
"(RO) Against the backdrop of the global economic and financial crisis, my country's government has had to reduce the salaries of state employees, pensions and unemployment benefit, as well as cut subsidies."
"Bearing in mind these particularly tough measures, public procurement must be carried out in the most transparent and quickest way possible so as to ensure that public money is spent properly and effectively."
"In addition, the use of online tender systems must be encouraged, which will help eradicate corruption and fraud in the public procurement system."
"Current administrative procedures, the confusing and complicated legal system, along with the need to clarify the process for appeals relating to the awarding of procurement contracts, have blocked the progress of some important contracts."
"Following consultations with the IMF, the Romanian Government amended its public procurement act, which is due to come into force by 1 June."
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial markets crisis has shown the key role of public procurement, which is aimed at developing large-scale works, at stimulating innovation and, of course, at encouraging internal and external competition at European level."
"We consider it essential to simplify standards and achieve greater legal certainty."
"This would definitely increase transparency over the composition and the work of the consultative committee on public procurement, for which the Commission is responsible."
"We welcome the part played by an institutionalised public-private partnership in facilitating access for the small and medium-sized enterprises that form the basis of our economy."
"We need to step up our efforts to prevent discrimination, which often hits small and medium-sized businesses within Europe."
"I congratulate my fellow Members for the work they have carried out, and they can count on my support tomorrow."
"Mr President, I think, in finding reasons for the economic recession we find ourselves in, the finger is pointed - and rightly so - at bankers, builders, regulators, speculators, etc."
"I think, however, the area of public procurement has led to a lot of the problems as well, where there was an element of 'jobs for the boys', a lack of transparency and a lack of integrity."
"The contracts went inevitably to the same people all the time who, of course, time and time again, went over time and over budget but were never penalised."
"I welcome these new developments that will allow us to have the greatest possible transparency in the process."
"However, we also need to ensure that those who are sitting in judgment on these contracts have the greatest expertise and the greatest independence and are not appointees of the parties in power."
"Finally I want to say that simplification is, of course, vital, because there is no point in having too much time and too much money taken up in a very important but, after all, a preliminary exercise."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Barnier, for whom I am standing in this evening, have monitored very closely the preparation of Parliament's own-initiative report on new developments in public procurement and the debate concerning the amendments."
"As Mrs Ticǎu, Mrs Comi and Mr Harbour said, good discipline in the field of public procurement is fundamental to ensuring that best use is made of public money for the welfare of the citizens and of small and medium-sized enterprises, especially in the current tight budgetary situation."
"The comments made in the report will be duly taken into account in the preparation of new initiatives."
"Work has already begun on some initiatives, which are in response to those comments."
"The Commission services have begun an ex post evaluation of the public procurement directives."
"A communication to clarify the way in which to use public procurement to promote sustainable development, social inclusion and innovation is currently being drafted."
"An analysis of the case-law of the Court is also under way on public-public cooperation, and it will enable us to define the scope of public-public cooperation that is included or not within the scope of European public procurement law."
"As regards a possible initiative on concessions, the Commission assumes the burden of proof and is working on an impact study, which will be finalised in 2010."
"This evaluation is a prerequisite for any legislative initiative on the matter."
"If it reveals that the current legal framework is curbing economic development or the development of a new, better quality service of general interest, then we will undoubtedly have to remedy it by ensuring greater transparency, legal certainty and clarity with regard to the applicable rules."
"At international level, we are doing everything we can to open up the public procurement markets of the world's major economies."
"In order to ensure the competitiveness of European industry, reciprocity is at the heart of all our negotiations."
"We want to work in close cooperation with Parliament, and we invite you to maintain a constructive and open approach to the discussion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Tuesday, 18 May 2010)."
"The EU Policy Coherence for Development and the 'Official Development Assistance plus concept' (short presentation)"
"The next item is the short presentation of the report by Franziska Keller, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on EU policy coherence for development and the 'Official Development Assistance plus' concept."
"Mr President, Policy Coherence for Development means not giving with one hand and taking away with the other."
"It makes no sense, for example, to provide funding to support agriculture in developing countries if, at the same time, we destroy the local markets through direct or indirect export subsidies."
"Similarly, we may be continuing with great efforts to promote health provision yet, at the same time, we are preventing the trade in generic medicines or pushing up the prices of medicines to prohibitive levels by extending patent protection."
"Agrofuels may possibly reduce CO2 emissions in the EU a little, but result in deforestation and land grabbing in developing countries, thereby leading to more climate change - which is precisely what we wanted to avoid, not to mention the displacement of indigenous populations and the loss of biodiversity and farm land for growing food."
"At the moment, we - that is, the EU per se - are not particularly coherent."
"The EU has long recognised in theory that political measures must not be contradictory."
"Policy Coherence for Development is laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Article 208 states: 'The Union shall take account of the objectives of development cooperation in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries.'"
"Let us be judged by this requirement."
"This year, we are reviewing the progress made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"It is obvious that we will not be able to keep our promises unless our policies are coherent."
"We - all of us that adopt and transpose legislation - need to be aware of this responsibility."
"Before we decide on a measure, we need to assess the consequences, so that we can recognise the negative effects that European legislation may have on developing countries."
"We need expertise in the Council, the Commission and in Parliament that can recognise incoherent aspects."
"The Commission's work programme on policy coherence is a good step in this direction."
"It is now a matter of how this plan is implemented."
"Policy Coherence for Development means giving greater consideration to the interests of local people in our reform of fisheries policy and not allowing these interests to be subsumed by the interests of European fisheries concerns."
"It means that we must dry up streams of money that flow from developing countries into tax havens."
"It means that we cannot adopt ACTA if there remains a suspicion that this agreement could disrupt the supply of medicines or technologies in developing countries."
"So far, the Commission has not been able to eliminate this suspicion."
"Policy coherence also means that development policy must remain a strong, independent policy area in the creation of the European External Action Service and that the field of competence of the Commissioner for Development must be expanded, not restricted."
"It also includes allowing municipalities to take fair trade, for example, into consideration as a procurement criterion, as proposed by Mrs Rühle."
"In many cases, we Members of Parliament need to keep a close eye on the Commission and the Council to ensure that policies are coherent."
"In many cases, however, it is up to us - the Members of Parliament - to provide coherence for development."
"We need the committees to be more joined up and we need a permanent rapporteur."
"The report - which was unanimously adopted by the Committee on Development - contains many good proposals and takes us a good step forward."
"I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, the ombudsman and all the NGOs for their cooperation and assistance, and I hope that our joint report will be able to be adopted in plenary tomorrow."
"Mr President, I hate to strike a note of discontent about the report at this early stage in the debate, but I should like to refer in particular to recital I and paragraphs 44 and 45."
"There is much that I welcome in this report, but I believe that the content of those paragraphs is partly based on a historical view of agriculture policy and certainly not based on the real situation on the ground at the moment."
"Before I deal in detail with that in the moments I have, let me just say that paragraph 15 is a very key paragraph in the report and perhaps should have been dealt with in more detail."
"It states that only four per cent of overseas development aid is dedicated to agriculture."
"That is quite a shocking figure and it is a figure that I mentioned in a report I drew up in the previous mandate of this Parliament."
"I think there is, perhaps unfortunately, an attack on European farmers in this report."
"I do not think that is appropriate."
"I will certainly not be supporting this report on that basis, and I regret that situation."
"I would urge colleagues to note those paragraphs carefully."
"(ES) Mr President, the report that we are debating today, Mrs Keller's report, highlights a matter crucial to the effectiveness of development policies."
"Coherence always lends effectiveness; when it comes to developing countries, incoherence is tantamount to ineffectiveness, and also to injustice."
"I am talking about development policy, not just official development assistance."
"Coherence means that all sectoral policies - trade policy, agricultural policy, all external actions - must come together in one single policy; a policy which is coherent with the global objectives we are pursuing."
"Only in this way can we create greater synergies and only in this way can we capitalise on the benefits of global public goods."
"This is why I supported and continue to support, in Mrs Keller's report, the demand for Parliament to appoint a speaker to evaluate and monitor the development policies on which this House expresses a view."
"(PT) The European Union's policies and actions in several areas frequently contradict stated development aid objectives."
"The liberalisation and deregulation of world trade - which the European Union has been advocating and pursuing - threatens the weakest production systems of developing countries."
"We must not ignore the fact that a significant proportion of the resources directed to these countries as public development aid ends up returning to the countries of origin in the form of the acquisition of goods and services."
"We cannot ignore the serious constraint that the enormous foreign debt represents; it has already been paid several times over, making its cancellation imperative."
"It is unacceptable that various developing countries are being blackmailed by making their public aid dependent on signing up to the so-called 'Economic Partnership Agreements', despite the resistance of many of these countries and the concerns they have expressed."
"Instead of being imposed, the European Development Fund's priorities must be revised, taking into account the opinion, the priorities and the real needs of developing countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Piebalgs, for whom I am standing in, congratulate the rapporteur on her motion for a resolution on policy coherence for development, which is excellent and exhaustive."
"The Commission fully shares her view on the importance of this ambitious task and fully supports the various proposals contained in the resolution to enhance the European Parliament's work on the matter."
"This resolution comes at just the right time."
"As you know, the Commission has proposed a 12-point action plan to support the Millennium Development Goals."
"Policy coherence for development is one of the priorities of this plan, which is currently being discussed in the Council."
"The main areas of concern appearing in Parliament's motions for resolutions coincide to a large extent with the priorities listed in the Commission's work programmes on future policy coherence for development, even though we do not agree with all the comments contained in the resolution."
"These two documents constitute a solid foundation for the EU institutions to make progress and to work on ensuring the greatest possible coherence of EU policies with the development goals."
"Policy coherence is not just about recording any negative impact that EU policies may have on the development goals."
"It is also about combining our efforts with those of our partners in order to come up with winning solutions that will refocus EU policies on development goals."
"That is why the Commission has adopted a new and improved approach to policy coherence for development."
"This approach links all the EU policies on the matter to five international challenges."
"It does not limit the scope of our efforts."
"It links the evaluation of policies to real strategic objectives."
"Furthermore, the work programme is based on objectives and indicators, and impact studies will more often than not be used to assess the coherence of policies."
"I have one thing to say about official development assistance: the Commission's position on the matter is very clear."
"The European Union and the Member States must fulfil their commitments in this area."
"To that end, the Commission has proposed to establish a responsibility mechanism within the Union."
"This proposal is currently being examined by the Member States."
"At the same time, public financial resources other than official development assistance are going to be provided to developing countries, in order to help them, among other things, to combat climate change."
"Therefore, we must endeavour to find a way of monitoring those resources and ensuring that they are used for development purposes."
"If we are to make our policies more coherent, we must involve our partners."
"Article 12 of the Cotonou Agreement provides for a means of communication, a forum to enable the ACP countries to voice their concerns regarding EU policies."
"That option must be used far more systematically."
"We shall therefore strengthen our dialogue on policy coherence for development within other international bodies such as the Asia-Europe conference on development, which is currently taking place, and the United Nations high-level meeting on the Millennium Development Goals, which will take place in September."
"I have one final comment to make: if we examine the various strategic areas concerned - trade, agriculture, fisheries and others - we cannot fail to see that only a joint and cooperative effort by all the major economic powers, and not just by the European Union, will help to create an environment that is favourable to development."
"Now and in the future, policy coherence for development must be a high priority at European and international level."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Tuesday, 18 May 2010)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I would like to go into more detail concerning recital I and paragraphs 44 and 45 of the present report, the wording of which is highly unfortunate and does not reflect the actual situation."
"Firstly, it must be made clear that export restitution is a European Union instrument of market control that is used very cautiously by the European Commission and applied only in a few exceptional cases."
"Export restitutions, which were designed as a kind of safety net, cannot therefore be held responsible for major damage to the agricultural sector in developing countries - as suggested in the recital."
"Moreover, it must be pointed out that the EU is the world's biggest importer of agricultural produce from developing countries."
"The EU is thus not weakening development and the establishment of a viable agricultural sector in developing countries; quite the contrary."
"The EU undoubtedly has a great responsibility in the area of international trade in the agricultural sector, particularly in respect of developing countries."
"That is not in question and the Union is fully aware of it."
"In view of this, I must protest against blanket judgments that have nothing to do with a differentiated and objective approach."
"I object to recital I as well as to paragraphs 44 and 45, and thus also to the report as a whole."
"in writing. - I support this resolution on Policy Coherence for Development."
"As the Lisbon Treaty clearly states, the European Union has to take account of development cooperation objectives when implementing policies that might impact developing countries."
"At a time when multiple crises seriously threaten the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it is all the more important to ensure that our development policies are not undermined by action in other policy fields."
"While the eradication of poverty is the primary development policy objective of the EU, many policy initiatives undercut this purpose."
"EU agricultural export subsidies gravely undermine food security elsewhere, and we have yet to assess the ecological and social impact of our fisheries agreements with developing countries."
"Policy Coherence for Development cannot be sidelined when negotiating bilateral and regional trade agreements, and has a key role to play if we are to ensure that the outcome of the Doha Round is not detrimental to development."
"European Investment Bank external lending to developing countries must be focused on investments which contribute to eradicating poverty, and has to turn away from tax haven-based companies."
"Human rights, labour and environmental standards and tax governance must guide EU negotiations with developing countries."
"Penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport (short presentation)"
"The next item is the short presentation of the report by Hella Ranner, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank all the members of the committee for their constructive cooperation."
"This report concerns an important matter."
"It affects everyone who travels on Europe's roads."
"It concerns compliance with driving hours and rest periods in goods transport, which needs to be considerably improved."
"Our discussions in committee - along with the many discussions held with a wide range of stakeholders from all sides, as well as discussions with representatives of Member States - showed that it is imperative that the implementation of the rules on driving hours and rest periods is urgently improved."
"The rules on tachographs also need to be improved."
"In May 2009, the Commission submitted a report analysing the implementation of the social rules relating to road transport in the Member States."
"It has to be said that the results were sobering."
"The penalty for the same offence in different Member States varied from EUR 500 to EUR 5 000."
"In consequence, as far as is possible - which is mainly in border areas - drivers naturally flee to states where the penalties are lower."
"This situation cannot continue."
"Differences in the frequency of checks also result in great uncertainty among drivers and undertakings."
"Not only are there differences in the level of fines, but there is also wide variation in the types of sanctions available and in how individual offences are categorised."
"This situation cannot continue, because the aim of such rules is not just road safety and the protection of employees, but also - and this should not be forgotten - fair competition."
"In times of crisis, undertakings come under increasing pressure."
"There is pressure on prices."
"The safety of all those on the roads and, of course, not least of those drivers directly involved, must therefore be absolutely ensured."
"As we are all aware, this can only be achieved if we have an effective penal system."
"The penalties must be clear, transparent and, above all, comparable."
"If we want the regulation on driving hours and rest periods to be successful, then the regulations also have to be sensibly transposed in the Member States - and that is the most important point in this report."
"In any event, we need more frequent and better controls as well as information on the rules, not just for drivers from our Member States but also for drivers from third countries."
"Naturally, they are not always familiar with our systems."
"It is therefore essential to bring about an exchange of information, and this be based in the Commission."
"An agency with general competence for road transport could be responsible for this."
"In this context, I consider it irrelevant which office deals with bringing together checks and results."
"One thing is clear, however: such an office must exist."
"Article 83(2) of the Treaty of Lisbon allows us to intervene in the rules of the individual Member States and to check whether the legal provisions are being harmonised accordingly."
"There was no question in the committee - it was entirely undisputed - that it is in all our interests, and the interests of our safety, to utilise this possibility."
"There is one further significant factor to mention before I conclude my comments."
"If we want drivers to comply with rest periods, then we must provide them with the necessary infrastructure."
"In many Member States, there are not really sufficient safe parking areas."
"It is up to the Member States to provide these, because only then can the rules genuinely have the desired effect."
"I very much hope that the Commission will continue to take this problem seriously and I am convinced that Parliament must and indeed will go along with this."
"This report must not be the end of this work."
"Perhaps it is only the beginning."
"It is a matter of genuinely joining forces to achieve better control and harmonisation, and I expect the Commission to submit a report within the coming year on the possible harmonisation measures, including those under the new rule in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"(EL) Mr President, I really must congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report."
"It is a fact that penalties, the types of penalties, fines and how they are classified - and that is what I wish to emphasise - differ hugely from one Member State to another."
"That is precisely why the report places a great deal of emphasis and the rapporteur quite rightly states at the end of her report that we need specific harmonisation measures from the Commission."
"In Greece, accidents are many and often, there are a lot of infringements and, obviously, if we do not manage to coordinate legislation at European level, if we do not manage to harmonise practices and to ultimately ensure that controls are carried out in a more specific and coordinated manner at European level, then unfortunately, we shall not be able to limit this massive problem."
"For Greece in particular, this is a very sensitive issue, which is why we believe that this report will constitute an excellent starting point for further action."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first to thank - both personally and on behalf of my colleague, Mr Kallas, for whom I am standing in - Mrs Ranner for her report on a particularly important aspect of the social rules in road transport."
"The Commission's initial report underlined the very significant differences between the penalties applicable in the Member States for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport."
"The penalties vary with regard to their type and category of seriousness and with regard to the level of fines."
"For example, a driver who exceeds the maximum daily driving time risks a fine, which can be 10 times higher in Spain than in Greece."
"The Commission welcomes Parliament's decision to follow up the report it drafted."
"Parliament is emphasising just how unsatisfactory the current situation is, insofar as drivers and hauliers may wrongly believe that committing an infringement is less serious in one Member State than it is in another."
"Clearly, this is potentially detrimental to road safety and to competition."
"Parliament's report therefore makes a valuable contribution to the Commission's efforts to coordinate the harmonised implementation of the rules in force."
"Parliament's report suggests, among other things, setting minimum and maximum penalties for each infringement against the social rules and stresses that Article 83 of the Treaty of Lisbon provides for the possibility of establishing minimum rules with regard to penalties, as the rapporteur said."
"The Commission will shortly scrutinise the extent to which and the way in which these new provisions of the treaty can be used to improve the implementation of the social rules in road transport."
"I am grateful to you for this particularly constructive report, and I can assure you that the issues raised and the suggestions made by the European Parliament will be scrutinised by the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Tuesday, 18 May 2010)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Today's discussion has made us aware of the significant variations in the penalties for serious infringements of social rules in road transport as provided for in the legislation of the 27 EU Member States."
"Therefore, I think it is a particularly valuable idea to prepare a multilingual brochure which would give drivers and undertakings clear information about social rules in different Member States."
"The brochure should contain a list of estimates of penalties which can be imposed on a driver for infringement of a particular rule."
"Another interesting point is the use of RDS-TMC technology instead of GPS to keep drivers informed in real time about penalties in force in the country in which the driver is currently located."

"Amending budget no 1/2010: Section I - Parliament - Estimates of revenue and expenditure for the year 2011 - Section I - Parliament (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr Maňka, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on Draft Amending budget no 1/2010 of the European Union for the financial year 2010, Section I - European Parliament, and"
"the report by Mrs Trüpel, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the estimates of revenue and expenditure of Parliament for the financial year 2011."
"Many procedures are now more direct and more transparent, due to the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon has come into force."
"Powers are more clearly defined."
"The European Parliament has greater power, and the European Union has boosted its standing both externally and internally."
"For the first time in the history of democracy, the citizens of a number of countries have the right to influence events on a supranational level."
"In view of the size and diversity of Europe, we must take care that all citizens, including those who are not very wealthy and do not belong to large established organisations, have recourse to all democratic means."
"Utilisation of these democratic means must not be dependent on the possession of large financial resources."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has a specific financial impact on some European institutions."
"During the budget procedure for 2010, it was agreed that we would preferentially use an available reserve in Heading 5 for financing additional costs arising directly from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Today, therefore, after adopting the original budget for 2010, we are addressing the corresponding additional expenditure via an amending budget."
"Following the submission of applications for additional resources, we took every effort to locate reserves and distribute existing resources as far as possible."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has a direct or indirect effect on all of the European Parliament's services."
"The amending budget of the European Parliament, which we are debating today, will secure the additional financial and human resources to enable Parliament to fulfil its new codecision-making role on an equal footing to that of the Council."
"The net financial impact of the amending budget of the European Parliament is lower than the original demand for budgetary resources."
"In the conciliation proceedings with the Presidency of the European Parliament, we managed to find EUR 4 million."
"There was a further reduction in demand for resources as a result of the timing, as we approved the budget a month later than we originally expected."
"Most companies and institutions, not only in Europe but throughout the world, are taking advantage of the global economic crisis to improve their efficiency and competitiveness."
"This is the challenge for us, the European Parliament, just as it is for other European institutions."
"The Secretary-General of the European Parliament now has further savings and efficiency improvements at his disposal, and not just for this year."
"The detailed functional audit at the INLO Directorate-General and in the security service unit, which we agreed on when approving the budget in December, may bring significant and sustainable savings for future budget periods as well."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's budget for 2011 is the first real budget for our Chamber since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That means that Parliament has more competences, we have more duties, we have more responsibility, we have more legislative duties - in other words, we need more working capacity and that means we need a bigger budget."
"At the same time - and this is very important to me - we have to be aware that we are in the midst of the economic and financial crisis and the euro stability crisis."
"In Germany the debt cutbacks will kick in in 2011, high levels of cutbacks are needed in Greece and in all heavily indebted public budgets."
"We thus need to find a very responsible position for how we approach the increases in Parliament's budget in these difficult economic times."
"As rapporteur for the 2011 budget, I will reflect the majority position, although I will also set out my own green position."
"Twenty per cent for Parliament's budget, based on the administrative budget, was an upper limit that was laid down between the institutions in 1988."
"The majority in the Committee on Budgets believe, however, that that cannot apply to the same degree to 2011, as the reality has changed."
"We have enlargement, we have more competences and we have more duties, so the 20% figure must not necessarily be regarded as fixed."
"Despite that, it has become clear that we are aiming to stick to the area around 20% for reasons of self-discipline and responsibility."
"The Bureau has proposed a figure of 20.46% - in other words, EUR 39 million above the figure for 2010."
"After some debate - and taking account of the conflict of aims - we have now agreed that we will only spend 20.32% - in other words, an additional EUR 20 million."
"There is consensus that we need more staff for enlargement, more staff for the library, IT and studies, that we need to give clearer priority to environmental protection here in Parliament and that it would be very positive for there to be more bikes available in Strasbourg so that less use would need to be made of the transport service."
"Where is there controversy, however?"
"There is controversy on the question of whether there should be more money in 2011 - EUR 1 500 - for assistants."
"I repeat that that is for assistants, not for Members of this House."
"That would total EUR 13.2 million."
"The majority in the Committee voted to place these increases for assistants in the reserve on the basis of the argument that this should be better evaluated and decided later in the year."
"I would like to make the green position on this point clear, which is that we need to be sensitive to the general debt problems and my group therefore believes that we should waive this increase of EUR 1 500 for the next year."
"We should not change the Members' statute at this point - we should instead undertake to take fewer business flights for short trips so that we actually apply environmental protection - which we repeatedly call for politically - to our own behaviour and our own Parliament."
"It is therefore very pleasing that we have succeeded in improving our own environmental protection data, one example being a 12.9% drop in CO2 emissions in 2008."
"We have reduced energy consumption by 0.8%."
"We would like to see a job-funded pass for local public transport, in other words, we want to prove ourselves to be responsible from both a financial and an environmental policy point of view."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is advocating budgetary stringency, transparency and sustainability."
"We therefore welcome the work of the administration in specifying fixed and variable expenditure, as well as the fact that a medium-term strategy regarding buildings policy has been tabled."
"Nevertheless, we believe that these documents can be improved in the future, and we would remind you that we are advocating a long-term buildings strategy."
"We are ambitious regarding budgetary stringency, so we want progress to be made towards a zero-based budget, in which each item of expenditure is supported by documentary evidence."
"To the same end, we also propose that progress be made in carrying out a cost-benefit analysis of variable expenditure."
"We would argue that there is a potential saving and we therefore support - indeed we are ourselves suggesting this - reductions in some budgetary items."
"Excellence in lawmaking is Parliament's principle goal."
"We all know that not having the appropriate legislation or having bad legislation always leads to high costs; costs which, in the final analysis, are always borne by the European public."
"To achieve this aspiration of excellence in lawmaking in the face of the new competences resulting from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we support the possibility of recruiting new human resources; we want these to be of a high standard; indeed, we demand it."
"I would also remind you that we are going to have 18 new Members and that these too must be in a position to properly exercise their mandate."
"The times we live in are very demanding and European institutions play an essential role; it is a crucial role, in which they must not fail, and they therefore need to have sufficient means at their disposal."
"We are well aware that there can always be strong doses of populism and demagoguery surrounding budgetary issues, and we repudiate these."
"There are even those who insinuate that MEPs' allowances are increasing, which is not true."
"What we are seeking is for Parliament to have allowances sufficient for it to have the dignity that we all advocate, and achievement of the goal that the European public expects, indeed demands, of us: excellence in lawmaking."
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, it is always controversial when you discuss your own budget, and we have seen that in our discussions on the amending budget and in our own budget for 2011."
"However, I am pleased that most of the issues have now been resolved for 2011 within the Committee on Budgets itself."
"Indeed, I believe there are now very few differences between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau, apart from maybe three or four issues."
"One, of course, is the 20% threshold."
"Another is the buildings reserve, another is the posts which have now been put into reserve and another is the second tranche of EUR 1 500 per Member per month for the assistants' allowance."
"These two tranches of EUR 1 500 per Member are controversial and would be difficult at any time, but are, of course, even more controversial in difficult economic times. This is even though we all recognise that the Lisbon Treaty has given us more responsibilities."
"It is because of this that a compromise has been reached to put the funding for the second tranche of EUR 1 500 into a reserve and it will remain there until the full costings of this proposal are established."
"I think the other controversial issue for us which is outstanding is the office-holders allowance."
"The compromise reached here was to reduce the figure allocated for office holders down from EUR 1.2 million to EUR 400 000 and, of course, documented evidence of receipts must be provided when any claims are made."
"I think that is an important principle and one we would all want to support."
"Colleagues themselves will decide whether these two compromises are acceptable to them or not."
"I believe the majority of the S&D Group will find those compromises acceptable to them."
"One thing, however, has also become clear in our discussions on the 2011 budget, and that is if we are to fund extra responsibilities in the future because of the Lisbon Treaty, we must also find efficiency savings elsewhere."
"For the 2011 budget, some attempts at making these savings have been made."
"Indeed, the overall increase has come down from 6.5% to around 5.8%."
"That is welcome, but I believe we need to do much more in the future."
"I hope that in the future, the Bureau will come forward with recommendations and proposals, not only about spending, but also about ways in which we can make efficiency savings in the future."
"I would hope those savings would include changes in the way we do things, rather than just making cuts."
"I believe it is important in the future that if the Bureau does come forward - and I hope it will - with efficiency savings proposals, that it is discussed with Members at an early stage."
"This will give the European Parliament the chance to shape the budget, but also to shape our priorities and to identify savings ourselves, but in the meantime, we should continue to work to ensure that our budget for 2011 is acceptable to Members, to this Parliament and, of course, to the public as well."
"Madam President, we have had an interesting debate on Parliament's own budget for this year and next year."
"I would like to start by giving particular thanks to Mrs Trüpel, who has done a good job on the preparation of next year's budget."
"It is probably more balanced than was originally intended."
"The Treaty of Lisbon brings with it new requirements of the European Parliament and, with that in mind, it is logical for Parliament to expect some increased costs, because there will be an increase in our activities."
"At the same time, it is absolutely astonishing that we have been entirely incapable of reorganising our own activities in order to meet the new requirements."
"That is an area in which we need to improve."
"In the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, we have been critical of the cost increases originally proposed by the Bureau which have, in fact, now been partly cut, as has been said."
"Nonetheless, I would like to say that the ALDE Group does not accept, and will not vote in favour of, a further EUR 1 500 per month increase in allowances for each Member so that they can employ further assistants."
"We also oppose the idea that the chairs of the committees should be given an entertainment allowance."
"It is obvious that the two big political groups have now found a point of contact in this matter, but we in the ALDE Group will fight for our views in this Chamber."
"It is important that the European Parliament shows that we really are interested in the level of costs to which we give rise."
"I cannot really understand the logic that was presented here earlier according to which it is a matter not of cost increases, but rather of being able to perform our duties properly."
"That is not what it is about at all."
"In the final event, it is only about cost increases."
"By extension, it is also good to remember that the greater the number of assistants employed in Parliament, the greater will be our requirements in terms of our buildings and it will become very expensive in the long term."
"We in the ALDE Group are highly critical of some of these proposals and will vote accordingly when the House votes."
"Madam President, I would like to start with the magic word 'balance' once again, which Mr Haglund has just mentioned."
"I actually believe that, as we now discuss the 2011 budget, we must take as our starting point the question 'How can we find a proper and responsible balance?'"
"Mr Fernandes spoke of popularism in relation to Parliament's considered idea of being very responsible and self-disciplined in the 2011 budget."
"I completely disagree with him in this regard."
"I do not believe that it is popularism for us to together come to the considered conclusion that, in the light of the many cutbacks that we are demanding of other countries, we too need to examine very closely how we in Parliament must act with self-discipline."
"On the contrary, I believe that to be precisely the political responsibility of the European Parliament in the current circumstances."
"In the cutbacks that are being demanded of Greece and public budgets in general, we must have the courage, on the one hand, to legitimise the increases that we do need in order to do our work responsibly and yet, at the same time, to find a limit where we say: under present conditions, we also require a certain delimitation, as that is simply a part of the political landscape."
"This must be signalled according to the maxim 'We have understood!'"
"That is important from a political point of view, and I therefore once again call on all the groups to consider what signal we will be giving the public with the 2011 budget."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, in Romania, civil servants are facing a 25% cut in their salaries, in Spain, public sector employees will see 5% to 15% of their wages disappear, and in Portugal - not to mention Greece - governments are making huge efforts to save on human resources."
"In the UK, the new government has already indicated that there is a need for a major package of financial savings this year."
"Does anybody in this Parliament think that now is the time for the European Parliament to spend more on anything - to increase spending, have more staff for groups, library, committees, IT staff and an additional EUR 1 500 in assistants' allowances?"
"We are debating the second tranche of the EUR 1 500;"
"I say that even the first is absolutely unnecessary."
"It should not be a question of putting the second into reserve; we should eliminate both because this is not the time to do this."
"We are all aware of increased competences, but more competences do not necessarily require more spending."
"It requires more efficient spending, more accountability and more responsibility."
"I completely agree with Mrs Trüpel, who said that there are ways to make additional savings."
"We do not need a fleet of cars here in Strasbourg."
"We have free public transportation."
"I use the tram every day."
"Instead of using business class tickets, we can use economy class in order to make savings."
"I, for one, as a matter of principle, have never flown business class when coming here from Budapest."
"All in all, while the discussion between the Bureau and Committee on Budgets was very useful in this respect, I think that a tremendous amount of further opportunities exist where we can make savings."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, once again, I am appalled to see how the Members of this Parliament continue to demand budget increases while people in the Member countries are struggling to live through the present crisis."
"But today I will refer to the ethics of this House."
"In the present situation, is it acceptable that, while they demand power to control national budgets, the European institutions want to increase their own administrative budgets, as is the case with this Parliament?"
"Is it acceptable that the EU institutions go to the Court of Justice over the Council's decision to moderate the increase in salaries of EU civil servants?"
"Is it ethically acceptable for Parliament to rush out its approval of the Council's 2008 accounts in exchange for the latter's approval of Parliament's budget increases?"
"Let me explain: the Budgetary Control Committee has voted unanimously against approving the Council's 2008 accounts due to a lack of transparency."
"Coincidentally, the Council has failed to approve budget increases for Parliament."
"I guess that we will see Parliament voting in favour of approving the Council's accounts this week, and shortly afterwards the Council will be approving extra budget for the Parliament."
"These votes, ladies and gentlemen of Europe, the ones for Parliament's budget and the Council's discharge, are representative of the ethics of the institutions that aim to govern all of us."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaty of Lisbon brought with it changes, including, and indeed specifically relating to, the importance of the European Parliament."
"I have already pointed out once that my 'Yes' to the amendment of the parliamentary budget is a conditional one."
"Of course, the European Parliament should strive for legislative excellence."
"Of course, strengthening Parliament's role means that it has more obligations, more responsibility and more work."
"That said, in times of crisis like those we are in at present - the worst economic crisis in 60 years - I would point out that, as MEPs, we, too, and indeed we, specifically, should exercise particular care with the money entrusted to us."
"The Council and the European Parliament are supposed to and must work together to a greater extent, and this cooperation requires a willingness to act as partners."
"(BG) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs, Mrs Trüpel and Mr Maňka, for their excellent work in preparing the decisions which we are discussing today."
"We must acknowledge that this was anything but an easy task, as witnessed by today's debate."
"On the one hand, we must be paragons of thrift and efficiency when it comes to spending European taxpayers' money."
"On the other hand, however, we must give Parliament the opportunity to fulfil all its duties and responsibilities which these same taxpayers have entrusted to it through the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The fact is that the new European Union treaty imposes the most changes and new duties actually on our institution."
"One of the most serious issues causing much debate was the extent to which the European Parliament is taking into account the tough economic situation in Europe and showing leadership in terms of restricting expenditure and increasing its effectiveness."
"The parliamentary decisions which we are discussing today are relevant to the economic situation."
"A minimum 5.5% increase in expenditure allows us to increase the European Parliament's staff by taking on 18 new employees."
"We need the administration to provide specialist support for areas which have significantly increased, where the European Parliament's decisions are crucial."
"We offer MEPs the opportunity to have more contact with their voters, to undergo specialist training in more areas and to fulfil their new duties, which were entrusted to them by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We are paragons of thrift as we are accommodating all the new functions as part of an overspend of just 0.28% on the agreement reached many years ago so that the European Parliament's expenditure does not exceed 20% of the European budget's administrative costs."
"At the same time, we must state very clearly that the old agreement needs to be renegotiated in future so that it reflects, to a large extent, the changes in the institutions' functions and, in particular, the increase in the role and, accordingly, the expectations of the European Parliament."
"Fellow Members, we still have reserves available."
"In future, we must increase our efforts to make Parliament work more efficiently, for instance, by relying not on buildings but on new technologies, by setting an example in terms of institutional and environmental standards and by analysing closely the impact of every expense and not allowing the budget to grow automatically, as is usually the case with any bureaucracy."
"We must not forget that we are accountable to our voters, who are going through difficult times at the moment, for every action we take."
"(DE) Madam President, in times of crisis, in particular, politicians must be able to separate their rational and emotional sides, especially when it comes to budgetary matters and money."
"I have the feeling that the Treaty of Lisbon and the associated budgetary issues are a little bit like the weather forecast - you never know exactly how things will look in the morning."
"The forecast says rain, so you take the umbrella, and in the end it maybe spits a little, but there is definitely no real rain."
"It is the same with the Treaty of Lisbon: we do not know how Parliament's workload will be changed by the Treaty."
"I have to wonder how it was possible for Members to have worked in the committees and the presidiums in the past in such a way that there will be no change as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The discussion about the EUR 1 500 increase in the secretarial allowance is symbolic for the issue of whether we are able to slim down our structures, save funds and make our working processes more efficient."
"Taking these three points into account would be of greater benefit to us than ever increasingly talking about the area of funding."
"Above all, it is only over the next year that we will see what impact the Treaty of Lisbon has really had on our work."
"(PL) There is no doubt that the European Parliament, which has more responsibilities and a greater role to play following ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, quite naturally must have greater financial resources to be able to fulfil this role."
"The previous speaker is right."
"We do not know how much, in practice, that role will increase, but we do know that it will increase."
"In relation to this, quite naturally, our voters' and taxpayers' expectations of us are greater, too."
"This, too, is why the request for an increase in funding, for example, for Members' assistants, is unquestionably justified both financially and politically."
"We are aware that at the moment, there is a huge crisis in Greece and generally in the countries of southern Europe, which is obviously also a problem of a political nature, but when cutting costs, we must not amputate certain functions of the European Parliament."
"I am profoundly convinced that the budget of the European Parliament should be significantly increased."
"(NL) Madam President, Parliament's draft budget for 2011 is EUR 1.7 billion."
"That is equivalent to EUR 2.3 million per MEP per year, EUR 200 000 per month and a staggering EUR 6 400 per MEP per day; and there are 736 MEPs in this House."
"Madam President, EUR 6 400 is a huge amount of money."
"I can think of a hundred things it would be better spent on than this puppetry."
"Most importantly, however, citizens themselves must be able to take such decisions."
"Let us shut up shop in Brussels, Luxembourg and, primarily, Strasbourg today."
"Let us simply clear everyone out of the buildings, lock the door, throw away the key and give that EUR 1.7 billion back to the citizens who have earned it with their own blood, sweat and tears."
"Each Member of this House should have to get up and go to bed every day with the thought that he or she will cost, or has cost, the taxpayer EUR 6 400 that day."
"Each Member must also see it as his or her duty to bring that amount down every day, as everything that is spent on nonsense here is taxpayers' money that has been produced by citizens through enormously hard work."
"That is what should happen, but it does not."
"In this House, more is always better."
"Via handshakes, like-knows-like, shadowy deals in back rooms, tens of millions are added to the budget."
"The elite decides, and the public coughs up."
"Everyone should think about this at night before going to sleep, and I would call on everyone to do so tonight: to ask him or herself, 'have I cost EUR 6 400?'"
"If they do not do so, they should be deeply ashamed, as they are worth nothing as MEPs."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would say to Mr van der Stoep: I am worth my money, and I am standing by that position."
"If you are not worth yours, then you have my sympathy."
"All I can say is that we are doing ourselves no favours if we create working conditions for ourselves in this House that effectively make it impossible for us to work."
"I support the increase in the secretarial allowance - indeed for both levels - and I believe that this is highly justifiable."
"Anyone who works in this House needs staff."
"Those who do not want to work should not prevent those who want and have to work from doing so."
"No one will be forced to use the increase in the secretarial allowance - you can use it, you do not have to do so."
"If MEPs do not use the allowance, then all the better for the taxpayers, who will then get the money back."
"I, in turn, can only speak for myself when I say that I am worth the money and that the same applies to my staff."
"However, we must put under the microscope activities that were undertaken in the past on the basis of a surplus in this budget."
"We must examine whether we thus want to and are able to continue these activities."
"I am also thinking, in this regard, above all, about the web TV service."
"I think that we have to take action, that we cannot leave everything as it is."
"Apart from that, we have undertaken many reforms with the Bureau and we should also allow these reforms to bite."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control will do everything in its power to point out where things are not working."
"Madam President, across Europe, governments and public institutions are facing up to the need for cuts, but this Parliament continues to live in a fairytale world."
"I hear fine words about the need for savings and efficiency, but the budget of over EUR 1.7 billion in 2011 is an increase of nearly 6%."
"This is totally unacceptable."
"We should be talking about massive savings, not increases."
"There are many ways in which this could be done."
"For a start, we should be cutting unnecessary waste and expenditure."
"This House should demand that Council end the Strasbourg circus and save annual costs of over EUR 200 million."
"A further EUR 50 million would be saved every year by closing the European Parliament offices in each of our countries."
"We must streamline the bureaucracy: the number of officials employed by Parliament has increased by 14% to 6 000 in just three years."
"Any other organisation in straitened times would meet new priorities with compensating reductions elsewhere."
"We seem to think that we live in a different world."
"We need to take the necessary steps to bring about real changes and real cuts in Parliament's budget."
"(NL) I should like to come back to the idea of twice adding EUR 1 500 per month to the secretarial assistance allowance."
"It is true that Lisbon gives us many additional tasks, so I shall certainly not be opposing the idea of more staff for the parliamentary committees given additional tasks by Lisbon, such as the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Nor shall I be opposing more staff for the groups, to enable them to better support that kind of task, but let us be honest, ladies and gentlemen: it is crazy, and also incorrect, to give each individual MEP EUR 1 500 more this year and a further EUR 1 500 on top next year."
"I myself have worked in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for 10 years, and I continue to do so."
"That committee has very many legislative tasks under the codecision, or ordinary legislative, procedure."
"I have always managed with three assistants, and I assume that those MEPs currently working or about to work in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs can also manage with three assistants."
"Your suggestion, Mrs Gräßle - that extra staff should be given to those wanting to work but not to those not wanting to - is populism of the highest order."
"I would like to thank everyone who expressed an opinion."
"I am pleased that you all want to perform your legislative work as well as possible, and to make the best possible use of resources."
"Each one of us has his or her own opinion as to where and how we might improve things."
"Today's debate bears witness to this."
"I would like to say to Mr Bokros that there is a way to achieve savings through objective methods."
"This way was blocked one year ago by Members of your political group, among others."
"Since January, I have been the head of a regional authority in my own country."
"After taking up this post, the first step was an independent external study of all the processes in my institution."
"This audit will eliminate duplication and reduce administrative costs by more than 15%."
"If we want to analyse spare capacity and reorganise existing resources to the greatest possible extent, an objective and independent external study is the best solution."
"Those who had the courage to take this step achieved the best use of resources and managed to reduce their administrative costs markedly."
"In the coming days, we will be debating and voting on the 2010 amending budget of the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"These institutions are clearly expanding their activities, with greater powers and a greater workload."
"I would also like to make a request to the Council for us to be able to finalise these budgets as soon as possible, so that both institutions can carry out their responsibilities in a responsible and efficient manner in the new or expanded areas introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you have all heard how controversial the debate about this 2011 budget is."
"No wonder, either, given that, in fact, it concerns real increases and cuts but also - as always in politics - symbolic issues."
"As rapporteur, I would like to put the following on the record."
"You have seen the full spectrum of viewpoints here, from Mrs Gräßle from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which is very settled in favouring these increases - including the EUR 1 500 - in order to safeguard its ability to work, to other Members, who have said 'We do not need this' or 'We need to evaluate much more precisely how the increases can be justified and provide ourselves with an overview, including of the individual committees and working areas of this House'."
"As rapporteur, I would like to point out that the majority of the Committee on Budgets decided to place the additional money in the reserve - it has thus not yet been agreed by the Committee on Budgets - and to demand a precise evaluation."
"All of that therefore still has to be done."
"We need to get this evaluation on the table, and then in the autumn we will once again have to very seriously get to grips with these results so that we will be able to further negotiate with the Council in October under the new budget procedure and also so that we can find a majority position internally here in Parliament."
"In the current state of affairs, it is important to point out that there is controversy, there are very different opinions and there is a majority opinion according to which we need to look at the figures very closely once again."
"My thanks for your advice, and I hope that we all demonstrate prudence as we move forwards."
"Thank you, Mrs Trüpel."
"However, this ends the joint debate on the budget."
"Thank you for your speeches."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the report by Mr Maňka will take place tomorrow, and the vote on the report by Mrs Trüpel will take place today at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The amending budget is the outcome of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Parliament has come up against new challenges and will need resources if it is to meet its new responsibilities and challenges with success."
"I should like to emphasise that European citizens want Parliament to perform its duties impeccably and, in order to safeguard this, it is important for its members, its committees and its political groups to have the necessary resources."
"Furthermore, we believe that financial discipline and spending cuts are needed now more than ever, and European citizens quite rightly expect them of us, which is why we have prepared a budget that guarantees financial austerity and transparency."
"We have also insisted on the need for long-term policy planning for European Parliament buildings, in a bid to safeguard satisfactory financial support both now and in coming years."
"We are sure that these measures will help to put us in a position to address the concerns, expectations and demands of the citizens of Europe."
"To close, I should like to congratulate Vladimir Maňka on his excellent report."
"European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 (amendment of Decision No 573/2007/EC)."

"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr Tavares, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Decision No 573/2007/EC establishing the European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 to 2013 as part of the General programme 'Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows' and repealing Council Decision 2004/904/EC - C7-0123/2009 -,"
"the report by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 on migration from the Schengen Information System (SIS 1+) to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) - C7-0244/2009 - 2009/0136(NLE)),"
"the report by Mr Coelho, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Decision 2008/839/JHA on migration from the Schengen Information System (SIS 1+) to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) - 2010/0006(NLE)), and"
"the report by Mr Tavares, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by reminding you that Parliament has already criticised the enormous delays in implementing the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)."
"On 22 October 2009, we adopted a resolution on the SIS II and the Visa Information System."
"The European Parliament once again expressed deep concern at the delays in commencing operations and requested information from the Commission and the Council on the results of the technical tests, demanding full transparency regarding the implementation process for the SIS II."
"The SIS II should have become operational in 2007."
"We are now in 2010 and no one is able to give a firm answer on when it will be concluded."
"As regards the package of proposals that we are considering, four fundamental questions arise."
"First, when is this migration to take place?"
"Before the SIS II can become operational it must be personally tested to check whether the system is capable of functioning in accordance with the technical and operational requirements set out in the respective legal instruments."
"Only after all these tests have been successfully concluded can migration from the first generation Schengen Information System to the SIS II take place."
"Second, have these tests been concluded?"
"No."
"Faced with enormous delays to the project, and because of all the problems and difficulties encountered, the Council decided to carry out two 'milestone' tests: the first in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the second in summer 2010."
"However, the first test had to be postponed until late January because the prerequisites had not been met."
"The test took place between 21 and 24 January 2010: apparently the system worked for the first 25 hours, but was notoriously unstable throughout the rest of the test."
"This test was carried out again between 2 and 5 March, and the final assessment and validation of the second set of tests took place on 6 April."
"Although the test conditions were not fully respected by the Member States or the contracted company, and despite the fact that the limited number of transfers did not comply with the required response times, the great majority of Member States concluded that the deviations were insignificant and that the tests' major objectives had been met."
"The new general timetable and budgetary plan are to be adopted at the next Council meeting in June, or in October 2010 at the latest."
"It was also thought essential that the following conditions be met before the system becomes operational."
"The Milestone II test must be successfully carried out and the operating conditions must be fully met."
"The overall test for which there is provision in Article 55 of the Regulation must also be successfully carried out, and the safety of the network completely ensured."
"Third question: why is it so urgent for these initiatives to be adopted?"
"Although the conditions necessary in order to go ahead with the migration have not all been met, nor is a time foreseeable when that will be the case, the mandate that was granted to the Commission to develop the SIS II will expire again on 30 June 2010."
"We therefore have to amend the sunset clauses in the migration instruments adopted in 2008 in order to prevent them from expiring."
"For my fourth and final question, what aspects of the proposals have I sought to amend?"
"First, the insertion of a sunset clause, which the Commission had not proposed."
"We propose that it be set for 31 December 2013."
"Given the considerable delays, it is also essential that it be set out in the legal basis that the solution used, whatever it may be, must be based on the available technology, must follow a reasonable timetable and must be acceptable in terms of cost effectiveness."
"The Global Programme Management Board must also be created, and its management of the SIS II formally integrated."
"I am absolutely convinced that if this body had existed from the start, we would have managed to be better coordinated, we would have known more, and we would have been more effective."
"Finally, I consider it crucial that the migration process be submitted to parliamentary scrutiny."
"Parliament is not just responsible for the legal basis: as budgetary authority, it also ensures the supervision of actions financed by the Union budget."
"That is why I, alongside my fellow Member, Mr Alvaro, have tabled an amendment to place funds in reserve."
"I have also tabled an amendment alongside my fellow Members Mr Alvaro, Mrs Ludford, Mr Enciu and Mrs Hohlmeir to request an audit by the European Court of Auditors."
"I would like to thank everyone for being extremely cooperative."
"I am unable to give the floor to Mr Tavares right now because he has had some slight transport problems thanks to a certain volcano."
"As soon as he joins us, I will give him the floor."
"Madam President, SIS II is a tale of attempts, failures and new attempts that has gone on for years."
"These attempts, failures and new attempts have thus far gobbled up a total of EUR 90 million - 90 million which, in many people's eyes, has been completely wasted."
"From a budgetary point of view, I can endorse Mr Coelho's every sentence, every word and every effort."
"We are working very closely and very well together on this."
"We all have a common interest in SIS II working."
"Sometimes, however, you have to admit - as with many things in life - when things are not working, and you have to consider alternatives."
"We, as the European Parliament, are not prepared to give up this project already and we will support Commissioner Malmström, who has accepted this difficult inheritance, in any way we can."
"It must be clear, however - and we have established this in the Committee on Budgets and are also recommending it to the plenary - that contributions for SIS II be placed in the reserve, so that we can have more control over the use of these funds."
"Personally, I expect that there is a plan B for the case where we admit, one day, that we are not able to achieve what we wanted to achieve."
"In the absence of Mr Tavares, I give the floor to Commissioner Malmström."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I should like to thank Mr Coelho and Mr Alvaro for their contributions, and thank you for the very constructive cooperation we have had on this extremely complicated file that I inherited."
"It is very complicated, but I am determined to work together with you in order to get this right in a transparent way and to see the project completed."
"The vote tomorrow is very timely for the SIS II project."
"The Council has confirmed that the Milestone I test was successful and that the development of SIS II should continue on the basis of current technical solutions."
"The legislative proposals before you contained three substantial elements: Mr Coelho made reference to them, and that will change the development of the project."
"First, as Mr Coelho said, the initial expiry date of the instruments - 30 June this year - has become unrealistic and will therefore be changed."
"This will allow the SIS II project to continue in the light of technical requirements and a global schedule which are currently being redefined with the Member States' experts."
"It will be available for the Council on 3 and 4 June."
"The rapporteur calls for a specific deadline for SIS II development."
"I am sorry to tell you that the Commission is not yet in a position to take up that proposal."
"The Commission's experts, together with all Member States, are in the process of finalising the adaptation of requirements and the new global schedule."
"Once this is done, the Commission will make appropriate suggestions in the light of the new global schedule to be presented at the next Justice and Home Affairs Council in two weeks."
"Secondly, the Global Programme Management Board is a group of technical experts advising on SIS II development and that should be formalised."
"The global management board has already proven to be a very good tool of cooperation and technical analysis between the Commission and Member State experts."
"The proposal will make sure that this will continue whilst streamlining the board's role, composition and procedures."
"For this reason - it is a purely technical body - it is not appropriate to open the board to MEPs and other parliamentary officials."
"We will continue to move forward on SIS II in a transparent way with the European Parliament, but we must keep a clear distinction between the technical work and political transparency."
"But in this spirit, the Commission is open to providing full technical information to the Members of this House by making available the reports of the board to Parliament, in line with what Mr Coelho suggests."
"Thirdly, the necessary legal flexibility to carry out the development through an alternative technical scenario would be foreseen and I believe that we all agree on the rationale of this."
"As regards the budgetary aspects of continuing SIS II development, the Commission shares the rapporteur's aim to make the most efficient use of taxpayers' money."
"In this context, the report asks to reserve Parliament's right to put funds for SIS II development for 2011 in the budgetary reserve."
"This is, of course, entirely within the discretion of the budgetary authority."
"From the point of view of budgetary implementation, I would only ask Mr Alvaro if there could be some sort of clear and efficient de-blocking procedure for the case when we would need the money."
"I would like to thank the LIBE committee, Mr Coelho and the Budgetary Control Committee rapporteur, Mr Alvaro, for their excellent cooperation on this file."
"I am sorry that Mr Tavares is not yet here."
"We would have had an opportunity to discuss the EU resettlement programme - an extremely important subject - with him."
"As you know, a large majority of refugees worldwide are hosted in countries in Asia, Africa and the Middle East."
"Many of these refugees find themselves in Catch-22 situations: they cannot return to their country of origin, nor can they integrate locally in the country of first asylum, since many of these countries are themselves victims of conflict or poverty."
"For these groups of refugees, resettlement can be the only solution."
"Through resettlement, the Member States of the European Union can demonstrate tangible solidarity with these often over-burdened countries of first asylum, at the same time protecting some of the most vulnerable refugees under sustainable and humane conditions."
"Today, resettlement is carried out, but there is no structural coordination at EU level."
"The Commission believes that the EU can play a bigger part and be more active on resettlement by strengthening the Union's role globally and showing solidarity with the most affected regions."
"The proposal tabled in September 2009 aims to improve the situation."
"We are very satisfied by the very positive response that Parliament and the Council have given to the proposal."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Tavares for his sterling work on this, and I welcome the strong political consensus among the different groups on this matter."
"The idea in the proposal is that the EU, in partnership with the UNHCR, will contribute to more strategic use of resettlement on the basis of an annual decision on the common priorities for resettlement."
"By pooling the national quotas, the EU can help to alleviate some of the most difficult conflicts in the world and in refugee situations."
"The programme leaves to each Member State the final choice as regards the number of refugees to be resettled, although it will enable them to coordinate and mutualise experiences and best practices."
"Through the annual exercise, the EU will be able to be more reactive to evolving challenges and global refugee needs in order to render more efficient the Member States' use of the European Refugee Fund."
"The programme will also help in a more targeted and practical cooperation project through the Asylum Support Office, working with both national administrations and civil society organisations."
"I fully support the rapporteur's idea of creating a specialised unit in the office to be established in Malta."
"The Joint EU resettlement programme is being discussed at a crucial time: since 2007, five Member States - in addition to those which already had the programmes - have decided to start national resettlement programmes."
"Several other Member States have resettled Iraqi refugees over the past year in response to a commitment agreed at EU level in 2008."
"It is crucial that we maintain this positive momentum and that the adoption of the proposal is not delayed."
"We regret, however, that certain divergences and procedural issues are hampering the rapid adoption of this proposal."
"This proposal is of great political significance."
"The Commission's decision to establish annual priorities for resettlement is an implementing decision, and forms part of the financial management of the European Refugee Fund."
"With respect to the 'delegated acts' procedures, we are concerned that the procedure would be considerably delayed, making management of the fund very difficult."
"This is a first step towards a common approach; there will, of course, be a review of the experience, and there are plans to bring forward more ambitious initiatives as part of the Stockholm Programme."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your update."
"Although Mr Tavares is not with us, I want to thank him for the cooperation which we have enjoyed to date and to express on behalf of our political group our positive position on the resettlement programme."
"We are talking about a single asylum area and the integrated refugee management policy that we need."
"Of course, the financing instrument to support this endeavour is the European Refugee Fund which, it is true, we have not sufficiently exhausted to date and there are margins for us to do bigger and better things."
"The European response to global resettlement requirements has been adequate to date."
"I would remind you that the Member States participate on a voluntary basis and, so far, together with the two countries which took part in this particular resettlement, only 12 of the 27 Member States are participating in this endeavour and, to date, the figures from it have not been particularly encouraging."
"In 2009, 6 896 refugees arrived in Europe under the resettlement programme, which accounts for just 8.2% of the total."
"We therefore certainly need better coordination and what we are trying to do, through this report and the consultation we held, was to give incentives, to explain to the Member States, that we have every reason to proceed with the application and implementation of this programme."
"Of course, protection for human rights and our real solidarity with third countries are a top priority objective."
"However, we must understand that another argument why all the Member States have reason to participate in this programme is because, through this programme, we can send all those who need it a message that they have every reason to opt for legal channels in their efforts to reach Europe, to reach European territory, for a better future."
"Illegal immigration could also be addressed indirectly through the resettlement programme, given that, if there are such programmes, refugees will not opt for illegal channels and will wait to be integrated into such programmes."
"Finally, I wish to say that we tabled an amendment on the internal resettlement of refugees, which was not accepted."
"At some point, Commissioner, we expect an initiative from the Commission on this issue."
"Dublin II has put a burden on certain countries and it is very important that we push forward with the resettlement programme, with the help of the European Refugee Fund."
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mrs Malmström for being here."
"I would like to express my support for the report and for the spirit of the work done by Mr Tavares, because his work with the non-governmental organisations, with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, and the observance of comparative law from outside the European Union is very important."
"These experiences are fundamental, and having been a member of a local council, I also believe that all the councils in Europe should make a commitment on this issue."
"This is because, although we are going through a crisis, the deepest crisis has been the refugee crisis, which has been a crisis of collective amnesia."
"In Europe, and in rich countries, we have forgotten that the wars that cause refugees are wars for which we are responsible, for which our countries and governments are responsible."
"We need to overcome this collective amnesia."
"I agree with what Mrs Malmström said about making a commitment and, of course, we need to make a commitment."
"A commission from Parliament has visited the Iraqi Palestinians."
"Of course they have: we need to make a commitment to these refugees."
"I would, however, say the following to Mrs Malmström, with all due respect: the differences need to be overcome between Parliament - she herself was a Member - and the Commission regarding delegated acts."
"I would not like this report, which today appears to be generally well received, to end up being blocked because the Commission and Parliament do not agree on delegated acts."
"Madam President, Commissioner, what we all discussed on this subject was that we simply must convince more Member States to take part in this programme."
"I believe there is much to be achieved in this regard by explaining the programme and also highlighting its benefits, as those who take part have thus far always said that they will continue to do so and that they welcome the programme."
"It is very important to make clear which people this relates to."
"It relates to people who do not, themselves, have the power to come to Europe."
"These are women, children and the sick, who find themselves in refugee camps outside the EU and need our help."
"I think it is very positive that we will be deciding to make a larger proportion of the European Refugee Fund available in future."
"At the same time, I also believe that it is very important that this money, if it is paid to the national Parliaments, the nation states, in other words, must not just disappear into the budget, but it really must be used in order to build a durable structure, that the money, in fact, even has to be passed on to the local authorities and to the towns and cities where the integration actually takes place, where the nursery places and housing are provided."
"It is a very important point that the towns and cities and the local authorities, as our allies, must be involved in this discussion."
"The Member States are perhaps more inclined to reject this in the short term than the local authorities on the ground."
"In the predictability that this brings with it, I see an important element connecting us - the EU - and those on the ground bringing about the integration."
"All together, this could certainly give a boost to the resettlement programme, something that I think is very positive."
"Above all, there is one thing that needs to be stated very clearly, which is that the citizens cannot be left behind - people and associations must be found who ease the path of people who want to start a new life locally and who show them how their new town works or where the nearest swimming pool is."
"We need a cross-society consensus that we want to take part in a resettlement programme, that it is a good solution, and that people will actually bring about integration on the ground."
"Madam President, I would have preferred to hear from the rapporteur, Mr Tavares, but never mind; now he has finally joined us in this debate, and that is the main thing."
"I think that the work that he has managed to do to reach a consensus on the use of the European Refugee Fund, whose job it is to fund and encourage the Member States to develop their refugee resettlement programme, is exceptionally positive work, which Commissioner Malmström is strongly encouraging, and I am delighted to see that."
"We must nevertheless bear in mind a few figures, which will allow us to put the scope of this fund into perspective."
"If we were to allocate the entire European Refugee Fund - something that I do not want because it would inevitably be detrimental to the funding of the conditions of reception of refugees and asylum seekers in Europe - we would barely be able to resettle 20 000 refugees in Europe, a number far removed from the request of the UNHCR, which has established that there are more than 470 000 refugees worldwide in need of resettlement, that is, people who genuinely have specific needs, vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and who cannot possibly return to their country of origin."
"We must therefore be sensible."
"To me, the second precaution we must take - because we have experienced this in my country, France - concerns the media coverage of the resettlement of some refugees as a tree of charity hiding a forest of malpractice, because at the same time, this country, France, has just been condemned by the United Nations Committee against Torture for returning asylum seekers to third countries where they risk facing inhumane or degrading treatment."
"I believe - and this is my final point - that these are the precautions that we must bear in mind."
"Madam President, I would like to speak about the Schengen Information System."
"Today, we have to examine the legal framework within which migration from SIS I to SIS II can take place."
"I would say that the warning lights are all flashing red on the subject."
"Commissioner, the least we can say is that the tests have been inconclusive in this regard."
"Nevertheless, despite the opposition of three of the larger Member States - France, Germany and Austria - the Commission is persisting."
"As you know, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left are just as persistent, I would say, when it comes to our reservations about the issues of storage and the risks that this involves in terms of data protection."
"I think we are living in a rather surreal period when the abuses and the risks linked to every aspect of security are increasingly being denounced by experts, who know what they are talking about."
"We must take precautions in the area of data protection for all citizens, whoever they may be."
"We must have a minimum commitment on file connection risks."
"We in France are well aware of the abuses that can result from file connection."
"Commissioner, under the current circumstances, the GUE/NGL Group cannot support such a migration."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, Britain is not signed up to Schengen, so technically this proposal should not apply to the UK."
"The old Labour government did not opt in, and the new Lib-Dem/Con coalition government must stay opted out."
"Such a scheme would merely encourage more refugees, genuine or not, to come to the European Union."
"Imagine if Turkey joins the European Union: we can expect not just 72 million Turks to have automatic right of entry to European countries and Britain, but floods of refugees from places such as Iran and Iraq might cross the border into Turkey and then seek resettlement in Europe!"
"Britain does not have to join this scheme, but watching our new government grapple with such issues will be interesting."
"One half of it, the Conservative Party, pretends to be Eurosceptic, whatever that means, while the other half, the Liberal Democratic Party, is unreservedly Europhile."
"However, our new Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, can solve such problems at a stroke as I described here yesterday."
"The increase in the numbers of Members of this place requires a complete re-ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Mr Cameron can simply choose not to re-ratify it, or he can belatedly uphold his cast-iron guarantee and give the British people the referendum on the Lisbon Treaty that they were denied."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are refugees in the world who can neither return to their countries because the situation is too unstable, nor stay in a transit country because it has not signed the Geneva Conventions and they cannot, for example, work in that country."
"The numbers are relatively limited: 200 000 per annum, and the problem has already been solved for some of these refugees - whose only option is to be given a new life in a third country - by actors on the international stage that resettle refugees: 80 000 by the USA and some by Canada, Australia, Brazil and Chile."
"Who is missing from that list?"
"Europe is missing, that is who."
"During the Swedish Presidency, the Council judiciously admitted that it was necessary to greatly increase the number of refugees being resettled in Europe, going so far as to talk about 100 000."
"The Commission has also judiciously reviewed some statements by the European Refugee Fund to make possible a more vigorous and robust policy for resettlement of refugees."
"I currently have two reports in the name of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs: one codecision and one own-initiative."
"We have four new additions to correct the policies that are currently in place in the codecision; two of these, however, are procedural."
"The first new addition is a dual approach."
"The Commission's proposal on which we are working mainly argues for regional priorities and then, within the regional ones, priorities that I would call 'humanitarian'."
"We saw fit to maintain these priorities but give them autonomy."
"In other words, we think that Europe must have intervention strategies in terms of resettling refugees, which are very important from a foreign policy point of view."
"These strategies must sometimes allow for intervention in certain areas of the world, open doors to a given country, or establish trust relationships in certain areas of the world."
"They must, however, give the Member States freedom to respond to situations in the rest of the world that are priority in humanitarian terms."
"What situations are priorities?"
"Victims of torture, women and children who are victims of sexual violence, or people who need to be resettled for serious health reasons, for example."
"The second new feature is modulation."
"This aims to move from only 10 Member States that currently resettle refugees at European level, so that we can try to ensure that the other 27 Member States will start resettling them."
"To achieve this, we proposed increasing the sum to be assigned per refugee to the new Member States in the first year, decreasing it a little in the second and making it the same as the other Member States that resettle refugees from the third year onwards; this was conditional on the increased amount for the first years, which are the years in which it costs most to start a new resettlement programme, being used to develop a sustainable resettlement programme."
"The other two new features are procedural."
"One gives the Commission the opportunity to start an emergency procedure to resettle refugees from a given area of the world - where there was a humanitarian disaster or a crisis situation - because the procedure that we had was being carried out on an annual basis and, clearly, disasters and humanitarian crises do not follow a timetable."
"The fourth new feature was that of the delegated acts, and here I must tell you very clearly, Mrs Malmström, that Parliament can take care of timetable arguments and procedural arguments very efficiently, and we promise to not take long to respond to delegated acts."
"We also promise that the prior consultation and debate that we proposed with, for example, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development, can prevent any differences of opinion between Parliament and the Commission regarding the regions that are resettlement priorities."
"What we cannot accept is the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, telling us that delegated acts to which it has no legal objection must not be adopted within the framework of this decision, which is so important in foreign-policy and humanitarian terms, simply because the acts seem bureaucratic to the Commission when we say that they are not."
"What is happening is that, from our point of view and that of the legal service, this decision is part of the delegated acts, and, as such, we believe that it falls to the Commission to argue for the adoption of the delegated acts here, as guardian of the treaties, and not raise objections that are, currently, merely procedural."
"Above all, we believe that none of these issues must prevent us from achieving our common goal: that of resettling more refugees in the European Union."
"(MT) Madam President, this resettlement programme which is being set up is filling a significant, long-standing void."
"I am, in fact, astonished at how this programme has not existed on a European level before."
"There are countries which have already set an example, such as the United States, which already operate very efficient resettlement programmes, having garnered considerable experience in this area."
"We can learn a lot from them."
"These kinds of programmes are important because they demonstrate the European Union's willingness to show its human side with refugees worldwide."
"However, their other important objective is to curb the influx of illegal immigrants towards the European Union, including those who require protection."
"Therefore, if the resettlement programme that is to be set up today can be used to resettle international protection seekers in Libya, then these people will doubtlessly have little reason to cross the Mediterranean Sea and risk their lives in the process."
"In this way, we would be helping both them as well as those European Union countries which are shouldering a disproportionate burden."
"It goes without saying that this programme must be used in conjunction with another programme, one intended to help European Union countries who are carrying a disproportionate burden due to the current immigration flow."
"We need to prove to these countries that we are willing to establish a programme that will allow the transfer of people who are granted international protection to other European countries."
"Thus far, this is still a pilot project, one that concerns Malta."
"However, I would like to see this project manifest itself permanently, and to see it extended to the other European Union countries that require it."
"(RO) As rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament for the SIS issue, I am going to speak about this very matter."
"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho for the huge effort he has invested in this and, in particular, for the consistency he has shown in finalising these two reports."
"I would also like to thank Commissioner Malmström because, since she has taken up her post, the Commission has started to show some transparency."
"What has caused, and continues to cause, us concern is the failure to meet the deadlines for implementing SIS II."
"Parliament has expressed its position on several occasions on the delays, especially regarding the Commission's inability to set a precise date for launching its operation."
"The fact that we do not know for sure even now whether the tests carried out have been successful or not only serves to raise serious doubts about how the project is being managed."
"Given that it is the European Parliament's duty to monitor the way in which Community money is spent, the proposal to keep in reserve the funds due to be allocated to the development of SIS II during the 2011 budget year is a normal safety measure to take."
"Parliament must be continually consulted on and informed about the progress of the SIS II project, which cannot be compromised due to a lack of political will or management ability."
"It must meet current requirements, support data protection and comply with the cost/benefit principle, with its deployment taking place within the exact timeframes specified for its implementation."
"Madam President, I shall also speak on the Schengen Information System."
"First of all, I would like to thank Mr Coelho for his excellent work, and I would like to stress that my group - from the very beginning - was quite cautious in accepting SIS II, due to many implications concerning data protection."
"Now it seems that the long SIS II saga is far from being finished."
"We see time delays and cost overruns; we do not have any positive results."
"We do not even have a consensus about the evaluation of test results - as Austria, Germany and France do not see them as being successful."
"In our opinion, the approach taken by the rapporteur is absolutely right."
"We have to be honest and admit that the current project might fail, and we have to discuss the alternatives."
"We should also carefully examine the reasons behind this failure; if we need to invest an additional EUR 30 million, Parliament should have all the information necessary for an informed consent."
"We must also maintain a sunset clause."
"We cannot continue investing money into a lifelong project."
"Of course, certain flexibility should be there, but we must have clear criteria for evaluation and to react quickly if, again, something goes wrong."
"(DE) Madam President, first of all, let me say that I believe - and I am referring to the Schengen Information System here - that the EU should not be operating a wish-based policy, but a policy based on the reality."
"When it comes to the Schengen Information System, that means that we must take account of the fact that the tests - what have been called the 'first milestone' - have failed."
"After eight years of tinkering, we know that the aim of the measure proposed by the Commission - the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II - is unachievable by the Member States, both on technical and legal grounds."
"That is not my evaluation - it is the evaluation of the Federal Republic of Germany."
"That is the position back in my home country, and it is a position, by the way, that I fully share."
"EUR 90 million has so far been squandered on this scheme, and the Commission would like to spend more."
"We do not want an extension of the deadline to 2013; we want to make that very plain."
"Instead, we want to abandon this system and start the search for an alternative."
"Secondly, the German Left Party is fundamentally critical of SIS II - I want to point that out, too, at this juncture - as access to the system is being dramatically extended, for example, to the secret services."
"In Germany, there is a requirement that the secret services and the police are separated."
"Thus, any mixing of the secret services' and the police's data will mean that the whole system will be brought before the German Federal Constitutional Court."
"That is something that I needed to mention, at least from the German point of view."
"We also oppose SIS II because it involves the collection of vast quantities of data and the gathering and recording of biometric data."
"That is neither purposive nor proportionate."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of defining a framework of consistent strategies with a will to express real solidarity between Member States represents a step forwards in the coordination of Community policies on migratory flows."
"Yet this measure also represents part of a wider process, whose aim is the international protection of refugees."
"If civil society can usefully be involved in this process, this measure seems to be closely related to the imminent activation of the European Asylum Support Office."
"We must immediately establish a list of priorities and aims to be achieved, with a time schedule and specific incentive measures."
"We must also allocate specific finance to increase the number of members, currently only ten, participating in the programme."
"Neither must we forget the need for health protection to supplement the social protection offered to people who are often worn out by their state of extreme weakness."
"A computerised database will also allow the traceability of every process implemented to protect the family unit while they are in the process of resettling."
"In this context, collaboration with Member States may be decisive in ensuring that procedures are streamlined and flexible."
"We want a fairer and more realistic European Union that takes into account the efforts of southern European Member States in particular."
"With third countries, it is crucial for the European Union to take responsibility for defining cooperation agreements, as Italy did recently with Libya and Niger."
"We believe that this is the way, the only possible way, to move on from a form of solidarity which, hitherto, has all too often been just a façade, to proper solidarity between European Union Member States in the overall management of migratory flows."
"(SK) First, I would like to thank Mr Tavares for his work in the area of refugee policy, and at this point, I would also like to express my disappointment that less than half of all European Union Member States have official resettlement programmes for refugees from third countries."
"Moreover, as has been said here many times, these programmes are not sufficiently coordinated, and as a result of the low level of coordination and cooperation between Member States of the Union, the costs associated with resettlement are also high, which naturally makes this idea rather unattractive."
"I firmly believe, however, that given sufficient political will, we Europeans will be capable of creating an effective, fair and unified resettlement programme."
"To this end, it will be essential to create not only the programme itself, but also a special fund for the resettlement of refugees in the Union."
"This package would finance the creation of national resettlement programmes where they do not exist already, as well as coordination of activities at the central level."
"In my opinion, the ideal coordinator appears to be the European Asylum Support Office."
"Madam President, I wish to thank everyone who has been working very hard on the seemingly never-ending story of SIS II: Mr Coelho and those in the field."
"The issue of recurring delays and cost overruns is very worrying and, if not this, what else could be more telling about Mr Barroso's management skills in his first Commission?"
"I believe that we should take these lessons which can be learnt here today and project them into the creation of a new IT agency, which could be situated in Tallinn."
"This would be a win-win situation: while the French colleagues could keep the servers in Strasbourg, the new programming work would be done in Tallinn by competent specialists with low management costs, thus avoiding a monopoly and embracing the idea of EU integration, and also giving a guarantee of data protection."
"Finally, I would like to express my confidence in Commissioner Malmström's ability to resolve these complicated issues."
"(ES) Madam President, I will explain my position succinctly."
"I would first like to congratulate Mr Coelho."
"The process was supposed to be completed before 30 September, so the regulatory instruments need to be amended before they expire."
"Secondly, there is no proposal from the Commission setting a deadline or removing the expiry clauses from the original proposals."
"Thirdly, a precautionary period should be established for migration which, if necessary, could be extended through comitology."
"Fourthly, the process is not subject to control by Parliament, which I think is a very bad thing."
"Fifthly, we do not know the results of the tests of the second generation Schengen Information System, and Parliament must be informed."
"Sixthly, based on what I have said, I support the rapporteur's proposals and the warning that the Court of Auditors will intervene if the project fails."
"Regarding the reports by Mr Tavares on the European Refugee Fund and resettlement, I would also like to congratulate Mr Tavares."
"The main problem is a lack of solidarity within the Union."
"We need to be cautious about financial aid for Member States that take in refugees for the first time, particularly due to comparative injustice."
"These measures, which I support in principle, Mr Tavares, require a detailed prior financial study."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in many respects, it is essential that we vote in favour, tomorrow, of amending the European Refugee Fund, and it is on this subject that I will focus my speech, at the same time as congratulating Mr Coelho and Mr Tavares on their deliberations and their work."
"The vote on the ERF will shed light on the need for the Member States of the European Union to play their full part in resettlement in order to fill a double gap that exists in terms of the number of countries committed to the programme and the reception capacity of each country."
"Let us recall that here, we are talking about refugees who are often barely tolerated in the countries that have received them and whose living conditions can sometimes take a tragic turn if solutions are not found quickly."
"Thanks to these new means, we can actually provide these particularly vulnerable people with greater security, so long as - and I stress this - each of the Member States involved with the ERF uses the funds concerned correctly and transparently, which is something that I know you are very concerned about, Commissioner Malmström."
"It will be difficult to take up the challenge when we know the lukewarm reception that the Member States have reserved for this new measure, and here too, Commissioner, I would like to underline your determination."
"Finally, I would like to stress the fact that the integration of refugees is one of the keys to the success of this enterprise."
"The more we prepare for and explain the arrival of refugees, the greater the chances are that it will be accepted and will take place under the best conditions, and the more the Member States - we hope - will prove their commitment to resettlement."
"That is why our Parliament must vote overwhelmingly in favour of these amendments to the European Refugee Fund."
"(DE) Madam President, in many Member States, including my home state of Austria, people no longer know where new asylum seekers can go, and the population quite rightly resists the idea of new reception centres."
"How can it be that, despite this, the resettlement of refugees in the EU is being promoted?"
"The plan to allow into the EU asylum seekers who have already fled to a bordering third country such as Ukraine because the standard of living here is higher is thus completely incomprehensible."
"Especially in such times of economic crisis, it is all you can do to shake your head when it comes to proposals like this."
"The entire EU asylum concept is a disaster, as far as I am concerned."
"According to the concept, an asylum seeker who is first picked up in Romania can then be sent back there for appraisal and for an asylum process."
"The idea of granting basic welfare provision to asylum seekers at the same high social security level as to nationals of the Member State in question is unrealistic and unaffordable."
"The EU should grant the protection of asylum to everyone who really needs it, to those who really are in need, but it should not open the floodgates to economic migrants."
"What we need is greater protection of the external borders, quick, unbureaucratic procedures and, of course, a consistent repatriation strategy."
"(RO) The basic principle underlying the European Union's involvement in asylum matters is to ensure a higher level of cooperation and solidarity between Member States."
"This cannot be achieved within individual countries."
"The adoption of a common European Union initiative is dictated by the increased strategic use of resettlement."
"A sound, well-targeted programme is required, which will be effective and of good quality."
"This programme will provide a suitable framework for ensuring that Member States will participate in the refugee resettlement process."
"The efforts made by Member States to admit refugees must be supported and encouraged with additional financial incentives."
"These measures will enable us to show greater solidarity from the EU in relation to the global refugee issue."
"We will also encourage the participation of a significant number of Member States in this process."
"(RO) I would first of all like to begin with a comment for my fellow Member from the left."
"I believe that the converse example is also valid: when an Englishman or Irishman commits a crime in my country, it should be possible to send him back."
"The process for implementing the second-generation Schengen Information System has been delayed and it seems that this will not take place before the end of 2011."
"As a result, I would like to ask the Commission about what repercussions this has on the timetable for the countries not yet included in the Schengen area, but which are due to join."
"It is unacceptable that, at the moment, the Commission cannot give an exact date for the launch of SIS II's operation, thereby raising considerable doubts about the management of this project."
"The additional costs and the need for new investment, if the migration to SIS II is going to end up failing and be included in the SIS 1+RE emergency plan, mean that much tighter budget control is required, especially for the new agency responsible for regulating and coordinating the implementation of SIS, VIS and Eurodac."
"(DA) Madam President, a year ago, all of the Members of the European Parliament were in the midst of an election campaign and were seeking either to gain or regain our mandates, and I know that in many countries, the issue of the Schengen area in particular played an incredibly important role in the election campaign."
"There is a great deal of dissatisfaction among our electorate, the citizens of Europe, about the way in which the EU deals with these issues: the lack of internal border controls, the severely deficient external border controls, the utterly inadequate control of immigration and the spectre that is lying in wait for us in just under a year's time with regard to whether the Commission will give its approval for Bulgaria and Romania to also join Schengen."
"I hear people saying that we must show solidarity, but, quite honestly, who is it we are to show solidarity with?"
"Who is it that needs to show solidarity?"
"When we see a massive exploitation of the system that both the EU and our Member States have set up, it is perhaps time that we also showed a little solidarity with the citizens, who are living with the failed policy that the Commission and its Member States have pursued."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, creating a common European asylum policy and resettlement policy means ensuring human rights and, at the same time, restricting illegal immigration."
"Thank you, therefore, to the speakers and to Commissioner Malmström, as we now have a valuable tool, especially for countries with a Mediterranean coastline: countries such as Italy which, up until now, have not been able to rely either on real solidarity between Member States or on a fair division of responsibilities."
"These policies must be supported by an appropriate budget, but also by reliable checks on the programmes implemented, with suitable follow-ups and the identification of good practices."
"My last words on the subject of human rights: we must give priority to those who are most vulnerable, minors, women who are victims of trafficking, of exploitation and of violence, including victims of genital mutilation, but I know that Commissioner Malmström has this properly in hand."
"(DE) Madam President, at present, the European Union does seem to have access to unbelievable financial resources."
"After the EUR 750 billion support package we are now, once again, to spend enormous sums on the migration issue, but not, for example, on repatriation measures or even on securing borders - the supposedly secure Schengen borders, in any case, are as holey as a Swiss cheese."
"No, EUR 6 000 per person is to be provided for the voluntary acceptance of refugees from third countries."
"If the EU really has the necessary loose change lying around, it should, I beg, support European families - then, perhaps, we would have a rising birth rate."
"The argument that we need immigration to counter the lack of children would then finally be superfluous."
"Instead of just opening up the floodgates to immigration, the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees should finally be accurately applied and it, of course, does not apply to the army of economic migrants."
"If we do want to spend many millions, then they could be spent on the border protection agency FRONTEX, rather than the money pit that is the Schengen Information System."
"(SK) I would like to talk about the Schengen Information System."
"We know that this system has taken relatively long to develop and has cost a lot of money, in addition to which the implementation costs are constantly rising and the results of trials are not known."
"Perhaps it would be appropriate to conduct an audit of the work carried out so far on this system, to consider whether the system is viable and whether we know how to bring it to completion in such a way that it will be useful for Europe, and then decide how to proceed further."
"As far as the resettlement programme is concerned, I agree that it is necessary to draw up a legislative standard which would restrict illegal immigration into the European Union, and which would establish the conditions for legitimate migration."
"However, perhaps we should draw on the experience of our colleagues from developing countries, who say that not all migration, not all the journeys their countrymen make into the European Union, are about the security restrictions faced by these people, but are for economic reasons."
"(DE) Madam President, I would actually just like to get a couple of comments about the Maňka report off my chest."
"I agreed this earlier on with your colleague."
"I want to express very clearly my opposition to the increase in the secretarial allowance, especially to the envisaged amount of EUR 1 500."
"Furthermore, I also oppose any increase in the staffing of this House and, should it be decided after a further evaluation that an additional EUR 1 500 per month for the secretarial allowance is to be made available, that would simply be to mock the taxpayers."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr Ehrenhauser, I think you are speaking on the wrong subject."
"This is the joint debate on the Schengen Agreement."
"I am sorry that you did not get to speak about the Maňka report, but I am afraid we have to move on now."
"(PL) Above all, I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho on two more successful reports."
"Secondly, there can be no turning back from SIS II today."
"If we want to think about a secure system, SIS II must be introduced, and this is why I think we need to continue these measures and support the Commission on this."
"I will remind everyone that the new visa code stipulates that biometric data must be shown in the system."
"SIS 1+ does not give this guarantee."
"SIS II will enable rapid verification of data in future."
"So in this area of security, we must not stop work on SIS II."
"Of course, we might wish that this work could be more effective and more successful."
"I will remind everyone that not so long ago, we also adopted measures which make it easy to travel throughout the Schengen Area with a long-term visa."
"In relation to this, work on SIS II must be continued."
"We want to support the Commission on this, in the hope that its work will proceed faster and be more effective, and we should wish the Commission success in this regard. Thank you."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank all Members for their support and comments on these two different, but very important, subjects."
"Starting with the SIS II, this has of course - and I am the first to recognise this - been a long saga, as somebody said."
"It is a complex dossier and very difficult."
"Probably there were things that could have been done better in the past, but since I took up office, I have really tried to deal with this in a very transparent and thorough way."
"The Commission has followed, to the letter, the roadmap outlined by the Council, and the Council agreed on conclusions at the last meeting."
"Some Member States were sceptical, but they did agree on the conclusion that the Milestone 1 test was successful."
"Right now, we are working with the different experts in order to assess and to define the final requirements of Member States to meet their operational needs and to define a more concrete timetable and way forward."
"I will make this proposal on 3 and 4 June to the Ministers for discussion and there will be a further assessment of this after the summer."
"We will, of course, be transparent and work with the European Parliament and the rapporteur all the time."
"To answer the question on the new Member States, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will be done via SIS I for all."
"Arrangements for Bulgaria and Romania are being made for that in the meantime."
"We are preparing for a - hopefully successful - Milestone 2 test on SIS later this autumn."
"Until that is successfully complete, we have contacts and ways open in order to maintain the contingency plan for the future."
"We hope it will not be needed but we have made that preparation as well."
"In the meantime, let me thank all Members, especially Mr Coelho, for your support and assure you of the maximum transparency and engagement on the part of the Commission with the European Parliament on this dossier."
"On the issue of resettlement, I fully agree with Mr Busuttil, who said that he was surprised that this did not exist before."
"It is, of course, a very good initiative to pool the resources of the Member States and to encourage further engagement on the global scene in order to alleviate pressure in refugee camps following a crisis or a very difficult situation."
"We can inspire Member States to make more intelligent use of the funds and to coordinate this with UNHCR."
"This is, of course, something that could really reinforce our role on the global scene, but also make a real difference for these people who are caught in a very difficult situation."
"UNHCR estimates there was a need for resettlement, last year alone, for 747 000 people."
"As Mr Flautre said, what we can do is a help but the needs are enormous."
"I think there is broad agreement on the aim and the purpose of this fund and I hope we can find a solution to the procedural issues very soon so the proposal can be adopted without delay."
"Several Members made reference to internal solidarity."
"This is, of course, related, but is a slightly different subject."
"I recognise the need for this as well."
"The Commission has already made proposals in this regard."
"We have proposed a temporary suspension mechanism in the Dublin Regulation and we have established the European Support Office that will open in Malta later this year."
"We have the Malta pilot project and are evaluating this."
"I agree that we should try to find ways to make it more permanent and to involve more Member States."
"This is, of course, subject to the willingness of Member States to contribute, but the Commission will look at this and we will also look at a general intra-EU solidarity mechanism and present that next year."
"So we can come back to this discussion, which is slightly different from the EU resettlement programme but nevertheless very important."
"Thank you very much to Mr Coelho, Mr Tavares and Mr Alvaro for your work on these two very important dossiers."
"I am looking forward to working with you to conclude them as soon as possible."
"Many thanks for the positive comments by various fellow Members."
"Mrs Malmström, I wanted you to know that Parliament is aware that you inherited this process and we have faith in your abilities and your intelligence, to bring it to the best possible conclusion."
"We also appreciate the efforts you have made towards transparency, which my fellow member, Mr Enciu, did a very good job of highlighting, as a matter of fact."
"As regards the deadline, we are giving off the wrong signals if the new migration instruments do not have a deadline."
"After all the delays, indefinitely extending the Commission's mandate does not make any sense."
"I understand that the Commission is in no position to bind itself to the target suggested by Parliament, but we will set it and, if for any reason, the process has not been completed by that point, you can come back to Parliament to request an extension and explain why it is needed."
"Extending the Commission's mandate without any deadline is a terrible signal after these delays, both to the European institutions and to the European public."
"I agree with your idea that the Global Programme Management Board must not be an assembly."
"I therefore understand the Commission's reservations about limiting access to its work: I could not agree more."
"Parliament's proposal was the result of a less favourable draft of the Commission's original proposal, because the Commission, at the same time as limiting the composition of the Global Programme Management Board, was allowing any other official of the Commission, the Council or the Member States to participate."
"This raises a legitimate question: why can officials of the Commission and the Member States participate and not those of Parliament?"
"If we restrict this body to its functions, I believe that we will all be in agreement, especially with the guarantees that the Commissioner has given regarding greater transparency."
"Madam President, my thanks to the Members who have taken part in the debate and to the Commissioner."
"I believe that if there is any agreement about what is wanted in relation to the issue of refugee resettlement, it is because we understand that for once, in the debate on immigration - and we all know how difficult that is in Europe, along with the debate on asylum and refugees - what we have is a problem that we can solve."
"We can resolve it for ourselves and for the refugees, because anyone who has visited refugee camps knows that there are children there losing one, two, three years of study that they could be undertaking in Europe."
"I think that gives us the right degree of urgency for this debate."
"I also hope that the procedural issues will be rapidly overcome, in accordance with what is written in the treaties, because we all know that what we have is not enough and we all know that just assigning part of the budget is still not a true refugee resettlement programme."
"It is, in fact, at this type of subject that we aimed the own-initiative report that we are also discussing here today and which is about quality: quality is of vital importance in the integration of refugees and requires a multilateral approach involving non-governmental organisations, local actors and local authorities."
"This approach must also resolve many of the bureaucratic issues with coordination that we have today."
"If the process for these children, who are in refugee camps and are not yet studying and who would have the right to be resettled, is taking a long time, we are told by actors in the border agencies of several Member States that it is because it takes a long time for Member States to coordinate to validate transit documentation, for example, which can be done mainly using an instrument which, in the own-initiative report, we suggested should be implemented by the European Asylum Support Office (EASO)."
"The EASO is a resettlement unit with a reduced number of officials, but with people who work permanently in resettlement, who know how to exchange best practices, who know how to introduce the new Member States to resettlement mechanisms, and who know how to coordinate even with the European External Action Service to facilitate resettlement processes."
"When we have already decided that those people will be resettled, there is no reason for us to delay in tackling red tape and bureaucracy, before we can really deal with integrating them on European soil."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at noon today."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"We are voting today on the adoption of a joint EU resettlement programme for asylum seekers from problematic third countries in the EU."
"However, there is another debate which needs to be held."
"For over ten years, Europe has seen an influx of large numbers of refugees and waves of immigration."
"The south of Europe has been left to shoulder the entire burden of European humanitarianism and it reached its limits some time ago."
"While Europe - quite rightly - has a fund ready for third countries, there is no provision for the Member States."
"If nothing else, the rapporteur's report recognises the problem."
"Other reports, such as the report on the establishment of the European Asylum Support Office, constitute - at least on paper - an obligation to support states whose asylum and reception systems are under particular pressure, due to their geographical position."
"One expressly stated objective is to support the development of a solidarity mechanism, such as the transportation of persons entitled to international protection within the EU."
"Let us hope that Europe gradually discovers solidarity."
"We must bear in mind that any delay here will harm our innocent fellow men."
"In relation to the matter of the Schengen Information System, I would again like to point out the fact that the state authorities in the Czech Republic, as well as local authorities and individual politicians, including MEPs, constantly face complaints from Czech citizens over the gratuitous and humiliating police checks and inspections they are often subjected to when travelling to Germany, both in the vicinity of the state boundary and in the wider German border regions."
"This approach taken by German police and customs authorities, carried out with great frequency and dexterity, has a significant negative impact, not only on Czech-German relations but, above all, on the attitude of Czech citizens to European integration."
"Following the accession of the Czech Republic to the Schengen Information System, Czech citizens were told they had free and unhindered movement within the territory of the EU, including Germany, just as the Schengen System anticipates and guarantees."
"In my opinion, the behaviour of the German state authorities towards persons travelling from the Czech Republic is unfounded in a clear majority of cases and contrary to the declared free movement of persons."
"Specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union (amendment of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Alves, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union - C7-0255/2009 -."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to point out the fact that we are debating the first report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that is subject to the ordinary legislative procedure as set out in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is an historic moment and, if this House votes in the way I am suggesting, it will get this new period of shared competences regarding agriculture in the European Union off to the best possible start."
"It does so precisely by colegislating with its outermost regions, in a practical demonstration of the will to build a Union that is strengthened by cohesion, in a spirit of active solidarity, in respect for the specificities and differences of its parts, as the only viable path towards building our common European project."
"It also does so by introducing basic regulations to make the sugar sector in the Azores - and I particularly welcome this, as that is my home region - more viable, as it is hundreds of years old."
"Furthermore, it contributes to the healthy diversification of agriculture in a region which, as we know, makes an irreplaceable contribution to Portugal's milk sector."
"We must consolidate it and make it sustainable."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Cioloş and the Commission's high officials, with whom we worked and negotiated, for the openness and flexibility they showed."
"The Spanish Presidency has given everything towards making our shared desire of reaching an agreement at first reading become a reality."
"I would, obviously, also extend my thanks to our shadows in the other political groups, as well as to the excellent officials of the secretariat of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, whose collaboration allowed us to achieve a result that I consider very positive."
"I would also stress the decisive contribution of the Agricultural Association of the Azores, as well as of the regional government and the government of the Republic; they were heavily involved and played a significant role in finding a solution for the sugar of the Azores."
"The proposal for a Council regulation was tabled on 2 October in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, at a time in which there was no prospect of the Treaty of Lisbon entering into force, which continued to await ratification by the Member States."
"In this context, the initial idea of the Commission and the Council was for the proposal to be adopted under the simplified process without any amendments, to become effective from 1 January 2010."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and despite the fact that the opinion that the proposal should continue to follow the simplified process predominated in the other political groups and the Council - because they thought that the proposal did not need amendments and should enter into force quickly - at the time, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and I understand that Parliament needed to express its opinion then in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon, and take up its role of colegislator."
"We did it at the right time, because new possibilities have opened up as a result, first with the contribution of the Committee on Regional Development and the opinion of Mr Teixeira - whom I would like to congratulate and thank, by the way, for the help he has always provided throughout the process - and then with my report introducing the new possibilities for sugar in the Azores, as well as the contribution and support of my colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"Finally, I would like to say in this first speech that we failed to get the amendments proposed by the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and supported by me, accepted in the commitment obtained in trialogue."
"It was essential to obtain a commitment at first reading, thus safeguarding the improvements already obtained and the need to enter into force quickly, in order not to compromise its retroactivity from January this year."
"However, as the Commission is already preparing a review document for the POSEI, we will surely soon have another opportunity to debate them."
"We have changed the name on the screen, as you have seen."
"Unfortunately, the Commissioner in question was not able to be with us on time, which I find regrettable, as there is no ash cloud at the moment and as it is already 11.00."
"Maybe at some point, the Commission could discuss the fact that the competent Commissioners should be here."
"That, too, is a subject for the framework agreement."
"I am sure that Mrs Malmström will be a wonderful representative."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you for your understanding."
"I would like to apologise on behalf of my colleague, Mr Cioloş, who is delayed and who is trying to get here as soon as possible to discuss with you."
"He has asked me to thank the rapporteur, Mr Alves, and the shadow rapporteurs of the European Parliament for the excellent work which has been achieved in the adoption of this proposal."
"The adoption is important because it is the first text adopted in the ordinary legislative procedure concerning agriculture and rural development following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"A very good cooperation has been established between Parliament, the Council and the Commission during these months, and that has created the conditions for a fast adoption in first reading of this proposal."
"With this first experience of the ordinary legislative procedure, my colleague, Commissioner Cioloş, and his services have learned a lot, and this has set an excellent precedent for future work."
"The adoption of this regulation is very important for the outermost regions as it imposes technical simplifications and it also imposes derogations to the benefit of several sectors: the milk sector in the Canary Islands, Madeira and Réunion, the sugar sector for the Azores and the wine sector for Madeira and the Azores."
"Concerning the Azores, I consider that the current circumstances justify an additional and joint effort from all of us - the public, regional governments, national governments and the European Union - in order to facilitate a diversification of the agricultural activities in this region."
"The diversification must indeed be one of the major priorities of the outermost regions to which the treaty has acknowledged a particular status due to their specific handicaps."
"The diversification must allow an indigenous development that would create stability and well-being in these regions."
"For this reason, following the assurance received from the Portuguese authorities, who committed themselves to support the sugar beet sector in the Azores, I can give my agreement for the extension of a derogation which has already been granted in the past for the benefit of the sugar industry in the Azores."
"I will listen to your comments to this text and I will try, to the best of my abilities, to answer your questions on behalf of my colleague."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, my fellow Member, Mr Alves, on his work, especially the capacity that he demonstrated for incorporating the various contributions that he received and which are nothing more than respect for the interests of the various outermost regions covered."
"In my function as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development, I welcome the fact that all the amendments proposed were fully accepted by the rapporteur and that the Committee on Regional Development voted in favour of all of them."
"These are proposals that aim objectively to improve and correct aspects of the regulation in force that are inadequate and anachronistic."
"Of these aspects, I would stress the fact that the maximum amounts for export and despatch of any processed products that have benefited from POSEI grants are currently calculated on the basis of the average between 1989 and 1991."
"Assuming that the report is adopted, I hope that the Commission and Council will be able to read Parliament's position and not use a possible future review of the regulations of the POSEI scheme as an excuse to not accept this House's positions and the proposed amendments, which are of the greatest importance for the affected regions."
"Owing to their permanent natural handicaps, the outermost regions need the European Union to have a specific look at the best conditions for them to carry out their economic activities."
"In the case of regions like the Azores, that are highly dependent on agriculture, particular attention to that sector is needed."
"It is in this context that we welcome this report on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions."
"The version voted on by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development was quite satisfactory; the version that has emerged from the trialogue inexorably penalises working conditions in the sugar sector, whose export allowance is touching on the merely symbolic."
"At a time in which the diversification of agriculture is gaining acceptance as one of the ways to minimise the sector's recurrent crises, it is regrettable that this report does not express the confidence and encouragement that sugar beet production and the associated industry in São Miguel needed."
"I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur for the objectives mentioned for agriculture in the outermost regions."
"The agricultural support scheme for the EU's outermost regions provides an important mechanism for continuing agriculture and maintaining the rural landscape."
"I support the current exercise of reviewing the delimitation of these areas in order to remove any inconsistencies in delimiting them."
"I believe that the application of uniform criteria will simplify the implementation of the payment scheme for outermost regions at European Union level, provide greater transparency and ensure uniform treatment for the beneficiaries of these support schemes."
"We all know what a key role agriculture plays in the local economy."
"In this respect, I think that it is appropriate to have measures in place in the European Union's outermost regions which are aimed at boosting the agricultural sector's competitiveness and promoting diversification."
"I support and completely agree with the basic objectives of the scheme for the outermost regions, which I regard as being relevant and which have proven to be an effective instrument for continuing agriculture in these areas."
"Mr President, firstly I wish to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Alves, for his excellent work on this report."
"Our group fully supports this compromise, because it is very important and obvious that the economic and social development of the EU's outermost regions is greatly determined by their periphery, difficult climate and geography and economic dependence on a short range of goods and services."
"It is very important, especially now in a time of crisis, that we focus attention on the balanced development of the regions of Europe and on achieving regional and social cohesion."
"We and the European Union must ensure that we are selfsufficient in agriculture everywhere in Europe."
"This is vital for security and biodiversity."
"The measures proposed in this report should now be put into actual practice, thereby producing permanent and, above all, longterm results everywhere in Europe, including Europe's peripheral regions."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, first of all, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for a very good job of work."
"My group was also able to support the agreement in trialogue and I think it has found a good compromise."
"I believe the outermost regions of Europe should be given the required support that they need where possible in order to compensate for their location and the difficulties that entails."
"These regions have permanent handicaps and we need to recognise this."
"The economic crisis and the crisis in the dairy sector have affected these regions disproportionately in relation to most of the rest of Europe, and that is why these regions deserve some special attention."
"I am particularly sympathetic to the situation in the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important and has had serious difficulties."
"Allowing the Azores to export relatively small quantities of sugar to the EU has to be a good decision for the economic future of that particular region."
"Mr President, justifying the prolongation of the re-exporting of sugar using the models that are currently being proposed, with the gradual abolition of the system of milk quotas, is dangerous and unacceptable."
"This abolition - against which we have fought and will continue to fight, supporting the struggle of the milk producers - will have very serious consequences for a productive sector that is fundamental to the economy of the Azores."
"Contrary to what is being suggested, it will not be possible to mitigate these consequences using the measures that are being proposed relating to the sugar-processing industry; all the more so when its gradual abolition is also being suggested."
"What will be left when these five years are up?"
"On the other hand, it is important to take into account that the process of reconverting vines is significantly behind schedule, not least in the case of Madeira, and could even be compromised if the incentives are not strengthened."
"The restrictions and constraints that affect the outermost regions are permanent."
"For this reason, the practical effect of acknowledgement of the specificity of these regions must be a set of permanent aid measures, not unconnected and time-limited ones."
"It is important to maintain Union aid to the agricultural sector in the outermost regions; even more so in the current socio-economic climate."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, we are dealing with a reform that is simple but extremely important for the outermost regions."
"This is especially the case at a time when the crisis is affecting everyone, but is affecting these regions in a fundamental way, as they have permanent structural handicaps that mean that they need these changes."
"I am going to talk about the Canary Islands."
"In the case of the Canary Islands, the most important change is regarding supplies of milk-based preparations intended for industrial processing."
"We are talking about skimmed milk powder with vegetable fat, which is a traditional product for local consumers that has been sold in the Canary Islands for more than 40 years."
"After a great deal of effort and despite many difficulties, a local industry was established that generates employment and obvious added value."
"I would like to highlight this because, in the current times, particularly on our islands, which have extremely high unemployment, supporting a small industry that creates jobs is not only a necessity but an obligation."
"The proposal is to maintain the supply of this product, which is used for local consumption in small quantities of 800 tonnes per year."
"This would eliminate the transitional nature of the measure, which is of little importance in the global context, and therefore give stability to this industry."
"As I said before, the outermost regions have significant handicaps, but they must be considered an opportunity for Europe."
"The different association agreements that are being worked on and debated at the moment, such as the free trade agreements with Colombia and Peru and others on which negotiations are beginning, such as with Mercosur, are a clear threat to our agricultural sector."
"I am thinking about numerous products: tomatoes, bananas, and the livestock sector."
"I have said this many times: these agreements must achieve a balance, whereby everyone surrenders a little ground, so we all win."
"However, in no way must one product or one specific sector be forced to bear the cost of the agreements."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Alves, and thank the Commission and the Council who, along with Parliament, have succeeded in reaching an agreement in this first trialogue on agriculture."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when this text came before the Committee on Regional Development, I managed to introduce the idea of an extension of the exemption authorising the production of reconstituted milk in Martinique and Guadeloupe, following the example of the sustainable growth model which proved its worth in Madeira."
"Unfortunately, there was no consensus on this position at the last trialogue."
"This is regrettable for two reasons."
"Firstly, in terms of substance, dairy production in the French overseas departments would offer multiple unmissable opportunities: the strengthening of the cattle industry, self-sufficiency in a basic foodstuff and the creation of jobs."
"Secondly, in terms of content, our Parliament as a whole was unable to reach a decision on my proposal since it wanted to pass this text at first reading via an informal procedure that I oppose."
"Be that as it may, our work on this POSEI regulation will continue very soon during the mid-term review of this regulation."
"At that point, I will again request an exemption in the other French overseas departments."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that the report on specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union has been so amicably discussed in the House."
"In the last electoral term, I was the shadow rapporteur for reform of the sugar market."
"At that time, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development visited the island of Réunion where I visited a small agricultural holding that grows sugar cane."
"Without our support, this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence."
"As someone from the continental mainland, I also observed that these farmers in the outermost regions of the Union do face a special set of circumstances."
"It is necessary for us to ensure, through certain rules on exceptions, that we offer these farmers in all these regions that are in the European Union future prospects and ensure that they are able to guarantee food security - at least for the most part - in these areas."
"It is up to us all to help ensure that agriculture - including through these rules on exceptions - has future prospects and that the security of supply for the local population is safeguarded."
"The way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals."
"My heartfelt thanks go to all those who have been involved."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the outermost areas are distinguished by socio-economic and structural particularities determined by their distance from the markets, their isolation, their small area, their topography, their difficult climate and their economic dependency on certain products."
"There are three particularly important agricultural sectors: sugar beets, dairy products and wine production."
"The economic system of these areas depends on correct running of the production systems for each of the above sectors, but it will take a lot of work to restore the balances that have failed over time, and to ensure the derogations needed to apply the appropriate market instruments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is with great concern that we learn of the negotiations in progress with Mercosur countries."
"If these are not backed by appropriate compensatory measures, this agreement could greatly endanger not only the outermost areas but also many sectors of European agriculture."
"(FR) Mr President, I must say that the compromise on sugar, such as was negotiated in the trialogue, falls short of what we had proposed in the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I deeply regret this."
"However, as far as Réunion Island is concerned, this text is important for the farmers, who are waiting for the swift implementation of the exemption given on milk."
"For them, it will guarantee the sustainability of the industry."
"However, I would have preferred the safeguards recommended in committee to have been kept."
"Still on milk, I agree with our fellow Member, Mr Tirolien."
"We would have liked a study to have been conducted for Martinique and Guadeloupe in order to keep an industry in these regions."
"However, these questions will quite clearly be back on the table during the POSEI negotiations, and we will have the opportunity to talk about them again."
"(DE) Mr President, for years, we have been observing a phenomenon that seems to leave the European Union powerless, namely an enormous rate of farms going under which undermines EU states' self-sufficiency."
"Clearly, those worst hit by this are those in disadvantaged areas, such as the outermost regions, but also farmers in mountainous regions like we have in Austria."
"Unfortunately, that is a consequence of the common agricultural policy, a policy that has been subject to many years of criticism, is constantly being reformed and yet still does not function properly."
"We have reached a turning point, however."
"In crisis situations - be they brought about by the depreciating euro or simply by the fact that a volcano in Iceland has paralysed air traffic and with it the supply of easily perishable goods - the Member States have to rely on themselves."
"We saw that most recently from the last time that Russia turned off the gas."
"When things get difficult, everything depends on a country's self-sufficiency, and that needs to be maintained within the EU, in those countries and regions with disadvantaged areas, and in the outermost regions."
"I believe that can only be done if agriculture is, to a certain extent, re-nationalised."
"(PT) Mr President, in this debate on the specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions, I would like to start by complimenting the rapporteur and everyone who has worked on this subject."
"I would also like to say that the amendments, which are often technical and specific, do not lead to significant changes."
"However, to call attention to the issue of sugar and sugar production in the Azores is to also call attention to a deeper problem."
"The outermost regions such as the Azores, which I recently had the opportunity to visit, have a very strong link to the agricultural sector."
"Specifically, in the Azores, the issue of milk quotas is very important."
"Milk production and how it is regulated are extraordinarily relevant for hundreds of producers and many of the people of the Azores and for that very reason, I want right now, here in the Chamber, to call attention to the need for solutions to be found that have the specific situation of these regions in mind."
"Mr President, I am happy to see a report on helping agriculture in the outermost regions of Europe."
"There is no doubt that geographical location, distance from markets and other such factors create many difficulties."
"The economic crisis has also had an impact."
"Price volatility has been very significant and had a detrimental, and indeed destabilising, effect on farming, not only in the outermost regions, but in all areas of Europe."
"However, I just want to address one very particular point to the Commission today, and that is that the Commission must be careful in its own actions not to disadvantage the European farmer and the European agricultural industry."
"In Northern Ireland, the dairy and beef industry has been greatly affected by imports."
"This has resulted in price volatility and great financial losses for farmers."
"Last week, I attended the Royal Agricultural Show in Northern Ireland."
"This is the largest show of its kind in the province, and farmer after farmer expressed very grave concerns at the attitude of the Commission in reopening the Mercosur trade talks."
"Surely the Commission, and we in this Parliament, must be very careful not to sacrifice Europe's industry in order to have so-called 'gains' in other areas."
"Mr President, I welcome proposals to help the outermost regions."
"Firstly, agriculture is primarily an industry that puts food on the table - without which we all would die - but also these regions without agriculture would die as well, both economically and by probably becoming denuded of people."
"So I welcome any proposals to help them."
"I also want to add my voice to those who expressed concern about the Mercosur proposals."
"These could do enormous damage to the outermost regions, and indeed every region."
"I think that it is time that the European Union got stronger and fairer with its own farmers."
"We were never meant to be the policeman for the farmers within the Union and the fairy godmother for the farmers in the rest of the world."
"That is what is happening here: there would be less stringent rules, less transparency and less accountability for food coming into the European Union than for food that is produced within it, and that would be unfair to the outermost regions and to all regions."
"Mr President, please excuse me for being late, but I was very keen to be present for this debate since it is my first one and it is about the first decision taken in codecision in the area of agriculture."
"I would like once again to greet and thank Mr Alves and all of Parliament's services for the very cooperative and effective way they have worked with the Commission and with the Council to reach this decision."
"We wanted a swift decision precisely so that the measures provided for in this report can be applied quickly in the regions concerned."
"Some decisions will even be applied retroactively."
"That is why - and I am also answering Mr Tirolien here - we have not introduced other amendments."
"In fact, as with some other proposals, we would have needed additional justifications and analysis, so as to establish the way in which they should be introduced."
"We preferred to move quickly, and I had several discussions with Mr Alves on this subject."
"I am therefore delighted to see the support that this proposal enjoys and I hope that we will be able to work in the same way with Parliament on other subjects in the future."
"Moreover, I am sure that we will be able to do so."
"As Commissioner for Agriculture, I can also assure all the speakers that negotiations with the Mercosur have been mentioned several times."
"I can assure you, as I did during debates within Commission bodies on the reopening of these negotiations, that I will check very carefully that these negotiations continue in the interest of European agriculture."
"We must, of course, consider these negotiations more comprehensively, without limiting them to agriculture, but I can assure you that, during the coming months and years of these negotiations, I will ensure that the European agricultural model, which is based on quality, diversity and land use, is preserved either through the results of these negotiations or through the measures that will be taken following these negotiations."
"The question was also asked as to why we should apply degressivity, why we do not opt for quantities such as those applied thus far to the Azores for sugar."
"In the latter case, we specifically agreed with the Portuguese authorities and with the local Azorian authorities to establish an economic instrument that enables the sector in question to cope with competition by means of economic investment measures."
"I am delighted with the support that I have observed and the commitments that have been made by the Portuguese Government to support the sector in this move and I hope that, in this way, we will be able to offer an alternative to the producers of the Azores."
"Mr Mölzer stated that the common agricultural policy was not robust enough, that it was not functioning well and that we needed renationalisation."
"I would like to put a simple request to you: look at what farmers receive in income today, look at what part of this income is support from the CAP, and ask yourselves how farmers could cope today if we did not have the common agricultural policy."
"That does not mean that the CAP should not be adapted."
"It must be substantially adapted in order to take account of precisely these changes that European agriculture faces."
"I can assure you that every effort will be made in the reform of the CAP in 2013 to take better account of current realities."
"Of course, that will be limited to the resources that the Council and Parliament make available to this policy."
"I hope that these resources will be directly related to the ambitions that Europeans and Europe have for their agriculture."
"I do not think that renationalisation is a solution because, in my opinion, the Member States would not have the means to assure the adoption of specific measures in these outermost regions if we did not have the common agricultural policy and a Community approach."
"I will therefore conclude here with the hope that, when it comes to the recasting of the POSEI regulation, we will be able to make progress on some points that were raised today and that, in general, in all the decisions concerning the common agricultural policy, we will be able to work as effectively as we did for this regulation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in this last speech, I would stress the importance of updating Regulation (EC) No 247/2006."
"The change that has occurred since it was adopted in 2006 - both in the field of legislation and in that of its application, as well as to the situation itself - has necessitated the introduction of amendments so that an updated version of it can continue to be an important instrument in the adaptation of certain Union agricultural policies relating to the specificities of the outermost regions, as set out in Articles 349 and 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"Allow me to briefly enumerate the improvements achieved."
"In the Canary Islands, the derogation allowing milk-based preparations that are considered 'a traditional product for the local consumers' is to be temporarily prolonged."
"In Réunion, it will now be possible to produce UHT milk reconstituted from milk powder below the limits set by the World Trade Organisation, with the obligation to set the level of integrated powered milk also disappearing."
"In Madeira, this same exception is being renewed using these models, and wine produced from direct-producer hybrid vines can be consumed in the region."
"In the Azores, the derogation for re-exporting sugar is being brought back and extended, both in amount and in time limit; the region is also benefiting from the provisions on wine already mentioned for Madeira."
"These are measures to be applied retroactively from 1 January 2010 which do not represent any obstacle to free competition in our single market and constitute important contributions to the economies of these regions, whose natural frailties make them more vulnerable at a time of profound crisis."
"Lastly, I would like to mention that, apart from the opportunity given to agricultural diversification, the adoption of this report means that the ban on re-exporting certain products has been lifted."
"It is also important to remember that thanks to its adoption, we will be contributing decisively to restructuring and maintaining several dozen jobs in the Azores, as well as the technical know-how linked to activity in the agro-industrial sugar sector, at a time of extremely tough economic crisis."
"I am delighted to inform Mr Alves and everyone that in 8 or 10 days time, a large-scale conference is going to be held on the outermost regions, sponsored by the Spanish Presidency."
"The President of Parliament has appointed me to speak along with Mr Durão Barroso, Mr Rodríguez Zapatero and the President of the government of the Canary Islands at the opening of the conference."
"I am definitely going to use the result of this debate and Mr Alves's report as major sources of inspiration for the speech that I have to make then."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12.00."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The European Union's island and outermost regions are facing a number of problems at the moment."
"This is why specific measures are required to promote their future social and economic development."
"I welcome the additional measures proposed by Parliament and the Commission, intended to improve the state of agriculture in the outermost regions, especially against the backdrop of the problems facing the Azores and Madeira."
"Milk is the Azores' main agricultural product."
"However, given that a number of European Union Member States have faced a milk crisis recently, it is necessary to change these islands' agricultural profile."
"I agree on this point with the rapporteur, who expresses the view that sugar beet is the best alternative to milk production, in terms of both economic efficiency and environmental protection."
"I wish to emphasise that sending the maximum volumes of sugar beet to Europe must still be encouraged."
"In conclusion, I wish to stress that, in the current economic crisis, the post-2013 financial framework must have solidarity as its main foundation and also still aim to achieve high standards of territorial and social cohesion."

"In November last year, here in Strasbourg, when we were discussing the approval of four previous macro-financial assistance proposals regarding other countries, the Commission promised us that, under the Lisbon Treaty and until the adoption of a framework regulation for macro-financial assistance, all future individual proposals for such assistance would be subject to codecision by Parliament and the Council."
"Now, only six months later, you have in front of you not only a proposal for a codecided decision, but also a first-reading agreement with the Council."
"In trying to reach that agreement, we were operating under a very tight timetable."
"Therefore, I would like to express my recognition and gratitude to the Spanish Presidency, the Council and the Commission, as well as to the shadow rapporteurs on the Committee on International Trade and everybody involved, for their positive and constructive approach."
"Under the proposed decision, Ukraine could get a loan of up to EUR 500 million in order to finance its balance of payments deficit and meet external financing needs."
"This loan would supplement IMF support and the EU assistance of EUR 110 million that was agreed back in 2002 but has not yet been disbursed."
"During our informal trialogue negotiations, Parliament insisted on keeping references to certain disbursement conditions that were important for us, such as the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the assistance."
"We also insisted on the importance of Parliament being kept duly informed about the actual implementation of the assistance."

"One does not need to be a clairvoyant to be able to predict even now that a uniform policy such as this will lead to a large increase in the number of asylum seekers in the Member States."
"The recital in the report stating that the introduction of a joint resettlement programme would make illegal immigration less attractive is particularly disagreeable."
"This hypocritical pseudo-argument resurfaces time and again when votes are held in this House on texts concerning immigration or asylum."
"It pulls the wool over people's eyes."
"In countries such as Belgium, illegal immigration usually occurs when people go underground following their asylum procedure and are subsequently rewarded with regularisation."
"This kind of thing must be combated, and a joint resettlement programme by no means offers a solution."
"(CS) We have passed a directive that will undoubtedly open up further opportunities for research into the energy efficiency of buildings and will contribute to savings in relation to the heating of buildings."
"It is mainly old buildings that are a problem, of course, and not just blocks of flats."
"Yesterday, my colleague, Marian-Jean Marinescu, mentioned a special fund."
"The provision of additional resources in a time of crisis is questionable."
"It is therefore necessary to make better use of current resources - which amount to 4% for the period 2010 to 2014."
"(CS) I wanted to speak again about the report on the refugee fund, and that is why I have come forward."
"I would like to say that the voting equipment showed that I abstained."
"I would like to declare here, however, that I support shared responsibility for more dignified conditions for legitimate asylum seekers and that I was in favour."
"On the other hand, we must fight more effectively against illegal migration."
"Now to the Schengen item, if I may."
"Today, we have approved further steps for launching version two of the Schengen Information System, which reinforces security guarantees for all Europeans living in a unified space without barriers."
"However, the actions of the German and Austrian police cast a dark shadow over the idea of Schengen and European solidarity, when numerous Czech citizens are forced to undergo unnecessary, intimate and degrading checks at internal borders."
"I raised this problem, along with other issues, two years ago in a question to the European Commission, but the situation has not yet been resolved satisfactorily."
"It amounts to a clear breach of the rules, and in the case of Czech citizens, including businessmen and workers, it restricts free movement, which is one of the basic freedoms guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"(IT) A migratory policy, Mr President, that seeks to be fair and realistic, necessarily requires the adoption of shared European regulations on asylum and must also make provision for a resettlement programme that is effective, solid and sustainable."
"At this point, I feel I must emphasise that resettlement pursues not only a humanitarian aim, but also the political and economic goal of relieving third countries of the burden of accepting large numbers of refugees, and the equally great burden of sharing costs and financial responsibilities."
"We believe, however, that one budget line and one form of financial support are not enough and so we urge Member States to promote the creation of further private financing mechanisms, encouraging public-private partnerships with NGOs and other social partners, such as religious and ethnic organisations, in order to help promote voluntary work in this sector."
"Where new financial perspectives are concerned, we think it would be a good idea, for example, to make provision for a specific ad hoc financial allocation, perhaps by means of a new fund set up for this purpose."
"Finally, we propose a firm commitment from all those involved to offering refugees, especially the most vulnerable, access to appropriate housing, education and language courses, health care, psychological services, as well as access to the job market, which is essential to ensure that they become properly integrated."
"(CS) I am pleased that the report of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has received such broad support in today's vote."
"I realise it is primarily the responsibility of the Member States to secure social conditions for female entrepreneurs that are on a par with those enjoyed by female employees."
"Nevertheless, this report provides clear outlines which countries should follow."
"I do not consider this a breach of subsidiarity, but if anyone has doubts, they can initiate a review."
"Even domestic parliaments can do this, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I am curious as to whether they will take advantage of this criticism, or merely engage in endless empty talk."
"(LT) I voted for this report and feel it is important to stress that on average, women in the European Union are still being paid less for every hour they work - 17.4% less than men."
"This disparity has only been reduced slightly in the past 15 years, while in some countries, it has even grown worse."
"I agree with Parliament's call for the preparation of regular reports on the gender pay gap in the European Union, and I support all measures to help reduce discrimination against women in the European Union."
"(CS) We approved the controversial proposal because our IMCO committee broadened and enhanced it by introducing country of origin labelling for the European Union as well."
"Italian Members submitted further proposals at today's plenary session, including broadening the regulation to encompass shoes as well."
"I have strongly backed this idea for a long time, but it must be drafted to a high standard by the European Commission."
"It is a matter of resolving the technical definitions, which Parliament cannot do very well itself."
"I therefore did not vote in favour of it, but at the same time, I would like to ask the Commission to begin work immediately and to submit the proposal."
"(DA) Madam President, I would just like to say that I voted against those parts of the report that concern 'made in' labelling because I do not think there is any evidence to show that the advantages are greater than the disadvantages."
"I believe that this is tending towards protectionism and that is something that I find difficult to vote in favour of."
"I therefore voted against the parts in question."
"(PL) Madam President, I decided to endorse this initiative, which gives certain regions in Europe the opportunity for development."
"Attention should be drawn to the fact that in economic terms, certain areas in Europe itself are also becoming outermost regions."
"Therefore, programmes like this have as their objective, among other things, the development of areas in Europe, and I hope they will stimulate development by agriculture and also by the fishing industry."
"Madam President, I would like to express my concern regarding the situation of banana producers in the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Madeira, which the treaty include among the outermost regions."
"Their situation has been made more difficult especially since the EU, within the World Trade Organisation, concluded an agreement with Latin American countries on lowering tariffs for banana imports from that region."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that in 2006, the EU reformed its common market organisation for bananas. It committed budgetary funds for aid to banana producers in those regions."
"Since the reform, the EU has committed EUR 208 million each year to supporting banana producers in the Canaries, the French Antilles, Madeira and, to a lesser extent, in the Azores."
"Although we should welcome such support, for many banana producers, this support will not be enough."
"So I would like to urge the competent institutions to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that traditional branches of the economy in the EU are not compromised for more strategic trade goals."
"Madam President, I support this report because it addresses the issue of diversity and our agricultural policy between the regions."
"However, I want to comment on the winding-up remarks made by Commissioner Cioloş."
"He responded to concerns expressed on the reopening of talks with the Mercosur countries and, while his words brought some comfort to those who listened - because he said he would ensure that the interests of EU farming and the EU farm model would be safeguarded - I am afraid I was not reassured."
"It is very clear from the Commission's own papers that European Union beef producers, poultry meat producers and pigmeat farmers will be adversely affected if a deal is done."
"We are having this reopening of talks at a time when we are reforming agricultural policy."
"The budget is under threat."
"We may not have a sufficient budget and yet we are facing further disruption of farm prices and incomes."
"It does not make sense, and I hope the Commissioner hears these views."
"(HU) I support this report because it simplifies the enormous administrative and bureaucratic burden currently weighing down farmers."
"I am very confident that as a result of the report, a new form of relationship will emerge between the officials responsible for implementing the common agricultural policy in Member States, especially in post-communist states like Hungary, and farmers."
"This will put an end to the sort of practice in use until now, which systematically punished, penalised and terrorised farmers."
"I hope, too, that a new form of cooperation will also develop at last between officials and clients."
"I think it is very important that responsibility does not rest only with farmers, who have hitherto had to pay fines for every petty incident, but that the state, too, assumes responsibility, such as when the office is late in paying farmers what they are owed."
"Claims for such payments should be enforceable in a court of law by both farmers and clients."
"(IT) I voted in favour of the Ashworth report because I believe that simplifying and reducing bureaucratic procedures relating to the CAP, the common agricultural policy, is not only desirable, but necessary so that European farmers can take full advantage of its benefits, and not, as so often happens, encounter administrative difficulties and delays."
"I also believe that many will share the desire to ensure clearer and more comprehensible legislation, both for the responsible authorities and for farmers, to do away with all superfluous regulations, and to promote the exchange of good practices between Member States and local authorities."
"(DE) Madam President, the common agricultural policy needs to be constantly checked for its practicability, as unnecessary red tape costs us and, above all, our farmers, a great deal of time and money."
"Elements that are not meaningful and appropriate must be dismantled and simplified."
"This is the case, in particular, for the often very complicated and disputed cross-compliance regulations."
"Our stated goal is to make agricultural policy simpler and more transparent."
"The European Union's farmers should be able to spend more time in the field again, rather than behind a desk."
"I really hope that the Commission takes note of this important message from our report and takes action to realise it."
"Madam President, I voted for this report, like many others who are actively engaged with farmers in their region."
"One of the key things we hear about all the time is the bureaucracy involved in the industry."
"So a key aspect of the new CAP must be a reduction in the amount of red tape and bureaucracy."
"Legislation must be meaningful to farmers and we must not restrict farmers from food production."
"However, not only streamlining of legislation is important but also flexibility for Member States and, most importantly, with the Commission and the European Court of Auditors."
"The European Court of Auditors has shown little to no flexibility, or indeed common sense, when applying penalties."
"This legislation needs urgent attention, and more common sense is needed."
"A financial review is also needed to assess the cost of farm inspections and the amount of money recovered in penalties, to see if this is actually value for money for the taxpayer."
"Madam President, I think when we introduced decoupling, few of us realised the implications of making cross compliance part of the package which farmers now need to comply with."
"I think it is over 17 different directives."
"Perhaps we should ask ourselves in this House how well we legislate for simplification."
"However, there is one particular area that I want to comment on, and that is the area of inspections."
"We have the overarching inspection for cross compliance by competent authorities, but farmers are increasingly facing other levels and layers of inspections from processors, from retailers, from all sorts of groups; we need a little bit of coordination and not duplication of inspections."
"They do not add any value or any degree of safety or security to the final product, but they add a huge amount of bureaucracy and frustration for the producers who are required to meet and greet all of these inspectors."
"I welcome this report."
"(FI) Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ashworth, for his excellent report."
"To my mind, there is very good reason now to focus attention on our ability to simplify the processes that relate to agriculture in the European Union."
"You could say that the payments jungle is such that the ordinary farmer, whether in the north or east of Finland, or anywhere in Europe generally, is disinclined to look into it."
"We therefore need clear, workable and comprehensible models."
"We also need trust between the farming population and the government in order to be able to make headway."
"At the moment, the European Union's agricultural policy is such a shambles, with its 27 different countries and 27 different cultures, that it is hard to see any clear future other than a simplification and clarification of the systems."
"This report by Mr Ashworth is an excellent step in this direction, and I hope that we will be able to continue along this path: clear, simple instructions and guidelines on agriculture now and in the future."
"Madam President, I think it is refreshing to have a report coming before Parliament today starting with the word 'simplification'."
"Of course, that in itself should not be necessary but it suggests that until now, it has been too complicated."
"Anything involving an educational approach to a particular topic should involve simplification rather than complication."
"We have had too much complication up until now, as anybody who has attended farmers' meetings will know."
"Farmers are driven absolutely berserk by the amount of forms they have to fill in and the overbearing inspectorate they have to endure."
"So I welcome this proposal."
"Of course, it also has to be said that what you do with forms is not actually going to decide how you farm your land."
"It is the way the farmers treat their animals and the way they farm their land that is going to give us the traceability, accountability and food security and quality that we need."
"So this is a step in the right direction."
"I hope we see many of them and, in due course, eliminate the need for the word 'simplification' to be introduced, because it should be there automatically."
"(FI) Madam President, I voted in favour of the report, but I voted wrongly in the allimportant Article 34, under Amendment 5."
"It is very important that we clarify the size of this carbon footprint and, furthermore, discover its costs."
"It is high time the European Parliament sat in just one location, and I am very glad that the new government in the United Kingdom has decided that this matter should be raised as part of its programme."
"I hope that the other Member States will also make it their concern."
"It is a matter of the environment, and it is a matter of costs."
"As long as the European Parliament is able to spend as much money as it does now on a rally of this nature, we will continue to ignore the economic crisis."
"(IT) As regards the Ţicău report, I voted in favour of the common position on updating the directive on the energy performance of buildings, because the aim is that, from the end of 2020, all newly constructed buildings will have an energy balance equal to zero, an aim that the European institutions must make every effort to achieve."
"Europe has a shared commitment, and is firmly convinced that in the near future, it will not be necessary to produce more energy, but to make better use of that which is already produced."
"Energy saving and energy efficiency effectively represent a source of energy production."
"We do not need to wait ten years to move in this direction; instead, Member States need to commit as of now to achieving energy efficiency targets, using financial resources that, until today, have been dedicated to producing greater quantities of energy."
"I remind you especially of the iniquitous launch of the nuclear programme in Italy, which damaged and endangered the health of citizens and the environment."
"A huge quantity of public resources was wasted on this launch in order to produce, in less than twenty years, the same quantity of energy that we could do without if we were to invest the same resources in energy efficiency right now."
"Green investments for our children, not radioactive waste!"
"I will now move on to the explanation of vote for the Rühle report."
"(IT) I voted in favour because I think it is important for Parliament to support the simplification and rationalisation of public procurement law."
"This will make work easier both for administrative bodies and for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which will find it easier to participate in tenders."
"I consider it essential to refer to the use of public procurement as a means of encouraging paths of sustainable development, by introducing environmental and social criteria within invitations to tender."
"I also think that it is the duty of this Parliament and of the European institutions to continue pressing for all-round transparency surrounding the use of public money, particularly with regard to public procurement, using all possible means and especially the Internet."
"Citizen control represents a crucial contribution for using public funds in a way that is genuinely in the collective interest and, as the Committee on Regional Development reminds us, for fighting the corruption that prevails within local and regional authorities."
"(CS) Public procurement is unfortunately an area suffering from one of the highest levels of corruption."
"I was happy to back the report by Heide Rühle calling for a simplification of public procurement."
"At the same time, however, I would like to point out that until the Commission introduces a public portal with information on the circumstances of suspicious contracts funded by the Union, not much will change."
"Competition will not be efficient, fair and accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I am talking about monitoring and analysis, about a reference price for one kilometre of motorway, for example, publishing the names of the real owners of victorious firms, including subsidiaries of parent companies, and also the names of firms that win repeatedly, so that they can be investigated by the media and the public."
"Madam President, I also wanted to speak on energy efficiency but apparently the rule is that, if there are no amendments, no oral explanation may be made, so I will put in a written one."
"On the Keller report, I want to be very clear that I reject it on the basis of paragraphs 44 and 45 and recital I. I regard paragraph 44 as deeply disturbing."
"Also, where does this Parliament sit?"
"Last year and the year before, we pressed the Commission to take action to assist dairy farmers across the European Union who were in a dire situation."
"The Commission responded with export refunds as an emergency measure."
"The only people who complained to me about it were from New Zealand, which is not a developing country."
"I think that to put these paragraphs into this otherwise good report does a disservice to this Parliament and to our producers across the European Union, who are struggling."
"We are reducing production in Europe."
"That has a consequence for the developing world. We need to heed it."
"Mrs McGuinness, you were exactly right on the Rules."
"I had thought that Mrs Alfano was going to carry on in a similar vein to Mrs Jäätteenmäki, but in fact, that report should not have had any explanations of vote."
"You are correct."
"Madam President, I just want to say that I agree with my colleague Ms McGuinness."
"We had difficulties with some of the proposals here and for that reason, we did not go with the EPP line, which we would normally like to do."
"I think Ms McGuinness has explained why."
"I fully understand and also concur with what she said, so I hope that the EPP will understand as well."
"(NL) Madam President, I voted in favour of the Ranner report on the grounds that it offers a good solution to the problem of driving times and rest periods in road transport."
"This solution lies in the harmonisation and interpretation of the legislation. This can be found in paragraph 17, as amended."
"The European Commission, in cooperation with the Confederation of Organisations in Road Transport Enforcement (CORTE), Tispol and Euro Contrôle Route, must work on producing an article by article interpretation of the application of the legislation."
"In addition, this interpretation must be clear for, and known to, everyone involved in applying legislation on Europe's roads."
"I also welcome the amended paragraph 27, and call on all drivers to make use of the Disproportionate Fines Complaint Desk at Euro Contrôle Route."
"Drivers, things have to change in Europe in terms of driving times and rest periods, and so proof is required."
"I encourage you, therefore, to report your complaints to this desk provided by Euro Contrôle Route."
"(IT) Madam President, my colleague's report accurately emphasises that there are still notable discrepancies between the way serious social road traffic offences are treated in the various Member States."
"I am therefore in favour of the proposed measures for the harmonisation and levelling of offences and the relative European penalties, and of the possible setting up of a coordinating instrument at European Union level."
"Written explanations of vote"
"There are still far too many accidents on Europe's roads."
"This is connected to the growing traffic volume, but also to the excessive demands on road users due to professional or private stress and overtiredness as well as a confusing mass of traffic signs and advertising billboards, etc. We must also not forget that, in particular in the case of accidents involving fatalities or serious injuries, heavy traffic has a negative role to play."
"For the sake of the environment, we must finally implement ideas that are only paid lip service to, such as transferring goods transport to the rails, but we must also implement intelligent traffic arrangements such as traffic light phasing."
"Traffic calmed zones, city centre driving bans and similar measures have not yet been sufficiently researched and therefore should not be implemented on a large scale."
"There are a number of problems that this report simply does not go into in sufficient detail and I have therefore voted 'no'."
"This proposal is part of the Union's legislative efforts towards establishing a European asylum system."
"This European Asylum Support Office must therefore provide the Member States with expert assistance and contribute to applying a consistent and high-quality common European asylum policy."
"The creation of this new office will, without doubt, be an added value for the reinforcement of mutual confidence and sharing of responsibilities between the Member States."
"It must facilitate exchanges of information, analyses and experiences between them, organise training activities, and develop concrete cooperation between the administrations entrusted with analysis of asylum requests."
"It is important to confront the significant divergences in the decision-making processes of the 27 Member States regarding international protection requests and to successfully achieve a certain amount of convergence in how the Member States analyse and respond to these requests."
"I support the rapporteur's proposal to include the offering of support on resettlement."
"I agree that the necessary budgetary changes to the European Refugee Fund will provide adequate funding for the new agency in its initial phases."
"Issues relating to immigration and, especially, the right to asylum are particularly sensitive."
"Whether or not this right is awarded to non-EU citizens could have a dramatic impact on their lives, so the decision must be taken seriously, given thought and treated with humanity."
"I think that it is basic common sense that an open-door policy - without criteria to restrict access to the Union's territory - is unacceptable, but that a policy of absolutely prohibiting entry is intolerable."
"A fair balance is needed which seeks to reconcile the legitimate interests and concerns of the nationals of the Member States with the needs of those who are seeking them."
"The establishment of a European Asylum Support Office could constitute an important step towards the adoption of best practices in this area, giving Member States greater confidence in each other, and resulting in the improved exchange of information."
"Nevertheless, I must emphasise that the Member States must continue to have a freedom of movement regarding whether or not to admit those seeking asylum within their borders."
"I would also stress that the EU must not hide the fact that the interests of its Member States in this area are not absolutely convergent."
"The goal of the European Asylum Support Office is to provide expert assistance that contributes to applying a consistent and high quality common European asylum policy."
"This office enables the development of mutual trust and the sharing of responsibilities and will be responsible for coordinating the exchange of information and other actions relating to resettlement by the Member States."
"As a promoter of values of human dignity, which constitute basic elements of freedom, democracy and socio-economic development, in the context of the current global landscape, the European Union must be a pioneer and an example to others regarding asylum."
"The creation of a European office, to support the Member States in this area of intervention with citizens of third countries, will be a determining factor in applying a common European asylum system and the solidarity of Member States in consistent action that fits with the values and principles of the project of building Europe."
"I call for the mechanisms and resources necessary to establish the Asylum Support Office to be ensured quickly."
"I voted in favour of the creation of the European Asylum Support Office in the hope that it will allow a certain added value to be brought to a European asylum system that today is clearly flawed."
"Certainly, I would have liked the mandate of this Office to be more ambitious and to be the instrument through which compulsory solidarity between the Member States is finally established, so as to put an end to the lottery of the right to asylum."
"This will remain a pious hope until common asylum procedures are adopted."
"Hopefully, this office will at least have the merit of contributing to improved identification of asylum issues and problems, in order to ensure the best possible protection for people who are the victims of persecution and are seeking refuge in our country."
"in writing. - (RO) I voted in favour of setting up the European Asylum Support Office as, in the case of Member States whose national asylum system is under pressure, the Office can support the implementation of solidarity mechanisms intended to promote a better reallocation of beneficiaries of international protection from such Member States to others, while ensuring that asylum systems are not abused."
"I welcome the fact that the European Asylum Support Office will coordinate the joint assistance actions of Member States which are facing specific situations, such as large influxes of third country nationals requiring international protection."
"It is vital for us to harmonise both our asylum laws and practices."
"The European Asylum Support Office will identify good practices, organise training courses at European level and improve access to exact information about the countries of origin."
"Furthermore, I believe that the European Asylum Support Office's activities should also include drawing up guidelines aimed at facilitating a fairer assessment of asylum applications, as well as monitoring compliance with and enforcement of the relevant Community legislation."
"We are persuaded of the added value that the European Asylum Support Office will represent for the development of mutual trust, and for the division of political and financial responsibilities."
"The EU Member States have yet to reach a final agreement on the treatment to be afforded to refugees, the profile of individuals to whom refugee status should be accorded and they must, above all, overcome the reservations of some governments where possible costs are concerned."
"This office will be responsible for providing specialised assistance."
"Its role will involve coordination, information exchange and actions relating to the resettling of refugees."
"It will run training programmes aimed at those responsible for this sector within each country, contributing to greater harmonisation between the various practices."
"We MEPs reserve the fundamental right to appoint its executive director."
"I feel it is my duty to stress our call to make the necessary changes to the European Refugee Fund in order to ensure that the new agency operates appropriately."
"The biggest political question remains the relationship between human solidarity and the division of financial burdens: the EU is called upon to offer effective support to States most affected by migratory flows and by a high number of asylum seekers, and which face specific and often disproportionate pressures due to their relatively small size."
"On such a sensitive subject, relating to human rights, the creation of a European Asylum Support Office is important in enabling specialised assistance at EU level to define a consistent and high-quality common European asylum policy."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"The Asylum Support Office could represent a very useful body, specifically if it took on a coordinating role in relation to repatriation and thus accelerated repatriation measures."
"As a result, the support would also be helpful for resettlement."
"The present report treats this element, which I find very important, only as a subordinate issue."
"Instead, it contains numerous bureaucratic proposals that will result in a bloated apparatus and a sluggish implementation of the measures."
"I have therefore abstained from voting."
"I express my support for the proposal to create a European Asylum Support Office."
"The role of this office, initially financed by the European Refugee Fund, will be to provide the specialised assistance needed to activate a common asylum policy, and to coordinate information exchanges and actions relating to the resettlement of refugees."
"It will be the job of the European Parliament to appoint its executive director, implementing principles of transparency and democratic control."
"Solidarity within the community will be assured by an agreement between Member States with the consent of stakeholders."
"I also support the establishment of a consultative forum as a result of pressure exercised by us MEPs, which will ensure close dialogue between the Asylum Support Office and the various stakeholders."
"Today, we are giving the go-ahead to the establishment of the European Asylum Support Office."
"It will have multiple benefits."
"The Asylum Support Office will make a decisive contribution to the integration of a single European asylum area."
"It will quickly put an organisation into operation which will coordinate and strengthen cooperation between the Member States on asylum issues by promoting a rapprochement between various national practices."
"The Office will also help to promote convergence between regulatory arrangements which apply in the EU in the field of asylum rights."
"Bearing all these benefits in mind and the consent of both the Member States and the European institutions to the establishment of the European Office, I was delighted to vote in favour of its establishment."
"Although a favourable vote on this report is merely a formality, since the implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon required some adaptation of the legal basis and delegated acts, I would still like to highlight the importance of energy efficiency in the building industry when it comes to achieving the EU target of reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 20%, and to increasing energy production from renewable sources by 20% by 2020."
"As we know, achieving energy efficiency and emission cutting targets in urban centres depends chiefly on improving the energy efficiency of existing buildings, and those under construction."
"I still believe, however, that the directive sets very ambitious targets that local administrations will struggle to achieve unless they are given financial aid, including EU aid."
"I am thinking particularly of the huge amount of energy recovery work required in existing building stock, such as social housing, where energy renovation (which would help families to cut their utility bills) will require a significant financial commitment by local authorities."
"The aim of this ambitious text is to encourage the construction/renovation of buildings according to standards that are more environmentally friendly since they are more energy efficient."
"I voted resolutely in favour of its adoption."
"With this type of initiative, the European Union is demonstrating its role as a leader in the area of sustainable development."
"This directive is a good compromise between encouragement and constraint where environmentally responsible construction is concerned."
"The construction sector is responsible for 40% of the EU's energy consumption and 35% of its emissions."
"This legislation stipulates that by 2020, new buildings must be nearly zero energy and that renovated existing buildings must meet minimum energy performance requirements."
"This legislation will therefore contribute to reducing energy dependency in Europe, decreasing CO2 emissions, improving internal and external air quality, and increasing well-being in cities."
"The incentive to improve the energy performance of buildings also represents a chance to reclassify our cities, contributing to tourism, job creation and sustainable economic growth in the EU."
"However, reclassification requires increased public and private investment."
"We are looking at direct public investment with a direct effect on job creation and on the involvement of small and medium-sized enterprises; a programme of urban regeneration will be appropriate for the economic recovery."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to use the Structural Funds to reclassify buildings in environmental and energy terms, with this financing used as a catalyst for private funding."
"I also call on them to find the appropriate financing model for renovating existing buildings."
"We spend 50% of our lives in our homes."
"Today, 30% of existing homes in Europe are unhealthy, even if there is a great disparity between the different Member States."
"It is therefore important not only to promote new sustainable buildings, but also to carry out sustainable renovation."
"I welcome this new legislation, which will help consumers to reduce their energy bills and the whole of the EU to achieve its climate objective of reducing energy consumption by 20% in 10 years."
"The Member States will have to adapt their building regulations so that all buildings constructed from the end of 2020 comply with high energy standards."
"Existing buildings will have to be improved if possible."
"For the Democratic Movement, the housing issue is also one of urbanism and build quality."
"We must give priority to the way in which our homes are designed."
"We must therefore encourage the rehabilitation of our building stock, for example, through a modulation of property taxes depending on the energy performance of buildings."
"We therefore call on the Member States to establish a tax system that is reoriented to encourage all the parties involved to behave in a more environmentally responsible way."
"I regard this report as being beneficial to the future of the European Union's energy sector, as long as the objectives outlined in it are feasible and compatible with the financial situation of all Member States."
"I welcome the objectives adopted by the Council on 14 April 2010 on the need to reduce the major disparities between Member States in terms of heat efficiency in buildings, as well as the proposed target of all buildings achieving zero energy consumption by 31 December 2020, based on gradual steps being taken by Member States in 2015 and 2018."
"However, the Commission and Council must bear in mind that many Member States are still facing economic recession and will require financial and logistical support to achieve the objectives being proposed."
"The Commission must consider for the future drawing up a financial intervention plan based on allocating development funds that will support Member States which are unable to allocate the necessary funds, especially for renovation work."
"This measure must be seen as beneficial to ordinary citizens as they are the ones who are footing the bill for part of the renovation costs."
"I voted for the recommendation on the energy performance of buildings, because it presents ambitious and feasible proposals for a 20% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the sectors not covered by the emissions trading scheme by 2020."
"This directive will have a direct effect on the lives of the European public, as it will help consumers to cut their spending on energy and, at the same time, it can contribute to creating millions of jobs throughout the EU through the planned investments in improved energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources."
"In 2008, the EU committed itself to a 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020 and for 20% of energy consumed to come from renewable sources."
"Improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way to reduce by 20% the energy consumption and emissions for sectors outside the Emissions Trading System."
"Furthermore, energy savings for energy efficient buildings average 30% over conventional buildings."
"On 13 November 2008, the Commission tabled its proposed amendment to Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings."
"These amendments will impact the lives of the European public significantly, as they will have immediate consequences for the buildings in which they live, and will create the need for more efficient technologies in the construction sector to be researched and developed."
"Moreover, this strategy will create jobs and contribute to sustainable growth."
"As the current draft is based on the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council in November 2009, I support the rapporteur's proposal."
"The adoption of this directive relating to the energy performance of buildings is an important step towards reducing Europe's CO2 emissions and energy dependency."
"These factors are increasingly decisive for the European public's quality of life, and the competitiveness of our economy and social organisation."
"Given that the building sector is responsible for 40% of energy consumption and for 35% of total CO2 emissions, the self-sufficiency and improved energy performance of renovated buildings are taking on decisive importance in the European Union's ability to achieve, by 2020, the goal of a 20% reduction in energy consumption and a 20% increase in the use of renewable sources of energy and energy efficiency."
"As well as helping private consumers and public services to cut energy costs, it is hoped that the application of this new legislation will help to fight the crisis in the civil construction sector and that it will contribute to developing urban regeneration programmes, which will have a positive impact on improving the quality of life and well-being of the public."
"Improving the energy performance of buildings is particularly important in increasing the EU's general energy efficiency and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"If the European Union wants to achieve the objectives that it is proposing, seeking to reduce energy consumption by 20%, to ensure that 20% of energy consumption comes from renewable sources and to increase energy efficiency by 20% before 2020, it will have to make a significant commitment to the energy performance of buildings."
"The political agreement reached between Parliament and the Council has resulted in the clarification of technical aspects, minimum energy performance requirements depending on the age of a building and whether or not it has been renovated, evaluation of the role of local and regional authorities, and support for public authorities in applying the recommendations."
"Nevertheless, we still have some concerns regarding the stronger role for the Commission in evaluating national plans and inspection reports, as well as the adaptations to the Treaty of Lisbon, which focus more power on the Commission through the so-called 'delegated acts'."
"The basic factors affecting energy performance are: 1."
"Conversion of one form of energy into another so that it can be put to a specific use."
"The longer the chain of conversions, the greater the losses."
"In practice, this mainly concerns the stream of heat energy released from primary energy sources."
"A large part of this passes into the environment."
"This effect can be reduced in cogeneration processes, which can achieve an efficiency rating of as much as 90%."
"2."
"Electrical resistance, or Ohm's resistance, which is important in the transmission of electrical energy."
"3."
"Thermal resistance."
"Low resistance is important in heat exchangers, while high resistance is important because of the low thermal conductivity of insulating materials."
"Use of these insulating materials - such as polystyrene, mineral wool and cellular concrete - significantly reduces residential housing's thermal energy requirement."
"At the moment, it is quite high - around 40% of the total energy used."
"4."
"Friction in anti-friction processes, such as in bearings, and in friction processes such as brakes."
"This concerns mainly cars and turbulence in aeroplanes."
"Friction losses are around 30% of total energy."
"I voted in favour of the regulation without the amendments, because energy losses in residential buildings are - alongside conversion losses - the greatest, while savings will help poor people."
"In Poland's case, thermal modernisation, alongside cogeneration, can bring economic, social and ecological benefits."
"In this area, there should be a certain priority of realisation, because new regulations often slow down the implementation of earlier ones."
"I voted for the draft revised directives on the energy performance of buildings because I believe that new buildings should abide by the principle of energy saving and that binding standards should apply in this area, so that they are respected effectively everywhere."
"Public buildings will lead the way from 2018, giving public authorities more weight and legitimacy in their information campaigns for citizens."
"These texts also stipulate that energy saving must be a fundamental element in the renovation of buildings."
"I would therefore like these measures to give SMEs a new momentum and the Member States to strengthen training programmes for the workforce responsible for making buildings energy efficient."
"Similarly, as far as the energy labelling of energy using products is concerned, I feel consumers should be aware of the energy characteristics of the products they buy."
"The issue of energy efficiency is crucial to the 2020 strategy."
"An important step has been taken towards reducing energy consumption over the coming years with the adoption of this recommendation, which aims for nearly zero energy buildings by 2020."
"The effort must be made not only when constructing new buildings, but also on large renovation projects involving already existing buildings."
"It will also be crucial for a good example to be set in public construction projects."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"Easy to implement energy saving measures have often been implemented in the past and it is difficult to estimate how high the easy to achieve (meaning that they are possible without extremely extensive renovation work) potential for energy savings is."
"All of this, in any case, must not get out of hand to the extent that buildings on which excellent energy efficiency renovation work has been carried out stand empty because the rent rises exorbitantly."
"Generally speaking, even in the interests of protecting the climate, we must not interfere unacceptably with the ownership rights of citizens where renovations are concerned."
"Energy saving measures are, for one thing, very cost intensive and do not always involve completely mature technology, so in that respect, we must not simply lay down something; we must provide incentives through subsidies."
"Given the wage and social security cuts that we are facing, we must double and triple check that the new regulations do not drive simple house builders or residents to wrack and ruin."
"The impact of energy demand cannot be clearly estimated, for which reason I voted 'no'."
"The building sector was identified by the EU as one of the markets with the highest energy saving potential."
"Energy savings for energy efficient buildings average 30% over conventional buildings."
"In the new EU Member States, including Lithuania, in many apartment blocks, around 60% of thermal energy is wasted."
"In Lithuania alone, there are over 35 000 apartment blocks."
"Their inhabitants not only pay huge sums for heating, but are also responsible for tonnes of CO2 emissions."
"The Conservative government in Lithuania is incapable of beginning building insulation."
"After almost two years of promises that renovation will start imminently, not one building has been renovated."
"I voted for this recommendation on the energy performance of buildings, since it promotes the objective of moving towards nearly zero energy buildings."
"This will guarantee that in time, EU buildings become sustainable from an energy point of view."
"By implementing this directive, we will begin the process of reducing the EU's energy consumption by one fifth by the year 2020."
"Investment to increase energy efficiency will create millions of jobs and will contribute to the growth of the EU economy."
"I express my support for the recommendation to improve the energy efficiency of buildings."
"Energy efficiency means not only saving energy, but also reducing CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions."
"To achieve this target, we should limit household energy loss, which has increased due to a technology that has shifted energy costs from construction to maintenance."
"Research in the construction sector is moving towards a greener approach to building."
"Today, the largest projects are concentrated within temperate countries, where this kind of technology is spreading at a rate that suggests we will have sustainable cities in the not too distant future."
"In Mediterranean countries, these new technologies are not spreading at the same pace."
"Even if the problem of heat dispersal is less serious in these areas, the buildings are no more environmentally sustainable."
"The growing use of air conditioning systems, which are increasingly widespread in homes, actually requires a great deal of energy."
"The European Union therefore needs to implement information campaigns, and to take action by making use of Community funds, incentives and information campaigns, and by applying and researching new production technologies."
"Achieving the 20-20-20 objective by 2020, in other words a 20% reduction in energy consumption, an increase in the ratio of energy from renewable sources to total energy consumption to 20% and a 20% increase in energy efficiency requires coordinated and targeted action, both by the EU and by the Member States."
"More importantly, improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions within non-ETS sectors by 20%."
"To be precise, energy savings for efficient buildings average 30% over conventional buildings."
"In addition, energy efficient buildings use less water and offer lower maintenance costs and utility bills."
"I therefore voted in favour of the directive on the energy performance of buildings, because it is expected to have a significant impact on the life of European citizens, given that it directly affects the buildings in which they live and which they use."
"In addition, investments in improving energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy sources will create millions of jobs and will contribute towards growth in the EU; at the same time, they will also help to cut the money currently wasted on maintaining energy-intensive buildings."
"Buildings are responsible for nearly half the CO2 emissions not included in the EU emissions trading certificate scheme, offering a major potential for cutting these emissions, with negative or low abatement costs."
"The new Energy Performance of Buildings Directive establishes a set of minimum indicators/requirements for the energy performance of new buildings so that they can achieve by 2020 an energy consumption close to zero, with a large part of the energy coming from renewable sources."
"This also involves applying these requirements to existing buildings."
"It is vital to inform citizens of these requirements and to encourage them, even when buildings are being renovated, to introduce smart metering systems (to replace the hot water and air-conditioning systems with energy efficient alternatives, such as reversible heat pumps)."
"Partial funding will be provided from the EU budget to encourage energy efficiency measures."
"Member States must adopt suitable measures in order to implement this directive quickly."
"I voted for this report as the new legislation will help consumers cut the value of their energy bills, thereby enabling the EU to fulfil its objective of achieving a 20% reduction in energy consumption by 2020."
"I have voted in favour of this important directive due to the need to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, which is one of the areas with the greatest potential to contribute to the EU's general targets of increasing energy efficiency by 20% by 2020."
"According to the text agreed between Parliament and the Council, before the end of 2020, all new buildings must have zero energy consumption, producing as much energy as they consume."
"Public buildings must set an example by complying with this legislation before 31 December 2013."
"The EU budget will fund part of the costs of the reforms."
"Moreover, existing buildings will have to comply with very high energy efficiency standards calculated by the Member States based on a common framework established in the directive."
"The indicator for measuring the energy efficiency of buildings must be included in advertisements for sale or rental that appear in the media."
"Another important new element is including smart meters and control and management systems focused on saving energy."
"The directive will be revised before 2017."
"Today's vote on EU rules on the energy performance of buildings represents major progress in the area of energy efficiency."
"However, we utterly deplore the fact that the legislation does not take into account the renovation requirements of existing buildings, which account for 40% of the energy consumption and 36% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe."
"Instead of establishing an ambitious energy efficiency policy by investing heavily in the renovation of buildings, the EU is concentrating exclusively on new buildings."
"It is letting slip the opportunity to create millions of jobs, to reduce our energy dependence on our neighbours and to significantly combat climate change."
"The construction sector is one with tremendous energy saving potential."
"The sector is responsible for 40% of energy consumption and 35% of total greenhouse gas emissions."
"Improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions."
"This agreement deserves our full support."
"By 31 December 2020 at the latest, all new buildings must be nearly zero energy. All public sector buildings must achieve this two years earlier."
"Minimum energy performance requirements will even apply from now on when older buildings are renovated."
"Nearly zero energy buildings are buildings with very high energy performance."
"In addition, the negligible or very small amount of energy they consume should originate, to a very large extent, from renewable energy sources."
"It is to be welcomed that the directive devotes attention to the provision of funding instruments to enable this transition."
"The Member States must draw up a list of measures for achieving the objectives of this directive by 30 June 2011 at the latest."
"Finally, the Commission must assess the functioning of the directive in good time; that is, by 1 January 2017 at the latest."
"This directive represents an important contribution to the fight against climate change."
"The Stockholm Programme provides for the creation of a reliable and sustainable common asylum policy in the European Union."
"However, in order to implement and ensure asylum policy objectives, it is necessary to encourage Member States to participate voluntarily in the Joint EU refugee resettlement programme."
"Therefore, the European Parliament is aiming to provide as many Member States as possible with the opportunity to participate in EU refugee resettlement programmes."
"The European Parliament supports the Commission's proposal and is of the opinion that resettlement of refugees should play a central role in the external asylum policies of the EU."
"It should be further developed and expanded into an effective protection instrument by the EU."
"By voting in favour of this report, Europe has taken a step towards reaching a common policy on asylum."
"This will make it possible to protect human rights more effectively and, at the same time, to limit illegal immigration."
"The EU must make its voice heard as far as migration and integration are concerned."
"It must assume responsibility for defining European rules, and for contributing to the expenditure incurred by the EU countries affected by migratory flows."
"Resettlement cannot and must not, however, be divorced from a shared line of action against illegal immigration."
"Such action requires not only the agreement of bordering countries but also of the countries from which future illegal immigrants will depart."
"in writing. - Resettlement of refugees is a process in which it is possible for these individuals to be resettled following a request by the UNHCR where it is deemed that there is a need for such individuals to receive international protection."
"This is one of the eligible criteria under the ERF."
"This process can be an ideal solution for those persons whose safety cannot be adequately guaranteed by nations of first asylum."
"I am in agreement with the conclusions that have been made by the rapporteur and have therefore decided to vote in favour of this report."
"It is only through a common asylum policy and joint resettlement scheme that we can pursue a proper human rights policy in the EU."
"Resettlement is, without doubt, one of the durable solutions for refugees whose protection cannot be assured in countries of first asylum."
"It is important for adequate funds to be available, although just assigning part of the budget cannot be considered a true refugee resettlement programme."
"We have no doubt of the importance of this amendment to the Refugee Fund, making it possible to plug a gap that exists in several Member States and improving their resettlement capacity."
"I am pleased to note that the number of Member States participating in this programme has increased in recent years; it is important that we manage to encourage the others to take part."
"The EU's development and expansion of this resettlement instrument must continue in order to establish the most effective protection possible."
"The Commission will, therefore, be able to set the EU's joint priorities regarding resettlement of people every year."
"These priorities may relate to specific geographic regions, nationalities or categories of refugees to resettle, although I agree that flexibility must be guaranteed in order to respond to emergency situations."
"The pressure of migration flows is intensifying and there are a number of migration target countries whose concern about this phenomenon needs to be understood."
"This is why it is important for the resettlement programme to be in operation as it would facilitate a fair distribution of the responsibility for complying with international obligations on refugee protection, as well as ease the load on countries burdened by the large number of refugees they are accommodating."
"One positive step would be to get the European Asylum Support Office up and running during this year, which can provide Member States with support in applying resettlement initiatives."
"No matter which country refugees are going to be resettled in, what is paramount is that they are provided with instant access to language and cultural courses about the relevant country, as well as to other facilities of a religious nature and to psychological counselling, if required."
"I believe that sustainability must be the main feature of such a programme, which is guaranteed a longer-term budgetary outlook as a result of this decision."
"The beneficiaries have already been traumatised by the break with the culture and traditions of the country they come from."
"They have to create a new identity for themselves, which is a traumatic process that does not need to be exacerbated by the precarious and insecure nature of their future."
"The need to resettle refugees has been becoming increasingly important in a Europe that does not wish to be closed off to the outside world or blind to what is going on there."
"A welcoming nature and solidarity for those who are suffering are two European characteristics that are inspired by Christianity and which it would be good to bring back in full."
"This must be done, however, without neglecting the legitimate limits set by the Member States."
"The EU's joint annual priorities in terms of geographic regions and in terms of specific categories of refugee to resettle must really take into account the needs of the Member States and their individual circumstances; the Member States' participation in resettlement actions must be encouraged."
"One of the 'eligible actions' of the European Refugee Fund (ERF) is resettlement."
"The Stockholm Programme states that the EU must act in partnership and cooperate with third countries hosting large refugee populations."
"The Commission defines annually the common EU priorities of persons to be resettled and this definition must be sufficiently flexible to respond to emergency cases."
"Particular attention must be given to the victims of the most repressive cultural, social and political systems."
"The number of Member States participating in EU resettlement programmes has been increasing and must be extended to the greatest possible number of Member States."
"I would stress the positive impact of introducing funds to assist with resettlement, with larger amounts for the first and second years of the process."
"These funds are in response to the increased costs naturally incurred by the creation of mechanisms and structures, as well as the importance of guaranteeing conditions to ensure the greatest sustainability and quality of the refugee resettlement process."
"Given its rather poor performance, Europe must contribute more to the effort to resettle refugees whose existence is threatened in the countries that have received them."
"It was in order to encourage the Member States to join this movement of collective solidarity that I voted in favour of this report, which aims to encourage the reception and resettlement of refugees in Europe."
"Good intentions are no longer enough; we must transform words into action and, in particular, give priority to women and children who are victims of violence or exploitation, to non-accompanied minors, to people who have been victims of torture, and to people who are seriously ill."
"Only 10 EU Member States, including Portugal, accept refugees for resettlement."
"The resettlement of refugees is a procedure whereby, based on a request from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees according to a person's need for international protection, third country nationals or stateless persons are transferred from a third country to a Member State."
"The adoption of this recommendation seeks to increase the number of Member States that resettle refugees, to which end those that do so for the first time will have increased financial assistance for the first two years."
"The resettlement of the following must take priority, irrespective of any geographical priorities that the EU may have set for a given period: children and women at risk of violence or psychological, physical or sexual exploitation; unaccompanied minors; persons with special medical needs; survivors of violence and torture; and persons who need emergency resettlement for legal and protection reasons."
"The eligible measures for support under the European Refugee Fund (ERF) include the resettlement of refugees from third countries."
"'Resettlement' means the process whereby, on a request from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) based on a person's need for international protection, third country nationals or stateless persons are transferred from a third country to a Member State whereby they are permitted to a) reside as a refugee or b) be given a status which offers them the same rights and benefits under national and Community law as refugee status."
"The measures proposed in the report will result in the EU - which already has to face the problem of mass immigration - becoming even more attractive to migrants."
"The UNHCR's figures confirm this."
"While, in 2008, approximately 5 000 people were resettled throughout the EU, at present, there are 750 000 people around the world with this need."
"It is for that reason that I voted against this report."
"In many Member States, including my home country of Austria, the capacity for accepting refugees is already at bursting point and the population is quite rightly resisting new reception centres and similar facilities."
"The report on the European Refugee Fund, calling, as it does, for the resettlement of refugees in the EU, is thus all the more incomprehensible."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The problem of refugees is a European problem and cannot be left to be managed by national States, particularly given their geographic and economic differences."
"I therefore support the setting up of a fund at European level."
"The setting up of such a fund must serve two purposes: it must support refugees who arrive in our countries, often on our coastlines, seeking help, and also those States that receive the greatest numbers of these desperate people due to their geographical location."
"The problem is, and must be, a European problem and we cannot leave certain States to manage it alone."
"I hope that the fund will be merely the beginning of a journey towards developing a more European and united approach to the whole issue."
"In view of the need to help refugees in Europe, I think the decision made by the European Parliament about this is extremely important."
"The main objective of the fund is to support measures taken by Member States, which very often involve additional expenditures."
"Such measures are intended to ensure decent living conditions for refugees, and also concern legal regulation of their stay in countries of the Union."
"I think it is essential to increase financial assistance for countries which are engaged in helping refugees."
"We must not give any grounds for the criticism that, as developed countries, instead of protecting refugees at all costs, we are trying to prevent them from coming to us."
"Refugees who come to Europe from the developing world, and who often have had to face enormous problems, such as violence, lack of the means to live and lack of access to medical care, should be given care organised in the best possible way by EU Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in the committee, there were many amendment proposals put to a vote which were aimed at pointing out the importance of the church and faith groups in solving the problem of refugees."
"All of these amendment proposals were rejected."
"When liberals and left-wing politicians assert that day-to-day work with refugees is sufficiently covered by non-governmental organisations and state funding, it reveals their short-sighted cynicism and hypocrisy."
"In reality, the exact opposite is the case."
"Is it not perhaps true that states often face criticism over the fact that conditions in refugee camps are, for the most part, undignified?"
"Would it be out of place to state openly the hypocrisy of states such as Germany, Spain, France, Italy or Malta?"
"Governments fail in the reception and care of refugees."
"The misery of these poorest people is an affront to affluent Europe, and so we return them."
"Due to political correctness, we ignore the fact that in the deepest misery of the reception camps, where the politically correct non-governmental organisations have already given up the fight, it is now the unobtrusive orders of Catholic nuns alone that work on with enthusiasm."
"Thanks to the Maltese Order, the Jesuit Refugee Service and many Christian organisations, governments are acknowledging their obligation to tackle the fate of the refugees."
"The Christian organisations are a thorn in the eye of our conscience."
"For this, they deserve our thanks - even now, when they get very limited funding from the EU budget and cannot even be mentioned in the own-initiative report on this topic."
"The report on the Schengen Information System and its modernisation contributes to this magnificent breakthrough in free intra-European movement."
"Faced with growing movements of people between Member States in the Schengen Area, as well as the latter's enlargement, we must improve the handling of data to ensure that this freedom is exercised in total security."
"The Coelho report contributes to the search for greater effectiveness in the circulation of information, as well as to the necessary respect for individual freedoms that the European Union guarantees."
"I logically voted for this report."
"The objective of this proposal is to ensure the migration from the Schengen Information System, whose current form is SIS 1+, to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)."
"It is indeed regrettable that the start of this system has been delayed."
"The European Parliament did all it could to ensure that this system would start to operate as soon as possible and that the SIS II implementation process would be completely transparent."
"However, it is necessary to seek the approval of all of the institutions."
"It is important to stress that the Commission would have to apply an alternative programme if the SIS II project is unsuccessful, and that Parliament should be included in the decision making as regards migration."
"Before switching over to the new SIS II system, Parliament should be fully informed by the Commission on the test results and given an opportunity to issue an opinion."
"in writing. - Prior to the migration to the new SIS, it is necessary that the appropriate tests be carried out and that the necessary safeguards are in place."
"While I believe that the above should be carried out in a professional and thorough manner, I also share the rapporteur's disappointment with regards to the extended delays that are impeding migration to the new system."
"I voted broadly in favour of the proposed amendments to this regulation."
"The data-migration phase is the final task under the development mandate for the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)."
"This therefore justifies the need to give the Commission a development mandate valid for the development of the system until it becomes operational."
"Given the considerable delays that have already been confirmed and the increased costs of the SIS II project, I understand that the sunset clause must be kept."
"The new mandate conferred on the Commission must be defined according to the date envisaged for the SIS II to become operational, in late 2011."
"However, the Commission must have some flexibility in order to be able to postpone dates using the comitology procedure so that it can adapt the legal framework to an alternative scenario if the SIS II is unsuccessful."
"The Commission's inability to set a likely date for the SIS II to become operational is unacceptable, since better guarantees of security, freedom and justice in the European area are depending on it."
"It also raises doubts about the lack of transparency in the way the process has been handled."
"The particular sensitivity of this subject justifies the assigning of the report to one of the Members of this House who has dedicated himself most to this subject, my colleague, Mr Coelho;"
"I would congratulate him on his work."
"The delays that this process has suffered are regrettable, but I share his caution on the success of the migration process and his concern over Parliament's right to be informed of developments."
"The 'saga' of migration from SIS I to SIS II has simply gone on for too long."
"That is why I voted for this report: to point out the need to respect the deadlines set and to end what could be viewed, following numerous fruitless outcomes and given the resources deployed to achieve the objective of said migration - so far without success - as mismanagement."
"The ball is in the Commission's court, but as the budgetary authority, the European Parliament must use its powers and reserve itself the right to ask the European Court of Auditors to proceed with a detailed audit of the management of the project and of the financial impact that a failure would have on the EU budget."
"I see slight progress in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs' amendments contained in this report."
"The latter, in effect, demands that the European Parliament be involved in the decision-making process and indicates that its favourable opinion is required before there can be any migration to the second version of the Schengen Information System."
"However, this report is still unacceptable."
"We cannot support the possibility of migration to SIS II - the new tool for achieving 'total security' - with impunity."
"With this system, more and more personal data can be gathered together, and for reasons of which the validity is subject to interpretation."
"How can the suspicion of the will to commit a terrorist act be deemed valid?"
"Worst of all, the United States could be given access to this data."
"In this hour of crisis, the reigning eurocracy continues to build us a Europe characterised by competition and by an overemphasis on law and order."
"However, now more than ever, it is time to build the Europe of solidarity and cooperation that we need."
"We have a Schengen Information System that works and is capable of expansion, and we have a prestige project costing millions that seems to be flopping."
"It is time to stop pouring money into the money pit and to rescue what can still be rescued."
"If the EU really wants to spend further millions, they should be spent on border protection or on benefiting indigenous families."
"Instead of simply paying out 'bounties' for taking in refugees, the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees should finally be accurately applied and it, of course, does not apply to the army of economic migrants."
"Finally, we do not need a new asylum support office to further expand the asylum jungle and the morass of EU agencies that gobble up millions."
"Until we have a functioning Schengen Information System, the Schengen Area must not be expanded."
"The new proposals are not only badly thought-out, they are quite simply counter-productive, and that is why I abstained from the vote."
"I express my full support for the report by Mr Coelho."
"The Schengen Information System has proved itself an excellent and valid instrument for management and control within the European Union."
"It has, however, required adjustment and adaptation during the course of its development, and also in view of further requirements that have become apparent."
"The rapporteur's proposal very much agrees with this viewpoint: second generation migration can no longer be postponed or put off."
"We need effective and efficient instruments for coordinating information on and controlling those who enter and travel within the Schengen system."
"For this reason, I join Mr Coelho in emphasising the need for the Commission to implement the new second generation SIS system as soon as possible."
"in writing. - Prior to the migration to the new SIS, it is necessary that the appropriate tests be carried out and that the necessary safeguards are in place."
"While I believe that the above should be carried out in a professional and thorough manner, I also share the rapporteur's disappointment with regard to the extended delays that are impeding migration to the new system."
"In addition, I feel that it is necessary for the Court of Auditors to be asked to take an in depth look into the management of this matter."
"The increased number of Member States has seriously complicated the process of transition, and migration between the Schengen Information System to the second generation Schengen Information System."
"Parliament has been demanding exact and up-to-date information on how this report is coming on, and rightly so."
"I hope that the migration takes place in the most effective way possible, that this change does not in any way damage Europe's security, and that it has a satisfactory outcome."
"I voted for this report since the question of refugees in the Community is still very relevant."
"At present, the issue of the resettlement of refugees in the European Union is not properly coordinated and only 10 Member States resettle refugees on a yearly basis, causing a lack of strategic use of resettlement as an EU external policy instrument."
"I welcome the Commission's decision to set up the European Asylum Support Office, which will be able to offer support to the Member States in carrying out resettlement initiatives, while ensuring coordination of policies within the EU."
"The EU is participating far less than the United States and Canada in the reception and resettlement of refugees from third countries."
"I voted for the European Parliament's own-initiative report on the establishment of a joint EU resettlement programme."
"The latter demands that an ambitious and sustainable resettlement programme be established within the EU and proposes financial support for Member States ready to participate in this."
"This report also indicates our disagreement with the Council's vision."
"The latter wishes to take refugees' nationality as the basis for deciding who has priority to be resettled."
"In addition to the geographical origin of refugees, we would like a category of 'vulnerable refugees' to be established (women and children exposed to violence and exploitation, unaccompanied minors, people in need of medical care, torture victims, and so on)."
"The latter must always have priority."
"It is essential that the European Union has a fair and realistic migration policy."
"I therefore welcome this effective, sound and sustainable resettlement programme, providing a durable solution for refugees who cannot return to their country of origin."
"The resettlement programme may help to make illegal immigration less attractive to refugees seeking to enter the European Union."
"The success of an effective resettlement programme requires access to job opportunities for adults and immediate integration of minors in schools."
"For this reason, access to educational and professional guidance services is essential."
"The follow-up measures must be undertaken by various entities of the public sector (for example, municipalities) and civil society, as well as NGOs, charities, schools and social services; it is essential to promote cooperation between entities."
"I call on Member States to promote the creation of private funding mechanisms and more widespread public-private initiatives so as to underpin the European resettlement programme."
"It is positive that the number of Member States participating in these resettlement programmes has been increasing in recent years."
"Nonetheless, only 10 Member States resettle refugees on a yearly basis, without any coordination among themselves or a joint EU resettlement programme."
"It is important that the Member States show solidarity with each other and fairly share responsibility for compliance with international obligations."
"An effective and sustainable European resettlement programme will bring benefits for the refugees being resettled, for the Member States, and for the EU itself by giving it a leading role in the international humanitarian field."
"A multilateral approach is desirable, involving all the relevant actors at local level and without forgetting the fundamental role played by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees."
"An effective EU resettlement programme must provide lasting protection and solutions, as well as the creation of mechanisms for cooperating and coordinating between the Member States."
"Such a programme must allow the exchange of best practices, create a joint strategy and reduce the costs of resettlement operations."
"I support the suggestion by the rapporteur - Mr Tavares, whom I congratulate on an excellent report - to create a resettlement unit that makes it possible to coordinate and facilitate resettlement processes."
"The draft regulation applying to the EU programme for managing and regulating resettlement will, as a matter of priority, resolve the settling and adaptation of refugees in their new environment."
"Humanitarian catastrophes and other unforeseeable events can unleash a wave of refugees, to which we must be able to respond jointly, within an EU framework."
"However, I completely reject refugees seeking asylum on political grounds within the EU."
"I cannot imagine that it would be legally acceptable in any EU Member State to persecute a citizen for political reasons."
"The participation of local authorities in a resettlement programme should always be on a voluntary basis, as is the case with Member State participation."
"Some countries are used to having increased numbers of foreigners in the local population, but for others of course, it is something new."
"In order to avoid phobias and concerns about foreigners in some countries or regions, we should respect their interest or lack of interest in participating."
"It would also be appropriate, for the sake of the conformity and complementarity of the EU resettlement programme with other asylum-related EU policies, to coordinate the proposed programme within an EASO framework."
"Despite the previously mentioned reservations, I back the entire report."
"The resettlement of refugees has been proving necessary in cases where the receiving third countries are unable to provide them with safety and a livelihood so that they can settle there."
"That is why various entities that are active on the ground are feeling the need for this problem to be fought at European level, and the joint EU resettlement programme proposed by the Commission could be the appropriate means of tackling this."
"Irrespective of which model wins out in the end, it is clearly urgent for the Member States to cooperate more with each other and with first-settlement countries in order to provide a lasting, sustainable and interconnected solution to this serious humanitarian problem."
"European citizens should not be deceived by the title of this report: by resettlement."
"We are not talking about some aid package or other for the repatriation of immigrants, but about the reception, on EU territory, on the recommendation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, of people who have already sought asylum in a third country - the first country of asylum or refuge that, for some reason or another, does not suit them or does not suit the United Nations."
"This is an incredible new incentive for socio-economic immigration that is disguised under cover of an application for international protection, while a European Asylum Support Office will be increasingly responsible for distributing applicants across the EU, whether we like it or not."
"How can we trust the UN and the first countries of asylum to organise such a check?"
"How can we tolerate the fact that a European agency is telling Member States who they have to accept on their territory and under what status?"
"According to the UNHCR, there are 750 000 people in the world who could claim asylum."
"Do we have to receive all of them in our countries, on the orders of this organisation? This is completely irresponsible."
"Only 10 EU Member States, including Portugal, accept refugees for resettlement."
"This situation must be changed, and solutions and incentives found to make the majority of Member States start accepting the resettlement of refugees."
"The creation of this programme constitutes an important step in that direction."
"It will also contribute to increasing the EU's involvement in resettlement at global level, and so also have an impact on the EU's ambition to play a leading role in world humanitarian issues and the international stage."
"Allow me to express my support for the report by Mr Tavares."
"As I stressed with regard to the setting up of a European Fund for refugees, the problem requires a European line of action and approach."
"I believe that procedures for conferring refugee status should be harmonised to achieve this end."
"We cannot have discrepancies over this definition at European level."
"A common concept would prevent the 'migration' of refugees within European States, while allowing more appropriate management."
"It therefore seems to me that a common programme would take us in the right direction."
"Finally, an efficient EU resettlement programme should provide protection and lasting solutions, not only for long term refugee situations, but also for the need for swift and appropriate responses in emergency situations, or situations of sudden urgency."
"Approval of the European resettlement programme for refugees from third countries in Member States of the EU is a step in the right direction and, of course, I voted in favour of the report for which I acted as rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"In fact, it is very important to build solidarity between the EU and third countries on refugee issues."
"However, we shall soon need to be bold and show the same solidarity within the EU by creating an internal refoulement programme, in order to mitigate the disproportionate pressure on certain Member States, compared with others."
"The pilot programme in Malta is a very good example in this direction."
"It is good that a joint EU resettlement programme has been established."
"The number of refugees who need to be resettled is growing, in contrast to the number of places available to accept them."
"However, the Member States which receive refugees are often among the poorest, and their resources do not allow them to accept a large number of people."
"Resettlement should be treated as a last resort - the only solution when refugees cannot return to their own country and cannot find a safe haven in a third country."
"The Member States should adopt a more ambitious programme which will ensure the quality and effectiveness of resettlement."
"We need to support the creation of mechanisms of private financing and the adoption of more frequent public and legal initiatives to strengthen the European resettlement programme."
"Particular attention should be given to the human resources needed in the current and future EU resettlement programme so that a procedure can be introduced which will enable good practices concerning adaptation and integration of refugees into the receiving society."
"The objective is to establish a joint EU resettlement programme, so that thanks to the closer cooperation of governments of EU Member States, the number of people resettled can be increased and their situation in the EU improved."
"Every effort should be made for more EU Member States to join the EU resettlement programme, which will initiate political and practical cooperation between Member States for the permanent protection of foreigners."
"in writing. - I voted yes to these reports, as agreed also with the rapporteurs during our debates in the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"The report, which I hope the vast majority of you will vote for, is an evaluation of the progress made in Europe on education and training policies in the period 2007-2009."
"The report also discusses the challenges identified by the 'New Skills for New Jobs' initiative."
"The result shows that there is still too much lacking in the training of our young people, both in terms of preparation for the new sectors of the economy and in terms of giving them the skills to develop in a context in which Europe and the world are increasingly open and increasingly interdependent."
"The 2020 strategy reflects the importance of training and education for successfully tackling the social and economic challenges facing us in the next decade."
"Therefore, in the context of an EU economic crisis, I want to stress the importance of preserving education and training budgets at national and Union level."
"I supported this report, since I believe that we must improve the quality of education and training in the EU."
"Unfortunately, the guidelines identified in the Lisbon Strategy will not be implemented until the end of 2010."
"Despite progress in recent years, many European citizens are still not yet sufficiently skilled and one third of the population of Europe have very low-level educational qualifications."
"Also of concern is the fact that an increasing number of young people are leaving school early and do not acquire any qualifications later."
"I think that it is very important to begin to implement as soon as possible a policy aimed at raising the quality of education and training in the Member States."
"The European Commission, Member States and employers should cooperate closely with education and training providers, to ensure a higher level of education and broader scope in order to meet the demands of professional sectors and the labour market."
"I voted in favour of the report on implementing the 'Education and training 2010' work programme because the report includes some very important passages, which I hope can find specific application in the sphere of EU policies and then be implemented in full by the Member States."
"I am referring particularly to the points on vocational training and the link between training processes and the needs of the job market."
"From this point of view, for the future of both our education system and our economic system, which is made up almost entirely of SMEs, one hopes that the need to strengthen the connection between institutions, particularly vocational training institutions, and the world of enterprise, will be recognised."
"The idea of fostering the establishment of forms of partnership between national and local production businesses, on the one hand, and the world of training, on the other, is without doubt a good one: this would allow schools to be more successful in coordinating training programmes with real local needs and the economic world that reflects those needs, not to mention the fact that the idea would also help schools to overcome the perennial problem of finding suitable resources for providing young people with high quality training that they can put to immediate professional use."
"I voted for this report, because this is an appropriate time to review the education and training objectives that were laid down in the Lisbon Strategy and to evaluate what was unsuccessful in this area."
"I am pleased that one of the most important objectives in the new Europe 2020 strategy is to improve the level of education, reduce the number of people leaving school without qualifications and increase the number of people with higher education or equivalent."
"Firstly, I would like to highlight the fact that due to the rapid development of information and new technologies, the educational environment is becoming increasingly complicated and varied and it is necessary to adapt to new needs in a changing world."
"Therefore, it is necessary to reform and improve curricula in schools and universities, taking into account the needs of the changing market."
"Secondly, I call for more efforts to increase literacy and encourage skills upgrading for people from disadvantaged backgrounds."
"One of this programme's most important objectives is the modernisation of vocational education and training (VET) and higher education."
"In other words, closer relations with the world of business are increasingly needed and it is crucial to develop new, more attractive qualification perspectives and mobility opportunities for students enrolled in VET."
"I am delighted that the European Parliament has drawn significant attention to the fact that we must facilitate the integration of people with disabilities in the areas of education and training."
"I also agree that we must allocate appropriate funding in order to ensure the integration of people with disabilities in the area of training."
"Quality education and training are a must in terms of personal fulfilment of the individual, equality, fighting social exclusion and poverty, active citizenship and social cohesion."
"It is essential to improve the quality of education and training for all students in order to attain better results and competences."
"That is the only way to implement the renewed social agenda for opportunities, access and solidarity, and help to create more and better jobs."
"Mobility between higher education institutions, the business world and vocational education and training must be promoted in order to promote student-centred learning and the acquisition of competences, entrepreneurship, intercultural understanding, critical thinking and creativity."
"I also call on the Member States to modernise the agenda of higher education and, in particular, to coordinate curricula with the demands of the labour market"
"Since the Lisbon Strategy, education and training policies have been becoming increasingly important within the European Union."
"I therefore welcome this report in general and, very especially, the Commission communication 'Key competences for a changing world'."
"Nevertheless, I am concerned about the mismatches between skills levels acquired at school and the requirements of the labour market in the European Union."
"A clear commitment to professional training and lifelong learning will contribute much to the success of the 'New Skills for New Jobs' initiative, as will the development of transversal key skills such as digital competence, the ability to learn, social, civic, sporting and artistic competences, a sense of entrepreneurship and cultural awareness."
"In order for the coming generations to be able to overcome the current gap between acquired skills and the needs of the market, I therefore believe it to be essential for preschool teaching to be of high quality as an instrument for early acquisition of essential skills."
"I also see primary and secondary education focused on the development of more specific skills as essential, for example, mastering foreign languages and adapting to the needs of communities in which schools are located."
"Higher education that is coordinated with the needs of the labour market, companies and society in general is also crucial."
"I voted for the report on key competences for a changing world: implementation of the Education and Training 2010 work programme."
"Despite some improvements, we are still a long way off achieving the goals on education and training set out in the Lisbon Strategy."
"This report analyses what went wrong and proposes challenges that have yet to be overcome, such as better linkup between teaching, professional training and lifelong learning systems."
"Having worked in government in the area of education in my country, I find it deeply regrettable to see it continually wrongly classified in practically all indicators relating to these subjects."
"I fear that these unfavourable results are, in large measure, the result of an ideology of learning that seems to be completely absent from the Commission's communication and Parliament's resolution: in these, not once can the words 'merit', 'rigour', 'effort', 'concentration' and 'discipline' be seen, and 'knowledge transfer' and 'memorisation' are seen as less important than the issue of 'aptitudes' and 'attitudes' based on 'essential competences'."
"It would be useful if governments stopped worrying about statistics and instead tackled the root of the problem, abandoning methods involving a lot of talking, taking away responsibility from all the people involved in the education process and statistical camouflage."
"They must instead adopt methods focused, above all, on scientific content and cognitive processes; on effective learning and teaching."
"There must be less focus on stating shared positions that are as hollow as they are well intentioned."
"Given the generally positive content of the resolution, I will vote for it, but not without registering my profound disagreement with this interpretation of what the education system should be."
"Education and training issues are clearly of the greatest significance, given the never-ending advances of science and technology, and the increasing incorporation of scientific and technical knowledge into productive processes."
"It is in this context that the report under discussion considers it 'vital to introduce policies seeking to improve the quality of education and training'; naturally, we share this concern."
"However, in voicing this concern, it does not even make the necessary mention of the importance of state schools in pursuing this goal, nor is there reference to the consequences of the lack of investment in public schools, or the exclusion of many young people from access to education and training; it chooses instead to make a mistaken and ambiguous reference to strengthening 'cooperation of the public and private spheres'."
"As regards higher education, the Bologna Process does not put forward any solution for the necessary improvements to education: on the contrary, in countries like Portugal, it has made it worse, not least the state system."
"We cannot fail to point out and condemn the advocating of 'flexibility', pushing young people into insecure, uncertain, intermittent and poorly paid work."
"We also disagree with the concept of volunteer work as a substitute for jobs, exacerbating the exploitation of young people seeking to enter the world of work."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues can agree with much of this report."
"We remain supportive of attempts to develop lifelong learning strategies and to promote vocational education and training (VET) and the better integration of key competences such as foreign language learning, mathematics and science."
"And we believe that the most important element is to ensure that labour markets are flexible enough to ensure that young people can gain employment."
"However, we cannot support the reference in this report for all migrant children to be taught in their mother tongue."
"It is our belief that this will be extremely unworkable, costly and inefficient, particularly in schools which have children from many diverse linguistic backgrounds and would do little to foster integration of migrants into local communities."
"In addition, education policy is, and should remain, the preserve of individual nation states."
"For this reason, we voted against this report."
"Following the 2000 Lisbon Strategy, a series of initiatives has been implemented aimed at reaching the strategic goal set by the European Council of Europe 'becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010'."
"Commitment to education and training is essential and must involve improving the quality and effectiveness of education systems in Europe."
"A commitment must be made to training teachers and educators, providing access to education and training systems for all, making the teaching process more attractive, opening up education and training systems to the rest of the world, and promoting stronger links with the world of work."
"The standardisation of objectives in a Framework for Key Competences was an important step towards achieving the goals proposed for 2010, which were not, however, fully achieved."
"From the point of view of reviewing and assessing the work done up to now, this document becomes even more important if it is viewed from the perspective of preparing recovery strategies in order to achieve objectives initially proposed for the education sector, taking into account the new proposal for strategic framing of European cooperation in this sector: Education and Training 2020."
"Education is important, but the reality is that a good education and training has, for quite some time, been no guarantee of employment, let alone a good job."
"Instead of investing money in appropriate qualification schemes, the plan is to ship lowly qualified staff into the EU using all possible kinds of card solutions, with transitional deadlines in the labour market to be dismissed as unnecessary."
"In the context of the basic conditions referred to, the training programme is not adequate, for which reason I voted 'no'."
"The recognition that education and training are essential for a knowledge-based society, and for the future economy, is no longer a myth."
"These things represent the basis of our society and the foundations for our own future and that of generations to come."
"Education (pre-school, primary, secondary and higher) and professional quality training are indispensable if we are to respond to the challenges that Europe must face, including under the EU 2020 strategy."
"I support the communication system which mentions various strategies that could be implemented, such as supporting the development of teachers' competences, updating assessment methods and introducing new ways of organising learning."
"I express my support and I congratulate the rapporteur for the sensitivity she has shown in drawing up the report."
"I voted in favour of the report on key competences for a changing world: implementation of the Education and Training 2010 work programme."
"The text presents a global approach to upgrading and adapting education to modern requirements."
"Identifying the reasons which led to the failure of the objective of the Bologna Process on the convergence of higher education between the Member States, the importance of adapting education systems, in order to prepare European societies so that they can exit the economic crisis and resume sustainable growth, and the importance of the penetration of new technologies at all levels of education, are key points for the education system of tomorrow."
"That is why I tabled amendments to that effect, which were adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education."
"in writing. - I am very glad that today, we adopted the report led by my Catalan colleague from the S&D Group, Maria Badia i Cutchet, on the very important issue of seeing education and training as key competences for a changing world."
"I voted in favour of this report and would like to recall the importance of the basic skills that every European must acquire."
"The number of young people unable to read properly by the age of 15 is steadily increasing (21.3% in 2000 and 24.1% in 2006)."
"With a European strategy focused on quality jobs and a smart economy, this knowledge gap is something that will marginalise an ever-greater section of the population."
"The Member States must integrate this priority to acquire basic skills (reading, writing, arithmetic) into their educational programmes before their pupils specialise."
"Moreover, the learning of foreign languages is crucially important."
"As an English teacher, I am particularly aware of this."
"The fact that some European countries have fallen behind in the teaching of foreign languages closes many doors to students, at a time when jobs are becoming increasingly international in scope."
"Finally, the adaptation of educational models to the new professions of the green economy or the digital economy is a major challenge for education in Europe."
"For that reason, assistance for lifelong learning is the key to a career path that is flexible and adapted to the jobs of the future."
"I endorsed the report on the Education and Training 2010 programme with pleasure and with hope for rapid implementation of the programme's ideas."
"As an academic teacher and a professor with many years of experience, I pay particular attention to the necessity of creating greater mobility between institutions of tertiary education, the world of business and vocational education and training."
"Modern higher education should prepare students thoroughly with a view to entering the labour market."
"As well as the right knowledge, competences such as entrepreneurship, intercultural understanding and creativity are becoming increasingly significant, and are playing a decisive role, on a par with formal training, in the achievement of professional success."
"From this point of view, therefore, education is very important."
"It is also essential to adopt effective measures to increase the representation of women in science and scientific research."
"On this matter, I have already asked the European Commission for an opinion and to consider the possibility of establishing special programmes to create equal opportunities for women in science."
"Taking into account the alarming statistics on the qualifications of Europeans - including, among others, the fact that 77 million people, or nearly one third of Europe's population between the ages of 25 and 64, either have no formal qualifications or very low qualifications - I consider this report to be extremely important for promoting science and raising vocational qualifications."
"In relation to this, I appeal to the EU's Member States and the Commission for effective realisation of the ideas of the programme."
"Education has important social functions, opens doors and offers prospects for a better future."
"Therefore, we must make every effort to help in the education of young people through EU programmes and grants combined with national measures."
"In an era of globalisation, increased competition and rapid change, it is important to participate in lifelong learning."
"Thanks to student exchanges, such as Erasmus, our young people are not only furthering their knowledge in specific subject areas, but are also broadening their horizons."
"Experiencing new cultures and languages and making international contacts leads to the creation of more solid bonds within Europe and helps in creating the European identity."
"Europe's ambition is to be at the forefront in terms of research and development, innovation and new technological solutions which enable better management of energy resources."
"Our hopes are pinned on young people, so we have to treat this group as a priority."
"Young people who have completed their university education find it difficult to enter the labour market because employers very often emphasise professional experience, which young people do not have at that stage of their lives."
"For this reason, we need to promote dialogue between universities and businesses, adapt courses of study to the needs of the labour market and emphasise placements and practical experience which will make it easier to find work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the belts being tightened throughout Europe - as a painful and severe measure - are beginning to have an impact."
"Victims and compromises have already become part of daily life in many EU sectors, but it is important (particularly during the economic recession) that we do not neglect our commitments in such fundamental areas of policy as education."
"As history has shown, education is a thing worth fighting for - whether in the underground educational institutions of Nazi-occupied Europe, or in the dissidents' 'flying university' in the Stalin era."
"The global economic crisis means that we are being forced to adapt once again."
"Vocational education and training must be adapted to the needs of the labour market."
"Europe's literacy rate must be improved, since in this area, Europe is far behind the United States and Japan."
"We must fill the gap."
"Not only is it important to raise the level of literacy, numeracy and computer literacy among young people, but also that of unemployed adults belonging to the lower socio-economic class."
"Lifelong learning from the cradle to the grave, as well as so-called 'second chance' programmes for adults with limited abilities, are not only important for stimulating the economy and the labour market, but also for social inclusion and active citizenship."
"It is our duty to raise the level of the quality of training throughout Europe and make education appear more attractive."
"That is a long-term struggle, but it is something worth fighting for."
"The administration and management of commercial companies is an area which raises new concerns, especially during the current crisis, even though it has been subject to constant regulation."
"In fact, making managers accountable, and I am not only referring here to administrators, is an absolute necessity in the context where we are intending to reduce systemic risks."
"In the case of corporations operating in strategic sectors, with either a large turnover or a significant market share, the financial problems which such corporations may encounter obviously go beyond the simple interest of shareholders, entering into the realm of 'stakeholders', in other words, creditors, employees, consumers, the relevant industry or state."
"In this situation, the amendment being proposed by myself about making members of the Board of Directors accountable by forcing a percentage of this body's members to be professionals supports the reduction in systemic risks as, at the moment, it is no longer enough to be a representative of the shareholder as long as, just as I showed, the benefit to the financial health and stability of certain corporations exceeds the strict investment benefit in the form of ownership of share capital."
"In addition, in order to encourage shareholder involvement in these corporations, which is passive in many cases when the proportion of capital held is too small, electronic voting should be regulated."
"The governance of companies and their ethics is a critical issue, particularly in the current situation in which many shareholders are suffering losses on their investments because of violations of some of these principles."
"Good managers who are responsible and whose conduct is guided by ethics are central to the balanced decision-making process which leads companies to become competitive."
"When we talk about regulating certain ethical practices, we cannot forget the principle of private autonomy and that there must be a limit at which certain practices must be regulated."
"I also consider it essential for shareholders to participate more in and take more responsibility for ensuring that good administrators are rewarded by the market and that less ethical managers are punished, so that their practices do not harm the rights of shareholders or have a negative impact on the entire market."
"The recent financial crisis reinforced the need for us to look at deontological issues relating to managing companies in a more responsible way."
"Issues relating to remuneration regimes and governance arrangements with regard to the remuneration of the directors and managers of listed companies must be governed by ethical and deontological principles that do not allow situations such as those experienced in the recent past, with the awarding of management bonuses in companies that immediately afterwards filed for bankruptcy or were found to be in serious difficulties."
"The EU must have a productive, social and environmental model with a long-term outlook that respects everyone's interests: companies, shareholders and workers."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"I express my support for the report by Mr Lehne."
"The recent financial crisis has illustrated the need to analyse issues related to pay policies of company directors."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he suggests a method based on binding measures, aiming to avoid a situation where the variable payment element (bonus, shares, etc.) gives rise to investment policies that are too risky and too far removed from the state of the real economy."
"To this end, there seems to be a need for legislative measures, allowing us to resolve the problem of disparity between national regulations concerning payment for companies, especially in cases of cross-border mergers."
"It is necessary, particularly when it comes to the financial sector, to put ethical issues at the centre; not only from a moral viewpoint, but also and, above all, from a social viewpoint."
"In order to achieve this, we must introduce uniform and global guidelines."
"I voted in favour of the own-initiative report on deontological questions related to companies' management as, above all, I support the European Parliament's call for encouraging higher numbers of women to be assigned to management posts and the request for the European Commission to put forward a proposal to introduce a system for the filling of posts on company decision-making bodies, posts in other bodies and posts in general."
"At the same time, however, I regret the fact that my amendment, which would have made this an obligation, was not included in the final resolution."
"I would have liked to have seen the European Parliament make more ambitious demands."
"In connection with pay policy, I would also like to point out the serious differences that do prevail in reality and to emphasise that the principles laid down in the European directives of equal pay and equal treatment for men and women must be observed and nurtured."
"I advocate these fundamental principles being made mandatory in every Member State and believe that a system of sanctions should be introduced for non-compliance."
"I supported the report by Mr Papanikolaou because I am aware that the consequences of the economic and financial crisis have already reached and affected the fabric of society, especially young Europeans, exposing them to alarming rates of unemployment."
"I therefore believe that it is the duty of European institutions to establish a well-defined strategy that can make the most of existing training and mobility programmes (such as Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci), while also increasing the correlation between the supply of training, competences and the demands and needs of the labour market, in order to make the necessary transition between vocational and occupational training smoother and more secure."
"I agree with this resolution because as we shape the policies of today, we have a strong responsibility towards young people and future generations."
"The European Union possesses important tools relating to youth policies, yet these tools need to be fully exploited, communicated and integrated."
"I am concerned about the increasing numbers of young people who are unemployed, under-employed or have no job security, especially in the current economic crisis."
"It is very important to ensure a youth perspective in the post-2010 Lisbon and Europe 2020 strategies."
"I also support the proposal to develop appropriate measures targeted at young people in the recovery plans drawn up in the economic and financial crisis plans and to ensure better integration of young people into the employment market."
"The report, which I voted in favour of, contains interesting reflections and suggestions for developing constructive policies that aim to give young people in today's society a sense of responsibility."
"Young people face many challenges today if they are to make their way in the job market and in society."
"I agree with the basic premise of the report: Parliament could be a useful instrument for implementing European youth strategies, in view of its democratic roots and its resulting ability to gather the requests of young people on the ground and within Member States, and to bring their demands to the attention of Europe."
"I reiterate, as have other previous speeches, the importance of ensuring training pathways reflect local business patterns: only by doing this can we help the young people of today and tomorrow to enter the job market more easily and with greater satisfaction."
"Nowadays, jobs are still the main problem for millions of young people in Europe, especially during the current economic crisis, which has raised the youth unemployment rate to more than 20%."
"I also agree fully with the report's emphasis on the social and human importance of young people taking part in voluntary work as a factor in helping them achieve personal and collective growth."
"I voted for this report, since the preparation and implementation of the EU strategy for youth is very important, particularly at this time when the economic and financial crisis has had a negative impact on youth employment and still threatens their future prosperity."
"Since young people are Europe's future, it is our duty to help them by applying a well prepared strategy for youth."
"Therefore, above all, Member States need to safeguard the right of all children and young people to obtain state education and must provide everyone with the same opportunities for education, irrespective of their social background and financial situation."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that, as provided for in the new Europe 2020 strategy, it is necessary to take measures as soon as possible to reduce the number of students leaving school without qualifications."
"Only by creating more flexible learning conditions for all young people, and safeguarding for all the right to learn and study, can we create opportunities for young people to get a foothold in the labour market."
"I would also like to stress that it is necessary to prepare specific policy guidelines to implement employment policy and combat youth unemployment."
"It is very important to stimulate youth entrepreneurship and provide young people with more flexible conditions to take advantage of micro-credits and micro-finance facilities."
"The financial crisis has been having a serious impact on the lives of young people."
"I therefore welcome the renewed youth strategy, which puts the well-being of future generations on the political agenda."
"As the knowledge triangle is a key element for growth and job creation, I would stress the importance of creating more opportunities for youth in education and employment through increased interaction between education, research and innovation."
"The Members of the European Parliament play a crucial role in promoting European youth policies in the Member States."
"I would draw your attention to the problem of early school-leaving and the need to ensure that a higher percentage of young people complete compulsory education."
"The European Parliament also plays an essential role in the formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of youth strategy."
"It is essential for Union programmes and funds to reflect Europe's ambitions for young people, and for the EU's policies, programmes and actions to be coordinated, with a view to an EU strategy for youth."
"in writing. - I voted in favour because, though the EU strategy for youth is, by its nature, a wide-ranging and all-encompassing document, it is crucial to reassert that any new strategy must place education at the centre of its ambition and policy."
"In the past, such an education policy would have correctly placed its emphasis on the need for all students in the EU to complete primary and second-level education."
"Thankfully, we have now come to the point where we can afford to cast our attention towards more ambitious goals."
"In the past two decades or so, many initiatives have been trialled which have been aimed at getting those from demographic groups traditionally disinclined towards university to attend third-level institutions."
"Some of these initiatives have been more successful than others, but in general, it remains the same social groups who make up the overwhelming majority of third-level students."
"This cannot be allowed to continue."
"If we are to truly address the poverty which remains but often goes unremarked in the EU, an effective system by which less-inclined areas of society start to become truly represented at third level must be achieved."
"I support Mr Papanikolaou's report on 'An EU Strategy for Youth - Investing and Empowering'."
"I agree with his call for the Member States to fully implement the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon in the area of youth policy, such as encouraging the participation of young people in democratic life, special attention for young sportsmen and sportswomen, and the legal enforcement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"I would stress the important role of the Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci programmes in the development of European education and training policies."
"I urge the Commission to prioritise instruments that improve young people's qualifications and increase opportunities to work and, especially, to develop 'Erasmus first job'."
"I agree with combating the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco and other forms of addiction, including gambling."
"I would stress the role of informing young people about sex education issues in protecting their health."
"I would highlight the importance of volunteering activities and, as the Portuguese Social Democratic Youth Movement (JSD) has always argued, giving young people central responsibilities in conceiving and implementing youth policies at European, national and regional level."
"Investment in youth policies is essential to the future of European societies, particularly at a time when the number of young people in the general population continues to decrease."
"I welcomed receipt of the 'EU strategy for youth', in which information on the situation of young people of Europe was collected for the first time, as well as the three priorities for youth set by the Commission."
"Creating more opportunities for youth in education and employment, improving access and full participation of all young people in society, and fostering social inclusion and solidarity between society and young people, are fundamental aims for an effective European youth policy that is capable of contributing to the development of a European mentality."
"Nonetheless, the existence of different definitions of 'youth' in the various Member States, as well as the fact that youth policy is covered by the principle of subsidiarity, show the problems involved in effectively implementing the instruments of youth policy."
"Strong desire and great commitment from the governments of the Member States are requirements for renewed European cooperation on youth in order to produce concrete results, as is the urgent strengthening of the open method of coordination."
"I voted for the report on 'An EU Strategy for Youth - Investing and Empowering'."
"The financial crisis is mortgaging, at least in the short term, the professional futures of millions of young people throughout the European Union, essentially because of the increased difficulty in entering the labour market."
"We urgently need to ensure that training measures ensure a better match of skills and the demands of the labour market, thus promoting young people's autonomy and economic independence; otherwise, we run the risk of squandering young people's talent."
"At a time when Europe is struggling through the largest, most serious economic and financial crisis of recent decades, it is essential that the European strategy for youth that we are now discussing be focused on the problems which the crisis has caused and which especially affect young people."
"Of these problems, we would stress the high rate of youth unemployment; the difficulty of getting into the labour market; low pay; the inadequacy of formal training from schools and universities for the demands of working life; and the difficulty of reconciling starting work, which is always difficult, with family life."
"These are concerns that must be present in any European strategy for youth."
"Policies and strategies that enable Europeans to adapt better and quicker to the challenges of the twenty-first century - especially in a crisis situation - must also be sought."
"I would especially stress the importance of measures that give education its due importance, those that aim towards the acquisition of new skills, and those that stimulate creativity and entrepreneurship."
"Finally, I believe that in order to successfully achieve the proposed objectives, it is necessary to strengthen coordination between the various agents involved in pursuing the strategy for youth."
"A commitment to young people is made through a good education system that gives absolute priority to the problems of early school-leaving and illiteracy, and that supports equal access for all young people to high quality education and training at all levels."
"We also advocated the promotion of opportunities for lifelong learning."
"Given the high rates of unemployment to which Europe's young people are exposed, and as young people with poor qualifications are more likely to be unemployed, it is essential to ensure that they receive the best possible training, which guarantees them prompt access to, and a long-term stake in, the labour market. The first job is very important."
"That is why we proposed an 'Erasmus first job' scheme, which was approved; we are waiting for the Commission to follow up this proposal."
"The EU should better inform, develop and implement the instruments that it already has at its disposal."
"Young people must be called on to participate more, not least in building the recycling society and in the objective of combating climate change, to which they have already been generously contributing, as a matter of fact."
"We believe that this report takes the correct point of view in approaching young people's problems as something that cuts across several sectors of society."
"By doing so, it identifies specific problems in several areas: education and training; employment; health; well-being and the environment; culture; and others."
"These problems include, amongst others: school leaving; insecure and precarious jobs; unpaid work placements; the brain drain; environmental degradation; drug dependency; and social exclusion."
"Although the rapporteur presents some proposals to solve these problems which seem fair to us and deserve our support, there are others that are clearly inadequate; some are even ambiguous and others go so far as being contradictory."
"We cannot accept, for example, that a Europe 2020 strategy that is 'more focused on young people' can adopt insecure or intermittent employment as 'strategic' solutions for young people; both of these concepts are present in the aforementioned strategy, which also advocates competitiveness as a possible way out of the crisis."
"As in other areas, harmonisation achieved through social progress and not by everyone ending up with the same, low standard of living is required here."
"Some countries - including Portugal - have included a broad range of youth rights in their constitutions; it is important for these to be implemented and not restricted."
"Unemployment, temporary work, internships."
"What kind of prospects await the younger generation?"
"What life expectations?"
"How must they feel, being forced to stay at home and be supported by their parents, and not even able to think of starting a family?"
"Working intermittently, often underpaid, and doing jobs that are far below their level of education."
"No prospects of a pension."
"What does the future hold in store for them?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is young people who are bearing the brunt of this crisis."
"They are disillusioned and alarmed by the possibility that they will be cut out of the job market."
"There is no point hiding behind good intentions and promises."
"Young people are asking for facts. And it is our duty to give them proper answers."
"We must invest; we must provide certainties, offer opportunities."
"The world of work is changing, and we must create conditions whereby young people are the first to adapt to these changes, making the most of new technology, and following educational pathways that are appropriate for the new needs."
"We must redouble our efforts; we must put young people at the centre of our European policies."
"If there is no future for young people, there is no future for society as a whole."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the report on the new youth strategy, as I believe that the future of Europe is the young people today."
"We need to take action now to ensure that young people are best prepared for their life ahead and best equipped to face the challenges."
"I urge the Member States to take the new youth strategy seriously and implement the proposed measures vigorously."
"The youth strategy needs to feed into the personal and professional development of each young person in Europe by providing them with the means to learn at home and abroad, through formal, non-formal and informal learning."
"The strategy should also serve to empower young people and increase their participation in society."
"Furthermore, no policy can truly function without cross-sectoral implementation."
"All relevant actors across sectors need to work together to make the strategy a success."
"Although youth policy in Europe is carried out at national level, we need to learn from each other and set examples."
"Making the national reports public is a crucial step in getting closer to our young citizens, but also in learning from each other through best practices and from possible challenges."
"The global economic crisis is just one of the factors contributing to a change in the behaviour and living conditions of young people in Europe."
"This must sound an alarm bell for both Member States and the European Union as a whole."
"We have been witnessing for some time now in Europe a declining population, with the dramatic consequences this entails for our economies and social welfare systems."
"It is a source of concern that young people are getting married increasingly later and having ever fewer children at a late age."
"At the same time, they are not being provided with adequate conditions for developing theirs skills and taking an active involvement in society."
"Education, employment, social inclusion and health are the major concerns of the young generations, but these pose challenges for Member States."
"This is precisely the reason why I voted for the draft report compiled by Mr Papanikolaou."
"I firmly believe that the amendments which we have proposed will make a significant contribution to the task of devising policies aimed at young people, by allowing them to make decisions independently and supporting their personal initiatives, equal access to education for disadvantaged young people and their inclusion in the labour market later on."
"I believe that the partnership with the mass media aimed at raising the profile of the European programmes and projects for young people is a key factor in helping us achieve our objectives."
"The EU strategy for youth has become increasingly important and must now be faced up to as one of the Union's political priorities, given that young people make up 20% of the total population."
"The objectives are clear and defined, and are connected with areas as important as the creation of more employment opportunities or encouraging young people to play a more active part in society."
"In the situation of economic and financial crisis that we are currently experiencing, combined with the problem of ageing, young people are one of the most vulnerable groups."
"I therefore advocate an ever greater commitment to youth policies at EU level."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"Young people, in particular, are especially hard hit by the current crisis."
"In the face of rising youth unemployment, it is important to improve educational opportunities."
"While we at EU level are still talking about promotion, the Member States are already making cuts in the funding for universities."
"If we really want to help the youth, we need to rein in the phenomenon of 'eternal trainees'."
"These measures are, at best, a declaration of intent but, given the conditions in these times of crisis, they are scarcely enough to actually achieve anything."
"I have therefore abstained from voting."
"I voted for this document as I am myself part of that same younger generation shaping the future of the EU and I am concerned about the sort of future that awaits me and people of my generation."
"At present, unemployment is one of the main problems facing young people in my country of Lithuania and in other EU Member States and we are already beginning to refer to today's young people as the lost generation of this era."
"Another problem is the incompatibility of the education system with the needs of the labour market."
"Although we agree with the Communication from the Commission on an EU strategy for youth, I am concerned that, like many of the other strategies we have adopted, it may never be anything more than a set of fine declarations on paper."
"We, the European Parliament, other EU institutions, the Member States have to understand that unless we care about young people today, it may be that none of our other strategies, including EU 2020, are ever implemented, as there will not be anybody left to implement them."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission, the other competent institutions and the Member States to take specific action as soon as possible so that this strategy becomes a reality."
"I voted in favour of European Parliament resolution No concerning the report on 'An EU Strategy for Youth - Investing and Empowering', because defining a strategy for young people is extremely important today."
"The young section of European society is faced by many challenges which will have to be tackled in the near future."
"The economic crisis and the ageing of society are undoubtedly important and urgent questions, and they mainly concern those who are going to build the future."
"What we ought to do, and what in fact we must do, is to create equal opportunities and equal access for all those who will begin their adult life in a few years, and also for those who are beginning their adult life today."
"Unfortunately, there are many young and talented people who, for a variety of reasons, have been left behind."
"We should give them a second chance."
"Measures such as financial support for people who have completed university are essential for a smooth transition to the labour market."
"Unfortunately, the unemployment rate among young people is high, and inequalities in the labour market persist."
"There are definitely more problems than those I have mentioned."
"Therefore, I fully agree with the rapporteur that the 'present report constitutes a further step of a continuous effort."
"An effort that is our duty."
"An endless duty towards future generations.'"
"This is what is expected of us, today, and it is what we should do."
"I agree with the view expressed by Mr Papanikolaou."
"The creation of a new EU strategy for youth is of crucial importance."
"The main aim of the new strategy for youth should be to use existing instruments more effectively and to promote knowledge."
"It is possible to make progress by urging governments to cooperate more on this issue, regardless of the existing differences between national policies concerning young people."
"This is an essential factor when it comes to offering future generations of European citizens a promising future."
"The economic crisis is having profound effects on young people, and represents a threat to their future prosperity."
"The ageing population will also have a strong impact on their future."
"Given the many pressures to which young people are subject, the resulting duty to support them by means of an effective youth strategy, the fact that policies favouring the young are subject to the principle of subsidiarity and the fact that Member States' cooperation in this area is voluntary, it is crucially important that the new strategy should overcome the weak points of the previous strategy and provide concrete results."
"in writing. - Educating young people is a crucial task because if mistakes are made, and they are not corrected in time, they tend to have generational consequences and are liable to be repeated, thus bringing about further degradation."
"The trouble with our 'Strategies' is that, once elaborated, we become obsessed with implementation, thus neglecting the need to revisit and adjust them regularly."
"The current strategy on youth, essentially elaborated before the current crisis, is already facing a number of challenges: how to protect the young from the negative psychological impact of the current crisis; how to prepare them for tomorrow's world, not today's; how to ensure equal opportunity to education irrespective of income; how to separate 'mobility' from 'brain drain'; and how to balance 'virtual bonding' through the net with actual bonding and team spirit through collective action."
"These are 'strategic' challenges which need 'strategic' attention from decision makers in all EU countries."
"I voted for this report since its goal is to promote the active citizenship, social inclusion and solidarity of all young people."
"As regards youth policy, where subsidiarity is the rule, we must encourage the Member States to define common objectives and agendas, and to improve their cooperation and their exchange of good practice."
"This is a matter of urgency because we know that, in Europe, 1 in 4 15-year-olds cannot read properly."
"While we are discussing the 2011 budget, I am concerned about the gap between the ambitions of the report that we have just voted on and the 3.4% reduction in the 'Youth in Action' budget."
"Why cut a programme that aims precisely at developing a sense of citizenship, solidarity and tolerance among young Europeans?"
"I therefore hope that the 2020 strategy, which is based on a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy, will result in ambitious financial commitments to youth education and training, because in these times of systemic crisis, the medium-term survival of the EU is dependent on young people who are educated and mobilised by the European project."
"I endorsed the EU strategy for youth with complete conviction and with certainty as to its success."
"It is one of the key areas of the work of the Committee on Culture and Education, on which I serve."
"It is imperative to improve the situation of young people and their educational and vocational chances."
"Three matters are crucial in this regard."
"1."
"Young people in the EU, and also in Poland, are making good use of EU programmes, such as Comenius, Erasmus and Leonardo da Vinci."
"Therefore, it is very important to increase funding for these programmes and to recognise them as the basis for development of a multiannual EU strategy for youth."
"In the future, these programmes should receive greater financial support."
"Investment in the education of young people is the best possible use of the EU budget."
"I also appeal for improvement and full implementation of the Erasmus Mundus programme."
"2."
"As a socialist, I also stress the need to create equal opportunities for young people in their access to education."
"It is essential to give financial assistance to those who cannot afford to complete tertiary education."
"It is also important to help young people by making their access to the labour market easier."
"3."
"In view of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, I would like to draw attention to the obligations of Member States concerning implementation of the strategy, which includes encouraging young people to participate in democratic life, paying special attention to young sportsmen and sportswomen and the legal enforcement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The report adopted by the European Parliament is a thorough analysis of the multi-dimensional question of youth - a question which sometimes appears to be under-discussed or pushed into the background."
"Today's young people are going to create the Europe of the future, so we must make sure they develop properly, and we must help them make the best use of the opportunities the Union offers."
"Young people are a special kind of added value - they bring freshness and innovation, and can make Europe's social vision a reality, based on tolerance, diversity and equality."
"The question of young people acquires even greater significance in the context of the current situation - the economic crisis and demographic factors in Europe."
"Young people are more vulnerable to the adverse effects brought by the current economic situation."
"Unemployment in this group is almost twice as high as the overall rate, and the financial situation facing young people often forces them to give up their education, which can, as a result, lead to poverty and exclusion."
"In the context of an ageing population, instruments need to be found which will encourage young people to start a family."
"They often put off this decision because of their unfavourable financial situation, problems with finding work or the need to reconcile work with family life."
"As for questions of organisation and structures of cooperation in the area of young people, we should be more clear and specific."
"The question of young people is complex and requires the involvement of many policy areas."
"The resolution adopted today concerning the Commission communication on 'An EU strategy for youth' points us in the right direction based on an integrated approach to the problems and needs of young people."
"We expect that taking account of the interests of young people and future generations when formulating policy strategies at all policy levels will ensure efficient and effective resolution of the most urgent questions."
"For example, the continued high level of unemployment in this social group shows a lack of structural solutions, such as errors in education systems, which educate young people in isolation from the needs of the labour market."
"We need to encourage young people to be active in civil society, to be politically active and to stimulate them to enterprise."
"We must create the conditions for them to be creative in the area of culture and awaken an interest in art, science and new technologies."
"On the other hand, we should ensure young people protection from discrimination and run campaigns which promote pro-environmental ideas, while not forgetting the fight against drug abuse and other dependencies to which young people are particularly vulnerable."
"This is why, today, I was delighted to endorse the resolution prepared by Mr Papanikolaou."
"The 96 million young Europeans aged between 15 and 29 account for approximately 20% of the European Union's population."
"The unemployment rate among young people hit the 20% mark at the start of the year, due to the economic crisis, while the school dropout rate reached 17%, with young people in rural areas being mainly affected by this."
"In addition, young people are being increasingly offered temporary employment contracts, thereby reducing their chance of achieving financial stability and buying themselves somewhere to live."
"Young people are our future and we should be involving them more in the decision-making process at European level."
"They are the ones who should be planning and implementing along with us, contributing to the development of the society we live in."
"I call on the Commission and Member States to adopt urgently a specific strategy and measures to help young people become more involved in society."
"These measures should have the following objectives: providing non-discriminatory access to education enabling young people to acquire the skills they need to find a job which will provide them with a decent living, offering accessible child care services to facilitate the work-life balance and giving support to facilitate young people's entry into the labour market and to provide social housing for young people."
"The global economic crisis came as a painful blow to us all."
"The saddest thing is the fact that the strongest blow was borne by those on whom our future depends."
"The financial tsunami of the last few years has made most young people unemployed or underemployed."
"On the basis of this report, the unemployment rate among young people in most EU Member States has almost doubled in comparison with the working population."
"Now we have the chance to turn the crisis into an opportunity."
"We owe it to the future generation of Europeans."
"It is important for my country, Lithuania, together with most of its neighbours, to halt the ever-increasing brain drain of qualified workers."
"As the name of the report suggests, we can achieve that by investing and providing opportunities."
"Education and employment are the principal areas from an investment point of view."
"We need to facilitate a smoother transition between education and the labour market."
"However, the impact of this essential investment will be limited unless we provide our young people with opportunities."
"We must encourage our young people to become more active citizens both socially and politically."
"Voter turnout among young people is very low in Eastern Europe."
"Therefore, we must revive their interest in the political process."
"Civil society and the corresponding non-governmental organisations can support EU interests, for example, the 'My vote' project, which used innovative Internet technologies, contributed to the political awareness of young people."
"In addition, we must start a constructive dialogue with young people and youth organisations in Europe, free from the web of bureaucracy and technical jargon."
"in writing. - I supported the report on a European youth strategy as I believe it will prove vital in getting young people into full-time employment over the coming years."
"With 5.5 million Europeans under the age of 25 out of work, it is clear that an effective strategy to combat the problem is needed."
"The problem of youth unemployment is not only due to the economic crisis; employers are looking for people with professional experience."
"I fully agree with the suggestion that higher education should be more effectively linked with the labour market."
"Cooperation between Member States is key to dealing with the problems of youth unemployment, which can have both heavy social and economic costs."
"It was important to strengthen the protection of self-employed women."
"Mrs Lulling's report on equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity is a step in that direction."
"It provides for 14 weeks' maternity leave and social security cover for assisting spouses, which was not the case previously."
"Once again, the European Parliament is guaranteeing the protection of women in their work."
"As I share this vision, I voted for this report."
"Bearing in mind the need to repeal Directive 86/613/EEC on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, this proposed amendment represents a significant step forward, for the situation of the spouses of self-employed workers too."
"As regards social protection, it is being proposed that where there is a social protection system in place for self-employed workers, the Member State takes the necessary measures for spouses to be able to benefit from social protection in accordance with national law."
"Although the social protection of spouses is not mandatory, this proposal constitutes an important step, since in many Member States, spouses do not enjoy any form of social protection, mandatory or voluntary."
"Finally, there is provision in this proposal for maternity protection, although not for the assisting spouses of self-employed workers to have the same amount of maternity leave as that for salaried workers."
"However, they will have the right to an appropriate payment to enable them to cease their activities for at least 14 weeks and/or request a temporary substitution service."
"For the above reasons, I voted for this proposal."
"In order to overcome the economic recession, it is very important to invest in human capital and social infrastructure, creating the conditions for men and women to take advantage of all their opportunities."
"The European Union has now come close to the Lisbon Strategy objective of achieving a 60% employment rate for women by 2010, but female employment in the Member States is very uneven."
"Therefore, the Commission and the Member States must take effective measures to implement at the earliest opportunity the directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity."
"The issue of maternity protection for self-employed women and assisting spouses or recognised partners is very important."
"It must be recognised that they need to be granted an allowance enabling them to stop work for long enough to come safely through their pregnancy and physically recover after a normal confinement, and that the maternity allowance granted to women should be adequate."
"Therefore, I particularly agree with the rapporteur's opinion on the proposals at this directive's second reading."
"In addition, in the Commission's consultations on the new 2020 strategy, insufficient attention is given to the issue of gender equality."
"We must strengthen and integrate issues surrounding the gender equality dimension in the new strategy."
"I welcome the adoption of this directive that establishes a framework for the application in the Member States of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self-employed activity, or who contribute to carrying out such an activity."
"Women's reduced participation in self-employed work constitutes an inequality, in as far as family responsibilities seem to have a negative impact on the entrepreneurship of women in comparison with men."
"As regards collaborating spouses, lack of social security cover and non-recognition of their contribution to family businesses confers an unfair competitive advantage on some companies, so this initiative would guarantee equal conditions in Europe."
"It is essential to adopt measures to resolve the gender disparities in entrepreneurship, in order to better reconcile private and professional life."
"I call on Member States to ensure full equality in practice between women and men in professional life, with a view to promoting entrepreneurship initiatives amongst women."
"The directive of December 1986 has proven to be ineffective, as it has had quite unsatisfactory results according to its implementation reports."
"That is why it is urgent to proceed towards reinforcing the protection of motherhood for self-employed women and ensure equal treatment for women who work for themselves, including their assisting spouses."
"In Europe, 16% of the active population are self-employed, of which only a third are women."
"This figure is undoubtedly a result of the innumerable obstacles that businesswomen encounter, not least in terms of juggling their family and professional lives."
"However, if the 1986 directive did not achieve its goals, the current proposal also lacks ambition."
"It is regrettable that the potential of this directive has been reduced in order to reach a political compromise in the Council."
"Nevertheless, it may be considered a first step towards improving the current situation regarding the social protection given to self-employed workers and assisting spouses."
"Minimum rules have been created under which, for the first time, the right to maternity benefit will be recognised at Union level, enabling work to be interrupted for at least 14 weeks."
"The Swedish delegation within the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) yesterday (18 May 2010) voted against the recommendation for a second reading on the common position of the Council at the first reading with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and repealing Directive 86/613/EEC."
"It is crucial that the Member States work together to ensure equal treatment for men and women so that more women can become self-employed."
"On the other hand, we do not believe that it is the job of the EU to take decisions on equality policy, which have a far-reaching impact on the public finances of the Member States."
"That must be for all of the Member States to decide for themselves."
"Furthermore, we do not believe that women and men are being treated equally if only self-employed women (and not men) are to be guaranteed benefits and parental leave when they become parents."
"Finally, we would like to highlight the fact that greater equality is one of the EU's major challenges, and one where Sweden could give inspiration to the other Member States of the Union."
"In the current economic crisis, it is of the utmost importance that the self-employed be supported and encouraged."
"It has been well over two years since we debated the report on the situation of women in rural areas, when we urged for necessary updates to be made to social protection legislation."
"The Council is now submitting to us a new type of directive whose scope of application, however, is confined only to agriculture."
"I do not think that there are any grounds for this restriction."
"The situation of women in rural areas is extremely hard, especially in the new Member States, and we must be constantly and actively concerned by this."
"However, when we are talking about self-employed activities, we must not overlook those who are involved in gainful employment in handicrafts, trades, SMEs and the liberal professions."
"In addition, I think that those provisions proposed by the Council, which could allow Member States to limit access to social protection schemes, need to be avoided."
"In compliance with the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity, the directive, in the amended form proposed by Parliament, provides the necessary framework which is conducive to narrowing the disparities between women and men involved in self-employed activities."
"In this regard, I believe that, on the one hand, maternity protection is vital, based on the entitlement to a minimum of 14 weeks' leave and to maternity benefit."
"On the other hand, the right for spouses or life partners to legally set up a company is just as vital."
"As a staunch defender of human rights and the principle of equality, I would not undermine initiatives that aim to protect the rights of women in the labour market, as is the case with this report by my dear colleague, Mrs Lulling."
"As I have already said, 'Men and women need to be treated fairly, giving them the same rights but taking their respective needs into account."
"In the case of women, this is particularly pertinent in areas such as maternity support, the reconciliation of work and family life ... '."
"That is why I welcome the fact that I find, amongst other things, concern for the protection of maternity for self-employed workers here."
"Nonetheless, I am also a staunch advocate of the principle of subsidiarity and believe that many of the subjects being debated must remain under the Member States' jurisdiction."
"I welcome the efforts that the European Parliament has been making to strengthen social justice and gender equality mechanisms in the European Union."
"As well as being an incontestable principle of the civilised world, and not least in a Europe that sees itself as culturally and socially developed, ensuring the equal treatment of self-employed men and women - particularly as regards access to social protection mechanisms, above all, those relating to maternity - is becoming even more pressing and obvious during this long period of profound economic and social crisis."
"I would stress our concern that differences in treatment between areas of activity be eliminated, in the face of well known developments at the levels of both organisation and of tools and mechanisms of work or production."
"Workers must have the same criteria for accessing public social protection schemes, notably as regards contributions and privileges."
"I would also stress that this recommendation will definitely strengthen incentives to female business entrepreneurship."
"The European economy still has much to gain, and many developments to undergo, as a result of stronger and more inclusive participation by women."
"As someone who is particularly sensitive to issues of gender equality and equality in general, including equality of social rights, I welcome the adoption of this report."
"Indeed, it seems fundamental to me that the Member States should guarantee social protection for self-employed women and assisting spouses and that this protection should be equivalent to that of salaried women."
"This measure is about boosting the entrepreneurial activity of women in Europe, which is still too hesitant; and, above all, it is about allowing these women to benefit from maternity leave in the same way as women doing another type of job."
"Maternity leave must be guaranteed in all the Member States and for all women, regardless of their employment."
"Since this measure is subject to the principle of subsidiarity, let us hope that the Member States will do what has to be done to ensure that these men and women can reconcile family and professional life as quickly and as easily as possible."
"I would like to congratulate my fellow Member, Astrid Lulling, on the acceptance of her report, which represents an important step forward in resolving an extremely long-standing problem."
"The situation of spouses and life partners of self-employed workers - who contribute to the activities and earnings of the business without having the status of an employee or business partner - could not be satisfactorily addressed in the 1986 Council directive."
"Therefore, it was time to repeal the abovementioned legislation and draw up a new directive recognising the work of assisting spouses and putting them on a par in terms of social security protection with self-employed workers."
"Moreover, an important achievement of the rapporteur and the European Parliament is that, compared with the original Council recommendation, the scope of application is no longer confined solely to gainful self-employed activities in the agricultural sector, since this target group also works in small and medium-sized enterprises, for example, or in retail, where they constitute a majority."
"Although the Council did not accept several important recommendations made by the rapporteur and Parliament - leaving the provision of equal social protection for spouses and life partners up to Member States and allowing Member States to maintain restrictive provisions relating to certain schemes or levels of social security protection - nonetheless, the draft directive as a whole represents a significant step."
"I applaud the approval of the proposal for a directive on applying the rule of equality for treatment of men and women who are self-employed."
"At last, the European Parliament is expressing an opinion on the application of this principle, so symbolic of social and economic progress!"
"While respecting state prerogatives, I believe there is a need not only to formulate a minimum standard of protection for self-employed women-mothers, as well as for assisting spouses and recognised life partners, but also to make their degree of protection equal to that of women-mothers who are employed, as opposed to self-employed."
"It is hoped that the declaration of these rights will be followed by de facto respect for them, and that States will commit to introducing appropriate measures, especially for protecting self-employed women and assisting spouses during pregnancy and motherhood. We must fight discrimination in the workplace in all its forms in order to support female emancipation as well as that of men."
"The Commission's proposal seeks to ensure equal treatment for self-employed men and women."
"I therefore see the adoption of this text as an important and very positive step in moving closer to current European legislation on salaried workers, as the fundamental rights of equality and social protection are already protected, and the proposed amendments to the original text are moving in the direction of a general improvement as regards the protection of the spouses of self-employed workers, specifically with respect to the maternity allowance awarded to self-employed women and spouses or recognised partners of self-employed workers."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"I voted for this report, not just because it is important and will, I believe, affect millions of EU citizens."
"I know many artists, lawyers and other people who are self-employed and I know that very often, they are assisted by family members, usually a wife or children."
"The fact that they will now have a right to social protection will doubtless improve their material status, morale and drive to work."
"This is particularly important for Lithuania, because now at a time when the crisis has hit the Baltic States hard, the material status of many families borders on poverty."
"No longer can we look on from the sidelines as self-employed women or men with families experience social injustice."
"The adoption of this report is a clear signal to the governments of the EU Member States to support the spouses of self-employed people, to guarantee them the right to a pension, paid holidays, maternity or paternity leave and to help them reintegrate into the labour market."
"I wish to express my support for Mrs Lulling's report."
"The proposal is necessary because of the great gender divide that still exists in the self-employed sector and threatens to become even more pronounced."
"The proposal also considers that social protection should be provided for assisting spouses, who often make a substantial contribution to the business of self-employed workers, yet completely lack any such protection in many Member States."
"The proposal, which aims to provide incentives for women to gain access to the job market and to help in the fight against undeclared employment, brings three main changes to current Community law: the definition of 'assisting spouse' is changed to include couples who are not married, where they are recognised by national law; self-employed women and assisting spouses are granted the right to benefit on demand from paid maternity leave lasting at least 14 weeks."
"I voted for this report as I believed that adopting this directive is of paramount importance at European Union level, given the current economic and financial crisis we are going through."
"Taking into consideration the fact that in most Member States, assisting spouses do not enjoy the social security benefits of their spouse, I believed that, in the case where a Member State makes it obligatory for the self-employed to join a social security scheme, this should also be mandatory for their assisting spouses and life partners."
"The Council's position is regrettable in that it does not accept that it should be compulsory for spouses and life partners assisting self-employed workers to join the social protection schemes in those countries where they are recognised as having this status under national law."
"Given that the large majority are not members of such schemes, they are therefore unaware of the benefits provided by the social security schemes which cover illness, disability and old age."
"As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, I supported the position that self-employed women, spouses and life partners who decide to have children should enjoy social protection and paid leave and should not be prevented from receiving child allowance, as the Romanian Government is doing."
"in writing. - I am very glad of the fact that today, the European Parliament adopted its position in second reading on the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and repealing Directive 86/613/EEC."
"Women play an essential role in sustaining self-employed businesses as owners and assisting spouses or life partners."
"I welcome Parliament's decision on the application of the principle of equal treatment between women and men for self-employed workers and their spouses as an important part of EU legislation."
"in writing. - The ECR Group are strong proponents of working to bridge the gender gap for self-employed workers and their partners."
"We support the report's aim, in that we would like to see all countries of the EU offering support and social protection to self-employed workers."
"However, we do oppose this legislation being made at EU level."
"The ECR Group has always defended the principle of subsidiarity and strongly believes that Member States should take the lead role in creating and driving employment legislation and social policy."
"For these reasons, the ECR Group has abstained on amendments 1-17."
"Today, Parliament has reiterated the need to obtain a high level of consumer protection throughout the EU, and the importance of harmonising regulations concerning the labelling of textile products, making this obligatory for all items of clothing marketed in Europe."
"The implementation of a future regulation on the naming of textile products, as well as information on labels about materials, will simplify the existing regulatory framework, making it transparent, clear and advantageous for consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Consumers will be able to use labels to make informed choices about buying products, also based on ethical considerations, such as health, considerations of environmental impact, human rights, and the pay and conditions of workers employed in the manufacturing of textile products."
"Meanwhile, small and medium-sized enterprises, and the textile industry in general, will be able to protect the quality, design and innovation of their products, all of which will make them more competitive, not just in the European market, but also worldwide."
"The 'made in' labelling would enable consumers not only to obtain additional information about product characteristics, but would also help strengthen the economy by developing new products for many sectors, promoting employment and supporting the fight against counterfeiting as far as products from third countries are concerned."
"In this era of globalisation, when products are increasingly the result of a journey through an international assembly line, it is difficult to know their 'nationality'."
"In parallel to this phenomenon, consumers want to be able to make purchases in full knowledge of the facts, sometimes favouring articles coming from countries with higher quality standards or social and environmental standards."
"In this context, I decided to vote in favour of this report since it proposes to make country of origin labelling obligatory."
"In my opinion, this is essential information that must always be communicated to the consumer."
"I also support the idea of the European Commission preparing, two years from now, a report, or even a legislative proposal, aimed at the harmonisation of textile labels."
"Indeed, given the fact that we have shared the same market for decades, why is it that size systems and many other, equally important, items of information still vary from one Member State to another?"
"I voted for this regulation as I believe that it will provide more clarity both to textile manufacturers and consumers."
"I welcome the form of regulation chosen, which brings together the separate directives currently in force and so will reduce the administrative burden incurred by Member States when transposing into national legislation the technical adaptations required each time a new fibre name is added to the list."
"Nevertheless, I feel it is time we began to discuss a revision of the textile labelling system, which would not be an additional burden on manufacturers and would be clearly understood and accepted by consumers."
"Therefore, I support the proposals adopted in the regulation that the European Commission report should cover such issues as an EU-wide uniform size labelling system for clothing and footwear, an indication of any potentially allergenic or hazardous substances and issues of ecological and social labelling."
"Surprising though it may seem, the phrase 'made in', which we find on many clothes labels, is not compulsory today and its use varies greatly from one Member State to another."
"Having considered the Commission's proposal for a regulation on the time-to-market of a new fibre, we used it to remedy this labelling problem."
"In fact, in the absence of European legislation, there is a risk that products will appear that were manufactured in third countries, but which bear an inscription suggesting that they were manufactured in Europe."
"The report also calls on the Commission to consider labelling which would give consumers access to information on the social and environmental manufacturing conditions of the products they buy."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Manders, for his hard work in bringing together three complex directives."
"This report simplifies the existing regulatory framework by ensuring, for example, that a new fibre can be quickly brought to market."
"For our small and medium-sized enterprises, this means saving on administrative expenditure and profiting more quickly from the sale of new fibres."
"These measures encourage innovation, an element which is - in my opinion - essential for European companies."
"Indeed, only with innovative and high quality products can we overcome the fierce worldwide competition and emerge from this difficult time of crisis."
"The text also protects consumers, whose interests - I stress - are central to our policies."
"The adopted rules will ensure clearer and more transparent regulations for European citizens, and will also mean they can benefit more quickly from innovative products."
"Finally, public health will be better protected: more detailed labelling will provide citizens with information on the origin of yarn and related products."
"I welcome this proposal for a regulation, which seeks to simplify and improve the legislative framework currently in force, with the aim of encouraging innovation in the textile and clothing sector, whilst allowing fibre users and consumers to benefit more readily from innovative products."
"The issue of simplification is essential to promoting innovation in European industry and increasing the amount of information given to consumers."
"It is also important to find alternative legislation that is less burdensome in terms of procedures and costs when transposing directives."
"Industry will benefit from the reduced time between the submission of an application and the ability to place the product on the market, meaning savings in administrative costs and the possibility that it will reach the market earlier, increasing sales profits."
"At last, we have adopted 'made in' regulations in the textile sector."
"Parliament had already voted in favour of the proposal for a Council Regulation on the indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries back in 2005, but this was blocked by the Council."
"Since it was not a codecision procedure, however, it was not possible to do very much against the opposition of some national governments."
"This vote today, though, represents a strong political signal from the Assembly which represents European citizens and now forcefully calls upon the Council to adopt these regulations."
"This goal is closer today and is also in line with the Treaty of Lisbon goals."
"This may only be the first reading of the vote, but it is an important result, the outcome of much work in recent months with colleagues from other national delegations and other political groups."
"This new regulation protects European consumers who wish to know the origin of textile products, and small and medium-sized enterprises who manufacture them within Member States."
"This means, for example, that we will no longer be able to state that a product is 'made in' a Member State where in fact only 25% of it is made there; today, at least 50% of a product must be made in the 'made in' country."
"Broadly speaking, we support our colleague Mr Manders' report on textile names and related labelling of textile products."
"That said, we are very critical of mandatory origin marking as we are convinced that it would lead to higher prices for the consumers of Europe, together with inferior conditions and higher costs, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We believe in free trade, and we therefore believe that it is important not to create greater technical barriers to trade through unnecessary regulation."
"Instead, we support a voluntary labelling system based on consumer demand for origin marking."
"On 30 January 2009, the Commission adopted a proposal for a new regulation on textile names and related labelling of textile products."
"The proposal brings together all the existing legislation on textile names and related labelling of textile products in a single regulation."
"In the words of the rapporteur, the review 'is essentially a technical exercise without major political implications'."
"Nonetheless, we know that the competition faced by European textiles - above all from Chinese products - makes it necessary for more profound measures to be taken on labelling in the future, and that must be the Commission's task from now on."
"Furthermore, the challenges that the European Union is facing today make it necessary to improve and strengthen the market, and efforts must therefore be made to remove obstacles to this being fully realised."
"The harmonisation and simplification of standards relating to textile names meet this objective, since they clarify the information provided to the consumer and so contribute to making the sector more competitive."
"The ability to properly identify where and how a product was manufactured and what it is essentially made of is a fundamental prerogative of consumers to ensure their trust and protect their rights; it also introduces an important factor in promoting fair competition in the global textiles market."
"In this context, the standardisation of how textile products are labelled will benefit the competitiveness of Europe's textiles and clothing industry, and Portugal's in particular."
"I would stress the need for harmonised rules on the indication of the origin of textile products imported from non-EU countries and precise criteria for the use of a 'made in' origin marking for products manufactured in the Union, as well as social labelling to keep consumers informed about respect for health and safety standards and human rights."
"I also consider ecological labelling relating to the environmental performance of textile products important."
"The introduction of these clearer and more transparent rules on labelling - which include information about non-textile components of animal origin - will also enhance consumers' ability to differentiate products and their quality."
"We voted for this report because of its main thrust, which advocates marks of origin and is concerned with defending the rights of consumers, the workers and the production of our countries' textile and clothing industries."
"However, we disagree with some of the details about labelling, notably about overly detailed content regarding fibres, especially when small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are involved because of the costs that could be involved."
"Therefore, although we have voted in favour in general, there are proposed details with which we do not agree."
"We would argue that it needs to be revised or, at the least, that there needs to be provision for aid measures to guard against the problems of SMEs."
"The designation of a product's origin is important so that consumers know the exact source of the product that they are buying."
"It is not correct to designate a given product as originating in the EU when it is only packaged in an EU country, with the other phases of its production carried out in countries that are not in the EU."
"The new rules adopted will contribute to greater transparency in international trade and to making things clearer for consumers."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"Once again, the organic label promises something quite different to what it actually delivers - one only has to think of the 'Organic Cotton' scandal or the recent bio-chemicals fiascos."
"Firstly, it gives rise to yet another confusion of labels and marks in this organic market - which the EU could sensibly standardise once and for all, something which it usually loves doing - and, secondly, it is high time that the EU accepted genetically modified cotton."
"If we are waiting for studies into the possible effects of harmful substances, then, in the meantime, labels should at least state that products contain genetically modified cotton."
"Moreover, it is high time for the EU to also take care of radio frequency identification (RFID)."
"We cannot apply electronic labels to textiles without the knowledge of those concerned; we still do not have appropriate labelling rules."
"If pedestrians are to be made visible by means of RFID clothing, it will be possible to monitor people's every step."
"As the report also notes this, it received my support in the vote."
"I am in favour of the report by Mr Manders on origin labelling for textile products, since it resolves a problem that has long threatened our consumers' freedom of choice."
"Origin markings are essential to ensure transparency, safety and information for European citizens and, at the same time, to give our enterprises clear, common rules."
"The problem does, however, remain open for textile products coming from third countries, our trading partners."
"I therefore invite my fellow Members to confirm their support for the regulation on origin marking under discussion in the Committee on International Trade."
"This will protect our consumers and enterprises, with regard not only to textile and clothing products, but also to sectors that are sensitive as far as European economic growth is concerned."
"The European textile industry has reacted to the great economic challenges of recent years by undertaking a difficult journey of restructuring, modernisation and technological innovation."
"European enterprises have improved their own position on the global market, concentrating on competitive advantages such as quality, design and technological innovation of those products with the highest added values."
"European industry plays a key role worldwide in developing new products, hi-tech and unwoven textiles for new applications, and products for cleaning, the car industry or the medical sector."
"I welcome the Commission's proposal for a regulation, as I believe it simplifies the existing regulatory framework for developing and growing new fibres, and has the potential to encourage innovation in the textile and clothing sectors and, at the same time, to enable fibre users and consumers to benefit from innovative products sooner."
"Finally, I will express my full support for the 'Made in' regulation, as I believe that this is essential for ensuring that consumers have adequate information about the composition and origin of the product they are buying."
"in writing. - We, as greens, have abstained on the final vote of this report mainly because some of the key amendments proposed by the PPE, Liberals and EFD were adopted."
"In summary, all these amendments go in the direction of widening 'made in' provisions."
"I did not support the amendments in the Manders report on textile names and related labelling of textile products regarding 'made in' (47/49, 48, 12 and 67)."
"These amendments, which seek to impose origin marking for textile products imported from third countries (with the exception of Turkey and the EEA Member States) or to regulate precisely the conditions of voluntary origin marking of textile products manufactured in Europe by means of this regulation, would amount to endangering the adoption, within a reasonable timescale, of this important legislation."
"The proposal for a regulation on origin marking put forward by the European Commission is still under discussion in the Council and is the subject of a report by the Committee on International Trade."
"I am not against transparency and traceability of products for the benefit of the consumer."
"Nevertheless, as Members of the European Parliament, we have a responsibility to respect certain regulatory frameworks."
"In my opinion, before adopting the mandatory 'made in' indication on the labels of clothes sold in Europe, we should have first made sure that the draft regulation on 'made in' labelling included all the necessary guarantees, in particular, in its methods of implementation."
"in writing. - I have supported this document."
"The relations between the EU and Ukraine have always been very close and based upon a constructive dialogue."
"The Ukrainian economy, like the economies of the EU Member States, has been hit by the international financial crisis resulting in a dramatic decline in output, a worsening of the fiscal position and an increased need for external financing."
"Union macro-financial assistance of EUR 500 million should not merely supplement programmes and resources from the IMF and the World Bank but should ensure the added value of EU involvement."
"However, this assistance can only contribute to economic stabilisation in Ukraine if the main political forces ensure political stability in the country and establish a broad consensus on a rigorous implementation of the necessary structural reforms."
"Macro-financial assistance to Ukraine is particularly significant at this time."
"This assistance may increase EU influence on the formation of Ukrainian policy and help Ukraine to overcome the current deep economic crisis."
"The Community's financial assistance shows that Ukraine is strategically important as a potential candidate country for EU accession."
"The MFA would be provided at a time when the EU is also helping to mobilise financing to support the reform of the Ukrainian energy sector."
"The Commission and other institutions involved are working together on a support package to the Ukrainian authorities designed to assist in developing a sustainable solution to Ukraine's medium-term gas transit and gas payment obligations."
"Even though the proposed MFA is not intended to be directly linked to that package, it would support Ukraine's economic stabilisation and reforms."
"I agree with this decision to provide Ukraine with exceptional MFA."
"Without this assistance, Ukraine would be unable to further integrate fully into many areas of the economy and implement its further objectives."
"Ukraine is now paying the price for a severe economic crisis, as well as for protracted political instability, which have allowed the authorities in Kiev to slip behind in the commitments they made to the international financial institutions."
"It is important for the European Union to be involved in providing assistance to its neighbour on its eastern border at a time when the social situation is deteriorating against the backdrop of a lack of cash flow, which is needed to keep any state running."
"Ukraine must have stability."
"The loan granted by the European Commission, with the approval of the Community legislative, also provides confirmation that Kiev can be considered as a candidate for accession."
"However, the European Commission must focus, from now on, a great deal of attention on the mechanisms for monitoring the trail of the loan granted to Kiev."
"Furthermore, the European Union is in a position to ask Ukraine to tackle more decisively vital reforms which will help consolidate the rule of law."
"Ukraine's transition from a state-controlled economy to a market economy is a difficult and painful process, especially for its population."
"This economic transition must be supported by efforts aimed at institutional reform."
"Ukraine must grasp the nettle on both fronts, no matter how difficult it might seem at the moment."
"I welcome the adoption of the legislative resolution providing macro-financial assistance to Ukraine, since it will allow the country to address the consequences of the global financial crisis by ensuring that its fiscal and external accounts are sustainable."
"This response to Ukraine's request is essential to economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the current International Monetary Fund programme."
"However, Ukraine needs to take appropriate measures to prevent and fight fraud, corruption and any other irregularities associated with this assistance, as well as providing for controls by the Commission and audits by the Court of Auditors."
"I am referring here to the memorandum of understanding and the loan agreement to be agreed with the authorities of Ukraine, which will provide for specific measures to be implemented by the country in relation to the prevention of, and the fight against, fraud, corruption and other irregularities affecting the assistance."
"I was pleased to vote for Parliament's proposal providing macro-financial assistance to Ukraine."
"As a potential candidate for joining the European Union, Ukraine is a privileged partner and must be the target of specific policies aimed at resolving its particular problems."
"However, macro-financial assistance from the European Union to Ukraine will only contribute to the economic stabilisation of the country if the party-political landscape stabilises and the dominant political forces - which, in recent years, have been too caught up in their little internal wars over power and influence - establish a broad consensus on strictly implementing the structural reforms that the country's future requires."
"It is also absolutely essential for the Ukrainian Government to take action to bring an end to the judicial authorities' lack of independence, as they are subject to too much influence, not only from the political powers but also from economic actors."
"Without a free and independent justice system, there can be no rule of law, human rights are not guaranteed, and there is no foreign investment or progress."
"Any mechanisms set out by the loan agreement must take these factors into account in order to enable the EU institutions to strictly monitor how well it is being implemented."
"Ukraine, which is an immediate neighbour of the European Union, also features among the European countries which have been hit hard by the global economic crisis."
"The crisis's detrimental impact on the Ukrainian economy is jeopardising not only internal stability, but also that of the region as a whole."
"I voted in favour of providing macro-financial assistance to Ukraine, which will make a particularly important contribution to creating stability and continuing the economic reforms in this country."
"The Commission and the other institutions involved - the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank - must speed up the process of putting together a support package for Ukraine in order to identify and implement a sustainable solution with regard to reforming its economy and, primarily, its energy sector."
"Resolving problems relating to the transit of natural gas across Ukrainian territory is strategically important."
"I think that the inclusion of the gas transit issue on the European Union-Ukraine Association Agenda was welcome."
"I firmly believe that this cooperation must be consolidated, which also means finding new forms of cooperation."
"Ukraine must be supported in continuing the reforms to help it progress along the road to European integration, which is in keeping with the European Union's objectives outlined within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"The recent news of violence between Members of the Ukrainian Parliament has been of concern to the whole of Europe, and clearly reflected the divisions in Ukrainian society, the crossroads at which the country finds itself today and the inescapable role of Russia in the region."
"I believe that the European Union must not stop pointing out the European way to Ukraine."
"To this end, the macro-financial assistance that we are currently providing must constitute another sign of getting closer to Ukraine and solidarity with the country, at a time of particular social, economic and financial weakness."
"I hope that Ukraine unreservedly undertakes a process of convergence with the European Union, that the proposed association agreement comes into force and strengthens bilateral relations and exchanges, and that the end of this road could be Ukraine's accession to our common area."
"I also hope that the need for aid of this type gets progressively less, that Ukraine recovers political stability, that the country manages to rebalance itself socially and renew its commercial fabric, and that it can continue to choose democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"The Ukrainian economy has been increasingly hit by the international financial crisis, with dramatically declining output, a deteriorating fiscal position and rising external financing needs."
"EU financial support reflects Ukraine's strategic importance as a potential candidate country for joining the Union."
"I therefore voted in favour of giving Ukraine macro-financial assistance in the form of a loan facility with a maximum principal amount of EUR 500 million, with a view to supporting the country's economic stabilisation and alleviating its balance of payments and budgetary needs, as identified in the current International Monetary Fund programme."
"I consider it important to help Ukraine return to minimum necessary socio-economic levels and enable the stabilisation of its public accounts, so creating prospects for growth and political confidence."
"I also agree that monitoring mechanisms should be ensured that increase clarity, transparency and accountability."
"The European Parliament should be given regular updates on the work of the Economic and Financial Committee."
"The macro-financial assistance to Ukraine that is currently being proposed does not constitute a form of genuine, disinterested aid: quite the contrary."
"Amongst other things, making this assistance conditional on the International Monetary Fund's requirements and the 'key principles and objectives of economic reform set out in the EU-Ukraine Association Agenda' means the following: the establishment of a comprehensive free-trade area between the EU and Ukraine; obedience to the objectives of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy; closer cooperation through military channels in order to tackle matters of common interest; the possible participation of Ukraine in the EU's Atalanta naval operation; the establishment in Ukraine of a complete and fully operational market economy and the principles of macro-economic stability established by the EU; and the exchange of 'best practices' between the EU and Ukraine on reforming the welfare state, with the goal of making Ukraine's pensions system more sustainable."
"As a result of everything that is explicitly stated and of everything that can be read between the lines, given the well known meaning of much of the EU language mentioned above, our vote could clearly only be against this proposal."
"By voting this way, we are also expressing our solidarity with the Ukrainian people."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I endorsed the report on macro-financial assistance to Ukraine."
"It is an important decision, which means that we will help a very important neighbour of the European Union and Poland."
"A loan of EUR 500 million will help Ukraine come out of the financial crisis."
"I do not suppose I have to persuade anyone that the economic stabilisation of Ukraine and reform of the Ukrainian energy sector lie in the Union's interests."
"Whether it will be possible to achieve those objectives depends on the Ukrainians themselves."
"I am pleased we have shown, today, that we want to work with them and to help."
"I voted in favour of the financial assistance granted by the European Union to Ukraine as I believe that we must show solidarity, which also means aiding recovery from the current economic crisis."
"As a neighbouring European country wishing to join the EU in the period ahead, Ukraine must be given a clear political signal which will encourage the authorities to implement the reform measures agreed with the EU."
"At the same time, it is important for us Europeans to have prosperous neighbours, with a stable internal political situation, in keeping with European standards and values."
"In this respect, we hope that the loan provided by the EU to this neighbouring country will be used to help the whole of Ukrainian society. This includes more than half a million Romanians living in Northern Bukovina, Northern Maramureş and Southern Bessarabia."
"The European Commission must, of course, take every measure to ensure that this exceptional financial assistance is used prudently and in the places where it is needed, in order to achieve the anticipated effects."
"The terms for granting this assistance must be in line with the major objectives of the EU-Ukraine Association Agenda, and the process for using the funds must be subject to rigorous European control, with the European Parliament being briefed on a regular basis."
"It is intolerable that European loans and subsidies are subject to constraints imposed by the IMF."
"It is unacceptable that the European Commission is setting itself the job of verifying that the policies of the World Bank and the IMF are applied by the Member States that are beneficiaries of them, regardless of the sovereignty of the Ukrainian people."
"I am voting against the macro-financial assistance presented today to the European Parliament."
"It is not the case that I do not support the people of Ukraine."
"On the contrary, I do not want them to suffer more than they already do from the obsolete and dangerous neoliberal system that the IMF, the World Bank and the European Commission are imposing on them."
"The process of economic stabilisation and recovery in Ukraine is supported by the financial assistance of the International Monetary Fund."
"In the face of its worsening economic prospects, Ukraine has requested macro-financial assistance from the Union."
"The macro-financial assistance programme is vital for improving the financial stability of European nations that have gone through the recent global crisis and have suffered from the effects of this crisis on their main trading partners."
"The financial imbalances relate to budgets and the balance of payments."
"This aid is important in order for Ukraine to tackle the crisis in the most coherent way."
"The EU must therefore be an area of solidarity."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"Ukraine, a major and important partner of the EU amongst its eastern neighbours, has been hard hit by the global economic crisis."
"For this reason, the provision of macro-financial aid of up to EUR 500 million in the form of a loan under the Commission proposal should be approved."
"This funding was to cover the country's general balance of payments requirement and its external financing gap, as determined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"Ukraine is to be supported in strengthening its long-term macro-economic stability, as it is also an important trading partner for the EU."
"For me, however, it was also important that the aid granted from the EU budget not only conforms to the IMF programme but also to the most important principals and objectives of EU policy towards Ukraine."
"Thanks to the EU's help, further necessary structural reforms have been set in train in Ukraine on the basis of a positive conditionality."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I voted in favour of the report by Mr Moreira."
"The proposed macro-financial assistance aims to supplement the IMF support provided as part of the stand-by framework agreement, as well as the support of the World Bank, which should take the form of loans granted to the budget support policy."
"The macro-financial assistance programme sets out to complement other financing from the Union."
"The Union's financial help reflects the strategic importance of Ukraine as a potential candidate for EU membership."
"MFA is granted at a time when the EU is also participating in the mobilisation of finances to reform Ukraine's energy sector."
"I agree with the rapporteur's aim of improving the clarity, transparency and documentability of the proposed project."
"in writing. - Nobody disputes that Ukraine is our 'strategic partner' whose situation is of great interest to us."
"Today, Ukraine stands at a crossroads economically, given its difficult situation, and politically, with a new government that favours closer relations with Russia."
"Helping Ukraine by making EUR 500 million available is therefore the right decision strategically, which we will support."
"However, tactically, is there not a discrepancy between the level of financial support - a mere half billion compared to other schemes involving tens of billions in financial support - and the control over Ukraine's economic policy we want to achieve in exchange?!"
"The EU does, of course, have strict rules that beneficiaries of its financial support have to respect, no matter the sums of money they receive, but sometimes, especially when the level of that support is relatively low, maintaining the same high conditionality reflects a political inflexibility which only diminishes the effectiveness of this instrument, especially at a time when others are much more flexible in their support."
"in writing. - In my capacity of EURONEST Vice-President, I voted in favour of the macro-financial assistance for Ukraine."
"I hope it will be swiftly delivered in conformity with the conditions underlying the provision."
"I welcome, in particular, the involvement of the European Parliament in this decision-making process as a consequence of the enactment of the Treaty of Lisbon provisions."
"The macro-financial assistance for Ukraine is the first case to be decided under the new procedure."
"Meanwhile, the delay registered in the decision-making process due to the new procedure is regrettable."
"I urge the EU institutions to build upon the experience of granting Ukraine macro-financial assistance and avoid further delays."
"Our Eastern Partners should be spared unnecessary delay."
"I refer in particular to the case of the Republic of Moldova and its pro-European government, which is still waiting for the delivery of the EU macro-financial assistance."
"While the Republic of Moldova is in urgent need of assistance, the proposal of the European Commission is already unacceptably late."
"It will be submitted to the European Parliament only this week."
"I call upon all EU institutions to avoid further delay in deciding on the macro-financial assistance for the Republic of Moldova."
"Our nine outermost regions (the Azores, the Canaries, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Madeira, Martinique, Réunion, Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin) are a real asset for the European Union."
"Since their remoteness handicaps their development, the European Union must adopt specific compensatory measures."
"Thus, in Réunion, for example, it must be possible to produce UHT milk reconstituted from powdered milk for human consumption."
"The valuable exemption granted to Madeira must be extended to Réunion, which shares this characteristic of very significant geographical remoteness."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report with the objective of introducing, extending or adapting the existing exemptions for the Azores, the Canary Islands, Réunion and Madeira in the sugar, milk and wine sectors."
"The outermost regions face greater challenges because of geography, which places them far from the centre of the Union."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of specific measures in the area of agriculture to help these regions in the current economic crisis."
"In particular, I would stress the specific nature of the regions of the Azores and Madeira, and I welcome the main measures adopted."
"These measures are related to the introduction, extension or adaptation of certain derogations in the sugar, milk and wine sectors."
"It is important to stress that it is essential to have an integrated strategy for the outermost regions, without forgetting that each of them has its own specificity: it is important to find the best responses for each different region."
"Several existing EU instruments, such as regional strategies and the European Neighbourhood Policy, should be highlighted, as should the importance of our continuing to debate strategic guidelines for the outermost regions, so as to raise awareness amongst decision makers of these regions' specificities and potentials."
"There is more than just one outermost region."
"Each island, each territory has its own specific character, identity and problems."
"The report that we have just adopted will allow the introduction of certain exemptions in the area of agriculture to help the outermost regions."
"As an example, the people of Réunion will now be able to produce UHT milk reconstituted from milk powder of EU origin, thus compensating for the insufficient production of fresh milk."
"The Azores, meanwhile, will benefit from an exemption from the rules limiting sugar exports to the EU, since the production of sugar beets represents the most viable alternative for the island - for both its economy and its environment - when milk quotas end."
"These exemptions will help the outermost regions."
"That is a good thing, and it is why we would like them to be guaranteed in the long term."
"This is what we expect of the Commission."
"I voted for the report on the proposal for a regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the European Union."
"As well as providing an opportunity for agricultural diversification, the adoption of this report means that the ban on re-exporting certain products has been lifted."
"At a time of economic crisis, this is a decisive contribution to restructuring and maintaining, not only many dozens of jobs in the Azores, but also activity in the region's sugar industry."
"The Commission's proposal envisages amendments to Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union."
"The changes are related to the sugar, milk and wine sectors."
"I congratulate the rapporteurs involved on the quality of their work."
"One of the basic principles of the current multiannual financial framework and the next financial perspectives must be the principle of solidarity; social and territorial cohesion must be ensured in this way."
"We all know about the natural difficulties against which the outermost regions of the European Union struggle because of their geographic location and conditions, resulting in negative effects on their economic activity and productive capacity."
"The proposed amendments are in line with this principle of solidarity, so I support them."
"The budget underlying this report - which is made explicit in the first item of the compromise proposal's preamble, accepting an end to dairy quotas - is unacceptable to us, which is why we voted against."
"In fact, bringing an end to quotas will - as the adopted report admits, presenting it as a fait accompli - have extremely serious effects on the milk sector in the Azores, and for the region's entire dairy sector."
"The consequences of abolition of the milk quotas for the region's economy - against which we have fought and will continue to fight - will not be mitigated with the measures aimed at the sugar-processing industry that are being proposed now, considering that the re-exporting of sugar is being prolonged."
"This is a fair goal."
"It is weakened from the start when it is accepted that this measure, too, will be gradually abolished over a five-year period."
"As far as Madeira is concerned, the process of reconverting vines is significantly behind schedule and could even be compromised if the incentives are not strengthened."
"The negative consequences for the region of the so-called 'Geneva Agreement' on the banana trade are also being ignored."
"Another issue that it would be important to consider is the possibility of aid to stimulate an inter-island market for the sale of local agricultural products."
"I voted in favour of the final text, which was pushed through urgently, since the application of these different exemptions for Réunion, the Azores, the Canaries and Madeira was key to ensuring the protection of jobs and the continuation of agricultural activities, in particular, milk production in Réunion."
"However, I voted against the compromise proposed by the European Commission and the Council since the latter was making proposals that fell far short of the measures that we had proposed and which had been adopted by the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Agriculture."
"It is regrettable that the quotas for sugar exports have not been kept at 3 000 tonnes for the Azores, that the exemption granted to Réunion for milk production has not been considered for the other French overseas departments, and that the safeguards concerning the sustainability of the results achieved by the Réunion milk producers have not been upheld by the Commission."
"I would put all of these questions back on the table during the negotiations that will deal with the reform of the POSEI programme."
"The outermost regions are usually characterised by a low population, small size, stagnation and difficult economic conditions."
"They are regions which are strongly dependent on climatic and geographical conditions, and whose access to products and services is based on cooperation with the mainland of the Union."
"Assistance for these regions should be permanently guaranteed, just as the difficulties which the people of outermost areas have to overcome are permanent."
"In order to guarantee these regions development of enterprise, stimulation of professional activity and the same level in the agriculture sector as in the whole of Europe, we need to introduce new legislative concessions - and continue with those which already exist - adapted to the needs of specific regions."
"The economic and social development of the outermost regions of the European Union is conditioned by their extreme remoteness and insularity, their small size, difficult terrain and climate, and their economic dependence on a small number of products."
"As these factors, taken together, severely restrict their development, there is provision in Article 349 of the Treaty of Lisbon for specific measures to benefit the outermost regions, which must be put into practice through appropriate initiatives that seek to respond to their specific needs, not least in the agricultural and fishing sectors."
"The main amendments are related to the introduction, extension or adaptation of certain derogations in the sugar, milk and wine sectors."
"We are voting in favour of these measures because of all these constraints and the international crisis that is devastating us."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution, because the second pillar of the common agricultural policy, namely rural development policy, is extremely important for improving the effectiveness of the CAP itself, but also for facilitating the management of land which has natural handicaps."
"The document which has been drafted by the rapporteur is very necessary, not only for us, but for the whole of the European Union."
"We must have information about land which, for reasons not dependent on the owners, cannot be used effectively or well."
"I agree with the rapporteur in his assessment of the review, which began in 2005, of criteria for classifying disadvantaged areas."
"The previous criteria for support of these areas must be modified so that they reflect actually existing handicaps."
"It should also be remembered that there are areas which come under specific criteria but where the handicaps have now been removed due to the application of effective measures."
"It is Member States which should be responsible for identification of less-favoured areas and for development of aid and development programmes."
"Of course, all measures must be based on a Community framework."
"The Commission's proposal, as improved by the rapporteur, makes provision for some changes to previous Community law, specifically to Regulation No 247 of 2006."
"The main changes concern the introduction, extension and adaptation of some derogations in the sugar, milk and wine sectors."
"I believe that the proposed changes are positive for the outermost areas concerned."
"The situation is very difficult, especially in some areas whose main economic sectors have been hit by the recent crises (dairy sector in the Azores, sugar beet, etc.)."
"It would therefore be advisable to encourage the diversification of economic activities."
"However, to encourage such diversification, producers and transformers must be offered long-term prospects, and economic operators must be allowed to reach an appropriate level of industrial and commercial activity."
"In view of the system outlined by the rapporteur and the amendments presented by my colleagues from the relevant Committee, I declare myself in favour of the report."
"As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development on the report by Mr Alves, I am satisfied with the road we have started down with a view to a quicker, more effective adjustment of the maximum export quantities for products included in the arrangements for supply from the outermost regions."
"The framework for this report is Article 349 of the Treaty of Lisbon, in which there is provision for aid for the outermost regions to overcome permanent difficulties resulting from their geographic situation, topography and climate."
"The provisions of this regulation must address the specific needs of these regions and the realities of the local market."
"It was this objective that I had in mind when drafting my proposals, which the European Commission has committed to revisit during the general review of this regulation that is still to be undertaken in 2010."
"I was also concerned with safeguarding the incomes of Madeiran and Azorean producers of wine from hybrid varieties banned by the common organisation of the market in wine, enabling them to continue growing these varieties for consumption by their families, which means that they are not forced to grub them up."
"As I was hoping, the compromise resulting from the trialogue between Parliament, the Commission and the Council was confirmed by a large majority in Parliament today."
"The Trüpel report on the 2011 budget is a new stage in the European Parliament's budget adoption procedure."
"In March, Parliament adopted the guidelines for 2011."
"The aim here is to adopt the draft estimates, which follow the negotiations that took place between the Committee on Budgets and the Bureau of the European Parliament, which is the body responsible for the matter."
"I supported this report, which notably provides for the adoption of the second instalment of the EUR 1 500 per month increase in parliamentary assistance allowance, the financing of the 18 new MEPs as they take office, the improvement of support services provided for MEPs (policy departments, library services), and the increase in the number of visitors that each MEP can sponsor financially from 100 to 110 per year."
"These various provisions are in keeping with the European Parliament's new responsibilities granted by the Treaty of Lisbon: henceforth, as colegislators with ministers of the Member States on almost all European competences, MEPs must be able to benefit from in-depth technical expertise on legislative matters, but also to inform citizens of their work, in particular, by receiving them in Parliament in Strasbourg or Brussels."
"I voted against Mrs Trüpel's report."
"In so doing, I am coming out very clearly against the increase in the secretarial allowance and any increase in the number of officials here in the European Parliament."
"The argument that the Treaty of Lisbon will bring more work for MEPs must be proven first."
"Should this be the case, the solution in these times of exploding state debts, however, can only be more efficiency, not more bureaucracy."
"There is an enormous potential for greater efficiency in this House, and it would be easy to also increase performance with a smaller staff and less funding."
"As I have said before, under the Treaty of Lisbon, the amount of matters to be dealt with by Parliament under the ordinary legislative procedure will increase."
"Adequate technical and logistical means are necessary in order for the work to be carried out quickly and efficiently."
"Taking into account the future enlargement of the European Union and the need to better inform the public about the work of this House, it is therefore necessary to allocate funds that will make it possible to work efficiently in 2011, so that the Union's entire legislative process does not become slower because Parliament is underfunded."
"In line with the policies that I have been advocating, I consider the adoption of the policy of zero-based budgeting at the beginning of each parliamentary term important."
"As a result, Parliament's budget will reflect real needs and will increase transparency, budgetary discipline and efficiency."
"I also advocate a distinction between fixed and variable costs, with the latter justified by a cost-benefit analysis."
"This cost-benefit analysis is important to ensure better results and resource management."
"New competences were assigned when the Treaty of Lisbon came into force and the inclusion of 18 new Members makes it necessary to create conditions that enable them to exercise their mandate in a fitting, effective way."
"I would stress that excellence in law making must be Parliament's main priority."
"This House must be provided with the resources necessary for it to operate properly; all the more so in this very demanding time that we are experiencing, in which EU institutions have a crucial role to play for Europeans and society in general."
"in writing. - We, as Greens, have voted in favour of the report by our colleague, Helga Trüpel."
"All amendments tabled to the report were rejected."
"The estimates of the EP for the year 2011 are thus forwarded to the Commission for inclusion in the draft budget proposal for 2011."
"As to the assistants' allowance second tranche increase for 2011, this means that the appropriations are currently entered in reserve pending a detailed financial statement of all related costs."
"Parliament can come back to this issue at the first reading of the 2011 budget in September/October."
"As to the first tranche of the secretarial allowance increase for 2010, this will be voted tomorrow as part of the Maňka report on the amending budget No 1/2010."
"Here we are already in the budget procedure proper and the vote here will constitute the final result."
"We have managed to get used to the fact that the European Parliament budget reflects complicated compromises between the European Parliament and other EU institutions, and also - indirectly - between the European Union and Member States."
"Next year may turn out to be particularly difficult in this respect, if we look at the importance and scale of the work which awaits Parliament."
"For, on the one hand, Parliament is faced with having to adapt to new conditions which result from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and from enlargement of the EU with Croatia - I need only mention the 18 new Members, the 68 additional posts and the 62 posts linked to the Croatian enlargement."
"On the other hand, Parliament's budget is not going to rise significantly in comparison with 2010 (5.5%), which raises the question as to how to reconcile this figure with the new reality."
"In this context, I welcome the proposal, which is repeated throughout the report, for spending to be planned prudently."
"Like the author of the document, I think it is necessary to review the level of subsidies given to employees' families, to increase employment in the library only after a thorough analysis of MEPs' needs and to ensure the security of Parliament's staff at a sensible cost and based on the principle of openness towards the ordinary citizen."
"Parliament remains too closed as an institution and, as far as is possible, we should increase financing for projects such as the House of European History and tours of Parliament."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has meant that the European Parliament's powers have increased, which naturally means new funds to meet the increased needs."
"That being the case, this estimate of the budget for 2011 represents a 5.8% increase compared to the financial year 2010, in an attempt to ensure that Parliament is able to fully make use of and exercise its prerogatives."
"The budget for 2011 will increase to EUR 1 710 574 354, of which 20.32% will be for Heading 5 (administration), allowing the political objectives to be reconciled with the respective finance."
"This budgetary proposal includes provisions relating to representation for Croatia, to extra funds for Members' secretarial services, to extra jobs, to an increase in the annual number of visitors that Members can invite, to the reduction in Parliament's carbon footprint, and to financing for the House of European History and the Visitors Centre."
"This report reflects a sensible budget, aimed at a policy of the sustainability of Parliament."
"However, it does not fail to have a rigorous approach to the effective use of available resources."
"in writing. - We voted against this report in accordance with UKIP principles and on the basis that we support legislation only where it limits the power of the EU or returns it to nation states."
"Any amendments which we felt unnecessarily harmed British farmers were not supported, as were any amendments that expanded EU control in this sector."
"UKIP will continue to defend the interests of British farmers against EU interference, as we feel the British agricultural sector is perfectly capable of running its own affairs, and already has high standards of both quality and safety."
"UKIP opposes the British taxpayer being forced to subsidise farms in other parts of Europe which compete with our own farmers."
"UKIP is committed to trade in agricultural produce under the terms of WTO rules."
"The administrative burden placed on farmers must be reduced and the excessive bureaucracy that is often involved in agricultural affairs must be cut back."
"Farmers should be able to focus on their primary responsibility: producing high quality products."
"I voted in favour of the provisions of this report that relate to removing the current duplication and that relate to improving flexibility."
"I also agree with the report's statements in relation to legislation in this sector; that is, that this legislation should be proportional to the objective and that no legislation should be brought in until an assessment is made of the legislation's impact as regards its potential financial burden."
"Excessive bureaucracy must be cut back if we are to achieve an efficient, competitive agricultural sector in Europe."
"I voted for this document as I believe it is necessary to continue the simplification of the regulation and the provisions of the common agricultural policy that started back in 2005."
"Farmers and other economic operators in the agricultural sector should be freed from red tape and requirements that are not necessary to reach political objectives and ensure proper management of taxpayers' money."
"Simplifying the CAP is essential to making our agricultural economy more competitive, preserving and creating jobs and contributing to a sound development of our rural areas."
"A high level of errors in applications has been recorded in some Member States and this makes it difficult for farmers to receive assistance on time."
"Member States should place at the disposal of potential beneficiaries systems that are simple, clear and transparent."
"Therefore, I call on the Commission to include this matter in the bilateral discussions with the Member States."
"Three years on from the CAP reform, we are now wondering how to adapt our agricultural policy to today's challenges."
"The own-initiative report offers useful and widely shared suggestions for achieving the aim of an agricultural sector that combines quality and competitiveness."
"We must welcome the spirit of this report positively, because with this report, Parliament is calling for the introduction of a new CAP in 2013 that cuts down on bureaucracy for farmers."
"Any measure capable of reducing the administrative procedures and burdens that weigh down agricultural producers - not to mention the local authorities concerned - and that does not compromise quality standards definitely deserves our support."
"A report such as this, which is attentive to the needs of farmers, including the need to ensure that they are not hampered by excessive bureaucratic burdens, will certainly be a useful contribution to the process of reforming the common agricultural policy which, for obvious reasons, is bound to be a complex and very sensitive process for the future of the European economy, and for the protection of the countless varieties of traditional local produce."
"I therefore voted in favour of the report."
"Farming has always been close to the heart of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), and we consider it a fundamental sector of the European economy."
"However, our farmers have too long been overwhelmed by bureaucratic and administrative burdens: it is time to lighten their load."
"I am, in fact, convinced that simplifying the bureaucratic procedures to be adopted with the CAP reform from 2013 is not merely desirable, but necessary."
"I therefore think it is right to simplify the rules for the electronic identification of animals, and to create a telephone helpline in every EU Member State to provide better access to information."
"In addition, it is essential to rebuild trust between authorities and farmers."
"Farmers, moreover, must no longer spend their days filling in forms and declarations, but tending their fields, and thus supplying better agricultural products that comply with higher standards."
"I therefore voted in favour of these measures, which form part of the process of simplifying bureaucracy, boldly supported by my parliamentary group, which offers a substantial response in times of crisis."
"in writing. - We voted against this report in accordance with UKIP principles and on the basis that we support legislation only where it limits the power of the EU or returns it to nation states."
"Any amendments that we felt unnecessarily harmed British farmers were not supported, as were any amendments that expanded EU control in this sector."
"UKIP will continue to defend the interests of British farmers against EU interference, as we feel the British agricultural sector is perfectly capable of running its own affairs, and already has high standards of both quality and safety."
"UKIP opposes the way CAP has historically been used in corrupt ways (e.g. phantom vineyards) or the way it is used to top-up the income of certain politicians in EU countries who own 'farms'."
"UKIP also objects to being forced to subsidise farms in other parts of Europe, which compete with our own farmers."
"UKIP is committed to trade in agricultural produce, under the terms of WTO rules."
"in writing. - UKIP voted against the report on simplification of the CAP because, although the implementation of the report would make the policy more comprehensible, transparent and workable, simplifying farm inspection, adding to flexibility to payment arrangements and making it more farmer friendly, to do so is to keep the CAP on track and potentially help to extend it for another generation!"
"UKIP therefore voted against the resolution as a whole, especially as it is without legislative impact."
"I voted in favour of the report on simplifying the common agricultural policy, and I congratulate Mr Ashworth and the shadow rapporteurs on the excellent work they have carried out."
"We must take action to simplify the bureaucratic procedures and requirements imposed on farms, in order to reduce their costs and, at the same time, increase their competitiveness and legal certainty."
"We often forget that, although they produce a staple product, farms too are businesses whose competitiveness suffers as a result of excessive bureaucracy."
"For this very reason, I think reports like this are important, because they underline the problems that arise due to conditionality, or over-complicated procedures, whilst also proposing solutions to simplify and improve what is still, after all, the most important EU programme, at least in financial terms."
"I believe that, by voting in favour of this report, Parliament has taken another step towards a CAP that is more up-to-date, efficient and economical and that is, above all, able to ensure that Europe's food requirements will be met not merely today but also in years to come."
"Farmers have always been the most ardent and steadfast supporters of European Union integration."
"They firmly believe that the CAP still is a common policy in the true sense of the term."
"In a globalised world, the European Union, with its Community market, must take uniform action in order to guarantee food supply security and promote renewable resources."
"It must also combat climate change and step up its research effort in order to make the best use of the opportunities that research can offer."
"The potential cuts to the CAP budget would cause considerable social and economic disruption, thereby preventing agriculture from coping with the challenges of the future."
"It is important for us to understand that farmers' incomes are dependent on direct payments, even though these alone do not provide farmers with a decent standard of living."
"The average agricultural income in the EU, including all direct payments, only amounts to half the average salary paid in the remaining economic sectors."
"I believe that reducing direct payments as part of Pillar I of the CAP would have devastating consequences not only for farmers, but just as much for rural areas, as well as for public services related to agricultural production, for consumers and for society benefiting from these payments as a whole."
"Direct payments are therefore vital and must be maintained."
"In general, I voted in favour of the efforts to simplify the common agricultural policy (CAP)."
"This simplification should benefit farmers, enabling them to concentrate on producing safe, quality food, and also the national and EU authorities, by reducing the bureaucratic burden associated with implementing the CAP."
"The CAP is of vital importance to the EU, both because it ensures the production of safe food and because of its concern for preserving the environment or rural areas, with a view to properly sustainable development."
"Simplification has to mean greater responsibility for all the actors involved."
"I would therefore stress the need to transform the CAP into a simpler, fairer and more transparent instrument."
"To start with, I would highlight the proposal to create a uniform system of animal identification."
"This system must include the possibility of self-certification, the reduction of inspection quotas to limits lower than those currently in place, and the issue of the traceability of meat from sheep and goats; I am referring specifically to the proposal for herd identification for livestock."
"Finally, the necessary reform of the CAP will have to distinguish between supporting individual farmers or cooperatives of such individuals, and leaving big agri-food companies at the mercy of the markets."
"The draft report on simplifying the common agricultural policy is a further step towards making the CAP simpler and more efficient."
"We must, of course, do much more to boost the competitiveness of European agriculture, retain and create additional jobs and support the natural development of rural areas."
"In this context, I would like to mention the issue of direct payments in border regions, where there is unfair competition and discrimination based on the place of registration of agricultural entities."
"In neighbouring regions of Member States with differing price levels, there are indications of massive economic action on the part of some agricultural entities in response to these price differences."
"An agricultural entity which gets higher prices in its country of origin does business in another country (with lower direct prices) at lower production costs and records the sales on the other side of the border."
"In this way, agricultural entities in countries with lower direct prices are discriminated against and economically disadvantaged on the local market, while agricultural entities from Member States with higher direct prices secure an economic advantage on the market as a result of EU policies."
"For these reasons, it is necessary to take account of the implications for prices when reforming the CAP; that is, comparing the place of production to the place where the direct prices are recorded."
"Through this regulation, we will also contribute towards creating a new and fair market in agriculture."
"I am in favour of the report submitted."
"I voted for this report because I consider the simplification of the common agricultural policy crucial to the competitiveness of EU agriculture, the preservation of jobs and the sustainable development of Europe's rural areas."
"The rules for checks must be simplified and made more accessible to farmers through help and advice by national bodies, in order to ensure that the quality of European agricultural products does not bring about unnecessary burdens and additional difficulties for actors linked to agricultural activity."
"The simplification of legislation is a goal that is essential to bringing Europe closer to the public."
"Simple and perceptive policies are necessary for those who have not mastered the Union's code and do not speak 'Europese'."
"That is why a policy as fundamental and permanent as the common agricultural policy (CAP) must be understood by its main beneficiaries; in this case, European farmers."
"I would therefore acknowledge how right the rapporteur is in saying that 'a new CAP should allow farmers to concentrate on the core objective of providing safe, quality and traceable food while also supporting them to deliver non-market public goods'."
"I hope that the new CAP will be simpler, more transparent and fairer; that it will be better aimed at the needs of farmers and the market; and that its processes will be faster and less bureaucratic, but secure and effective."
"Legal certainty does not require complexity or sluggish processes, but rather simplicity and effectiveness."
"That is exactly what we want for the new CAP."
"The common agricultural policy (CAP) must, on the one hand, ensure an adequate supply of safe food and, on the other, respond to such challenges as the conservation of rural areas, mountain regions, disadvantaged areas and the multifunctionality of European agriculture."
"The harmonisation of legislation must be accompanied by the elimination of redundancy."
"It is to be hoped that the target of a 25% reduction in the administrative burden will be reached ahead of 2012."
"The CAP must be simplified, as that will make our agricultural economy more competitive, so preserving and creating jobs and contributing to the sustainable development of our rural areas."
"Simplification of the CAP must benefit farmers first and foremost and not only the national authorities and payment bodies in the Member States."
"Farmers must have access to workable systems that allow them easily, and without needless bureaucracy, to submit applications for direct payments in the place in which they live."
"This simplification must go hand-in-hand with simplification of its implementation, and the Member States must minimise the bureaucratic formalities required of beneficiaries, especially in the area of rural development."
"Greater flexibility is needed, so we are advocating the authorisation of more flexible payment arrangements even before all checks have been definitively completed."
"This report has positive aspects, of which we would stress the following: the simplification of the common agricultural policy (CAP) must not mean less aid for framers and the dismantling of traditional instruments for managing markets; the need to amend the fines, not least when they relate to offences that are not the producer's responsibility; the simplification of the application process; and very positive amendments regarding animal identification, particularly of sheep and goats."
"Nonetheless, the approach proposed by the rapporteur is largely aimed at the market, at competitiveness, at 'reducing excessive protectionism', and at going further with liberalisation, with its well known and disastrous consequences."
"The report also continues to support the current model for distributing aid."
"It states that 'the distribution of the single farm payment should ensure fairness', but does not propose specific measures to achieve this goal."
"It expresses its belief that the current definition of agricultural activity for the purposes of single payment should be reviewed, but proposes nothing to amend the current model in which people are paid to not produce."
"In summary, the report lacks proposals and measures to change the CAP model in force, to begin with (but not only) as far as the distribution of aid is concerned."
"in writing. - I fully agree that the simplification of the CAP should not result in less support for farmers and should not lead to the dismantling of traditional market management instruments."
"Furthermore, I agree with a deferral on the obligation of electronic sheep tagging."
"Simplifying the principles which define the operation of the common agricultural policy is extremely important."
"The CAP should not be reduced just to the distribution of money."
"Personally, I would like greater resources to be directed to individual agricultural investors, who could more effectively modernise farms and expand production."
"However, increasing the financing of direct payments is, in my opinion, a way to retain poverty in the most backward regions, which supports people who, in reality, are not connected with agriculture and hinders the restructuring of agriculture."
"Only subsidising 'real' farmers - producers of healthy food and high quality products - can guarantee security in this area for Europe and the world."
"in writing. - I have voted against the Ashworth report on simplification of the CAP, because of Paragraph 12."
"Farmers do not need more EU direct support; they need fairer prices for their products."
"However, I do agree with the essence of the report."
"The CAP is overly complicated and unnecessarily burdensome on farmers, Member States and decentralised governments and authorities."
"There is a great need to relieve this administrative burden and reduce bureaucracy, especially in these times of crisis."
"Furthermore, there should be a possibility of error correction for farmers who have, unintentionally or due to factors beyond their control, committed infringements and are penalised as a result of this, as well as a greater transparency regarding these penalties."
"The common agricultural policy is an essential element of the European Union, whether we are talking about providing food for our citizens or about conserving and protecting mountain regions and rural areas, as well as the outermost or disadvantaged regions."
"I voted for this report because I support the need to simplify the CAP."
"It has to be results-orientated and offer a greater capacity to respond."
"I also think that closer cooperation is needed between Member States and local authorities in terms of exchanging good practices."
"At the same time, farmers must be kept well informed and be given more assistance by the authorities."
"Agriculture is one of the main resources in Europe, but it is also the sector that is most burdened by the grinding wheels of EU bureaucracy."
"Neither must we underestimate the impact of climatic and environmental factors that are, by their very nature, hard to predict and force the farming world to face new and difficult challenges due to the global changes that are taking place."
"Against this backdrop, the European Parliament considers it indispensable to bear in mind that the goal of reducing administrative burdens by 25% set out in the 2003 programme is not enough and also not ambitious enough, given that we will probably achieve it before the deadline of 2012."
"Parliament also believes it must suggest urgent strategies to the Commission and the Council for further reducing the burdens oppressing our farmers."
"The proposals in this parliamentary resolution also aim to anticipate the redrafting of the CAP in the light of the EU 2020 strategy."
"This step is crucial for ensuring growth in this sector, and for ensuring that its financial allocation is maintained, in view of the erosion of EU resources that is foreseeable for 2013."
"This report has the merit of pointing out that the public service alone guarantees the independence and impartiality of inspections and of stressing the idea of agriculture as a public good."
"The insistence on the traceability of foodstuffs is also important, although clear labelling on their environmental footprint is more likely to raise awareness among all citizens (producers and consumers) of the importance of relocation and of the environmental quality of produce."
"The determination shown in the report to simplify the administrative rules of the common agricultural policy is also important."
"However, the fact that the CAP is considered only from the perspective of competitiveness and neoliberalism, in the direct tradition of the policies implemented by the European Union in the last few years, prevents me from voting in favour."
"I am therefore abstaining on this text as a sign of goodwill for the progress made in the intentions shown."
"It is essential to simplify the common agricultural policy if the goal of a 25% reduction in the agricultural sector's administrative burden is to be achieved by 2010."
"Bureaucracy is a serious impediment for farmers, who neglect their daily activities in the fields because they waste a great deal of time on red tape."
"Furthermore, the new amendments will also mean a reduction of hundreds of millions of euro in the administrative burden borne by farmers, with palpable benefits, especially if we take into account the difficult economic situation that we are experiencing."
"The simplification of standards and of checking mechanisms is essential for farmers, who must ensure the food supply for 500 million people at a reasonable price."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"I voted for this report, which contains important provisions aimed at removing the red tape which affects Europe's farmers, especially at the moment when agriculture is being hit very hard by the financial crisis."
"I would like to thank my fellow Members who voted for the amendments I tabled, thereby retaining the text already approved in committee."
"I am referring mainly to Amendment 49 relating to the high level of errors in applications submitted for direct payments registered in some Member States, which also highlights that these errors are attributable mainly to the orthophotographic equipment used rather than to the farmers themselves."
"I am also referring to Amendment 65 concerning the deferment of the obligation on the electronic identification of sheep and goats starting from 2010, due to its excessive cost in the present economic crisis."
"The proposal to simplify the CAP is part of the wider process of reducing bureaucratic procedures, a process initiated some time ago by various EU Member States, to ensure more efficient and accessible services for citizens."
"This reform is also necessary for the agricultural sector, to allow farmers to save time and money, and to have access to the benefits under the system of conditionality and direct payments, as well as with regard to some aspects of rural development and methods of identification for reared animals."
"At the present time, with the debate for the post-2013 CAP already under way, this proposal for simplification represents a test bench that can be used to highlight opportunities and threats and form the basis of a proposal for European agriculture in the future."
"For the reasons I have expressed above, I voted in favour of the report."
"The report on the simplification of the common agricultural policy (CAP) examines an issue that has been of serious concern to farmers, who are the main beneficiaries of the CAP, and also to the European public in general, who find the CAP hard to understand because of the complexity of its mechanisms."
"The simplification measures are therefore recognised as necessary and urgent by everyone."
"It is essential that these measures have a direct impact on farmers and not just on each Member State's administration, as has very often been the case."
"The elimination of the market management instruments cannot be put forward as one of the means of simplification."
"One thing that the simplification needs to address is the need to eliminate discriminations in the single payment scheme in the various Member States, which are problems that result from the inefficiency of national administrations, such as checks, deadlines, payments, etc. Eliminating these discriminations will prevent us having a multi-speed CAP that encourages inequalities between the farmers of the various Member States."
"I voted for the Ashworth report in favour of a simpler common agricultural policy which is also easier for farmers to understand."
"Administering the common agricultural policy is often excessively complicated."
"Consequently, it is of paramount importance to the whole agricultural sector to simplify it and make farmers' lives easier."
"The rules proposed by the European Commission are, on many occasions, extremely difficult to implement and there is a very high level of bureaucracy in Member States with regard to applying agriculture legislation."
"In particular, the animal identification legislation must be reviewed to make it more flexible and less bureaucratic."
"Current legislative provisions in this area are far too rigid and counter-productive on many occasions."
"The simplification of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is crucial to making Europe's agricultural economy more competitive, preserving jobs and encouraging their creation, and contributing to the development of rural areas."
"It seems essential to me for the Commission to seek to eliminate unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles at the same time as proposing new regulations in this area."
"The simpler the legislation is, the easier it is for interested parties to understand, be they farmers, national and regional authorities, or bodies for monitoring the application of funds."
"In the same way, the less time these actors need to prepare applications, the fewer errors they will make."
"The cost of monitoring financing will also be lower."
"Simplification is also needed in the monitoring of how funds are used, and outside audits seem to me to be the most efficient way of doing this."
"Fines must be applied in a way that is transparent and proportional, and must also take into account the size of the farm and the local situation, not least in the outermost regions such as Madeira."
"I voted for this report in the Chamber today because it attempts to tackle these issues."
"We must now ensure that there is better coordination between agricultural policy and cohesion policy in the general review of the CAP."
"By endorsing this document, we have given expression to our determination over simplification of the common agricultural policy."
"This process is essential to guarantee the right level of competitiveness in the European agricultural sector."
"It is obvious that by harmonising regulations, reducing bureaucratic burdens and restricting costs, we have the chance for a simpler, fairer and more understandable common agricultural policy."
"However, it should be remembered that the intended addressees of the simplifications should not only be the authorities and national bodies which manage the agriculture sector but, first and foremost, the farmers, who are excessively burdened with regulations."
"The report presented by Mrs Rühle is an own-initiative report aimed at studying ways of improving public procurement procedures in Europe, in order to obtain a more stable and transparent legal framework."
"The incorrect application of the rules on public procurement is, in fact, one of the most frequent causes of errors in the payment of the European Structural Funds."
"I support the main points made by the own-initiative report: a call for better coordination of public procurement procedures within the various directorates of the European Commission, a statement that the objectives set by the 2004 review of the directives on public procurement (clarification of the rules and greater legal certainty) have not yet been fully achieved."
"I also approve of the position taken by the report to the effect that small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular, suffer from the complexity of these procedures, which may sometimes prevent them from participating in an invitation to tender through a lack of legal aid resources."
"I therefore voted in favour of this report and will monitor closely the proper application, in our Member States and in France, in particular, of the public procurement directives that are already in force."
"I supported this report since a public procurement system that operates properly and transparently is particularly important for the internal market in order to promote cross-border competition and innovation and achieve optimal benefit for government institutions."
"The aims of the 2004 revision of the public procurement directives have not yet been achieved, particularly with regard to the simplification of procurement rules and the creation of more legal certainty."
"The European Court of Justice has examined a disproportionate number of infringement cases in the area of public procurement, indicating that many Member States have struggled to comply with the public procurement directives."
"The Treaty of Lisbon has incorporated into European Union primary law the first acknowledgement of the right to regional and local self-government and consolidated the concept of subsidiarity."
"Given that public procurement law serves to ensure that public funds are managed soundly and efficiently and to give interested companies the opportunity to be awarded public contracts in a context of fair competition, I call on the Commission to simplify public procurement procedures in order to relieve both local governments and companies from spending a large amount of time and money on purely bureaucratic matters and facilitate SMEs' access to such contracts and enable them to participate on a more equal and fairer footing."
"A significant portion of the funds from Member States' budgets is spent on public procurement."
"Therefore I agree with the opinion of the rapporteur that public funds should be transparent and open to public scrutiny."
"Public contracts must be awarded under transparent conditions whereby all stakeholders are treated equally and the relationship between price and project performance is the ultimate criterion, so that they go to the best tender and not merely the cheapest tender."
"In order to increase the transparency of public procurements it is necessary to simplify public procurement procedures to relieve both local governments and companies from spending a large amount of time and money on purely bureaucratic matters."
"Simplifying the procedures will also facilitate SMEs' access to such contracts and enable them to participate on a more equal and fairer footing."
"Due to globalisation processes, it is particularly important for the Commission to focus on procedures for the application of social criteria."
"Therefore, guidelines or other practical assistance given to public authorities and other public bodies in connection with sustainable procurement are essential."
"I welcome this resolution, which seeks to simplify public procurement rules, while simultaneously contributing to creating greater legal certainty."
"European initiatives on public procurement require coordination at European level to avoid inconsistencies and legal problems."
"Legal clarification of the conditions under which procurement law applies to institutionalised public-private partnerships is also important."
"I call on the Commission to simplify procedures in order to relieve both local governments and companies from spending a large amount of time and money on purely bureaucratic matters."
"Simplifying the procedures will also facilitate small and medium-sized enterprises' access to such contracts and their participation on a more equal and fairer footing."
"Public authorities must be encouraged to base public procurement on environmental, social and other criteria."
"I call on the Commission to explore the possibility of using green public contracts as a tool to promote sustainable development."
"In 2004, the Commission carried out a revision of the public procurement directives, the purpose of which was to simplify the procedures, making public procurement more transparent, more efficient, more flexible and less bureaucratic."
"As the rapporteur says, 'The main purpose of public procurement is the cost-effective purchase of goods and services with a view to the performance of public-service tasks."
"Public authorities are not typical market participants, however; since they manage public funds, they bear a particular responsibility.'"
"I am forced to say once again that a complex law is not the one that best serves the interests of the parties; quite the opposite in the case of public procurement."
"The more complex, the less transparent and the slower procedures are, the more likely it is that the law will be circumvented and, in extreme cases, that there will be corruption."
"It is therefore crucial that, during the process of revising the current public procurement directives, simpler and more effective rules be sought to regulate a sector that represents almost 16% of the European Union's GDP."
"Total annual expenditure on the public procurement of goods and services in the European Union amounts to EUR 1 500 billion, or more than 16% of EU gross domestic product."
"Against the background of the current economic crisis, public procurement directives must not make the process of awarding contracts slower or more costly."
"Contractors, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, demand legal certainty and swift processes."
"I believe that the Commission and the Member States should revise, in cooperation with regional and local authorities, the various sets of rules applicable to public procurement in order to unify those rules and simplify the whole legal framework for public procurement, with a view to reducing the risk of errors and increasing efficiency in the use of the Structural Funds."
"It should be noted that improper transposition of EU procurement rules leads to a large proportion of the irregularities in the implementation of European projects cofinanced by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund."
"I believe that the Commission must consider the possibility of continuing to use accelerated procedures in connection with the Structural Funds, even beyond 2010, so that Member States do not waste these resources."
"While I support the report's objective of inviting the Commission to simplify public procurement procedures in order to save local government and enterprises from having to devote substantial amounts of time and money to strictly bureaucratic issues, I regret the wording of the second part of paragraph 9."
"I feel that this interpretation of a decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union indicating that local authorities can cooperate without ever resorting to the market deviates from the principle of neutrality."
"That may well be detrimental to enterprises (private or public capital), which thus see themselves ruled out of any opportunities to compete for contracts to deliver public services of an economic character."
"This report throws a little light on the social and environmental standards that we must be able to integrate into invitations to tender; it also proposes recommendations to facilitate SME access to public procurement markets."
"Nevertheless, it has a major shortcoming on account of the explicit absence of any reference to the necessary adoption of a legal instrument specifying the definition and the status of service concessions at the time of the recast of the public procurement directives."
"We cannot settle for the current case-law of the European Court of Justice on public service concessions; the need for a framework directive on services of general interest is keenly felt."
"Legal clarification is essential, for everyone's benefit."
"That is why I abstained from the final vote on this report."
"Public procurement in the internal market of the European Union represents about 15% of GDP."
"Opening up the public procurement market is beneficial to the ordering institutions, because larger markets give greater opportunities for choice, and so for lower costs and better quality."
"How public money is spent is extremely important, especially now, when the post-crisis economy requires stimulation, and the Member States are having budget problems."
"As the rapporteur rightly observed, current legislation is fairly complicated, which is a particular challenge for local and regional authorities and for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Furthermore, clarification is still required for questions including public-private partnerships, town planning and service concessions."
"Therefore, I agree with the main points of Mrs Rühle's report, which show the need for greater legal transparency in the field of public procurement, and which do not call for the current directives to be changed at the moment, but for a thorough analysis of existing problems to be carried out by the European Commission services."
"in writing. - (RO) Public procurement accounts for a significant proportion of the European Union's GDP."
"Its purpose is to purchase goods and services at the best price/quality ratio."
"European procurement directives delay the process of awarding contracts, make it more costly and restrict the public procurers' scope for action."
"Unfortunately, an ever increasing number of Member States have encountered such problems."
"This is the reason why I voted for the report as I strongly support measures to simplify and update the procedures."
"Simplified, uniform legislation is required for all Member States."
"This will enable us to eliminate current discrepancies between the regulations applied by Member States, along with errors, as well as to make more efficient use of public money."
"Public procurement is a very delicate matter which deserves to be treated very seriously as it concerns public funds."
"Public contracts must therefore be transparent and completely open to public scrutiny so that they do not arouse suspicions of any kind. That being the case, public contracts must be awarded under transparent conditions whereby all interested parties are treated equally and the relationship between price and project performance is the ultimate criterion, so that they go to the best tender overall and not the one that is, perhaps, merely the cheapest."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"Public procurement accounts for approximately 18% of Community GDP, and therefore has a key role to play in relaunching the economy and employment."
"Procurement also has a significant impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, which often act as subcontractors."
"In the current context, where the interaction between the internal market and international markets is increasingly clear, European companies run the serious risk of suffering unfair competition from companies in third countries (for example, China), which benefit from State subsidies that European companies are not allowed, and which can offer considerably lower costs and shorter production times due to their failure to comply with European standards for safety and workers' rights."
"We need coordinated action at European level to counter this effect."
"Lastly, I would remind you of the importance of respecting the principle of reciprocity and proportionality."
"For example, Chinese enterprises have access to the European market, but European enterprises cannot take part in invitations to tender in China."
"I applaud the rapporteur for his work and am voting in favour of this."
"in writing. - I am very glad the amendment proposed by the Socialists and Democrats Group has been rejected, which has allowed our group, Greens/EFA, to vote in favour of the Rühle report."
"I condemn the ostrich politics of those who think that the European Court of Justice's current case-law on service concessions is satisfactory and that there is absolutely no need to legislate."
"For years, the socialists have fought and campaigned to obtain framework directives protecting services of general interest, and there is no question of us abandoning this commitment."
"The only long-term guarantee for public services is real European legislation, not judicial decisions, however well-founded they may be."
"As we can see with the difficulties in transposing the Services Directive in relation to social services, only a specific framework can provide legal certainty and quality of service."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises and local and regional authorities expect clarity and legal certainty in the awarding of public procurement contracts such as social housing public procurement contracts."
"However, neither did we want to vote against this report, which contains important elements, in particular, as regards social and environmental standards, which we must be able to integrate into tender procedures, recommendations to facilitate SME access, and a clear call for vigilance in public-private partnership contracts."
"It is essential for European policies on development to be coherent."
"However, this report by Mrs Keller sometimes has a tendency to be either excessive or vague in its wording."
"Very clearly I say 'Yes' to EU policy coherence, but 'No' to questioning the commitments made by the European Union (and by France) within the framework of the World Trade Organisation."
"Our agriculture must evolve gradually and by responding to the difficulties faced by our farmers, who are key players not only in our rural areas but also in our cities."
"I therefore voted against this report."
"The European Union is the biggest aid donor in the world."
"This year in fact, it is expected that the amount of development aid provided to non-EU states will reach EUR 69 billion, marking a 20% increase on 2008."
"The European Union has shown itself to be consistent with regard to the commitments it has undertaken towards the international institutions."
"The clash between Europe's development policies and its trade policies is a reality."
"However, the European Union has made the commitment that all EU policies with an impact on developing countries will take into account the development objectives which have been assumed."
"Contrary to initial predictions, the economic crisis is affecting poor countries in particular, many of which are involved in development projects run with European funds."
"On the other hand, the export and agriculture policies applied by the EU in these countries have an adverse impact on their development."
"We therefore have to deal with an undesirable upshot from this: the EU builds at macro level and has an adverse influence at micro level."
"In these circumstances, the objectives adopted through the resolution voted on yesterday during the European Parliament plenary acquire huge importance and must be adopted by all EU institutions."
"In the face of the economic and humanitarian crisis that the world is currently struggling through, it is more urgent than ever for Union development aid policies to be processed in a way that is consistent and unified between themselves, and which is fully linked to the Union's other policies on trade, the environment, etc. It is now clear that, despite the EU's commitment to development policy and the fact that it is the biggest development aid donor in the world, there is not always an effective link between its policies, undermining the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)."
"We aim to change the status quo, and rightly so."
"We must look at Official Development Assistance from a long-term point of view of bringing together synergies between all the Member States and consistency between policies."
"This consistency must be achieved because it contributes to meeting the development requirements of the needy."
"I support this European Parliament report in general, and consider it crucial that EU actors give their all to removing obstacles to development, to achieving the MDG, to the fight against poverty, and to ensuring that human, social, economic and environmental rights are actually put into practice in developing countries."
"in writing. - (SV) The Swedish Conservative delegation yesterday (18 May 2010) voted against report on the EU Policy Coherence for Development and the 'Official Development Assistance plus' concept."
"The primary reason for this is that we do not support the proposal for the introduction of an international transaction tax."
"Introducing a Tobin tax would simply harm developing countries and lead to greater poverty."
"We would like to stress, however, that there are elements in the report which are in line with our thinking, for example, the point that EU export subsidies for European agricultural products have had a disastrous effect on food security and the development of a viable agricultural sector in developing countries."
"One billion four hundred million people in the world survive on less than EUR 1 per day."
"The European Union has a duty to combat this situation."
"That requires more efficient and effective development cooperation and assistance policies."
"Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments are still not being fulfilled satisfactorily."
"To address the urgency of development, we call on the Commission to urgently define innovative additional sources of financing for development, such as a tax on international financial transactions intended to generate additional resources, in order to overcome the worst consequences of the crisis."
"In the same spirit, the Member States should reaffirm the commitment made at the Millennium summit to devote 0.7% of GDP to ODA over the next decade, while taking into account the absorption capacities and good governance of the recipient states."
"Finally, European development policy must be linked to flexible regulation of the movement of people, goods and capital with developing countries."
"We support the objective of this report for EU policy to be consistent with the Union's aim of promoting development in low and middle-income countries."
"Yet Mrs Keller's report talks, for example, of a developed services market and clear competition rules as obstacles to meeting the Millennium Development Goals."
"The result of this is that we do not feel able to support the report as a whole."
"Clear ground rules are a precondition for the ability of a market economy to function properly and the trade in services is an important element in the development of countries' economies."
"The European Union often comes up against paradoxes of its own creation and the incongruities that its policies bring about for the Member States and their citizens, as well as for third countries and their peoples."
"As the biggest development aid donor in the world, the European Union and the Member States must strive for their development aid policy to be not just efficient but also consistent and coherent; this has not always happened."
"All the efforts to encourage this consistency and seek to keep in mind the multiple needs of the peoples that receive the aid should be welcomed."
"Trade policy cannot be immune to this goal."
"The subject of this report is very relevant, since we know that the EU's policies and actions in several areas frequently contradict stated 'development aid' objectives."
"There are several significant and positive aspects, such as: calling attention to the tragedy of hunger at world level; pointing out the incongruence and ineffectiveness of agreements on fisheries in the face of proclaimed development-cooperation objectives; denouncing the effects of Union subsidies on exports; criticising the liberalisation of services, the introduction of competition rules, tax havens, the capital outflow from developing countries into the EU caused by incoherent policies, the small amount of aid dedicated to agriculture; and advocating the creation of a patent pool for HIV/Aids medicines."
"Unfortunately, the rapporteur herself ends up being inconsistent, notably by advocating the further development of instruments such as free-trade areas and the so-called economic partnership agreements."
"The rapporteur ignores the fact that these instruments threaten the interests of developing countries in several areas, as has been becoming clear from the resistance of many of them to signing these agreements, which have only been overcome in some cases through unacceptable pressure and blackmail on the EU's part."
"I fully recognise the importance of EU development policy and of assistance to developing countries."
"However, I voted against the Keller report, due to the position it takes on the impact of EU agricultural export subsidies on the farming sector in developing countries, which is totally inaccurate."
"Moreover, the EU is a particularly open market in terms of imports of products from developing countries as a result, among other things, of the 'Everything but Arms' and other preferential agreements."
"It should be noted that the commitment made by the Member States of the WHO at the ministerial summit in Hong Kong (2005) concerns the parallel elimination of export subsidies and the imposition of disciplines on all export measures with equivalent competitive effect."
"I voted in favour of this report as it is a particular concern of mine that international free trade agreements should include legally binding social and environmental standards."
"I think it is particularly important for the European Union not only to apply the principle of the social market economy within the EU, but also to take it outside its borders."
"Our partners in free trade agreements should maintain certain standards, and I also believe that we should bring an end to negotiations with states that do not comply with such standards."
"in writing. - I voted enthusiastically in favour of Franziska Keller's report on Policy Coherence for Development, and I am very glad it was adopted by a majority vote."
"I deplore the negative vote of the EPP and ECR groups."
"in writing. - (SV) In the European Parliament vote, I voted against the report 'The EU Policy Coherence for Development and the 'Official Development Assistance plus' concept'."
"Conducting a responsible, effective policy for development should be a key focus for the European Parliament."
"It is something that I, along with many others, work for on a daily basis in the Committee on Development."
"It is clearly absurd and anything but responsible for the EU to take with one hand - for example, through agricultural subsidies that make developing countries less able to compete - and then provide aid to 'repair the damage' with the other."
"The debate on EU Policy Coherence for Development is important and valuable."
"However, the present report contains elements that I cannot support, such as the paragraph on the imposition of a tax on financial transactions and the use of the vaguely defined term 'environmental rights'."
"Large parts of the report - which was voted through in plenary - are very sound, however, and my 'no' vote should not be interpreted as an unwillingness to participate in the work on Policy Coherence for Development."
"On the contrary - it is a process that I am very keen on, and I am keen that it should happen in the best way possible."
"I am particularly pleased about the adoption of the report on EU Policy Coherence for Development and the 'Official Development Assistance plus' concept, which is an excellent report aimed at ensuring greater respect for developing countries."
"I especially welcome the adoption, by a slim majority, of paragraph 70, which asks the Commission systematically to include legally binding social and environmental standards in trade agreements negotiated by the European Union."
"This is an important step towards fairer trade."
"The European Union must set an example in this area."
"Given the current global economic situation, this report is extremely important as it seeks to make the Union's policies more consistent in order for it to achieve the goals that it has set itself, such as the Millennium Development Goals."
"The EU is the biggest development aid donor in the world - the latest sums point to some EUR 49 million - and its interventions pay attention to both countries and their citizens, so it is a far-reaching Union policy, with trade, environmental and social concerns."
"The need is stressed here to promote the access of products from these countries to European markets; amongst other things, the development of Union instruments for lowering customs tariffs."
"However, I would express my concern regarding some suggestions, since it must be said that they could have consequences for European producers, not least those that come from geographic locations that deserve special attention."
"Development aid and poverty eradication are a requirement of the greatest importance that deserve my full support."
"Nevertheless, I think that commitments that cannot be met without endangering the interests of our fellow citizens must not be made."
"Our citizens must not be forgotten or subordinated: we have special obligations to them."
"I voted in favour of this European Parliament own-initiative report, which responds to the European Commission's analysis of penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport."
"Today, differences exist between the Member States that adversely affect the fair functioning of the internal market and road safety."
"The European Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism is proposing in this regard some ways in which to provide solutions."
"In particular, the report proposes a harmonisation of penalties by means of a common categorisation of fines."
"It calls for the creation of a coordinating body, to be responsible for improving cooperation between the Member States in the implementation of social rules, as well as the setting up of inspection bodies."
"Finally, the report underlines the need to provide hauliers and drivers with sufficient information on the relevant social rules and the penalties for infringements by means of printed media, information technology and intelligent transport systems."
"As I fully support these proposals, I voted in favour of this report."
"The penalty systems in the Member States of the European Union show wide disparities, and therefore the legal position with regard to international transport operations has become very hard for undertakings and especially for drivers to understand."
"The regulations and the directive on social rules in road transport currently in force afford the Member States a great deal of scope for interpretation and this results in a failure to achieve uniform transposition into national law in the Member States."
"The Treaty of Lisbon provides for an opportunity to approximate the provisions of criminal laws and other legislation of the Member States."
"I believe that the Commission must use this opportunity to develop and promote such harmonised approaches to checks and take regulatory action so as to remove obstacles to the European single market and improve road safety."
"In order to ensure, as effectively as possible, the implementation of the social rules in road transport, the European Commission should come up with a uniform and binding interpretation of the Regulation on driving and resting hours, which the national inspection bodies should take into account."
"Since 2006, a European regulation has obliged all road hauliers driving in Europe to respect the same maximum daily driving limit and to take rest periods in order to guarantee safety on European roads."
"Unfortunately, the way these measures are being applied is far from optimal: the penalties for an infringement are completely different in each Member State."
"Thus, the fine imposed on a driver who exceeds the maximum daily driving limit by more than two hours is ten times higher in Spain than in Greece."
"In some Member States, a prison sentence may be applied for serious infringements, while in others, the driving licence is simply withdrawn."
"This lack of harmonisation undermines the effectiveness of the regulation and introduces considerable legal uncertainty for road hauliers."
"I voted for Mrs Ranner's report, which calls on the Commission to propose minimum and maximum sentences for infringements that would be harmonised in all the Member States."
"The report also calls for the creation of a simple and accessible information brochure to inform lorry drivers of the risks they run should there be an infringement."
"The European Union's concern about the absence of a uniform system for regulating road penalties at Member State level is justified."
"The enforcement of such penalties, at least non-financial ones, on all car drivers in Member States would lessen the confusion experienced by many hauliers or individual drivers as a result of legislative discrepancies between the country of origin and a third EU Member State in which they are driving."
"On the other hand, the European Commission and specialist parliamentary committees are right when they say that it is too early for us to even contemplate standardising the financial penalties applied to traffic offences."
"The European Union shows significant discrepancies in terms of the economic situation of companies and the population, which means that fines imposed for the same traffic offence cannot be the same across the board in all Member States."
"However, standardising the regulations applied to passenger transport would place greater responsibility on transport companies."
"Harmonisation of the regulations across all Member States, supported by their strict enforcement, without leaving it up to each Member State whether or not to adopt the European recommendations, would also increase safety on Europe's roads."
"Infringements are a serious problem in road transport, which poses significant questions as regards border crossings."
"It is therefore important for the Commission to consider the situations in the various Member States, as well as what constitutes an offence in the different national legal systems and the respective penalties and fines."
"On this subject, the rapporteur argues 'that an effective, balanced and dissuasive penalty system can only be based on clear, transparent and comparable penalties across the Member States' and 'calls on the Member States to find legislative and practical ways of reducing the, in some cases, very substantial differences in the type and level of penalties applied'."
"I tend to agree with the importance of an effective and balanced penal system, and that the Member States should work together to reduce the differences in how road infringements are handled."
"However, I have greater difficulty in thinking that the national legislator should be losing authority on criminal matters in favour of harmonisation at Union level regarding the nature of penalties and the value of fines."
"The report prepared by the European Commission summarises the various types of penalty existing in Member States and demonstrates the differences between the systems adopted by each Member State in this area, concluding that the situation is unsatisfactory."
"It therefore calls on the Member States to apply the social rules in road transport in a harmonised way."
"The European Parliament's rapporteur is proposing to increase harmonisation efforts in this area, particularly at the level of 'interpretation of the application of social legislation' and penalties, by 'categorising' it and so seeking to 'achieve an internal market in transport and to increase legal certainty'."
"Road safety is, without doubt, an important matter, as is improving working conditions in the road transport sector, not least driving times and rest periods."
"We would reaffirm that these objectives are not necessarily achieved through generic harmonisation."
"Harmonisation is indeed necessary, but through progress and not by everyone dropping down to the same low level, as has been common practice where attempts have been made 'to achieve an internal market'."
"Increased road safety is necessary, as are improved working conditions in the transport sector."
"This will ensure better road safety in each of the Member States."
"Road transport safety has always been a concern of the EU."
"The adoption of this resolution is another step towards eliminating serious infringements of the social rules in this area."
"Greater cooperation between Member States is necessary in order to create an easy communications network for all the sector's professionals whenever they are working in a Member State that is not their own."
"A financial effort is also necessary in order to establish an appropriate infrastructure, including a sufficient number of safe parking spaces and services, on the European road network so that drivers can, in fact, comply with the provisions on driving times and rest periods."
"That is why I voted as I did."
"Statistics show that heavy duty vehicles in particular are involved in a high proportion of traffic accidents."
"It is therefore that much more important the vehicle be in faultless condition."
"Drivers' attentiveness falls almost as much as a result of tiredness as it does under the influence of alcohol."
"Consequently, in the name of general safety, we need to ensure compliance with these regulations."
"It is important, in this regard, that the same conditions apply to employees and the self-employed so as not to push ever more people into fake self-employment, who are then utilised up to or above the limits of their tolerance."
"Fines, however, are often an unsuitable way of guaranteeing compliance with rest periods, which can only be possible when a vehicle is immobilised."
"As no expansion of these road safety measures is planned, I voted 'no'."
"The report by Mrs Ranner, whom I congratulate on account of her work, sheds light not only on the differences between fines in different Member States, but also on differences surrounding the types of penalty in highlighting the unsatisfactory nature of this situation for drivers and transport enterprises."
"I agree with the approach of the Parliamentary report, which underlines the importance to the internal market of fully implementing social regulations, by applying more frequent checks if necessary, establishing a European coordination instrument and harmonising infringements and their associated penalties."
"Only by having a uniform arrangement will it be possible to ensure the rapid recovery of sums due for infringements."
"I therefore voted in favour."
"This report by my colleague in the Committee on Transport and Tourism is an excellent initiative towards solving some of the existing problems regarding the road transport penalties applicable to serious infringements."
"The rules applicable in the case of serious infringements against the social rules vary considerably in each Member State with regard to the value of fines and the nature and categorisation of penalties, making greater harmonisation necessary."
"I welcome the solutions proposed for such differences in the report, not least the necessary harmonised categorisation of serious infringements, and the implementation of a system of checks - coordinated at European level by a body with the appropriate characteristics - the purpose of which would be to improve cooperation on the implementation of social rules and ensure the training of inspection bodies charged with applying these rules."
"I would also stress the importance of developing initiatives to provide adequate information about social rules, and create adequate infrastructure and car parks to ensure respect for the rules."
"For the above reasons, I voted for the report brought before Parliament today."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation - Action plan on organ donation and transplantation (2009-2015) (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Mr Mikolášik, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation - C6-0480/2008 -, and"
"the report by Mr Perello Rodriguez, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Commission Communication: Action plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015): Strengthened Cooperation between Member States."
"I am delighted to have this unique opportunity to appear before you today and to talk about the progress we have achieved in the negotiations in Parliament, and also in the subsequent trialogue on this very important topic of organ donations and transplants."
"I personally consider this bill to be enormously important, not only as the chief rapporteur, but also as a doctor."
"I firmly believe that this new directive fundamentally addresses the greatest challenge we currently face in the process of organ donations and transplants, which is the shortage of organs faced by patients who are waiting for them."
"In the context of providing the best health protection for European Union citizens, our goal is to ensure that human organs designated for transplantation are safe and of a high quality."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety voted on the draft report on 16 March, when it was adopted by a clear majority in the context of the rapporteur's recommendations."
"Subsequently, we completed three intensive interinstitutional trialogues involving Parliament, the Commission and the Council, under the leadership of the Spanish Presidency."
"I would especially like to highlight the following points, which were key to our discussion."
"First, the principles applying to organ donation."
"Voluntary and payment-free donation is a fundamental principle which must not be challenged in any way or under any circumstances."
"The altruistic nature of donation must be preserved so that we can prevent any form of commercialisation or financial motivation of donors."
"At the same time, the greatest possible protection must be ensured for living donors."
"Here, I would like to mention the lively discussion provoked by the topic of organ donation by living donors."
"On the one hand, this method remains complementary to the acquisition of organs from dead donors but, on the other, it is an alternative with remarkable potential."
"Of course, it is not our intention to prevent progress in this area, but we must ensure that the donation of organs by living donors who do not have a genetic or family connection with the recipient is always voluntary and payment free."
"The principle of non-payment does not apply to cases of so-called compensation, where a living donor may receive a contribution in line with the expenditure related to donation."
"However, Member States must precisely define the conditions under which such contributions can be made, so that we can avoid any kind of financial incentive or profit for potential donors."
"Other important matters in the context of principles include allocation criteria - ensuring that organs are not taken from a person before the legal acknowledgement of death, and the fully-informed consent of the donor."
"We defended these in the introductory parts of the provision known as the recitals."
"The second principle includes traceability, protection of personal data and confidentiality."
"Member States must ensure that all organs which are taken, allocated and transplanted on their territory can be traced from the donor to the recipient and back again."
"This concept has replaced the original proposal for anonymity, which is inimical to the safety of the process."
"Personal data must remain confidential."
"The third principle is the framework for quality and safety."
"We expressed clear agreement that Member States should set up a national framework which will set out all stages of the process organisationally, from donation to transplantation."
"The Member States will subsequently inform the Commission about the activities and results achieved in the context of fulfilling this regulation within three years of it entering into effect."
"Here, we are expecting great progress, especially in the case of countries where the system is not sufficiently well developed and which may significantly increase the number of transplants through the adoption of appropriate systemic measures."
"I would especially like to underline the role of the transplant coordinator or coordination team, the importance of which is beyond question."
"It has proved its worth in many countries where operations run smoothly."
"I would like to end by mentioning criteria such as the organisation and performance of collections, the specification of roles for competent authorities, the involvement of third countries, the swapping of organs with third countries and the safety of the process."
"We approved the so-called delegated acts under provisions based on the Treaty of Lisbon (I will finish shortly)."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise how hugely important it is to increase public awareness, and I would therefore like to call on the Commission to encourage the Member States to promote organ donation via special programmes."
"I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the successful course of the negotiations, and especially to applaud the efficient and constructive approach of the Spanish Presidency."
"Madam President, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, Commissioner, it is 43 years since Dr Christiaan Barnard said the sentence 'Jesus, dit kan werk', which in Afrikaans means 'Jesus, this is going to work', as he watched in disbelief as the heart he had just transplanted was beating."
"In that time, it has become common practice to transplant a useful organ from a person who no longer needs it to another who needs it in order to live."
"It is, however, also true that this has not yet prevented 56 000 Europeans from being on the waiting list, and has not prevented the possibility that 12 of those people will have died by the end of this debate because they do not have the organ that they need."
"Therein lies the challenge for Parliament which, in this plenary sitting, has to adopt both the directive, which was explained so well by Dr Mikolášik, and also the action plan."
"There is no doubt that we need to offer clear and efficient channels of support for the European public so that no European dies due to a lack of organs as a result of shortcomings in the transplant system."
"Europeans living longer, a reduction in traffic accidents and advances in science are, of course, to be celebrated, but they also mean that more organs need to be available as there are more people who need them."
"The response from Europeans when they are asked whether they are willing to donate organs in order to save the life of a fellow citizen is very strong and very positive."
"The reason that this is often not directly reflected in the number of transplants carried out in each country is undoubtedly because we need to improve essential aspects of our transplant system such as coordination, information, professional training and educating the public on this issue."
"In some countries, we have examples that show that when coordination and training are at optimum level, the number of transplants per million people increases."
"If you will allow me, I will quote the example of Spain, where a model has been established that must be used as a benchmark."
"In addition to the guarantees of quality and safety in transplants and the complementary, free and voluntary nature of transplants from living donors established by the directive, there are the recommendations established by the action plan on the need for continuous training for professionals, and for society to be provided with information and education on this issue, without which it is difficult to work."
"All of this forms the basis for optimising what we could call a harmonised European transplant system shared by all the Member States as an instrument for achieving the objective that we have set ourselves."
"Our objective is simply to reach the point where no European dies because he lacks an organ that he needs in order to live due to systems that have not been perfected."
"In 21st century Europe, we cannot allow a lack of coordination or of optimised systems to cause an organ to be lost so that another European cannot benefit from it."
"This is what the adoption of this directive and action plan is achieving, which is the result of hard work."
"I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the willingness and cooperation shown by both the rapporteurs - in this case Mr Mikolášik - and the shadow rapporteurs."
"I would also like to highlight the major impetus that the Spanish Presidency - represented by the Spanish Ministry of Health and Dr Matesanz, as Director of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation - have given to this directive and to the action plan, because we have been able to count on them at all times."
"I would like to stress that those who have worked so hard deserve our thanks and ask you to repay them by unanimously adopting this report."
"As a Member, I am thankful for the work that has been done, and as a European I am thankful that this step is being taken to save the lives of all the citizens of the Union who might need it at any time."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be appearing before Parliament's plenary sitting to take part in the joint debate on organ donation and transplantation."
"This is certainly an important debate, firstly because it has a direct impact on people's lives and on the health of thousands of Europeans."
"In this respect, I would like to remind you that, despite the constant increase in the number of donations and transplantations in recent years, it is estimated that currently there are 56 000 patients in the European Union on the waiting list for the right organ, and many of them die before receiving it."
"Secondly, it is an important debate because it enables us to enhance the generosity and solidarity of our society."
"Allow me to give you an example: currently in the European Union, there are 18 donors for every million inhabitants."
"If we were able to increase this figure to equal the highest figures, such as 34 in Spain or more than 30 in Portugal, 20 000 more lives would be saved in Europe."
"Likewise, promoting organ donation by living donors across the European Union to the levels in Scandinavian countries, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands would free a further 2 000 people from dialysis every year."
"We should never forget, ladies and gentlemen, that without donors, there can be no transplants."
"The debate this afternoon is going to enable us to give a definitive boost to the launch of a common Union strategy for achieving the best structure in the world for organ donation and transplantation."
"Moreover, Article 168 of the recent Treaty of Lisbon gives us the opportunity to create this common, high quality and safe framework for the process of donation and transplantation."
"We now have two important Commission initiatives on this, which were presented in 2008, and on which the Council, along with Parliament, has worked very hard and very generously in recent months."
"The first is the proposal for a directive regulating the quality and safety aspects of organs intended for transplantation."
"As I said, this directive establishes a common legal framework which must enable us to limit certain risks in all the stages of the process of using organs for treatment, from donation to transplantation."
"This involves guaranteeing the quality and safety of the organs but also protecting donors and recipients by appointing the competent authorities."
"Secondly, we also have an action plan that helps to strengthen cooperation between the Member States, the objectives of which are threefold: first, to increase the availability of organs; second, to improve efficiency and accessibility to the transplant system; and third, to improve quality and safety."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these two initiatives give us a common framework, which is a European framework that incorporates not only the best shared elements, but also the best of good organisational and welfare practice that the different Member States have been building up in this field."
"In other words, it is a framework based on quality, security and innovation."
"We are doing so by establishing a European model for donation and transplantation around values and principles that we all share: solidarity, fairness and cohesion, which are the symbols of the Union's identity."
"This will help to achieve self-sufficiency in organ donation and therefore to combat transplant tourism."
"I am sure you will agree with me that the entry into force of this directive and Parliament's support for the action plan will, in themselves, boost the exchange of organs between the Member States and promote donation."
"Firstly, we are establishing an EU framework to give Europeans equal access to health in general and to transplant treatment in particular."
"Secondly, this more efficient Union framework will directly benefit patients who, due to their characteristics, have a smaller chance of finding an organ that suits their needs."
"As a result, there will be a reduction in the number of organs wasted due to the absence of a suitable recipient in a particular geographical area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, before I conclude, the Spanish Presidency would like to thank the Czech and Swedish presidencies for the work that they did in beginning the negotiations in 2009, creating the circumstances for significant progress thanks to the cooperation of the Member States and the Commission."
"The Spanish Presidency would also like to thank Parliament for its hard work and particularly the rapporteurs, Mr Mikolášik and Mr Perello, for the work that they have done to promote the necessary agreement and consensus."
"It is through the joint work of all the Union's institutions that we have to reach an agreement that will enable us to launch a European service which, on the one hand, will give 500 million people the best guarantees of quality and safety and, on the other, will promote equal access to the treatment on which so many lives depend every year, and also the solidarity of our society."
"Let us enhance what the European Union means today."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, 56 000 Europeans are waiting for an organ transplant in Europe; for many of these people, a successful transplant is a matter of life and death."
"This is why we are here today: to ensure high quality and safe organ transplantation across Europe."
"This is what the Commission's proposal for a directive and the action plan are about."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Dr Mikolášik, and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent work on the proposed directive on the quality and safety of organs."
"I would also like to thank Mr Perello Rodriguez for his supportive own-initiative report on the action plan on organ donation and transplantation."
"Let me recall that the key objectives of these two initiatives are to improve quality and safety for human organs for transplantation, to increase organ availability and to make transplantation systems more efficient and accessible."
"The proposal for a directive sets the legal framework for quality and safety requirements, and the action plan focuses on increasing the availability of organs, and the efficiency of transportation systems."
"The six-year action plan sets out 10 priority actions to reinforce cooperation between Member States through joint actions and the sharing of best practices."
"I note the wishes of Parliament to include in the action plan activities which could not become legal obligations in the directive under Article 168 of the treaty, in particular, regarding criteria for allocating organs, recording the wishes of potential donors and issues related to medical practices."
"The Commission is willing to support the Member States in addressing these issues of importance to Parliament."
"With regard to the directive, I am very pleased that we are now close to a first-reading agreement following swift and constructive dialogue between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"I believe that this is the first agreement to be reached at first reading since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I am convinced that the text with the amendments proposed includes Parliament's key concerns as set out in Dr Mikolášik's report."
"Allow me to comment on a few specific issues."
"I strongly support strengthening the principles of voluntary and unpaid donation, which are essential for ensuring the quality and safety of organs."
"I also welcome clarification that the principle of non-payment shall not prevent living donors from receiving compensation, provided that this is strictly limited to covering the expenses and loss of income related to the donation."
"I fully share Parliament's concern as regards combating organ trafficking."
"However, the scope of the proposal is limited to quality and safety as stipulated in the public health article of the treaty."
"In this context, I welcome the text stating that the directive will indirectly contribute to combating organ trafficking, for example, through the authorisation of transplantation centres, the establishment of conditions of procurement and systems of traceability of organs."
"I also understand Parliament's concern about transparent, non-discriminatory and scientific criteria for organ allocation."
"Although the matter falls outside the EU's sphere of responsibility, I can accept the inclusion of this principle in a recital."
"I also welcome the fact that the text proposed recognises that living donation coexists with deceased donation in most Member States."
"Living donation increases the number of available organs and I welcome the text strengthening the efforts to protect living donors as a means to guarantee quality and safety of organs for transplantation."
"Moving on, as regards the provisions dealing with consent systems and certification of death, these issues are governed by national law."
"However, in the spirit of compromise, the Commission can accept the additional clarifications proposed."
"I also note Parliament's wish to include in the action plan activities which cannot be covered by the directive, in particular, regarding criteria for allocating organs, recording the wishes of potential donors and issues relating to medical practices."
"The Commission is willing to support the Member States to address these issues."
"Let me also raise another issue: adopting a law is the first step."
"What really matters is that the law is implemented."
"This is why the Commission insists that Member States report how they transpose directives into national law: the 'correlation tables'."
"Parliament has always supported this."
"I regret that, for the very first time, Parliament does not support inclusion in the directive of the obligation for Member States to report on transposition."
"Finally, several amendments align the proposals to the comitology provisions of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I welcome the possibility granted to the Commission to adopt, in clearly defined cases, delegated acts under the urgency procedure in this regard."
"I declare that the European Commission undertakes to keep the European Parliament and the Council fully informed on the possibility of a delegated act being adopted under the urgency procedure."
"As soon as the Commission services foresee that a delegated act might be adopted under the urgency procedure, they will informally warn the secretariats of the European Parliament and the Council."
"I also declare on behalf of the Commission that the provisions of this directive shall be without prejudice to any future position of the institutions as regards the implementation of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or individual legislative acts containing such provisions."
"To conclude, let me state that the Commission is prepared to support the compromise package."
"Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Mikolášik for such excellent and very constructive cooperation on this important report."
"There are many challenges in the area of the donation and transplantation of human organs."
"We have a responsibility and must live up to the expectations of the great number of people on the waiting lists who live in uncertainty from one day to the next, as they await the new life that a new organ can bring."
"The line between life and death does not come any clearer than this."
"The tasks of the European Parliament also include conducting a determined battle against the despicable trade in human organs."
"That is also something that we are doing."
"By laying down clear ethical and safety rules, we can better ensure people's self-evident right to their body, their integrity and their self-determination."
"I am pleased that the views advanced by the Committee on Legal Affairs have been taken account of."
"It is hard to paint a finer picture of our common purpose than that of safeguarding people's lives in our various Member States."
"This report portrays that picture very clearly."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, yes, it is true, this is a question of life and death."
"That is precisely the reason why this debate is quite so emotionally charged."
"There are completely different systems for organ transplantation in the different countries of Europe and for how people give their consent or non-consent, whether people's own organs may be used or whether family members can consent to a transplant."
"In future, under this report, those countries with very restrictive systems ought to take a very close look at the examples of other countries in order also to observe the positive effects."
"Since, when so many people are waiting for transplants, that must be a signal to us, not only to create more opportunities and greater accessibility, but also to guarantee quality, safety and accessibility."
"That would also provide an important tool to combat the trading of organs - a truly ignoble activity - and make possible the better regulation of living transplants, which really must take place without payment."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish are the champions of Europe at football, most people know that, and it is nice, but it is not as important as the fact that the Spanish are also the champions of Europe when it comes to organ transplantation."
"The key to the Spanish model, we should all understand this quite clearly, is the organisation in the hospitals."
"In other European countries organs, I am sorry to say, are lost, not because the family members were unwilling to give consent, or because the victim does not have a donor card or had stated that they did not want to donate their organs, but, for most organs in Europe that are lost, it is quite simply due to the fact that the doctors do not have enough time to deal with this matter."
"Spain has organised this much better with its transplant coordinators."
"Wherever this system is adopted, more people can be saved and more people can live a healthy life without having to suffer dialysis and other difficult experiences."
"That is why we should really press home this point in the Perello report to the Member States."
"The directive deals, above all, with quality and safety, but also with the effects on people who are waiting for organs."
"This is because, at present, an organ in one Member State may not be used because no matching recipient can be found fast enough."
"If we have common quality and safety standards, we can also improve cross-border organ exchange in order to help people."
"That means that this, too, is an important point."
"Another very important element in the directive is that we must combat the trade in organs."
"This is a subject that we must not simply ignore."
"For that reason, a few other Members and I have also invited an expert who has investigated organ trading and the deliberate killing of people in China for organs to transplant to come and speak to us tomorrow."
"I would ask all my fellow Members to also take an interest in this topic."
"With the directive and the action plan, we have sent a clear signal."
"Voluntary and unpaid donation is laid down in a legally binding way and I would like to thank everyone who has helped us to achieve these goals."
"Madam President, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, would like to agree with the preceding speakers and open with the words 'life is beautiful'."
"This is a sentence I hear again and again from a former colleague of mine, Vice-Governor Ernst Höger, who suffered a serious heart condition as a result of a tick bite but had the good fortune, in December 2004, to benefit from a matching heart donation."
"Ernst Höger is still alive and kicking, he walks among us, full of life and full of energy and he tells us that 'life is beautiful'."
"We have heard the figures today: 55-60 000 Europeans are waiting for the opportunity to be able to tell us in future, like Ernst Höger, that 'life is beautiful'."
"Twelve of them are lost to us every day because our systems have simply not progressed to the stage where we can get the organs to the people who need them from another location where they become available in time."
"That is why it is our task to put that into practice."
"I believe that this action plan is something really important, that we must ensure the security of organ donations and transplants, that we must also give the living donors, who we also need just as much - I say that thinking purely of the many dialysis patients - the certainty of the best medical standard, and that we must be absolutely vehement in our fight against any trade in organs - in other words, voluntary and unpaid donation is the absolutely essential thing."
"We must guarantee the consent of donors."
"We must develop Europe's systems so that we can close the major gap between the one donation per million citizens in many Member States and the nearly 40 donations per million in Spain, our European champions."
"We should aim, together with our national health care systems, to implement these action plans as soon as possible and to guarantee the highest standard so that the 55 000 who are currently waiting can say that 'life is beautiful'."
"Madam President, tomorrow we are expecting to have this directive on organ donation and transplantation, which is essential."
"In Europe, some 60 000 patients awaiting a heart, lung, liver or kidney have been waiting for this law for years."
"Twelve of them die every day because they have waited too long."
"Like those who spoke earlier, I would like to stress the excellent result that we have achieved, which would not have been possible without cooperation between our rapporteurs, Mr Perello Rodriguez and Mr Mikolášik, the shadow rapporteurs, of whom I am one, and the Spanish Presidency."
"I would like to take this opportunity to praise Dr Matesanz, who was our excellent guide during our visit to Madrid."
"Let us not mistake the objective here."
"The main priority is indeed to increase the number of organ donations in Europe and, therefore, of course, at the same time, to make European men and women more aware of donation, as the disparities speak for themselves, they are quite blatant: there are 34 deceased donors per million inhabitants in Spain, 27 in my country, Belgium, and just one single donor in Romania."
"Therefore, we also have to educate people about this issue of donation; enable potential donors to access information; break down administrative barriers, which is essential; establish throughout the 27 Member States a national authority in charge of controlling the quality and safety of organs, from extraction from the donor to transplantation; and then also inspire - as has been said - better examples of organisation, such as exist, once again, in Spain, where progress is linked to a kind of early warning system, a constant warning throughout the chain, from the death of the donor to transplantation."
"Our directive's compromise, our famous Amendment 106, which sums up all our efforts, sends out the right message to patients, the message of hope, by authorising - and this was sometimes at the end of very in-depth discussions - the use of a non-optimal organ in cases of extreme urgency, especially by encouraging living donations, where this is possible of course."
"Here I am essentially talking about kidney or liver donations, donations which are necessary, which are fast expanding, which are encouraged by practitioners and specialists, and which, at the moment, still only account, on average, for 5% of donations."
"Do more and cooperate more: that is the rationale behind the action plan that has been guided by Mr Perello Rodriguez."
"One example is my proposal for online enrolment in a register, in a national or a European donor register, with the idea of adding a reference to a person's identity card or driving licence identifying him as a donor and therefore allowing matters to proceed more swiftly, where necessary."
"I would just like to sum up for a second by saying that we have done an excellent job and that we preferred the ethics of hope to the ethics of prohibition."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to Mr Mikolášik and Mr Perello Rodriguez for their quite excellent work."
"The hardest question in the talks related to living donors."
"On the one hand, there are long patient waiting lists for a kidney transplant and, on the other, there is the need to protect living donors and prevent the illegal trade in organs and the extreme exploitation of poor people that is associated with it."
"We did not achieve the sort of good result that we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would have liked."
"The safest solution as far as the human rights of donors are concerned would be to insist that Member States impose a strict national system to prevent the illegal trade in organs, if donations from living persons are to be allowed outside the sphere of family members and close relations."
"Although the legislative text negotiated is rather less robust in its objectives, I hope that all the EU countries will take strict measures to weed out the illegal organ trade."
"According to the Council of Europe, 5-10% of transplanted kidneys come from the illegal trade in organs, and that means thousands of victims a year."
"Voluntary donations that are free of charge are also the safest option, even for the recipients of organs."
"There can be no crimes associated with the trade in organs unless there are middlemen and the demand."
"It has been appalling to read reports about how organs are bought in poor countries in regions such as Africa, Asia and even eastern Europe."
"The most shocking have been the reports that describe people actually being killed."
"For example, Australian organ transplant surgeons have condemned the practice in China of killing prisoners for their organs."
"We in Europe must do all we can to avoid creating a market for this kind of criminality."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jiménez, the lack of organs for transplantation is a major problem."
"It has already been referred to several times and it is a major problem that is raising questions for us, both about public health and about associated matters, such as the strengthening of the grey market and of organ trafficking; this last is in no way good for our health systems or our citizens."
"We must therefore fight this crime, and one way of doing so that seems more than important and more than relevant to me is through legislation and proposals such as those that we are discussing here today."
"That is why I want to focus on the most important issues raised by these two proposals."
"The system that we have had up to now is one with enormous inequalities, because it lacks these two proposals."
"Inequalities between Member States, inequalities between existing systems, inequalities in access to organs, inequalities between members of the public: I believe that we cannot put up with these inequalities."
"It is therefore important to reduce them further and these proposals seek to do exactly that."
"Nonetheless, I think that a European system that maintains some of the specificities of some countries, so that they are not obliged to have more restrictive systems, is the response to this problem."
"The work that has been carried out by the rapporteurs, Mr Mikolášik and Mr Perello Rodriguez, is extremely important and contributes to solving the problem that we are facing."
"If we are talking about proposals that are based on, and supported by, issues such as donation, volunteering, gratuitousness, confidentiality, safeguarding of data, traceability, accountability - and here I think that Parliament's interest in helping until the patient recovers and not just in donating is important - and cooperation between Member States, we are on the right track."
"However, in relation to donations between living people, I must just mention that I am pleased that this enlargement with rights has been included."
"Obviously guaranteeing all rights and all conditions, but it is very important to have gone beyond the restricted circle of the conventional family because, if not, that would be another way for us to have other forms of inequality."
"Therefore, promoting donation as the main source of transplantation, as well as protecting the data and security of patients, seems to me to be more than enough reason for us to all be together this morning and vote in favour of these two proposals that are extremely important for the European Union."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (DA) Madam President, I hope that no one here ever needs to make use of this directive."
"Twenty seven EU countries means 27 different sets of regulations plus people from countries outside the Union who have been illegally let in and who, because they are poor, are willing to donate a kidney for very little money."
"Unfortunately, in recent years, we have seen a number of examples of botched work that has affected both patients and donors."
"We therefore need coordination at EU level and, of course, we must ensure that both recipient and donor receive the best possible treatment."
"In a couple of EU Member States, you are born a donor, whereas in most countries, you can only donate by making an active personal decision to do so."
"Thus, we are in a situation where we have 27 different statutory regulations and insurance schemes, which does not exactly promote opportunities for cooperation."
"It is an extremely complicated subject that we are talking about, because we must also ensure that the quality of organs is a top priority."
"For health reasons alone, it is important for us to take up the issue of illegal donation, as we often do not know the donor and hence, his or her state of health."
"It would be very unfortunate if we were to end up with kidneys, hearts and other organs coming from donors with contagious diseases, infections, leukaemia or worse."
"We therefore need to screen the organs concerned before they are used."
"We need to be sure that interventions are carried out safely, in other words, that the personnel responsible for the operation itself are well trained in their field and that the highest level of monitoring is carried out."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, I would first of all like to highlight the work done by the rapporteurs - Mr Mikolášik and Mr Perello - and all the work that they have done to reach the best possible compromise for a transplant policy in the European Union."
"I would also like to highlight the contribution made by the Spanish Presidency and by Dr Matesanz, the Director of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation, because Spain is currently the world leader in terms of donations, with 34.4 for every million inhabitants."
"This is solely due to the constant improvement in organisation and to the measures that have been taken to raise awareness among the population about organ donation."
"We need to achieve this for the whole of the European Union: increase the number of donations, ensure that all transplants are done to the same quality standards, and also promote cooperation between all the Member States."
"We also need to ensure that every donation is voluntary and not rewarded, with the exceptions listed by Commissioner Dalli, in order to combat organ trafficking, which is entirely linked to a scarcity of organs."
"The action plan can contribute to this by helping to solve the shortage of organs and improving public access to transplants."
"The solution that has been reached for living donors is very important, as we cannot forget that living donations are complementary and have been shown to be effective even if there is no genetic relationship between the donor and the recipient."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, to encourage, coordinate and supervise organ donation: those are our objectives, and that is why it is very important that we be gathered together here to enable the development of organ donation and transplantation in Europe."
"Currently, 60 000 people - European men and women - are awaiting transplants in Europe and, according to our estimates, 12 people die every day for want of a transplant, because, while 81% of Europeans say they are in favour of organ donor cards, only 12% possess one."
"It is, therefore, first of all, a question of harmonising practices by following the example of Spain, the star pupil of the 27."
"Organ donation rates vary considerably from one country to another."
"It is therefore a question of harmonisation."
"As you indicated earlier, Commissioner, the challenge is also to create a European network of organ donors, which would allow us to better satisfy the needs of European citizens."
"It is also a question of improving cooperation among all the Member States."
"We must ensure that we can establish national authorities that will be responsible for controlling organ quality and safety, from extraction from the donor to transplantation."
"For example, in France, a person waiting for a liver transplant could thus receive a compatible organ from Germany or Italy, knowing that minimum common standards are applied throughout Europe."
"It is also a matter of reaffirming, as has been indicated, the free and voluntary nature of donation as a more effective way of combating organ trafficking and transplantation tourism and thus, of stopping rich patients from going abroad - to China, for example - to receive a transplant."
"Finally, I welcome the action plan aimed at developing transplants in Europe, on which we will also vote today, and I am delighted with the work of the rapporteurs and, in particular, with the report by Mr Perello Rodriguez."
"I would first like to express my astonishment that a representative of my group has been interrupted in the introductory part of a speech on behalf of the group."
"It was clearly just an error of some kind."
"In my speech, I would like to praise the work of both rapporteurs, which I consider to be very valuable."
"If there is one area in health care and public health that is genuinely European, then it is surely transplants."
"This standard is a logical and very welcome step."
"I would also like to applaud the rapporteurs for leaving out the ethical element, which will naturally fall within the scope of the Member States."
"As has already been said here, there is a different approach and, in my own country, for example, we use the previously mentioned principle of assumed consent."
"Some countries, on the other hand, require explicit consent."
"In my opinion, this is a foundation stone which can improve and expand the scope of the existing Intertransplant, and if it has been said here that this is clearly the first standard that can be adopted at first reading following adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, then I am pleased about that."
"However, I am even more pleased that this is a topic which is genuinely European."
"I value that highly."
"As far as the list of speakers is concerned, the cause is being looked into."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, increasing the availability of organs, improving their quality and access to them and making the public more aware of these issues: these are the demands of the European Parliamentary Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in order to reduce the waiting lists for transplants."
"We therefore need to promote biotechnological research and organ circulation within the European Union, but we also need to introduce a European donor card, prevent transplant tourism, and strengthen our opposition to the illegal trafficking of organs, by imposing strict penalties upon those responsible."
"In order to avoid illegal practices, living donations must be considered only as a last resort, when there are no other possible options, such as post-mortem donation."
"The living donor must not receive remuneration of any kind, other than compensation to cover inconveniences following the operation, to be determined by national regulations."
"Member States should also approve or maintain strict legal measures over transplants and living donors who are not blood relatives, in order to make the system transparent and to rule out the possibility of illicit organ sales or forced donations."
"They must also ensure the reimbursement of social costs for living donors and protect them against discrimination, especially by insurance systems."
"Parliament emphasises, however, that living donations must be considered complementary to donations after death."
"Organ donation must remain strictly non-commercial, supporting the measures aimed at protecting donors and ensuring that organ donation occurs on a voluntary basis, for altruistic reasons."
"Mr Ouzký, many thanks once again for bringing this to our attention."
"We have looked into it."
"It was a problem in the allocation caused by the computer system."
"You will thus be listed in the minutes as the speaker for your group."
"I hope that this resolves the issue."
"Thank you for pointing it out."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, today we find ourselves discussing organ transplants, which is, without doubt, one of the most positive aspects of progress in the sphere of health, but which also opens up a series of problems concerning the rights of the donor and the patient, which must be dealt with on ethical, social, legal and economic levels."
"It is a question of embarking on a virtuous path that addresses the serious imbalance between the need for and the quantity of organs available, without damaging the principle of free, voluntary donation."
"The aim must be that of preventing all forms of commercialisation and illegal trafficking, ensuring the quality and safety of organs destined for transplants and introducing measures that combine confidentiality and traceability."
"It goes without saying that, in the context of cross-border exchanges and significant differences between the transplant systems used in different Member States, these objectives can only be reached by promoting coordination and cooperation."
"On this note, I think it is very important to establish a European database and to adopt common quality and safety standards."
"We must, however, be careful not to introduce pointlessly rigid rules or create further bureaucratic burdens which compromise a process that is currently taking place correctly and efficiently."
"This would not only fly in the face of our aims ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(BG) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing a topic which, by its very nature, directly affects a limited number of people, compared to other issues which are important to health care in the European Union."
"On the other hand, it is a subject of heightened interest for two basic reasons."
"The first reason is that transplants are perceived as a crowning achievement of modern medicine."
"The second reason is that, in practice, all citizens are potential donors, which raises many questions of a different nature."
"In addition, I want to emphasise that human life is priceless and that every conceivable effort must be made to save such a life."
"Statistics show that the situation differs greatly among the various Member States."
"In some countries, a good structure has been set up across the whole chain, whereas in other countries, health care systems are experiencing enormous difficulties and transplants are more likely to come under the heading of 'exotic medicine'."
"Patients requiring transplants in these countries are forced to resort to transplant tourism, clearly aware of the high risk involved and that they are infringing the law and ethics as their life is often saved at the cost of another life taken or destroyed through violence."
"It is important to avoid the commercialisation of organ donation and to guarantee that the donation of organs from live donors is completely free, while obviously ensuring the provision of all the necessary care and compensation for loss of earnings."
"It is particularly important to set up a transparent system for monitoring organs within the European Union, including after transplantation as well."
"I believe that the proposed directive will improve access to organs for European citizens requiring a transplant, increase trust in the donor system and encourage the exchange of good practices which can be applied at supranational level."
"Madam President, we all support directives that help save lives, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work with a report that seems simple in principle but is, in fact, complicated in detail."
"In the area of post-mortem donations, there are issues of a delicate nature to be addressed, such as ethics, the deceased family's positioning, the question of whether donor cards should be compulsory and, indeed, whether there should be a European donor card."
"All these areas need to be treated with respect as there is no right or wrong approach."
"The area of living donations has been the most challenging."
"There is an important red line that cannot be crossed and this line ensures that living donations can be made freely and with no financial gain."
"The directive has achieved the balance between ensuring a good quality of post mortem donations, while recognising the need for living donations."
"Its strength is in its recognition that post-mortem donations alone cannot achieve the supply of organs needed and therefore has set up controls and guidelines to ensure that when living donations are made, they are done in a correct manner, protecting both donor and recipient and ensuring that it is done on a free and voluntary basis."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, myself, have a staff member who was reliant on an organ transplant."
"I have seen how pleased he was that he was able to benefit from this."
"However, I also saw how he waited and how his quality of life was restricted."
"It is therefore important that we adopt this proposal now."
"A thousand patients still die in Germany every year - and this is a fact - because no organ is available, and it is therefore important to rectify this shortcoming and to guarantee quality."
"There is a high social relevance to this."
"In Europe, we have the best conditions to be able to achieve a significant improvement, thanks to the existence of the internal market and the European institutions."
"Let us make use of those conditions."
"I am very pleased that we have stipulated in the directive that donations must be voluntary and unpaid, thus ensuring that human dignity is maintained."
"As far as the fall in donors is concerned, I would like to ask the Commission - it has already proven this several times - to generate a culture of discussion and information in Europe so that acceptance amongst citizens is reinforced."
"I really do not believe that we need to harmonise the differing systems."
"What we need to do is coordinate them and I think that the appointment of a transplant coordinator in hospitals is an important step."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(PT) Madam President, Mrs Jiménez, Commissioner, the ability to replace deteriorated human organs with those of another person, preventing it from being rejected, is one of the great successes of contemporary medicine."
"European benchmarking shows differences."
"It shows that average countries like Portugal do very well in such comparisons and that larger countries such as Spain are today recognised as leaders in terms of organisation and best practices."
"There are some principles and practices to be safeguarded."
"First, the strengthening of any scientific knowledge and information that leads increasing numbers of donors to donate whilst alive and making post mortem donation general."
"Second, the banning of commercial donations not only in the Member States but outside them too, banning transplant tourism and fighting organ trafficking."
"Third, the proactive promotion of donation in hospitals as a way of overcoming shortages."
"Lastly, Madam President, guaranteeing equal access to transplants for all those who need and qualify for one under harmonised clinical criteria, obeying the principle of universal access to health: a paradigm of social Europe of which we are proud."
"Congratulations to the rapporteurs on their work."
"Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank both rapporteurs, who have worked very hard on these reports and have produced between them an excellent body of work and, within, a real plan for organ donation and transplantation throughout Europe."
"We are all well aware of the figures - thousands of people across Europe require organ transplants every year."
"In light of this, I am glad to see that we are going to make concerted efforts to boost the numbers of organ-donor registers by encouraging different forms of registration schemes and strengthening our cross-border cooperation so that the best matches between donors and recipients can be made."
"For me, the key issue is raising awareness and I believe these reports will help achieve this."
"Can I also say that I am glad to see that we have highlighted in these reports the key principles that organ donation should always be altruistic, voluntary and unpaid."
"This is important if we are to encourage people to donate and ensure the quality and safety of the system as a whole."
"Many lives have been saved."
"Many more can be."
"I commend this report."
"(EL) Madam President, the directive we are debating today will concern more and more people over coming years, as medical technology and genetics progress."
"We literally cannot forecast today the number of transplants that will, at some point, be covered by this directive, which may become much more important than we imagine."
"That is why it is very good that the text has solid foundations based on altruism and voluntary donation and requires the Member States to adopt very strict procedures for the whole endeavour."
"However, one drawback of the compromise on which we will be called to vote is that it waters down controls in comparison with the text we initially voted on, saying that there will either be a control or an 'audit', whereas the initial text made provision both for control and evaluation of organisations which will carry out transplants and provide organs."
"This is a weakness and I hope and believe that it is not serious."
"However, I consider that it is important to point it out, because transparency is the key to the issue of transplants."
"(PL) Madam President, transplantation and transplantology need our strong support and, as a matter of priority, they need better organisation and coordination as part of health care services."
"However, it is also extremely important to increase the trust of society in this branch of medicine, especially because every so often, news comes to the attention of public opinion in Europe about a variety of irregularities, including the illegal trafficking of organs from unknown sources."
"As Public Prosecutor General in Poland, I supervised an investigation in which a series of irregularities in obtaining organs was found, including illegal payments made to doctors, which motivated them to look for information about donors with suspected brain death."
"For supplying information about a single donor, doctors in Poland could earn more than one month's salary."
"In the matter of transplantation, society must be sure that everything is being done in accordance with the law, transparently and without any hidden interests, and that this noble medical procedure is not being used as a cover for considerations other than that of saving human life."
"Trust is absolutely essential."
"(FR) Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, today we are having a debate that clearly shows that the evidence is alarming and that, in order to rise to this challenge, we must strengthen the cross-border exchange of organs so as to make the link between donors and receivers."
"It also shows that, given the length of waiting lists, the absence of such action will mean that there is very little chance of patients receiving the organs they need."
"Common binding standards on the quality and safety of donations in the 27 Member States absolutely must be adopted in order to improve cross-border exchanges and to increase donation rates."
"That is why a European framework on the issue is required."
"Of course, we must be extremely vigilant as regards the issue of illegal organ trafficking."
"All measures must be implemented to combat mafia-style networks and transplantation tourism."
"However, care must be taken not to hinder donations from living donors, which must be a matter of free and informed choice."
"We must guarantee the principle of free transplants and prevent any pressure from being put on potential donors."
"We must therefore encourage those patients who want to freely give their organs to save lives, because the risks of rejection during these transplants are significantly lower than in cases where the organs come from deceased donors."
"I would also like to warn those who, for ethical reasons, would like to limit organ donations from living donors in Europe, by arguing that there are risks of trafficking."
"The donation of organs from living donors must, above all, be very strictly regulated, and that is the only solution."
"(MT) Madam President, as the Commissioner mentioned, there are around 56 000 persons awaiting organ transplant surgery within the European Union."
"Many of these cases, as has already been said, can mean the difference between life and death and therefore, I believe that these are important developments that merit further discussion."
"The measures will not directly add to the number of organs to be transplanted, yet the implementation of common practices within the Member States should increase the level of trust and reliability between these countries which, in turn, will lead to an increase in organ donations both within and amongst countries."
"Some of the problems mentioned in the report, such as organ trafficking, cannot be directly addressed."
"However, I appreciate the rapporteur's efforts in increasing awareness on this issue and I hope that these are annexed to the final document in a non-binding manner."
"To conclude, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Dalli and the rapporteurs for the good work carried out on this sensitive topic."
"(RO) Transplants and organ donation save and prolong the lives of thousands of European citizens every year."
"It is unfortunate that thousands of other patients die while waiting for a transplant, even though there are compatible donors available in the European Union."
"This is a difficult and controversial issue which raises important questions."
"Parliament confirms through this report a common viewpoint, which is that any commercial element in this process which may lead to the sale and purchase of organs is illegal."
"It is vital for us to approve and implement an effective system as quickly as possible, not only because we will save patients' lives, but also because such a system will reduce the request for organs which, otherwise, will be obtained illegally for profit and even against the donors' will."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to congratulate everyone on this initiative, because it means improving the life expectancy of many people and making solidarity and fraternity into something more than just words."
"The Basque Country - Euskadi - has the world record for organ donation."
"In 2009, we had a rate of 38.5 donations for every million inhabitants."
"This means that every year, we carry out 60 kidney transplants and 30 liver transplants for every million inhabitants."
"In the United States, the figures are 54.7 and 21.4; in Europe, they are 35.1 and 13.4; and in Spain they are 48.8 and 24.6."
"This success is due to the protocol used in hospitals in order to secure donations and a process of organisation and awareness raising, which are the two ideas that we need to support."
"It is also due to the work begun in 1986 with the creation of the regional transplant coordination system: another example of how the regions can make their contribution to Europe."
"(NL) Approximately two years ago, the European Parliament adopted the Adamou report by an overwhelming majority."
"The report discussed the policies at EU level in the field of organ donation and transplantation for the first time."
"It was my very great pleasure to cooperate on this as one of the shadow rapporteurs."
"Today, I note to my great satisfaction that the rapporteur, Mr Mikolášik, and his shadow rapporteurs, have done a splendid job and, even in this short period of time, have succeeded in achieving an agreement with the Council at first reading."
"For the most part, the key points of the report from two years ago have been incorporated and built upon."
"I hope, therefore, that this directive and action plan will result in an increase in the number of organ donors in the European Union, so that patients no longer need to end up on waiting lists."
"Madam President, I would like to have some guidance from the rapporteur on two issues."
"One is the issue of the 'presumption of consent' system and the 'presumption of the lack of consent' system."
"As I understand it, these two systems still coexist in Member States."
"In one system, it is presumed that the deceased donor would have consented to the transplantation."
"It seems to be quite obvious that this is a much more effective system from the point of view of the number of transplantations made available."
"Should it not be recommended to every Member State to use the presumption of consent system?"
"The other thing is anonymity versus traceability."
"There seems to be a kind of controversy between the two."
"What are the issues here?"
"What is anonymity and traceability?"
"(SV) Madam President, around 95% of us say that we would want an organ transplant if it would extend our life."
"No more than roughly half of us are prepared to donate organs, however."
"We therefore need to influence public opinion in this area."
"Can coordination be improved?"
"Absolutely."
"A heart that is removed from the body of a person who has died is viable for only four hours."
"That is how it was."
"Today, however, it is viable for up to 24 hours if we decide to utilise the modern medical technology that has been developed for transplantation."
"We also now have medical knowledge that enables us to 'cleanse' or recondition lungs, to put it simply - so that they can be used for transplantation in ways that were inconceivable in the past."
"It is a known fact that the lungs live on for two hours after death has occurred."
"Let us push for factual knowledge to be exploited in practice."
"I believe it is a basic prerequisite if this coordination is to become a reality and not just something that we talk about."
"(PL) Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to speak."
"I would like to come back to what is, in my opinion, a fundamental matter."
"In different Member States of the European Union, very different methods are used for identifying potential donors."
"In some countries, written consent is required from a potential donor, while in other countries, it is assumed that if there is no objection, an organ can be taken from that donor."
"These measures do, of course, have a fundamental influence on the number of donors."
"In relation to this, I would like to ask the representative of the European Commission if the Commission should not support more actively the second solution, where written consent is not required?"
"A situation in which organs can be taken from those who did not express their objection to this would be enough to create a radical increase in the number of donors."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, more than 55 000 patients are on waiting lists for an organ transplant."
"Nearly 10 people a day die whilst waiting."
"Organ transplantation - yes, of course, but truly only voluntarily, with a declaration of consent and without payment, in order to be able to counter the illegal trade in organs and, of course, based on the highest possible quality and safety for those involved."
"(PL) I am pleased that the question of organ donation and transplantation is a priority for the Spanish Presidency, because it can be said that this is a matter of life and death."
"Despite the fact that every year, the number of transplants rises, the number of those waiting for a transplant is not falling."
"In spite of growing social awareness, a huge disproportion is noticeable between Member States in terms of donation and transplantology."
"Therefore, besides establishing a European model for donation and transplantation which will use the best practices and solutions, it is very important to improve social awareness and acceptance."
"This is why I am pleased that the model for the proposed measures is Spain, which has achieved the best effects, both in terms of numbers of donors and numbers of transplants performed, but also in gaining huge social support for the idea of organ transplantation and donation."
"(ES) Madam President, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, allow me to start by telling you that I come from Cantabria, a small region of Spain with a rate of 61 donations per million inhabitants, the highest in Spain and in Europe."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Perello and Mr Mikolášik on this report and for supporting this proposal for a directive that has come as a response to the scarcity of organs in the European Union."
"The success of the Spanish case is a model that can be useful to the rest of the European Union with elements such as the competent national authorities, traceability of organs and living donors."
"I would also like to congratulate the Spanish Presidency on its firm support for this issue as one of its priorities."
"Lades and gentlemen, as you are aware, nearly 56 000 patients are currently on the waiting lists."
"Donation rates and the availability of organs vary considerably between European countries."
"The lack of organs is a key factor affecting transplant programmes."
"The good practice that can be achieved produces much greater benefits in some Member States than in others."
"For this reason - I will now conclude - the adoption of this report is essential for improving this situation in all the Member States"
"(IT) Madam President, Mrs Jiménez García-Herrera, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, these days, people are often denied the right to have a transplant."
"The denial of this right is perhaps the most problematic condition as far as social welfare is concerned, not least on account of its psychological consequences, and yet there remains a chronic discrepancy between the number of people on the waiting list and the number of patients who receive a transplant."
"Moreover, the donation procedure is very sensitive with regard to health and legal issues, and is often weakened by procedures that are generally cumbersome and slow, when instead we should be reinforcing the welfare response."
"The European Union must therefore commit to ensuring real solidarity and voluntary action that does not make the procedures any less rigorous, by improving the professional nature and the culture of donation itself."
"Adopting common quality standards is therefore a definite step forwards, which must be viewed favourably as part of a goal to which the World Health Organisation can contribute further."
"(DE) Madam President, I have followed this debate very closely."
"Words draw pictures in people's minds."
"Today, we have repeatedly heard about the illegal trade in organs - about an illegal activity and about trade."
"I believe that this directive quite clearly states that the trade in organs is itself an illegal activity."
"We must not send out the signal that trade in organs could be legal in some circumstances."
"I would ask Members to emphasise, including when dealing with the media, that we want organ donation, in other words, an activity where one party has a will to help someone to live longer but there is no payback except for gratitude."
"Thus, there cannot be any illegal trade in organs because no trade in organs is allowed."
"There is only organ donation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all of the political groups and everyone who has spoken for the support and the constructive tone of their speeches."
"I would also like to express my satisfaction, because with this agreement that we are achieving here today, in this debate, we are concluding a process."
"In addition to the difficulty of legislating on technical aspects that could vary as science progresses, we have had to tackle the practical difficulties of applying the Treaty of Lisbon in this six month term."
"The Spanish Presidency would therefore very sincerely like to thank all the European institutions - Parliament, the Commission and the Council - and all the Member States for their cooperation in completing this exercise."
"It has been an exercise involving, firstly, flexibility and adaptation and, secondly, responsibility and a desire for consensus, which has been expressed this afternoon."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have succeeded in making the Union more effective and relevant to the public, and we should be pleased with this."
"However, as you are aware, the work does not end with the adoption of this directive."
"On the contrary: we need to continue to work towards ensuring that the spirit of protecting public health that we have sought and achieved is maintained when it is transposed."
"We need to continue to work to generate more solidarity and maintain the social value desired by everyone who has been involved in creating and launching this directive."
"We also have a great deal of work left to do in the context of the action plan, which offers us a unique opportunity for continuous learning, adaptation and improvement."
"Thank you once again to all the parliamentary groups for their support, their tone and their constructive attitude."
"Together, we are going to achieve this."
"We have already achieved it."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, following the very good collaboration between the Commission, Parliament and Council, I am convinced that we have now reached agreement on all the key issues."
"I would like to again congratulate and thank Dr Mikolášik and Mr Perello Rodriguez for their contribution."
"I believe that by ensuring high quality and safety standards for human organs, the proposed directive will be of great benefit to European patients."
"The directive will provide a comparable safety standard across the Union and increased trust in transplantation systems."
"I am convinced that the proposed directive strikes the right balance between citizens' data protection and organ traceability, and indirectly contributes to the fight against organ trafficking."
"This is not the solution to all the problems in the area of organ transplantation; this directive provides the framework, clarifies the boundaries of responsibilities and sets some standards."
"However, more needs to be done in the area of organising our hospitals, collecting and disseminating information, proper characterisation of organs and action against illegal trafficking."
"In the latter context, traceability will go some way to redress this, but this depends on the enforcement exercised in Member States."
"Member States are being given a great deal of flexibility, and we hope that all Member States will give this issue the importance it deserves."
"The competent authorities that they need to set up should be adequately equipped and resourced to ensure proper data collection and control, traceability, supervised standards, characterisation of organs and in transplantation and to conduct effective vigilance to report adverse events and reactions which will help all of us to minimise risk in the future."
"President, Minister-in-Office of the Council, honourable Members, from the contributions of the honourable Members during this debate, it is evident that the compromise text which is on the table today responds to everybody's concerns."
"Thank you for your input, your cooperation and your support."
"Analytical Table of the Amendments on the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation"
"- C6-0480/2008 -"
"Rapporteur: Mr Miroslav Mikolášik (PPE)"
"Amendments:"
"Directly acceptable: amendment 106 (Text as a whole, Block No 1, compromise amendment)."
"The Commission is in favour of the adoption of the compromise text by the colegislators"
"I would like to thank you for your contributions to this discussion and to express the firm belief, which I think we all shared during the negotiations, that this directive goes beyond political controversy, because it is about people, about patients and about saving lives."
"In my opinion, more organs and more successfully cured patients will mean that more people return to a full life, to their families and to new jobs or back to existing jobs, making a fundamental change to their quality of life."
"Openness, accessibility, safety, quality, availability, altruism, more living donors, payment-free and voluntary donation - these are the principles we have all incorporated into this directive."
"I believe that this directive will also provide more organs, thanks to better cooperation and cross-border swaps between individual countries, and that it will link EU Member States together in a new and fundamental way."
"Through this directive, I believe we will all contribute something that we resolved upon at the outset: more consensus, more love, more cooperation and especially more happy patients."
"Madam President, the fact that, during the difficult crisis period that Europe and the world are going through at the moment, Parliament has been able to adopt the first directive since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon at first reading says a great deal about this House's sensitivity."
"It also increases confidence in democratic institutions and shows that the Members of this House want to move forward and make progress at the same pace as science and with the same level of willingness and strength of solidarity as European society."
"I do not know if we have done everything too well or if we could have done something more, but I do want to clear up any doubts that may have arisen."
"What I am sure about is that if we fulfil everything that we are going to adopt in this House, we will be giving people longer lives and preventing any organ trafficking crimes from being committed in the Union."
"These crimes may be committed anywhere else in the world, but that is absolutely not the case in the European Union."
"Therefore, if, as a result of any speech, any of these doubts has remained in anyone's mind, as fellow Members have said, I want to clear them up."
"That was not our task."
"We have tried to respect everyone's conscience, the measures of ethics and morality, without losing sight of the fundamental objective: that not a single European should be left without the transplant they need to live, because we can achieve more transplants, and therefore less organ trafficking."
"Therefore - and I will conclude now - I do not know if we have succeeded in saving everyone's conscience with the work we have done, but I am totally convinced that we are going to save many lives."
"That was our task and that is what we have done."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 19 May 2010."
"(The sitting was suspended at 16.25 and resumed at 16.30)"
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I welcome the new legislation to regulate quality and safety standards of organ donation in the EU. In particular, the introduction of practical measures to help ensure that live saving organs are not wasted, such as the creation of a pan European organ database."
"The new law will save many lives and optimise the organs donated by allowing Member States to share organs."
"Before this legislation, if there was no suitable recipient in a particular Member State, the organ went unused."
"Now, the organ can be given to one of the 56 000 EU citizens awaiting transplants."
"This regulation constitutes an important framework which needs to be developed upon by the respective Member States."
"With reference to Ireland, we need an independent body to monitor the transplantation and harvesting of donated organs."
"At present, Ireland and Malta are the only two countries in EU without a national transplant authority to maximise organ usage."
"In order to eliminate transplant patient waiting lists, one of the primary aims of the resolution, we need to raise the profile of organ donation among EU citizens - in Ireland, this could be done by the introduction of a government supported awareness programme."
"Institutional aspects of accession by the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms - Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in Kampala, Uganda (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report by Ramón Jáuregui Atondo, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on institutional aspects of accession by the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and"
"the Council and Commission statements on the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in Kampala, Uganda."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I think this is an important day."
"I know that there are many important days in this House, but I sincerely believe that since the Treaty of Lisbon was adopted on 1 December 2009, the mandate for the European Union to sign up to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms has been one of the big headlines of the process of European integration."
"I therefore think that we are witnessing the culmination of a long-held aspiration that is part of the historical process of European integration, because human dignity, human rights, democracy and the rule of law are part of the DNA of what has largely been the historical process of European integration."
"The report that we will adopt tomorrow is realising this mandate, which the European Union has had since the Treaty of Lisbon required accession to the convention."
"I would like to summarise the content of this report based on three main ideas."
"First of all, I would like to point out that it is not only the Member States that protect human rights."
"Now it is the European Union that protects human rights, with its new legal personality under the Treaty of Lisbon; it is Union law and it is the development of an EU state that Member States can achieve."
"They can do so if they submit to the principles of the European Convention and to a court that is external to the Union and to the Member States and guarantees the fulfilment of those principles at all times and in all places."
"The second idea is providing the European public with a new law and a new court: the right of Europeans to apply to this new court in order to guarantee fulfilment of the rights established by the convention in relation to the European Union or the Member States when they are implementing Union law."
"Even the European Union's activities involving foreign policy, policing, security outside our borders and international cooperation are subject to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"What does this mean?"
"In my opinion, ladies and gentlemen, it means a major step forward, historically speaking, in the process of integration and in building the most essential notion of the European idea of human dignity which, as we said before, responds to the demands of the European public."
"It also means strengthening the European system for protecting fundamental rights because, alongside the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaty of Lisbon, it creates a setting, a legal protection framework that is almost perfect and is therefore the most advanced in the world."
"It also strengthens the Union's credibility in the eyes of third countries, as the European Union has always demanded the fulfilment of human rights in its bilateral relations."
"This report sets out institutional and legal aspects that I am not going to describe now."
"What I do want to do is point out that here and now, a process is beginning, since, along with this report that has been drafted jointly with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Commission now has a position, a negotiating framework that will enable it to come back to Parliament to adopt this agreement and will enable the Member States to ratify accession to the European Convention."
"I would like to thank Mrs Reding for the swiftness with which the Commission adopted the mandate for negotiations, and the European Council, which will do so shortly."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Gál and Mr Preda for their cooperation in the two other committees."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I think that this is headline news."
"Madam President, as Mr Jáuregui was saying, the debate that we are going to have now, along with the one that we have just had, is extraordinarily important."
"I think humanity is taking a historical step forward when defending human rights becomes not just the responsibility of states, which are the traditional political actors and the traditional political players of the last few centuries, but something which, in terms of defending humanity, goes beyond the borders of states and establishes a series of mechanisms and institutional guarantees in order to better defend their universal values."
"The European Convention on Human Rights, which is probably one of the greatest treasures that Europe possesses, and the International Criminal Court, which goes beyond Europe, are examples of this step forward that is being taken in our times towards the globalisation and defence of human rights."
"With regard to the European Convention on Human Rights, there is little to add to the speech made by Mr Jáuregui and to his excellent report, which was drafted along with the rapporteurs for the opinion, Mr Preda and Mrs Gál, on the issue of the European Union signing the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I would like to reiterate many of the things that Mr Jáuregui said, and point out that signing the convention constitutes an element of European integration, which therefore strengthens the European Union."
"Moreover, it is going to join forces with the major new element brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon, which is the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and they are going to work together."
"This is one of the tasks - not only political tasks, but also technical tasks - of the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union, without impinging even slightly on their jurisdiction."
"Moreover, this initiative, which is provided for by the Treaty of Lisbon, also increases the European Union's credibility in defending human rights, as we are asking not European Union countries but European countries to contribute to strengthening the European Convention on Human Rights."
"In other words, we are asking them to guarantee that the rights laid down in the convention are respected and protected and, in this way, the European Union itself, not just its Member States, is going to be subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights."
"This increases our credibility, as Mr Jáuregui's report very rightly states."
"With regard to the International Criminal Court, I think that this is a time that we are also going to describe as 'historic' and of major political significance, because in a few days, the review conference of the Rome Statute is going to meet."
"This is the only compulsory conference that must meet to review the Rome Statute if necessary and evaluate the extremely important step forward that is the International Criminal Court."
"This is therefore an extremely significant event, which today is being examined in the Political and Security Committee and tomorrow is going to be discussed in the Permanent Representatives Committee (Coreper)."
"We hope that next week, the Council resolution will be adopted so that we can join in the very positive evaluation of the International Criminal Court given by other states, such as the Latin American states that are part of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur)."
"We are talking about an International Criminal Court that represents a commitment to defend human rights, and therefore to prosecute crimes against humanity at universal level."
"This is a commitment that has been made by the European Union and by its Member States."
"I would like to remind you that there was a common position in 2003, there was an action plan in 2004, and there was also an agreement by the European Union on cooperation with the Court in 2006."
"All the Member States of the European Union are now parties to the Rome Statute, and therefore submit to the International Criminal Court."
"I think this is extremely important in order to highlight the role that the International Criminal Court plays in the world and the European Union's commitment to strengthening it."
"The International Criminal Court is currently essentially working on the continent of Africa, but the Kampala conference is telling the African people that we are not against Africa: quite the contrary, we are with Africa."
"This is also why this review conference is very important."
"It is open to all states, along with civil society and international and regional organisations, and is going to enable us to evaluate the state of international justice at a time when the International Criminal Court is becoming established as the only permanent international criminal court."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I agree with all the speakers and with all those Members who have been working on the subject."
"The accession of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights is a step of constitutional importance."
"It will complete the system of protection of fundamental rights within the Union, and you know perfectly well that the Lisbon Treaty does not make this an option but a destination."
"I therefore welcome the fact that Parliament takes such a great interest in this file - and has from the very beginning, by the way - which is evidenced by the resolution which Parliament has put on the table."
"In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the Committee on Constitutional Rights and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their excellent cooperation on the file."
"I would like to thank them for the hearing which was organised and which was of real help and great use in bringing this file forward."
"The draft report presented by Mr Jáuregui Atondo is, to a very large extent, in line with the position of the Commission."
"Let me just mention three points which, in my view, are very important."
"Firstly, the Commission shares the position that accession by the EU to the additional protocols of the European Convention - which, by the way, have not been ratified by all Member States - is also very desirable."
"Indeed, many of these protocols are of potential relevance as regards the exercise of the Union's powers, and certain guarantees enshrined in these protocols are also reflected in the Charter."
"The negotiation directives should therefore mandate the Commission to negotiate a provision ensuring that the Union may accede to any of the additional protocols."
"The decision then to which protocols we will de facto accede, on top of the convention itself, will have to be taken unanimously by the Council after obtaining the consent of Parliament."
"In the Commission's view, such decisions should preferably encompass all additional protocols and should be taken together with the decision concluding the accession agreement itself."
"Secondly, it is important to deal with the specific situation of the Union as a distinct legal entity vested with autonomous powers that is going to become a contracting Party to a mechanism initially designed for States only."
"Therefore, a number of limited and technical procedural adaptations to the convention are necessary with regard to the specific nature of Union law."
"Among those is the so-called 'co-respondent mechanism' to take account of the decentralised implementation of Union law by Member States."
"By that mechanism, the Union will receive the right to join the proceedings as a co-respondent in cases brought against Member States when Union law is at stake."
"I am glad to see that Parliament's report also argues in favour of this."
"Thirdly, I fully subscribe to the report which recommends participation by representatives of the Union in the bodies of the convention on an equal footing with those of the contracting parties."
"Such participation is indeed a key element in the smooth integration and insertion of the Union into the system of the convention."
"You have understood this now to mean, in particular, the presence in the Strasbourg Court of a judge elected from each contracting party."
"The Commission is therefore strongly in favour of having a permanent full-time judge elected for the Union, who enjoys the same status and has the same duties as his peers."
"An ad hoc judge, who would intervene only in cases brought against the Union or involving Union law, would, in our opinion, not be sufficient."
"As for the method of electing a Union judge, the normal procedure provided for in the convention should apply."
"This means that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council will elect a judge from a proposal for three candidates presented by the European Union, and I agree with the draft report that an appropriate number of Members of Parliament should be allowed to participate in sessions of the Assembly when it elects the judges of the European Court."
"The procedure for drawing up the list of the three candidates is not a matter for the accession agreement: it is a matter for us."
"We have to do this by internal legal rules, and the idea that Parliament should be involved in a way similar to that provided for by Article 255 regarding the selection of candidates for the Court of Justice is a very interesting one which deserves close examination."
"Honourable Members, the Spanish Presidency attaches very high priority to this dossier, as you know, and the Spanish Presidency would like to reach an agreement before the end of June."
"If the Council could reach an agreement by then - which I hope it will - this will allow us to then start accession negotiations after summer."
"As I already said two weeks ago in Brussels, I will ensure that the Commission - as the Union's negotiator - keeps Parliament fully informed throughout the negotiation process."
"This all relates to European affairs, but we also have the question of international human rights on the agenda."
"As you know, 138 states took a step forward in 1998 when they adopted the Rome Statute creating, for the first time in history, a permanent international court to ensure that perpetrators of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are brought to account."
"The Court started to operate in 2003 and now, seven years later, we have the review conference in Kampala, which invites us to conduct an early analysis of the Court's activities, of the challenges that lie ahead and of the effectiveness of EU support."
"As regards the activities of the Court, we know that the Court is fully operational, but is still in its infancy."
"No judicial cycle has been completed, but the ICC is considering the situation in five countries: one trial has started, another trial is going to start on 5 July and one further case is in the pre-trial stage - all for DAR and DRC."
"Let us not forget that this is only a court of last resort, so the primary responsibility lies with the states themselves."
"In most cases, the Court acts as a catalyst for states to investigate and prosecute cases before national courts."
"At the same time, in its short life, the Court has been a powerful deterrent for future atrocities because perpetrators now know that justice will prevail and, in this sense, the Court faces challenges."
"The ratification by Bangladesh brought the number of State Parties to the Rome Statute to 111."
"However, it is very clear that we have to go for universal acceptance of the Statute and of the Court."
"The Court needs the participation and the cooperation of all State Parties and non-Parties, as well as international and regional organisations."
"The Court cannot perform its functions without the states arresting those for whom an arrest warrant has been issued by the ICC; nor if the witnesses cannot be protected; nor if there are no prisons for those who have been condemned, and that is why the EU supported the Court over the last ten years to help solve these problems."
"We, as the EU, have, from the outset, been staunch supporters of the establishment of the Court as an essential mechanism in the new international order designed to end impunity which, as you know, has seen millions of people in recent history subjected to crimes but only a handful of those responsible brought to justice."
"The EU considers that an effective ICC is an indispensable instrument for the international community to combat this impunity and to promote a rule-based international order."
"That is why we have been supporting the Court using the various instruments at our disposal that the Minister has already mentioned."
"The common position was translated into an action plan."
"We were the first organisation to enter into a cooperation and assistance agreement with the Court in 2006, and we give the ICC full political and diplomatic support with démarches, political dialogues and statements."
"The inclusion of ICC clauses in international agreements is now standard practice for the European Union."
"Since 2000, the European Initiative - later entitled the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights - has contributed EUR 29 million to support the Court directly or indirectly, notably through global civil society campaigns."
"The EU has also adopted several decisions in the justice, freedom and security area with a view to strengthening cooperation among Member States in the investigation and prosecution of Rome Statute crimes at national level, so we do our best in order to advance the system."
"The system needs further perfection, but it needs strong engagement by all nations around the globe for this to happen."
"I am going to refer to Mr Jáuregui Atondo's report."
"I wish to begin by congratulating him for drafting this excellent report which, in my view, provides a comprehensive description of the benefits and challenges arising from the European Union's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"From the perspective of the opinion which I drafted for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to emphasise the main benefit of the EU's accession to the ECHR."
"This step may seem nowadays, in the post-Lisbon period, to be completely obvious, but it has been hoped for on a regular basis during the last 30 years."
"I consider that accession to the ECHR will boost the EU's credibility in any human rights dialogue with third countries, confirming to all once again that the European Union is, above all, a community based on law."
"The EU's institutions, as well as those of the Member States of the Council of Europe, will therefore be subject to external, independent control by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, based on the statement: 'a single standard in human rights, a single Court'."
"From the perspective of having a single standard in human rights, I must emphasise that accession to the ECHR offers, at the same time, an opportunity for the EU to accede to other Council of Europe treaties as well."
"I mean, of course, the supplementary protocols, the revised European Social Charter which, as you are aware, complements and reinforces this protection at pan-European level."
"I also believe that the European authorities' increased involvement in the bodies of the Council of Europe specialising in the protection of human rights is a logical consequence of this single standard of protection."
"Another point which I also emphasised in the opinion that I drafted for the Committee on Foreign Affairs is that a balance also needs to be found between, on the one hand, preserving the specific features of the European judicial system and, on the other, preserving the system of jurisdiction in Strasbourg, which has shown its effectiveness in protecting human rights at a pan-European level."
"Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to thank the person responsible for the report of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, for his cooperation."
"I believe that the close cooperation between the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, along with the Subcommittee on Human Rights that supplemented our work, has successfully addressed the series of questions relating to our accession to the convention, and has correctly indicated the emerging questions that remain to be clarified."
"I personally, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, resolved first of all to focus - and this was ultimately confirmed by the Committee - on ensuring that our accession does indeed represent added value for citizens of the European Union and that the latter are aware of these values and opportunities, although we should also avoid raising exaggerated expectations."
"There are countless crucial questions that must be clarified in the coming period in the course of the negotiations; these include the relationship between the Strasbourg and the Luxembourg courts, since there will be no change in the system of jurisdiction in either of these courts."
"I consider it important to emphasise that reforming the functioning of the Strasbourg court coincides with the accession, and this should be a significant consideration."
"I would also like to stress that this accession will be successful only if it truly reinforces the current institutions, and the Member States' judicial systems must take the necessary steps to this end."
"The EU's accession to the convention is a unique experiment, but it must not jeopardise what is already in place as regards the enforcement of human rights."
"It is very important that we are aware that it will be successful if it reinforces already existing institutions and truly provides added value for citizens."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, the review conference of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is a long awaited and important event in the evolution of the Court itself and, more broadly, international criminal justice."
"The review conference is a good opportunity for the stakeholders to consider the existing deficiencies of the ICC and propose possible changes or directions for reform."
"I would like to mention several issues that EU Member States, as well as the EP delegation, should have on the agenda."
"One of the issues is certainly the position of our transatlantic partners on the ICC."
"I would like to point out that the lack of participation of the United States in the ICC is the single most important factor reducing the relevance and authority of the ICC."
"It would therefore be very useful if our American partners could express more clearly their current position and commitment to the ICC."
"I would also like to urge the EU to insist on discussing - and hopefully revising - Article 124, also known as the transitional provision, of the Rome Statute, which allows states to choose not to have their nationals subject to the ICC's jurisdiction over war crimes for a seven-year period after the ratification of the Statute."
"This is a regrettable loophole that should be removed from the Rome Statute."
"Last but not least, I would like to point out that the EU should strive for the widest ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute in relations with those countries that have not yet done so."
"It must be an objective of the EU during the enlargement negotiations and accession phases of the new EU Member States."
"It should be high on the agenda in our dealings with Russia as well, especially taking into account the fact that we are currently negotiating the modalities of the partnership agreement with our Russian partners."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur for his excellent work on the European Union membership of the Human Rights Convention, which benefits European citizens: due to this convention, there will be a new court, external to the European Union, to ensure that the rights of European citizens are always respected by the European Union and Member States."
"Under the principle of democracy, the European Union and its Member States should always have the right to be able to defend themselves."
"I therefore believe it is crucial that every nation belonging to the convention should have a judge to explain the context of every appeal, just as I think it important that the European Parliament should have an informal body to coordinate information exchanges between Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council, and that Parliament should also be consulted during the negotiation process."
"I would also like to add that European citizens have the right to understand the mechanisms governing this membership, just as they have the right to know what their rights are."
"Therefore, I believe it is essential for the Council of Europe and the European Union to consider establishing guidelines, with a clear explanation of all the effects and implications that membership will entail."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the accession of the EU to the ECHR has been a long time coming."
"It is an essential piece of the jigsaw whose final picture is to be a superior rights regime fostered by the Court of Justice and enjoying the external supervision of the Court at Strasbourg."
"It is a necessarily complex measure because it is a quid pro quo for making binding the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It signals an important fresh consensus between those like the traditional British, who have favoured the intergovernmental Council of Europe approach, and federalists such as me who have favoured the supranational approach."
"Such a twinning is extremely appropriate at this time of coalition politics in the UK between the British Liberal Democrat and Conservative parties."
"Madam President, the adoption of the Rome Statute and the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is a success story."
"There are many examples that show this, but the crucial thing is that, for the first time in history, it is now possible for high-ranking representatives of a State - civilian or military - to be called to account for having ordered war crimes or crimes against humanity."
"The EU has supported the establishment and the work of the ICC in numerous and very positive ways and it must continue, in future, to support and reinforce the Court and to protect its independence."
"The forthcoming review conference in Kampala will take stock and ask what has been successful and what needs to be improved."
"Now is exactly the time to clearly recognise that the States must strive at the national level to adopt laws or implement existing laws consistently so as to support the ICC."
"Many are still slow to act when it comes to arresting high-ranking people for whom an arrest warrant has been issued."
"Commissioner Reding has pointed this out."
"Often, the fear of diplomatic difficulties carries more weight than the understanding that the ICC needs tangible support in order to be effective."
"The conference in Kampala needs to work on the definition of the term 'war of aggression'."
"A dedicated working group from the States that are party to the Rome Statute has done some successful preparatory work on this and has already submitted a suitable text, which can also be found in our resolution."
"We call on the Commission and the Member States to work intensively for the incorporation of this definition into the Statute and thus its inclusion within the competence of the Court."
"In so doing, the strictest attention must be paid to ensuring that no restrictions are introduced in connection with the Court's independence."
"Allow me, in closing, to also emphasise just how important the call for the EU to be represented at the conference by the highest-ranking people possible is."
"That would be a signal of our support for the International Criminal Court, as well as a positive example for other governments."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, my Group is committed to protecting human rights, but we are not convinced that allowing the EU to sign the convention is wise."
"Given that every Member State is already a signatory to the convention, what benefit is there to the EU signing as well?"
"I should be very pleased if someone in this Chamber could give me a practical example of how the human rights of one of my constituents will be better protected as a result of the EU signing the convention."
"At present, Member States are not required to make the convention directly applicable within their domestic law."
"I want to be reassured that if the EU signs the convention, that position will not change."
"I do not want the power of the British Parliament to change the way we decide to protect human rights to be undermined."
"My suspicion is that one of the motives behind this proposal is a desire to enhance the status of the EU to show it is a player on the international stage."
"In my view, that is a very good reason not to permit the EU to sign the convention."
"Madam President, my group very much welcomes the accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is, no doubt, Europe's most important human rights instrument and the importance of the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights - maybe even for Mr Fox - is clear from the fact that it handles an average of 30 000 complaints a year."
"In 2009, incidentally, there were 57 000, and the Court issued 2 000 judgments that year or, more accurately, it had to pronounce these judgments."
"In the shape of the Court of Justice, the European Union, too, has a court, but, unlike the European Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice is not solely responsible for protecting fundamental rights, and it is also not completely wrong to establish at this point that the Court of Justice did not, in the past, occupy the sole leading role in evolving European fundamental rights."
"Both the Council of Europe and the EU are calling the forthcoming accession historic, and I think we in the plenary will give a majority backing to this in our vote."
"I, hope, first and foremost, that it will indeed prove itself to be historic for Europe's citizens, as it will create an area of applicable human rights to which not only 47 governments, but also the institutions of the European Union, are bound."
"In that way, the EU will be sending a strong signal to the citizens of Europe that it is not above the law when it comes to human rights and that they, the citizens, can bring an action if the Community institutions should infringe their human rights."
"The specific form of the accession process itself will certainly create some problems, and it is therefore important that we find the best solutions for the extremely difficult technical and legal problems quickly and constructively and with open-mindedness and creativity."
"Madam President, it is easy to see the benefits of the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It will benefit those people who have been employed in the EU and have been fired for refusing to put their signature to false accounts and becoming whistle blowers."
"They can bring cases of this nature before the European Court of Human Rights under Article 6."
"It will benefit fellow Members here in Parliament who receive extortionate fines for expressing their opinions freely and who have nowhere to go to appeal against this."
"Such cases can be brought before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg under Article 10."
"It is thus easy to see the benefits."
"The reason that my group and I are nevertheless opposed to the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights is the fact that the disadvantages clearly outweigh the advantages."
"For example, there is no doubt that the Court of Justice, in particular, would use the accession to once again extend the EU's powers."
"In ever more areas - the social sphere, the policy on aliens and fundamental freedoms - we will see how it will be possible to use accession to the Convention on Human Rights as yet another argument in favour of more decisions being taken at EU level, which means fewer decisions being taken by the Member States."
"We do not want to see a situation where Member States are not able to determine their own policy on aliens or issues concerning their freedoms, the freedom of expression and everything else covered by the convention."
"These must remain national matters and therefore, the EU should not go down this route."
"Madam President, the rapporteur states in his report that the accession to the ECHR will afford citizens protection against the actions of the Union."
"I would be far more interested in protecting the residents of my constituency, the West Midlands in the UK, against the action of the Convention on Human Rights."
"Of course, in the UK, we incorporated this into our law in 1998, allowing the ECHR to have effect in all our courts."
"In the manifesto of the new Conservative government, it was promised that they would repeal the Human Rights Act but, as they should have known, Lisbon made the EU a legal entity and the EU has greater powers than the electorate of the United Kingdom."
"We are reminded of George Orwell."
"The writing is on the wall and, as we know, some people are more equal than others when it comes to human rights."
"Earlier this month, my constituents in Meriden and Hatton suffered invasions by so-called 'travellers', who have broken the peace and who are building unauthorised and possibly illegal developments on what little remains of our precious green-belt land."
"Thanks to the Convention on Human Rights, these travellers have special protected rights."
"They have priority in health care and education, all at the expense of local taxpayers!"
"The rapporteur wants us to involve our national courts and ministries of justice in this process."
"I say that the Convention on Human Rights has done enough damage already."
"Perhaps the rapporteur would like to visit my constituency and witness at first hand the desecration of our land."
"Perhaps he would like to speak to the hardworking villagers who have seen the value of their homes plummet."
"He can inspect the lines of police drafted in to keep the peace and, of course, preserve the special rights of the travellers."
"He could even enjoy the spectacle of 90 lorries laden with gravel churning up the country lanes where parents walk with their children."
"He might help residents as they rush to install security equipment in anticipation of the surge in criminal activity that often accompanies such developments."
"Of course, these are but small tragedies and are nothing when compared to the important political project that is the European Union, but let us consider that when we propose special rights on one group of citizens, we automatically degrade the rights of others."
"The Convention on Human Rights has degraded the rights of my constituents."
"It should not be up to unelected officials to decide who is special and who is not."
"We have a newly elected government in the UK which has made promises in this area."
"In the name of democracy, let them carry out those promises!"
"(ES) Madam President, more than 20 years ago - in fact 23 years ago - I was fortunate enough to witness the signing of an agreement in the other parliament building between the then President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, and the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Marcelino Oreja, for what were then the European Communities to sign up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"That was 23 years ago."
"This reminds me of the answer that the poet Heinrich Heine gave when he was asked, 'Where would you like to die?'"
"He replied, 'In England, because there everything happens 100 years later'."
"Based on some speeches that we have heard, it seems that everything happens 200 years later, Madam President."
"I trust, however, that Mr Duff's influence in the new Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition government will improve this situation."
"Therefore, Madam President, my Group, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), has been in favour of this accession for a long time now, and we warmly welcome the excellent report by Mr Jáuregui."
"It is his first report and I am sure that it will not be his last."
"We are doing so because we feel that it will increase guarantees for the public, because what we are doing is giving more guarantees to people that the European Union legislation applied by the Member States and European Union laws is in line with the set of rights recognised in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"This report opens the way for resolving many of the technical legal problems that are going to arise, because we must not forget that the convention was designed to be ratified and applied by Member States."
"Whatever the propaganda from some sides of this House, the European Union is not a state or a super-state."
"It is an international organisation, and therefore, there are difficulties in adjusting an international organisation to something that was made for states."
"Mrs Giannakou, who was our shadow rapporteur and did an excellent job for which I sincerely thank her, will talk about the specific issues."
"All I want to do now is join Vice-President Reding in calling for the Council to give the Commission a mandate to negotiate swiftly, and I am sure that my friend, Mr López Garrido, will ensure that this is the case."
"This will mean, Madam President, that soon we will be able to celebrate the European Union signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to join in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Jáuregui, and the rapporteurs for opinion, who have worked on drafting this report."
"I do so, above all, in order to highlight the fact that in the same way that we have been dealing with the economic crisis in the Monetary Union during this year of Parliament's mandate, this is the time to say that Europe will not be built through the internal market or the single currency, but through the people."
"The rights of the people are strengthened by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, this 'bill of rights' that must take into account the political and public dimension of European integration."
"They are also strengthened by the mandate in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union to sign up to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"This does not diminish any of the fundamental rights guaranteed to European citizens by the legislation of the Member States due to the fact that they are citizens of those Member States."
"On the contrary, it multiplies, strengthens and increases the rights that we all have as participants and players in a joint project."
"I also wish to highlight, as Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the fact that we have discussed all the problems - which will arise - with incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights within that shared culture of strengthening and guaranteeing rights and citizenship."
"We have organised extremely fruitful visits to the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights, and we have called a third conference on 21 June which is going to be attended by important specialists and judges from the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Union in order to put together a joint, advance response to what the legal guarantee should be for citizenship rights."
"A British legal expert named Hart wrote that there are no rights without legal guarantee, and there is no legal guarantee without judges, in the same way that there can be no Europe without citizens and there are no European citizens if they are not aware that European integration makes us grow and strengthens the fundamental rights that we already have as members of the EU Member States."
"Madam President, as we review the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, let us be reminded that its creation truly marks a success for liberal democracy and a commitment to effective international law."
"With all EU Member States ratifying to comply with the Rome Statute, we set out on the next chapter of meeting our ambitions and responsibilities in the field of human rights, peace and justice."
"A critical evaluation is important, but the ICC is already an important institution in ensuring that these fundamental values are not just European but universal."
"It is a last resort, as Commissioner Reding said, but an important one."
"The EU and Member States should continue their commitment to the ICC, or the principles it seeks to ensure, by adopting the EU guidelines on the ICC."
"It is a primary obligation to investigate and prosecute those who commit war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity."
"With the Lisbon Treaty, we are working towards an effective common foreign EU policy."
"The High Representative should actively promote the accession to the Rome Statute of other global players - China, India, Russia and important candidate Member States, such as Turkey - but, also, the long-term ally of the EU, the United States, should be engaged in a dialogue of contributing to global justice and should seriously consider joining its ally."
"As a Dutch European, I would like to reassure our citizens that the 'Hague Invasion Act' will never be invoked."
"The EU needs to work constructively with Turkey and the US to stop impunity in Iran, which is one of the most urgent cases of aggressors and where execution, rape and torture are brought upon citizens by their own government on a daily and systematic basis."
"We need to work on the true globalisation or universalisation of human rights, justice and the rule of law, and the ICC is an important instrument to meet this goal."
"Support for this Court needs to be globalised as well."
"The European Parliament has been working constructively and is united on this subject."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what we are working towards here today is the extension of law at the supranational level."
"The importance of this can be seen from a glance at the terrible history of my own country, along with a glance at the human rights infringements currently taking place."
"In reality, Germans did not carry out the most horrific crimes in history because they broke laws, but because they drafted laws that made the unethical legal and that, for example, made the murder of Jews, Communists, Christians, homosexuals and others a legal obligation."
"If such people and, above all, those who ordered these actions later say that they only did what the law stated at the time and it was not possible to prosecute them later on, that would demonstrate an unbelievable weakness in the law and in humanity."
"For that reason, what we have done here with the International Criminal Court represents a major step forwards in that all such people will know, in future, that there is a judge beyond national law and that, for the rest of their lives, they will have to live with the fact that they will be held to account."
"That is a major step forward, just like the European Union's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, something which we, and I personally, championed for quite some time."
"I am pleased that we will be able to implement this together here today and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Jáuregui Atondo, for his outstanding report."
"Madam President, my national party, the British Conservatives - for those who do not know, I am a Conservative - has expressed serious concerns in the past about the ICC and its enforcement of international criminal jurisprudence, as encapsulated in the Rome Statute, in the areas of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide."
"However, the 10th anniversary of the Statute's entry into force does offer us now an opportunity to make a clear assessment of the role of the ICC and, in my view, the Court has, to its credit, stuck rigidly to its brief, eschewing mischievous prosecutions and seeking to arraign only the most serious tyrants."
"The Court's Chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, has skilfully helped the Court to strengthen its impartiality globally."
"The aggressive pursuit of politically motivated cases has, thankfully, failed to materialise, which was one of the big worries of our American allies."
"Britain joined the ICC under the previous Labour administration."
"Perhaps the recent establishment of a Conservative-Liberal coalition in the UK last week offers us now a chance to reassess Britain's relationship with the ICC and, at Kampala, to amend some of the disputed areas, like command responsibility."
"We cannot allow the UK's vital national interests to be compromised by the ICC but, at the same time, we should also recognise that in certain circumstances, the ICC may have a constructive role to play in ending a climate of impunity for genocidal dictators."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to talk at the same time about accession to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and about accession to the International Criminal Court (ICC)."
"First of all, I would like to thank our rapporteurs for the quality of their reports and for their willingness to integrate everyone's proposals in a great spirit of consensus."
"In addition to everything that has been said in favour of this accession, I would like to stress two points that I feel are important: the establishing of a control outside the Union and the extraterritoriality of the convention; in other words, its application to all the acts of the Union, including outside EU territory."
"Allow me to express the hope that the 'human rights and democracy' clauses will thus make a little more sense."
"Therefore, not only must the Commission's negotiating mandate relate to the convention itself, to all the protocols and agreements already enshrined by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but we must make a commitment very quickly to accede to all the legal instruments of the ECHR in order to have a coherent system for the protection of human rights."
"As for the ICC, I would like to express two wishes."
"Firstly, I would like the European Union to be particularly vigilant as regards the rights of victims and of their legal representatives."
"That implies ad hoc legal assistance affording access to specialist external lawyers."
"I have one other wish, Commissioner: that the Union will use all of its weight, all of its energy, to ensure that the Member States as a whole adapt their law to international law."
"France, in particular, has not yet done this."
"I regret this, just as I regret that some large countries, such as the United States, are not participating in the implementation of this international law in the area of crimes against humanity."
"Madam President, the European Union signing up to the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights will be followed by legislation that will make the convention part of European Union law, as well as being another organisation's document as an external benchmark."
"That means that the EU's Court in Luxembourg will have the jurisdiction to interpret and enforce two potentially competing documents - the EU's Charter and the Council's Convention."
"I have asked several experts in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs what would happen if there should be a conflict between the two documents or between different sections of the same document."
"Which document or which section would take precedence?"
"I was told, first of all, that the document or section that granted the greater amount of freedom would take precedence over the one that granted the lesser amount of freedom."
"I later asked what would be decided if there should be two parties to a dispute and each claimed different but competing, and possibly contradictory, rights - for example, the right to practise one's religion without being offended and the right of freedom of expression involving criticism of the tenets of followers of a religion."
"This is not entirely theoretical as the case of the Danish cartoons illustrates."
"This was the case of the dog that did not bark or rather the expert who did not venture an opinion."
"The silence was as deafening as it was clear for all to hear and to understand."
"Free speech will always be sacrificed because that is the EU's default position."
"Denying free speech is what the EU does best!"
"We are talking about two different categories of right - the political right of freedom of expression against prosecution by the state and the right not to be offended by criticism."
"The right not to be offended is considered to be much more important than the right to debate a matter of public interest."
"Should there be no restrictions on freedom of speech?"
"There should be restrictions on those who incite violence, but criticism that falls short of that should be free from interference from the criminal law."
"(EL) I wish, in particular, to congratulate Mr Jáuregui Atondo on his report and on our excellent cooperation and, of course, Mr Preda and Mrs Gál, on their contribution from two different committees."
"The material accession of the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights and hence, to the jurisdiction of the Court is, of course, based on the fact that the Union acquired its own legal personality under the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Of course, some people are wondering why, having incorporated the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we need to accede to the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"First of all, the Court in Strasbourg has, in the sense of res judicata, acquired much broader capabilities than those provided for under fundamental rights, as both the Presidency and Commissioner Reding have hinted."
"Secondly, this somehow forges a link between the European Union and what is happening in Europe as a whole, and hence with the countries of the Council of Europe."
"Of course, some people are wondering if this will cause more general complications, but the report stresses that there should not be any transnational appeals, nor is one Court above or below the other."
"Each court will have jurisdiction for the powers vested in it, as will the European Union, therefore, for the Court in Luxembourg."
"I consider that accession to the European Convention on Human Rights is an important step, as it is the procedure for accession to the protocols relating to corresponding powers; this will, of course, give the European Parliament the facility to become actively involved in negotiations and to help select a judge through the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe."
"Madam President, I am proud to be chairing this Parliament's delegation to the review conference for the International Criminal Court, to celebrate how its establishment has helped build global justice and fight impunity for crimes against humanity and to represent our European Union's determination, in our common foreign and security policy, to work towards the Court's universal jurisdiction."
"In calling for better access to justice for victims, we should acknowledge that 15 of the 24 countries worldwide who have contributed to the Trust Fund for Victims are our own EU Member States - but we should also note with humility that that means 12 EU Members have not given such funding and that 14 of our countries have neither designated national contact points nor responded to the annual survey, as required by the Charter."
"Universal jurisdiction abroad starts with universal implementation here at home and, Madam President, I have to regret that one of the first decisions of the UK's new coalition government is to go to the review conference to oppose jurisdiction for the crime of aggression and to resist Belgium's proposal to include the use of prohibited weapons in internal conflict as a war crime."
"Aggression, the unlawful use of force against another state, was prosecuted by the Nuremberg and Tokyo Tribunals at the end of the Second World War, and I find it hard to understand why the ICC should not be used to prosecute the war crimes of the 21st century."
"Meanwhile, how they justify saying that the use of poison gas or dumdum bullets is illegal if going across a border but not if staying within it, I do not understand."
"They are saying that when Saddam Hussein gassed the Marsh Arabs, or when demonstrators in Gaza are shot with bullets that intentionally break into shrapnel inside their bodies, the perpetrators are able to do so free from the fear of being held to account."
"Quite simply, they are wrong."
"(FR) Madam President, conceived as it was to try the authors of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, the long-awaited International Criminal Court is an initial response to those victims who have too often and, sadly, in vain, demanded compensation and justice."
"Prior to its creation, many of us wanted the Court to have a preventative role."
"Indeed, could an international body authorised to punish the authors of crimes as heinous as those perpetrated in Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia and Darfur not dissuade a given dictator-executioner, who knew that once his crimes had been committed, he would no longer feel safe outside the borders of his country, where he was able to act with complete impunity?"
"In this regard, I would like to ask the Commission and the Council whether they believe the objective of prevention has been achieved."
"For example, could the Commission tell me if, in its opinion, the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court against President Omar al-Bashir constitutes part of the solution or part of the problem?"
"Personally, I continue to believe that it is part of the solution."
"Be that as it may, what lessons will be learnt from the short period in which the Court has been in existence?"
"Having taken these lessons on board, does the Commission intend - and this is my final question - to table amendments during the ICC review conference in Kampala, which will be an opportunity to table and, if necessary, adopt amendments to the text that constitutes the Court's legal basis?"
"(PL) When we accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, we must, at all costs, avoid a number of serious dangers."
"We have a significant problem related to competition between two courts: the one in Strasbourg and the European Court of Justice."
"The fact that two documents will be in force - the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention - will create problems."
"It will be very difficult to explain to our citizens which court is the right one for their complaint."
"As a result, there will be a rise in the number of instances of refusal to examine a case due to a conflict of jurisdiction of courts and the legal grounds involved."
"There is also a danger that accession by the Union to the European Convention will reduce respect for the constitutional traditions of Member States which form the general principles of law today."
"In particular, accession by the Union to the convention should not be a means of circumventing the protocol to the Treaty of Lisbon which guarantees the United Kingdom and Poland exemption from any unexpected effects of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I am very sorry that I have only one minute for this important topic, so please allow me, no matter how short the time is, to inform you that there is a terrible flood devastating Northern Hungary, Slovakia and Poland as we speak."
"The lives of hundreds of people are at stake."
"We should reassure them from this Chamber in the European Parliament in Strasbourg that we are in solidarity with them and sympathise with the victims, and that we hope that this destructive flood will recede as soon as possible."
"I ask the leaders of the European Parliament to offer assistance to the victims, should this become necessary."
"At the moment, there are several dozen towns in northern Hungary that are entirely under water."
"We hope that fate and God will have mercy on these disaster-stricken regions."
"The main problem with this report is that it is important for all of us present, as MEPs, to raise human rights to a higher dimension, namely the protection of human rights."
"Accession to the convention, however, does not increase protection for human rights."
"It is only the ideology of a United States of Europe that emerges, which we do not support, since sovereign countries, the Member States, have already signed up to the convention."
"We also oppose the notion that this symbolic decision should be taken as suggesting that we are part of a large empire."
"(IT) Madam President, Mr López Garrido, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this membership is surely a sign of one of the European Union's missions: the mission to defend and promote human rights."
"A mission that is already fully formulated and borne out by history, by the fact that individual Member States already belong to the European Council convention, by the reiteration that the general principles of the convention and Member States' constitutions are now part of European law."
"So this symbolic gesture is extremely important."
"However, translating this ideal concept into substantive legal rules is not so simple: this report refers chiefly and ultimately only to institutional questions, and is completely acceptable."
"I must say that I also thank Mr Atondo, and am bound to report that the AFCO Committee on Constitutional Affairs - which I chair - has approved this document almost unanimously."
"We are therefore satisfied with this document, and I will not dwell on individual elements of it, because we fully support everything that the President of the Council and the Commissioner have said."
"I would like to make just one suggestion, since the statement about the institutional presence of European Members of Parliament within the European Council Parliamentary Assembly when meeting to appoint the judge and the judges is somewhat vague: I would say that there is a small problem with the relationship between the population of Europe, of the European Union, and the populations of other countries."
"Luckily, the regulation governing membership and representation in the European Council Parliamentary Assembly already states that there can be no fewer than two per State, and no more than 18 altogether."
"Given the importance of the European Union, I suggest that we should draw the line at 18."
"I must conclude, however, and so I will finish by saying that this resolution exposes a problem that it is worth examining in more depth, in other words, the problem that we have already highlighted many times of the relationship between the Courts."
"I believe we must reflect a little more upon this problem but, above all, on the problem of the European spirit: we are the European Union and, as stated in Article 2 of the Treaty of Lisbon, we are founded on human dignity and human rights - and equality is founded on human dignity."
"In Europe, we are not united on this point, and so we must reflect carefully on this concept of human dignity, its limits and what it covers."
"That is not the subject of this decision and this very welcome report, however."
"I thank the rapporteur."
"(EL) Madam President, the European Union is, and remains, an ardent supporter of the International Criminal Court and its role in defending the universality of human rights."
"We all hope that the review conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala will be a real milestone in the further development of the Court."
"The international community is being called up to strengthen the validity of the institution and to safeguard the protection and further strengthening of the independence and efficacy of international criminal justice."
"Within the framework of the review process, various proposals have already been presented, of which the most important is indubitably that relating to the crime of aggression."
"What is paramount today, however, is to make it clear that the European Parliament wishes to stress that heinous crimes against humanity cannot go unpunished."
"What we want is clarity of law and cooperation from as many Member States of the international community as possible, so as to put an end to impunity through fair and impartial process."
"War criminals must be absolutely certain that they will have to account for their actions."
"It is this certainty of punishment that can help to prevent similar actions in the future and pave the way for reconciliation following violent clashes."
"We therefore affirm our absolute support for the purpose of the Court and our devotion to human rights and international humanitarian law and wish the review conference in Uganda every success."
"(PL) The review conference of the International Criminal Court will be an important opportunity to commit Member States of the Union to values which, to us, are crucial."
"Fortunately, there is a general conviction among Europeans that the greatest crimes must be judged, and the perpetrators punished."
"In view of this, it is good that the review conference will take place in Africa."
"Africa is a continent where many crimes have not yet been punished."
"The Court is currently conducting investigations in five African countries: Kenya, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, Uganda and the Central African Republic."
"The impunity of those who commit terrible crimes against their own citizens and against other people regardless of their citizenship must be ended."
"The role of the Court in this matter is crucial."
"If the Court had existed 70 years ago, perhaps the Katyń Massacre would never have happened."
"The existence of an effective court can, of itself, have a preventative effect."
"European states should strengthen the Court in its basic roles: investigation and prosecution of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity."
"It is important that more states accede to the Rome Statute, because the effectiveness of the Court is dependent on cooperation between states and international organisations."
"Therefore, all State Parties of the Rome Statute should join in such cooperation, because otherwise, that effectiveness will not be achieved."
"(PT) There are important items on the agenda of the Kampala conference such as the crime of aggression."
"However, bringing the accused Omar al-Bashir to trial is currently the most significant step in consolidating the universal jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC)."
"It was thanks to pressure from the European Union that the Security Council of the United Nations referred the crimes in Darfur to the ICC."
"The arrest warrants issued by the ICC include one for the current Head of State of Sudan for crimes against humanity and war crimes."
"The European Union must act in accordance with the assessment of its observers in the Sudanese elections, who concluded that the elections had not complied with international standards."
"Even if Omar al-Bashir had been elected legitimately, the European Union should still be demanding that he be brought to justice."
"The European Union cannot continue to give contradictory signals."
"It is imperative that President Omar al-Bashir be handed over to the ICC."
"That will send a powerful signal to discourage other dictators from using violence against their peoples; failure in this case will have the opposite effect."
"Madam President, I will speak on the Union's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I want to underline that I am going to speak as a lawyer."
"I would like to draw attention to the role of the Court of Justice in the construction of the European Union's accession to the European Convention."
"In particular, the requirement in the European Convention on Human Rights that the applicant must exhaust domestic remedies before applying to the European Court of Human Rights must be transposed into a procedure which would give the Court of Justice in every case the opportunity to decide as the last domestic remedy before the Strasbourg Court looks into the matter."
"I mainly refer to the cases where Member States apply EU law and Member States are sued by individual applicants following the application of that EU law."
"The Court in Luxembourg must first be given the possibility to apply the convention in such cases."
"Let us not forget that the Court in Luxembourg has been applying the convention for years."
"In relation to this, I would like to recall the European Court of Human Rights' finding in the case of Bosphorus Airlines vs. Ireland in 2005."
"I quote, 'The protection of fundamental rights by Community law can be considered to be equivalent to that of the convention system'."
"Along with my colleagues, I welcome the Union's accession to the convention but, at the same time, I ask for a very careful analysis of the procedure we put in place, as we need to protect citizens' interests and, at the same time, to preserve what is working well."
"(PT) I would stress that it is with great satisfaction - shall we say - that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and its Portuguese Members are seeing the start of Europe's process of accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"In the end, in a country like Portugal - which has always been at the forefront of human rights with the abolition of slavery in Portugal as soon as 1761 and which was a pioneer in abolishing the death penalty - we could clearly only be interested in supporting this accession process."
"I would like, however, to call attention to the fact that we believe it to be very important for Parliament to monitor the EU's process of accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"We consider this to be essential from a technical, legal and political point of view, because Parliament itself is a House of human rights and one in which human rights are of great importance."
"I would also like it to be noted, Members, that we consider it very important that we are in contact with many third states; this is a very important signal that we are giving to the members of the Council of Europe (the entry of the European Union to the Council of Europe) who are not Member States."
"For these members of the Council of Europe, it is a signal of strengthening, of a commitment by the European Union to the situation and levels of democracy and respect for fundamental rights."
"(SL) Honourable representatives of the Commission and the Council, it has been some time since human rights and freedoms were confined to the level of the individual nation state."
"This renders superfluous the fundamental dilemma of whether the European Union should be based on intergovernmental agreements or whether it should become some sort of a supranational state."
"I think that the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights is a step towards extending human freedom and the freedom of the individual."
"This move will also bring added value and we must make it our goal to make the European Union a zone where standards of human freedom are the highest in the world."
"That said, I do not think that the European Union will become a realm of freedom all of a sudden just because it has acceded to the convention."
"On the contrary, there will still be breaches of human rights and freedoms, but it is important that these rights and freedoms are not under systematic and systemic threat."
"We must strengthen the functioning of the courts and other structures and delimit their competences, and on this note I would like to bring my speech to a close."
"(PL) I would like to say something about the subject of today's proceedings."
"It should be borne in mind that, unfortunately, Africa is a continent where there have been numerous cases of crime and genocide on a frequent basis."
"The European Union must not be passive in this situation."
"Fortunately, the International Criminal Court in Kampala is becoming increasingly significant in measures being taken against these crimes."
"Criminals must know they will never go unpunished anywhere."
"In relation to this, I am among those who are decidedly in favour of the Union giving its support to the work of the Court."
"I do not suppose we can raise any doubts about this, today."
"I think we should discuss and think about what to do for the Court in Kampala to work still more efficiently and effectively."
"(SK) As has already been mentioned, the accession of the EU to this convention is, above all, a symbolic gesture."
"Despite this, I believe that it can only strengthen the integration process, and that it is a further step towards the political unification of the European Union."
"In addition to the symbolism, this legal measure also has practical significance for EU human rights policy."
"On a formal level, it will also eliminate double standards."
"The Union, that is to say, was not previously obliged to observe human rights."
"From now on, however, EU laws will be subject to external judicial checks, which will monitor compliance with the convention."
"A further practical benefit of the EU's accession to the convention will be a guarantee of protection not only for EU citizens and other persons in the EU, but also for all individuals falling within the jurisdiction of the Union outside its territory."
"Personally, I am pleased with the idea that the aim of the Union will be to observe the clauses of the convention fully in all of its external relations and activities."
"It is important that the submitted report mentions the possible technical and administrative complications of the whole process, and suggests how to reduce the complexity as much as possible."
"The EU, as a non-state member acceding to a convention that was designed for states, should take care not to demand needless changes to the convention or to its judicial system."
"The European Court of Human Rights is already overstretched enough."
"Moreover, needless complications might undermine the legitimacy and popularity of the process of EU accession to the convention."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, I have been a Member of the European Parliament for nearly a year now, and I am beginning to get used to what is impossible to get used to, namely, that the debate on every single report follows the same script."
"There are some 20 or 30 of us present in this Chamber out of almost 800 MEPs, with a few of us who are not even here out of a sense of duty, but simply because we do not wish to vote according to the party line but based on personal conviction and sound information, and who all have had the same experience."
"We ask questions but never receive any answers to them, save perhaps for some general statements."
"I sincerely ask the Commissioner responsible for human rights to make an exception this time and give a precise answer to my question."
"The question is what added value and benefit are derived from the perspective of European citizens by the European Union's accession to the same Convention on Human Rights that every single EU Member State has already joined."
"I ask that you kindly provide a single example that shows what new contribution this accession will make to the citizens of Europe in terms of protecting their human rights."
"I thank you in advance for finally making an exception to the general rule for once."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, becoming a member of the European Court of Human Rights represents a crucial step in the Union's growth: the two systems of guarantee will strengthen the protection of individual fundamental rights, both within and outside our 27 countries, if we consider all the member countries of the European Council."
"This is therefore an opportunity not to be wasted, and one for which we have waited many years."
"The doctrine and law, both of the Court of Justice and of the Strasbourg Court, have, for some time now, been working towards this moment, or rather paving the way for this goal, because for me it is a goal: it is a goal for all of us."
"I am therefore compelled to mention the importance of membership for all Union citizens, who will thus be able to refer cases to the Strasbourg Court against a European institution or a Member State because of the wider protection they enjoy."
"I conclude, in the knowledge that the independence of the two courts remains unchanged, as is clearly explained and ratified in the report - more than that, I congratulate my colleague on this report - and accords with all of our wishes, with the obvious exception of cooperation between the two institutions, which respect their own areas of responsibility."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to clarify two things."
"Firstly, the articles that are in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that are also in the European Convention on Human Rights are the same and mean the same thing: Articles 52 and 53 of the Charter; there is therefore no contradiction."
"Secondly, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights is supranational."
"Therefore, if someone wants to apply to it due to a European Union decision or the application of Union law, they will first have to apply to the Court of Justice of the European Union for a preliminary ruling."
"I understand that Europhobes always want to vote against Europe, but at least out of parliamentary courtesy, they should read Mr Jáuregui's report, which sets everything out clearly."
"Madam President, in relation to the first point regarding the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I would like to join in congratulating the rapporteurs and also the Commission for the way in which it has very quickly put forward a draft mandate for negotiation."
"I would also like to welcome the speech by Mr Duff, who said quite clearly that the government that has been formed in the United Kingdom between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats is absolutely in favour of the European Union signing the European Union Convention on Human Rights, and therefore of complying with the Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, some of Mr Duff's compatriots said exactly the opposite: representatives of the European Conservatives and Reformists and the representative of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group - who is not British - along with Mrs Sinclaire and subsequently Mrs Morvai, who said quite clearly, 'Why does the European Union need to sign the European Convention on Human Rights if the Member States are already parties to it?'"
"What has happened is that the Member States have transferred some of their competences and powers to the European Union, so they are not exercised by the Member States but by the European Union."
"The European Union could therefore theoretically infringe the European Convention on Human Rights."
"This is the case unless it is considered that the European Union does not have any power or any competences whatsoever, but it does have powers and competences that have been transferred by the Member States."
"This means that it is not enough for the Member States to have signed the convention."
"The Union needs to sign it too in order to complete the protection of human rights throughout the whole of the European Union."
"I do not understand how people such as the representatives of the two groups that I mentioned, who have demonstrated their obvious euroscepticism, are refusing supranational control over the European Union."
"It is absolutely contradictory for someone who wants the European Union to be controlled or considers that everything that the European Union does is bad or that wretched bureaucrats are doing everything badly to be refusing supranational control over the European Union."
"This is absolutely contradictory."
"There will be other reasons to do with human rights or to do with an international organisation that defends human rights being more legitimate, stronger and more solid."
"There may be other reasons, but not the ones being given."
"I believe that the need to sign the convention is very clear, and I also believe that it needs to be done with the speed with which the Commission has already begun to act. As Mr Méndez de Vigo said, the Commission has acted quickly and the Council needs to do the same."
"I am sure that the mandate for starting negotiations will be adopted on 4 June at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels, so he does not need to worry."
"With regard to the issue of the International Criminal Court, I think that the review conference is a very important meeting."
"It is a very important meeting which the Presidency, on behalf of which I am speaking, is going to attend in order to clearly establish and reaffirm that the Member States have to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, and that they are going to work along those lines, naturally based on the principle of complementarity, which is a basic principle of operation of the Criminal Court."
"I agree with one of the major objectives of this conference, which is to introduce the crime of aggression, and also with removing from the Rome Statute the possibility of delaying for seven years before handing over possible or alleged war criminals."
"I also agree with the issue being debated - a proposal put forward by Belgium - as to whether the use of certain weapons in conflicts can constitute a war crime in itself."
"In any case, the Presidency will make a statement supporting the Criminal Court and will also give an evaluation of what the Criminal Court has meant."
"I also presume that many Members will be at the debates at the Kampala conference."
"I therefore believe that this is a very important conference, with great political, symbolic and legal significance; decisions will be taken that affect legal texts."
"I am, of course, very grateful to Parliament for holding this debate today, which has enabled us to reaffirm our common values and also to recall that basically, when we talk about the International Criminal Court, we are talking about people who have suffered the atrocities that the Rome Statute seeks to prosecute, and that it is ultimately about fighting impunity and making it clear that in the 21st century, there is no room for impunity."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Convention on Human Rights are extraordinary texts."
"They are the basis of the values on which we have been building our society and our European Union."
"I think they are much too important and much too historical to give way to party political polemics."
"I must say that I am very proud indeed that, at this moment in the construction of the European Union, we can go ahead by putting the Charter of Fundamental Rights into practice and by acceding to the Convention on Human Rights."
"When I hear what your rapporteur, Diego López Garrido, and your co-rapporteurs, Cristian Dan Preda and Kinga Gál, have said in your name in this Parliament, I know that you are also very conscious about the historical task which is now in our hands."
"The added value of the accession has been very well explained in those texts and in the contributions of many of the Members."
"The Member States have all signed up to the Convention but they have also - as the Minister-in-Office of the Council just explained - transferred substantial competences to the European Union."
"It is therefore normal that the European Union, when it acts as a European Union, will be subject to the same external control of the specialised Court on Human Rights as are the Member States."
"To give one very concrete example, there could be a decision of the European Commission against an industry in the area of competition law which could be potentially challenged directly before the Court in Strasbourg, which is something that is difficult to do today."
"As you have already pointed out, there will be a lot of very concrete examples: concrete examples which will help the citizens because - and this is something new - they will now have a double guarantee."
"The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg will judge on the basis of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which, by the way, is binding for all Member States."
"That should be clearly stated once and for all."
"I cannot understand how somebody who has an elected mandate and has been elected by citizens can call into question the rights of those citizens."
"It is better for citizens to have twice the rights than to have zero rights."
"Here, we are giving them twice the rights, and that is what Europe is about."
"Europe is about rights for European citizens and I am very proud that this House is standing for those rights."
"Yes, we will now have the bills of rights where the citizens will know that they can go to the courts in order to have their rights taken seriously."
"The question of whether or not we shall now be part of the Convention on Human Rights is not a question anymore because Article 6 of the treaty obliges the EU to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"So I do not think we should discuss this any further because that is simply done."
"We should also know that this accession will leave the position of the individual Member States, vis-à-vis the convention, completely unaffected as long as there is no European law at stake."
"This will continue to be the case."
"The individual relationship between a Member State and the convention will stay exactly the same as it is."
"Now there will be supplementary guarantees concerning the EU law."
"Of course the issue of the risk of conflicting jurisprudence has to be analysed."
"It is being analysed and I am grateful to the rapporteur who has taken this issue on board."
"We have so far seen that these conflicts are considered to be minimal because the convention is already part of the norms which the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg takes into account today and the convention will operate as a minimum standard."
"The Commission expects case-law of Strasbourg and of Luxembourg to develop harmoniously and converge in the coming years."
"I now move to more specific questions."
"On litigation: that is not an issue for the European Court of Human Rights or of the European Court of Justice."
"For the moment, that is an issue for the British system of litigation, and I have already started to discuss this with the British Government to see if they could review this system of litigation, which can, in certain cases, when it comes to the freedom of the press for instance, become very harmful indeed."
"The European Parliament has so far, under the leadership of its rapporteurs, done very good work."
"I count on Parliament to continue to participate in a process which will certainly be a difficult process, a long process, where we have to solve the technical problems - and technical problems can become very political indeed - so I count on Parliament to continue to participate in this very difficult task."
"As for relations between the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I leave that in the hands of Parliament."
"If you need a helping hand, I will be there to help you in that respect, but it is a matter for the parliamentarians themselves to see that they find a common ground and I believe that it should not be that difficult."
"Concerning the ICC, this Parliament has already received the Prosecutor, Mr Moreno-Ocampo, and the President of the Court, Mr Song."
"I think this was a very strong political signal from the European Parliament that Parliament is taking seriously human rights, not only within Europe, but also outside Europe."
"We also believe that the Kampala conference is the most important international conference devoted to international justice in a decade."
"We have to make it count."
"There again, I count on Parliament also because I know that Members will be present and will be speaking up in Kampala."
"We know that the EU has played and will play an important role by integrating the outcomes of the conference into its policies on international justice, on its assistance to third states and, most of all, into all the negotiations which will take place in the coming months and years."
"In particular, we will continue to support national capacity building in order to strengthen and enable national jurisdictions to conduct credible and effective national investigations and trials of Rome Statute crimes."
"Our policy in this respect remains unchanged and undiminished, but we now have a new tool, and the new tool is the Lisbon Treaty, which gives us a new capacity to be more consistent and more effective in our support to the Court."
"In line with the encouragement by Parliament and expressed in the resolution and during the debate, the High Representative/Vice-President and her services will continue resolutely to promote universal accession to the Rome Statute."
"We will do that systematically in all our discussions with partners outside of Europe."
"There were two very specific questions which I would like to answer briefly."
"The first was whether an arrest warrant against President al-Bashir is a part of the solution or part of the problem."
"The Commission clearly sees this as part of a long-term solution because this arrest warrant shows that, with the establishment of the Court, justice has become imminent."
"Whoever the person is, even if this person is a Head of State, and even if this arrest warrant is not immediately enforced, it will not disappear because the ICC is a permanent court, so let me assure you that the EU will continue to call on Sudan to cooperate fully with the Court."
"On the question of whether the Commission will present amendments in the Kampala meeting, here the answer is 'no' because the EU, as such, is not a party - it is the Member States who will negotiate the amendments."
"However, the Commission will play an active role in the stock-taking part of the conference, and we count fully on the Spanish Presidency to lead the European nations so that their voice will make a big difference in this conference."
"Madam President, I would like to express my thanks to all those who have spoken, because the vast majority of them have expressed a very favourable position regarding the accession agreement that we are going to vote on tomorrow; in fact, it has almost been unanimous."
"I would especially like to thank Mrs Reding for giving us the opportunity to continue working together, as there are very complex negotiations to come and I believe that Parliament needs to be very close to those negotiations."
"I would like to answer a few questions and clarify a few things very quickly."
"Accession is not a symbolic act, ladies and gentlemen: it has legal value."
"Some are asking what the point is, and what it adds."
"I will give you an example."
"Let us suppose that a competition for European Union staff discriminates against Hungarian lawyers, for example, for some technical reason or any reason at all."
"Where do the Hungarian lawyers take their complaint?"
"To the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"What does accession add?"
"The opportunity for these lawyers to take their complaint to the European Court of Human Rights if their right to equality has not been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union."
"It is a new court, it is a new opportunity for guaranteeing fundamental human rights, for example, the right to equality."
"It is therefore clear that this event does not make a symbolic contribution but a legal contribution."
"I would like to clarify two things, ladies and gentlemen."
"Members have expressed their desire for the negotiations not to be limited to accession to the European Convention on Human Rights, but for the protocols that the convention has been building up over the years to be incorporated, especially those that refer to the rights acknowledged by the Charter of Fundamental Rights, as that will provide equivalence between the two documents."
"Finally, Parliament is also calling for accession to Convention and Council of Europe bodies and authorities, because this will enable recognition of the universal human rights protection system, including the Turin European Social Charter."
"I have received one motion for a resolution at the end of the debate."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday, 19 May 2010."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon creates the legal framework for the European Union's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights (ECHR), thereby making the EU the 48th signatory to the convention."
"The EU's accession to the ECHR will supplement the level of protection established by the Treaty of Lisbon through the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has binding legal force."
"The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will acquire the authority to exercise judicial control over the acts of the EU's institutions, bodies and agencies, including decisions made by the European Court of Justice, with regard to compliance with the convention, thereby creating an additional layer of judicial control over fundamental rights within the EU."
"Following the EU's accession, the convention will provide the minimum standard of protection for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Europe and will be applied on a mandatory basis, especially in situations where the level of protection provided by the EU is lower than that offered within the convention."
"I believe that both Member States and the Commission will have to prepare information briefings which will provide explanations about all the implications and effects of accession so that the EU's citizens are fully aware of the significance of this process."
"The European Union's accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a logical step following on from the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and enhances the depth of integration and creation of a common political area."
"The EU's accession to the ECHR will provide greater coherence between the European Union and the countries belonging to the Council of Europe and its pan-European human rights system."
"In my opinion, the most important upshot of accession to the ECHR is that it will provide citizens with protection against the actions of the EU, similar to the protection they enjoy against the actions of all Member States."
"This is a substantial development, given that Member States have transferred important powers to the European Union."
"It is logical to have the option of appeal to the European Court of Human Rights concerning decisions made by the EU as a whole."
"As we talk about European citizenship, we must also provide it with specific content, which includes offering this option."
"I hope that this additional instrument made available to European citizens will be easily accessible and, in particular, that the decision to accede to this convention will help create a more coherent framework for human rights within the European Union."
"In connection with the forthcoming negotiations on accession by the Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, I would like to draw attention to the matter of external relations."
"This is an area which will be particularly affected by the Union's accession to the convention."
"Why?"
"Firstly, I will permit myself to remind us that under the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Court of Justice has very limited jurisdiction in the area of foreign policy."
"Accession to the convention will partly make up for these limitations by ensuring external judicial supervision of all aspects of the Union's activity."
"The Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg will gain the right to assess how the Union observes fundamental rights in all areas of its activity, and so also in foreign policy."
"Secondly, it is not necessary to remind anyone how often discussion on the subject of the necessity to observe human rights comes up in the Union's relations with third countries, including in the forum of the European Parliament."
"Accession to the convention will, therefore, give the Union credibility in dialogue with third countries on human rights."
"There is no doubt that by submitting to the supervision of the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the Union has the opportunity to strengthen the human rights aspect of foreign policy and security and, in so doing, to promote the idea of human rights more effectively around the world, to the extent that the EU treats its own human rights obligations seriously."
"Let us hope that this is how it will be."
"(PL) Accession by the European Union to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is, without doubt, a step in the right direction on the road to ensuring our citizens equal and fair privileges."
"We must make sure its principles are upheld in all Member States."
"This will also improve legislative cohesion between the Union and the countries of the Council of Europe, and will increase the number of institutions to which citizens will be able to appeal if their rights have been breached."
"It will also raise the significance and credibility of numerous initiatives of the European Parliament in the area of the protection of fundamental freedoms, which are the right of every person."
"However, let us not forget that as well as upholding the rights of the people of third countries, the Union should first take care that these rights are not broken in the Member States."
"There is a country in the European Union where, for nearly 20 years, the human rights and fundamental freedoms of about 20% of the population have been violated."
"Regardless of this fact, Latvia was accepted into the European Union in 2004."
"At the time that Latvia's accession negotiations were taking place, the Latvian Government promised the then EU Enlargement Commissioner, Günther Verheugen, to solve the non-citizen problem, but to this day, regardless of those promises, the question has not been resolved."
"As a result, there are approximately 340 000 non-citizens living in EU territory."
"In Latvia, they are second-class people, who are not allowed to work in the public sector, or hold official posts even in districts where more than 60% of the population are non-citizens."
"There is a city in Latvia, Daugavpils, where more than 90% of the population is Russian-speaking."
"Despite this fact, the use of Russian as an official language in the city is forbidden, and 30% of the population do not have the vote in local elections."
"Local councillors, elected in a Russian-speaking city, are not allowed to use their mother tongue in meetings."
"Funny though it may be, to this very day, the European Commission has found neither the necessary arguments nor the time to influence the Latvian Government to bring to an end discrimination on grounds of language."
"It is essential to set up a working group to investigate the situation in Latvia without delay, otherwise I do not see the point of the EU's being a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"We must make it known clearly and unambiguously that there is a country within the European Union where the rights of more than 25% of the population have been cynically violated over many years."
"When we talk about accession of the European Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights, we are talking about work which has been going on for 10 years now and about many fears concerning, inter alia, competition between the Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights."
"This will certainly lead to problems in the area of jurisdiction and the autonomy of the Court of Justice."
"I think, however, that what we have achieved after those 10 years can mean complementarity of the two systems, so perhaps we should depart from such hierarchical thinking."
"The Court of Justice has, for a long time, been following the work of the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg and vice versa."
"Both these systems coexist and there is no competition between them, so perhaps those fears are unjustified."
"We need accession to the convention for symbolic reasons but, above all, we need the convention because it will complement the system of protection of human rights in the European Union and will give it greater credibility in the eyes of its citizens, for they will gain protection against the European Union and its institutions, and not only against the Member States, as has been the case until now."
"So we should be glad that the system will be strengthened."
"However, we do need a certain loyalty, so that we do not undermine the credibility of the system."
"This is why we propose that Member States do not prosecute each other on matters of EU law by using the possibilities afforded by the convention."
"Stockholm Action Plan (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Stockholm Action Plan."
"The previous debate was very interesting, but we have exceeded our allocated time, so I ask all those who are about to speak to stick closely to the time allocated."
"Madam President, the European area of freedom, security and justice is one of the European Union's greatest achievements."
"It is one of the advances in cooperation between Member States, civil cooperation, criminal cooperation and internal security."
"It is one of the most important results of the European project and one of the results that has come closest to achieving what the European Union always fails to achieve, which is relating to the public."
"It is definitely this aspect of the Union's policies that its citizens feel adds the most value in the most important aspects of their daily life, in enjoying their freedoms, for example, security."
"This is undoubtedly one of the great achievements of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"There were even some decisions adopted by the Council in this area of freedom, security and justice before the Treaty of Lisbon - when the area was practically intergovernmental - which concern the subject we were debating before: the investigation of crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes at national level."
"For example, the Council decisions of 13 June 2002 and 8 May 2003 established the capacity for the Member States to cooperate at national, intergovernmental level to prosecute these crimes, which fortunately - and we all remember the case of General Pinochet - are even part of the legislation in some Member States."
"For example Spain, not to mention other countries, has what is called universal justice, which means crimes that are so serious that even if they have been committed outside a country they can be tried there, if possible, even if that means going beyond the sacred principle of territoriality in criminal law."
"This principle has been waived in practice by some states where crimes that are particularly intolerable and deeply damaging to the dignity of humanity itself can be prosecuted even outside the territory in which they are committed."
"One aspect of this area of freedom, security and justice is what has been called the Stockholm Programme, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is already opening up this area not only to the intergovernmental sphere but also to the sphere that is strictly and clearly the EU."
"It is clearly particular to the EU method and therefore gives Parliament and the Court of Justice leading roles that they did not have before."
"The Stockholm Programme is extremely important, which is why we welcome its adoption by the Council in December 2009 and subsequently by the European Council."
"It is a programme that sets out a clear programme of work for the European Union and its Member States, and places the interests and needs of the people at the heart of its priorities for the next few years."
"It is therefore an extremely important programme."
"The programme establishes - and if you will allow me I will refer once again to the previous debate - the obligation for the Member States to cooperate with the International Criminal Court in the prosecution of crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity, so that they do not go unpunished."
"This is part of the Stockholm Programme that was adopted at the end of last year under the Swedish Presidency."
"We are therefore talking about an extremely important programme, which must be implemented and set out in detail."
"In this respect, we recognise the importance of the communication from the Commission entitled 'Delivering an area of freedom, security and justice for Europe's citizens - Action Plan Implementing the Stockholm Programme', which presents initiatives to help implement the programme."
"The Stockholm Programme enables us to build on previous achievements and face new challenges, taking advantage of the new opportunities presented by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is a new era."
"Institutionally, it is probably, to a greater extent, a genuine revolution - if you will allow me to speak so emphatically - because it is a genuine legal and institutional revolution for an area of freedom, security and justice that was previously entirely in the intergovernmental sphere to now clearly move into the EU sphere."
"This is initially taking shape in the important Stockholm Programme."
"The Council acknowledges the importance that Parliament has as the colegislator, as an institutional partner, in relation to the majority of the measures that we are going to adopt in the next five years."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, you know it already, but let me briefly present you with the action plan of the Commission, entitled 'Delivering an area of freedom, security and justice for Europe's citizens', an action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme."
"This action plan is a guide for very concrete measures to be taken during the next five years."
"But first let me go back a step: it has been proven by events of the last weeks and months that there is a shared sense of urgency to confront the economic and social situation of Europe, as well as a very clear expectation from our citizens that the EU must act rapidly and decisively."
"You will recall the adoption of the work programme of the Commission at the end of March, the content of which showed that the Commission not only has the intention but is already taking action."
"It focused, among other things, on the need for the EU to build a citizens' agenda which puts the people at the heart of European action."
"The action plan in the area of justice and home affairs is the first strategic initiative of the new Commission in order to put this work programme into practice; it follows very closely the mandates, as well as the broader philosophy, of the Stockholm Programme, and it takes into consideration the proposals and suggestions by Parliament and by the Council."
"The challenge of ensuring the respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, while also integrating and guaranteeing security in Europe, is addressed here in what we think to be a comprehensive way."
"The set of initiatives laid down are a roadmap - a roadmap to a free and secure Europe."
"We believe that you cannot separate freedom from security: they are two sides of the same coin; they are all related to the citizens and this is one way of getting citizens more acquainted with Europe."
"The action plan will guide us in delivering an ambitious set of very concrete measures in a field where the added value of Europe will be very visible to our citizens."
"It is also a powerful message reiterating what we have been discussing before, that the Treaty of Lisbon and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights are actions for the citizens."
"As all these actions are interlinked, indispensable and consistent with the scale of ambition which have been fixed in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we have to reach this ambitious outcome as quickly as possible in line with citizens' expectations."
"That is also why Parliament should not view this action plan as being carved in stone; there might be unexpected events, and if there are such unexpected events, the Commission will certainly make use of its right of initiative in order to help solve the problems."
"That is why we have the intention - and this will be important for Parliament - to submit a mid-term review of the implementation of the Stockholm Programme in 2012, in order to ensure that the programme remains in line with European and global developments."
"But, as the Minister-in-Office of the Council already has rightly said, this action plan is not only about what the European Commission is going to propose."
"It is also very much about what the Member States are going to do: how the Member States are going to take their initiatives where subsidiarity is at stake; how they are going to implement European Union decisions in their national law; and how they are going to collaborate with other Member States."
"Therefore, this action plan will only be a success story in the end if all the institutions play their role, and I am very confident that Parliament will help us to advance quickly on the right road."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to congratulate the Commission for its timely presentation of a very concrete action plan to empower European citizens."
"I have been very active in the discussions in Parliament because I truly believe that the Stockholm Programme is the best way forward to a citizen-centred Europe: a Europe for citizens, with the people."
"I therefore invite the Commission to stick to the vision of the Stockholm Programme when presenting the specific proposals for the next five years."
"The programme adopted represents a real balance between providing security to citizens while respecting their rights, freedoms and integrity, and strengthening their citizenship."
"On the action plan, I particularly welcome the measures presented recently to combat trafficking in human beings and child abuse and to increase the protection of unaccompanied minors - to mention just a few."
"I also welcome the fact that the action plan includes a strategy to combat female genital mutilation, domestic violence and violence against women."
"I nevertheless wish that this proposal could have been presented earlier than scheduled, Madam Commissioner."
"We also need to encourage the participation of citizens during the process and ensure the transparency of decision making and the openness of documents."
"I hope that the measures will be presented in a user friendly way."
"To conclude, I look forward to continuing working with my colleagues in Parliament, and with the Commission and the Council, to really deliver an area of freedom, security and justice, and make it a reality."
"I would like to make a few general and a few specific remarks regarding the plan."
"Of course we consider the Stockholm Programme to be very important."
"It is precisely for this reason that the action plan has been somewhat disappointing, since its ambitions do not truly reflect the importance this Parliament has attached to it or the size of the majority with which it voted on amendments on several topics."
"We see that the most important or many important points in the plan have been deferred until 2013-2014, and as regards this year, we can already see a certain level of slippage."
"It seems to be a general problem as well that cooperation between the Commission and Parliament with regard to international treaties has not yet been clarified."
"Although the feedback has improved considerably, such as the feedback on the SWIFT and TFTP negotiations with the US, there are still some points that have yet to be clarified."
"I wish to make a few concrete proposals: we regret that hate speech does not appear in the draft legislation but only the reports and the framework decision referring to implementation appear among the plans."
"Likewise, the provision of information on human rights is not sufficiently categorical."
"We know that implementation is related to the degree to which people are aware of their rights."
"In connection with immigration, I would like to mention that cooperation has begun but there seems to be an inadequate level of ambition."
"There are two other important issues."
"The first concerns reciprocity on visas, where new, effective solutions are needed due to both the reintroduction of the visa requirement and inequalities."
"The second concerns the free movement of labour where it is important to put an end to the discrimination that continues to exist against new Member States."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the Stockholm Programme is undoubtedly ambitious, but we still need to adopt an action plan that would implement it in the most efficient way."
"Efficiency means not only a suitable timetable, but it also refers to the content of the legislation that we will adopt in the coming years and to the institutions that will be built upon in the future."
"If we want the Union to be more coherent, we have to work towards a level of trust and mutual recognition in the judicial area or on police cooperation, similar to the principle which has governed the EU single market."
"To achieve it, we need to shift our views on our legal traditions, which should no longer be perceived, used or misused to prevent us having minimum standards, particularly in criminal law."
"Our citizens demand and deserve better protection against terrorism and against organised or trans-border crime."
"It is our duty to provide for this protection, but we have to do it while fully respecting not only the rights of the victims but also those of the defendants as well."
"This is why minimal procedural standards must apply to all EU Member States and if we need to be bold for these, we shall be."
"We will be bold when entrusting Eurojust with more power or when we have to protect the data of our citizens or when we will have to regulate on the asylum package."
"My political group is determined to constructively work with the Commission and the Council and, at the same time, to persistently fight for the protection of human rights."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, listening to the Commissioner and the Council representative on the Stockholm Programme, some questions come to mind."
"It is now close to the end of the Spanish Presidency, with five weeks to go."
"At the beginning, we heard great ideas from the Spanish Presidency on asylum, migration, the Anti-Discrimination Directive and the emancipation of women, but I must say that, with five weeks to go, I wonder where the concrete results and proposals are."
"The Commission and Parliament did their work on asylum and migration, and we are really waiting for the Council to act."
"It is not only - as Commissioner Reding said - the individual Member State that needs to implement its laws."
"It is the Council that needs to come up with ideas on Dublin, on the Reception Directive, on the Eurodac system and on the Qualification Directive."
"We really are waiting for it."
"The Anti-Discrimination Directive is something this plenary voted for and the Greens are really waiting for that."
"Turning to the Commission on that issue, equality and anti-discrimination are, of course, fundamental basics in the Stockholm Programme, but why did the Commission not choose to make same-sex partnerships a priority for this action plan?"
"You said people would be put at the centre."
"Organising same-sex partnerships is putting people at the centre."
"Could you give me an explanation as to why?"
"With regard to Europol, in the pre-Lisbon era, Europol was submitted to a minimum of scrutiny by Parliament, and that is still the case, although we now have the Lisbon Treaty."
"For example, the competence to enter into negotiations for cooperation agreements with third countries is based on Council decisions that date from a couple of years back."
"It is rumoured that Europol is now discussing a treaty with Israel, and who knows what other countries are being approached for treaties."
"The Lisbon Treaty gives Parliament a new role, and I would like the Commission to act upon it."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, 170 measures in five years, numbers that are too ambitious for a programme devoid of any real connotation, especially when it comes to certain issues."
"Where immigration is concerned, the programme is embarrassingly weak when you look beyond the official documents: what is the point of promising to strengthen bodies and agencies if there is then no political strategy?"
"A truly useful strategy that must be based on some firm points: the fight against illegal immigration along the southern border, ensuring that responsibilities for opposing illegal immigration are shared between all European States, a policy of agreements with third countries, especially the recognition that immigration is not a resource at a time of crisis."
"Parliament's homepage tells us that more than 20% of young people in Europe are unemployed."
"On a continent where 25 million people are out of work, the Commissioner for Home Affairs says that the issue of immigration must be based on solidarity."
"Instead, what is really needed is joined-up reasoning and realism: today, our priority is giving work to our citizens!"
"All the rest is do-gooding rhetoric that does not help immigrants to integrate, and certainly does not help our people."
"(ES) Madam President, we are talking about more than 360 actions in five years."
"From my perspective, the presentation of the action plan should have been given more time in Parliament in order to give Members the opportunity to debate and, more importantly, to amend the proposals."
"Let us look at some examples: combating radicalisation; monitoring terrorist funding and the possibility of creating a European Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP); the coordination of the Joint Situation Centre (SitCen), Europol and Eurojust in the fight against terror and organised crime; combating the use of the Internet for terrorist purposes; amending the Frontex Regulation; and the viability of creating a European border guards system."
"Along with what I have mentioned, there is a great deal more that has been said."
"These are very important issues that would have been worthy of a different parliamentary format."
"In addition it is notable that in relation to protecting the victims of crime, the plan only proposes one measure: creating a global instrument for protecting victims, which will include victims of terrorism."
"I believe - and this would be an amendment that I have not been able to table due to the rules - that the creation of a special instrument to protect the victims of terrorism should be an inalienable priority for the European Union."
"I would like to stress that this is my view."
"To conclude, Mrs Reding, with reference to Europol, I would like to know why a Council decision is going to be replaced by a Europol regulation by 2013."
"(SK) There are several areas in the action plan of the Stockholm Programme I would like to talk about, and as we have to move on, I will name these problem areas."
"I definitely consider the EU's common asylum system to be a problem area, which we have discussed together at least several times here, where, on the one hand, the Commission talks of the need for legal migrants or immigrants to be successfully integrated into the common system but, on the other, the action plan displays very little ambition in this direction."
"Likewise, it appears that we do not expect a proposal for the unified processing of asylum applications until 2014, and therefore no mutual recognition of the rights of refugees between EU Member States either."
"Your plans are nonetheless quite concrete in the area of restricting the influx and movement of immigrants or migrants, for example, seasonal workers."
"So, to be brief, there is no progressive and fair common asylum system in sight, and the plan specifies rather repressive measures."
"I would like to mention at least two more areas."
"The first is the sad fact that, even in the Commission's own words, progress over the mutual recognition of registered same-sex partnerships within an EU framework is not a priority, and the sidetracking of this topic really concerns me."
"The final area I would like to mention is the rights of corporations."
"The Stockholm Action Plan often mentions citizens and their rights, but very clearly emphasises the freedom of business without sufficient regulations, which is at least surprising, particularly in the context of the current financial and economic crisis."
"Madam President, for me, the best bit of the action plan is the list of five concrete measures regarding rights of the individual in criminal proceedings that comprise the roadmap endorsed by the Stockholm Programme."
"I speak as rapporteur on the first of these measures on interpretation and translation for defendants on which, I am pleased to say, I reached provisional agreement with the Spanish Presidency this very morning and I hope that our respective institutions will endorse that result."
"I do thank Commissioner Reding for her staunch support as we drew solidly on the Commission proposal and Commission representatives made a full contribution, so my personal thanks to her."
"We are finally, a decade overdue, but finally building the mutual trust necessary for mutual recognition."
"My support for the European arrest warrant is qualified by my dismay and indeed anger at some miscarriages of justice and the way it currently operates such as in the cases of Gary Mann and Andrew Symeou that I am involved in."
"If we had these measures in place a decade ago, I believe those miscarriages of justice would not be happening."
"(MT) Madam President, I agree with those who say that the Common European Market, the single market, is probably the largest project the European Union has ever undertaken."
"I believe that this project, which favours European citizens, is the next big task for the European Union."
"It is interesting that the single market began in 1992, the same year in which we adopted the Maastricht Treaty that introduced the concept of European citizenship."
"By means of this action plan, we are now creating a space within which European citizenship can be exercised."
"This can be done in several areas: human rights, civil rights, access to justice and the right of freedom of movement within the European Union."
"The European Union can also serve as an example in a number of fields, namely, trafficking, combating paedophilia, children's rights, cyber crime, and of course, immigration and asylum matters."
"Nonetheless, I believe that this project requires three things: Firstly, a political stamp will give it importance and meaning for our citizens."
"Secondly, respecting the subsidiarity principle, because there are certain important areas that cannot relinquish the right to employ subsidiarity."
"Thirdly, deadlines: these must be honoured in this action plan, otherwise it will all come to nothing."
"(ES) Madam President, as the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I was the co-author of the resolution adopted on the Stockholm Programme in November, along with Mr Casini and Mr Berlinguer."
"I would like to point out that I said at the time that the Stockholm Programme was not going to make Parliament's life easier in the area of freedom, security and justice but, on the contrary, it was going to make it much harder."
"I want to say here that some of the requirements in the resolution that was adopted have not been reflected by being clearly set out in the action plan proposed by the Commission."
"Therefore, as I am aware of the limitations of parliamentary debate and parliamentary intervention in the debate on the action plan, I do wish to point out that paragraphs 148 to 150 of the parliamentary resolution contained some precise indications regarding extremely important issues."
"Many of these have been stated, from victim protection to the institutions and agencies related to Schengen, Europol, Eurojust, Frontex and the European Asylum Support Office and its pending new regulations, but there were also some regulations on substantial and fundamental problems, such as data protection and the clause to combat discrimination."
"The interdependence of data protection and security has certainly been debated in Parliament, in particular, during the debate on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Programme (TFTP), and the debate highlighted the need for Europe to make its own commitment to an appropriate balance between security and privacy."
"What is really important, however, is that the Commission now has five years of work ahead of it to implement each of the links in the action plan for the Stockholm Programme step by step."
"I therefore call on it to really work very hard with Parliament to take into account all of the commitments relating to paragraphs 148 and 150 of the resolution, keeping in mind that if the Commission does not work diligently and closely with Parliament, it will be vigilant and it will make proposals."
"It will, of course, also work with the Council, which can adopt initiatives that might deserve to be considered and dealt with by Parliament."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr López Garrido, I, in turn, wish to say how pleased I am to be talking about this action plan, the roadmap, as Mrs Reding called it, for implementing the Stockholm Programme."
"It deals with a host of fundamental issues, and rather than compile a random list in the very little time I have, I will simply focus on those points that will cause some frustration - one on form and one on substance - to talk about this issue."
"In terms of form, as we have said in this debate, we have set ourselves some very precise deadlines for the implementation of the measures, and I would like us to try our best to take concrete action, so that we are not simply paying lip service to ideals."
"To that end, in terms of substance, we must address two main points in order to make a success of this implementation."
"We must define some priorities."
"On the question of substance, Mrs Reding spoke of added value."
"I suggest that we press ahead with some points that we consider more urgent than others: firstly, on legal cooperation, so that we are on the same page in legal terms, with, of course, a kind of Erasmus for judges, but why not a kind of Erasmus for all the legal professions and another for the police professions?"
"Then, the second point in terms of substance, and a key priority, is that of taking every possible measure to ensure the rights of children, to protect them, and to combat cyber crime, child pornography and sexual exploitation."
"(EL) The big word missing from immigration programmes is the word 'solidarity'."
"Today, we voted on the resettlement of asylum seekers from third countries in Europe, but the Commission programme refuses to promote a similar provision for the settlement of asylum seekers from one country of Europe to another or for money."
"Whatever happened to solidarity?"
"Over 100 000 illegal immigrants arrive in Greece from Turkey every year."
"Whatever happened to the Europe-Turkey agreement on the return of these illegal immigrants?"
"It is being side-stepped and is barely even mentioned in our programme."
"Whatever happened to the agreement being negotiated by Frontex with Turkey today?"
"Can you assure us that it will not directly or indirectly dispute the sovereign rights of Greece, and hence of Europe, on the borders?"
"Finally, of course, there is the huge obligation of solidarity towards immigrants themselves called 'integration'."
"Without the integration of immigrants, there is no way that 40 million people who have come to live among us will be able to do so on equal terms."
"We may be building time bombs."
"Programmes are needed, money is needed and, at the moment, the Commission does not have them."
"(ES) (Start of speech with microphone switched off) I feel that a Europe in which the borders have disappeared and in which there is an increasing amount of supranational crime needs to have more ambition from the point of view of responding to the problem of supranational crime."
"I believe that we need to have greater ambition in terms of police coordination, in other words, Europol; judicial coordination, in other words, Eurojust; the European public prosecutor; the technical standardisation of criminal investigations; unifying criminal trial law; and in terms of bringing the respective criminal legal systems closer together."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there is little ambition and too much national resistance, and I urge you, especially in the Council, to overcome the pro-sovereignty tendency of the Member States, and to unify our criminal justice systems in order to effectively combat insecurity and supranational crime."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the opportunity offered by the Stockholm Programme is definitely an important one: a high number of positive actions that the Commission must implement, carving out a real common space for freedom, justice and security."
"Achieving these aims, however, requires a method of cooperation between European institutions, and between these institutions and the Member States, which are an indispensable instrument of true cooperation."
"Issues such as the regulation of migratory flows according to objective criteria of fairness, the dignity of people in today's overcrowded prisons, the welfare of those who are rehabilitated after drug addiction, the revitalisation of agencies, the opposition to organised crime at cross-border level, make this genuine cooperation truly necessary."
"The activities of our Parliament are obviously centred on this challenge, and also provide strong and definite stimulus for the Commission and other Community institutions, as well as for Member States."
"Madam President, Dame Sarah Ludford said that she had some concerns about miscarriages of justice in relation to the European Arrest Warrant, in the cases of Andrew Symeou and Gary Mann."
"That is an understatement if ever there was one!"
"The European Arrest Warrant is a gross miscarriage of justice in itself."
"Extradition has been reduced to a mere bureaucratic formality."
"British courts have been stripped of their ability to protect British citizens from unjust arrest and imprisonment when they are extradited to a foreign country."
"I know because I sat in the appeal court in the case of Andrew Symeou when two Senior Law Lords were unable to prevent the extradition of Mr Symeou, even though it was obvious to everybody in the court that the evidence was either non-existent or fabricated by the police."
"But of course, that is the whole point, because the court is not allowed to look at the evidence; they have no right."
"Dame Sarah and the Lib Dems can cry crocodile tears now over cases like Mr Symeou, but they have to bear responsibility for the human misery which they have caused."
"(EL) Madam President, it was with real satisfaction that we voted in the Stockholm Programme for provisions which refer to solidarity on immigration issues and in the fight against illegal immigration."
"I read in the action plan that the Commission will create an instrument in 2011 to evaluate national asylum systems, so that it can provide better assistance to the Member States in terms of each one's capabilities and needs."
"At the same time, however, we have given the go-ahead in this Parliament for the European Asylum Support Office to start operating in Malta."
"The question is this: will the European Asylum Support Office have anything to do with this mechanism and, via this mechanism, with the evaluation carried out?"
"Has provision been made for an internal resettlement programme for refugees in order to even out the pressures between the Member States?"
"Madam President, I would like to refer to the mechanism to assess corruption in the Member States - the mechanism that is provided for in the action plan."
"We have a Council decision for the Stockholm Programme, which refers to this matter, and we have the Commission action plan on implementing the Stockholm Programme."
"They both refer to an evaluation of the anti-corruption efforts in the Member States."
"Therefore, we need strong political will and commitment from the Member States for such a mechanism to come into place."
"I say this because we all know that, so far, the domestic efforts have not been effective in all Member States, to say the least."
"Secondly, the deadline for the communication in the action plan on the Union's policy and mechanism against corruption is 2011."
"I would like to suggest having it done before the end of 2010."
"This would better respond to the need of combating corruption in the Union, as corruption is also seen as a cause of the economic crisis."
"Therefore, it would be a measure to stop and prevent it."
"Madam President, what is really at the heart of this debate on the European area of freedom, security and justice is something that I think was rightly said by Mr Busuttil when he was talking about European citizenship."
"What we are talking about here is the composition of that European citizenship, which we need to deepen."
"This is certainly one of the focuses of the new political phase beginning in Europe with the Treaty of Lisbon, and it has, of course, been one of the focuses for the Spanish Presidency."
"There was a very clear and direct question on this to the Council from Mrs Sargentini, on what had been done by the Spanish Presidency during this period and what is in place for the future."
"I thank her for this very direct question, and I am going to try to structure my response around some points that all relate to European citizenship and the content of rights, freedoms, securities and justice: in short, the status of European citizens in the 21st century."
"With regard to freedoms, we were talking earlier about accession to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"This is one of the Spanish Presidency's priorities."
"I refer to the extensive debate that we had earlier."
"I also believe that, in relation to freedoms and rights, we need to talk about the directive on rights to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings."
"As you know, work is under way on this directive."
"We are waiting for the European Commission to make a proposal in general terms on the very specific directive mentioned by Mrs Sargentini: the non-discrimination directive."
"This is a very ambitious and very important directive."
"The Presidency of the Council does, of course, support it, and we are awaiting the Commission's initiative."
"Issues surrounding victims have been a concern and a priority for the Spanish Presidency, especially victims of gender violence."
"I would like to say to you that during this period, progress has been made on the directive to combat people trafficking."
"With regard to the directive to combat sexual abuse, we are working on reaching a common position in June."
"Work is also being done on a legislative initiative to combat gender violence: the European Protection Order, which is currently being debated in various parliamentary committees: the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"Gender violence is undoubtedly the biggest scourge that exists with the greatest number of victims in European societies."
"The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) also adopted the European Observatory on Violence against Women and the helpline for victims last month."
"Regarding security issues, the internal security strategy was adopted in the March European Council."
"In relation to this, the constitution has been adopted for the Standing Committee on operational cooperation on internal security."
"There have been agreements with the United States on security issues, and agreements are in progress: the Toledo Declaration on security and civil aviation; the SWIFT issue, which is very well known to parliament, on which there is a mandate for negotiating a political agreement with the United States as soon as possible."
"We are also working with the United States on a joint declaration on the fight against terrorism and an agreement on data protection."
"With regard to civil cooperation, we hope to agree the Rome III Regulation, a law that applies to marriages."
"In relation to the subject of immigration and asylum, which has also been mentioned in many speeches, it should be said that the Spanish Presidency is responsible for the first evaluation of the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, which it is going to prepare in cooperation with the Commission."
"At the same time, also in cooperation with the Commission, a returns programme is under way for unaccompanied minors."
"Also, in relation to asylum, the Frontex operations are being maintained, and work is being done on a European programme for refugees and on the resettlement of refugees, and also with some countries on repatriation programmes."
"In addition to those, there is the European Refugee Fund, which should be ready by 2011: the Tavares report from Parliament provides for it to be adopted by then."
"So, there are various important initiatives under way in relation to immigration."
"I would like to add to this response with a debate that has been taken up very constructively by the Commission - specifically by Commissioner Reding - on the European public prosecutor, which is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I think this is a debate that we need to have."
"It would be very interesting, not only, as the Treaty of Lisbon says, to protect the economic interests of the Union, which is, of course, a very topical subject."
"It would also be very interesting at a later stage in order to be able to prosecute transnational crimes."
"It is also a debate that has been launched by the Spanish Presidency of the European Union."
"These are some of the specific elements that are being launched or have been launched during the Spanish Presidency, in cooperation with the Commission and Parliament."
"We believe that it is absolutely crucial for us to have credibility in terms of building an open, safe Europe that protects its people."
"This is the spirit in which the Spanish Presidency wants to continue, along with the trio of presidencies that will be operated by our partners: Belgium and Hungary."
"This is the Spanish Presidency's intention, and we are, of course, counting on the cooperation of the European Parliament, which we have."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, everybody is talking about the Stockholm Programme."
"That is a Christmas tree with several hundred wishes."
"I would like everybody to speak about the reality."
"How were these Christmas tree wishes treated before the Lisbon Treaty?"
"Behind closed doors, without much consideration for the citizens and what they want, wish for and expect; in the third pillar, where ministers of the interior were asking neither the European Parliament nor the Commission, and where the European Court of Justice had no possibility to intervene."
"That is where we are starting from: an impossible situation."
"Fortunately, we now have the Lisbon Treaty."
"There is no third pillar any more."
"There are Commission proposals, codecision, implementation at Member State level, control by the European Court of Justice, but that means also that things cannot be done instantly any more."
"Rules and proposals have to follow the normal way, under which you parliamentarians have asked the Commission to conduct its work."
"First, a thorough analysis of what is feasible, what is good, what has added value."
"Second, public consultation, in order to know whether the ideas that we put on the table will be accepted or not by civil society, by industry, by the Member States, by the national parliaments, which are now a player in all these questions and which conduct the subsidiarity test."
"And then, impact assessments, in order to see if what we are doing is the right way."
"And, only then, we have the definite proposal from the Commission."
"If you want the Commission to continue to do as has been done over the last number of years, just tell me, and I will come with a proposal every week."
"And do you know what will happen with those proposals?"
"They will first be blocked in the national parliaments, and rightly so, because we have to come with serious proposals based on the legal assumptions that what we are doing is strong, is feasible and can be implemented in the Member States."
"I do not want the first proposal we make to be challenged before the Court of Justice and before the Court of Human Rights."
"I would like to lead all of us to the way where the citizens will understand that the added value of what we are doing here is of real benefit to them in practical terms."
"Yes, as the Commissioner responsible for women's affairs, I have heard this Parliament discussing what we need to do, most of all in order to give legal certainty to women in all our Member States, that when they have a problem of violence, they will get justice and not the illusion that they hope they will get justice and then they get nowhere and end up with nothing."
"So here we really have to work together."
"There are hundreds of measures which have to be 'Lisbonised', which have to be taken out of the hole and brought into the light of day, which have to be adapted to the real rules of law - hundreds of measures that do not work."
"The arrest warrant: Ms Ludford was just speaking about this."
"Of course it is not carried out in the Member States because the construction around the mutual recognition and the mutual trust, which is at the basis of the mutual recognition, has not been built up."
"Colleagues, you cannot do all this without having mutual trust."
"I am sorry, I cannot by decree insert mutual trust in the heads of the judges all over Europe!"
"We have to build this mutual trust with the legislation and with the measures to boost the rights of citizens in all our Member States, so that the judges also implement the rules we have been looking for and, yes, we are advancing very quickly on this."
"An action plan, well, the colleague is not there any more, but an action plan for combating the violence against women."
"In 2011, a comprehensive text about protecting the victims, all kinds of victims - for me there is not a victim here, a victim there and a third category of victims - all kinds of victims have to be considered."
"Yes, we have been working on data protection; when fortunately you, Parliament, said no to the way things have been working before Lisbon was implemented."
"We will not continue like this any more and, yes, Chairman of the committee, you know that your committee and the other committees are fully integrated in the way we are preceding."
"We will have many things to do together: very technical questions, which will have a very important impact on our society."
"We will have to do something; we will have to explain to the citizens what we are doing."
"Because that is also a part of the whole thing and it is not the easiest part of the whole issue."
"Yes, we have to take measures, for instance, on illegal immigration and asylum and, as you have seen, my colleague, Cecilia Malmström, has very concrete proposals on illegal immigration, on border controls, on legal migration."
"Yes, it would be important if the Parliament could, together with the Council, adopt the existing proposals, the asylum package, the simple permit proposal, the joint resettlement programme, the mutual recognition and the just adopted action plan for unaccompanied minors."
"There is an awful lot in the pipeline."
"It is not about who is going to do what because certain things you simply cannot do."
"Here is an example: you asked for the Anti-Discrimination Directive."
"The Anti-Discrimination Directive, I am sorry to say, is a question that has to be solved by unanimity and it is blocked in the Council."
"So what do you want me to do - not me, because it was before my time - the Commission has put anti-discrimination on the table, unanimity is blocked in the Council?"
"So speak to the Council; speak with those who are blocking it."
"Same-sex couples: well you know perfectly well that it is the prerogative of subsidiarity, the competence of Member States to regulate the way they treat same-sex couples."
"Where the European Union comes in is the cross-border treatment of these same-sex couples."
"But I cannot do the work for France, for Italy, for Poland, for Romania, for Greece and for Luxembourg; that has to be done by those Member States alone."
"I can see there is no discrimination if those people, from wherever they come, are exercising their rights to cross-border mobility, and that is what we are going to do."
"We have started already to see that, in terms of mobility, in terms of citizens rights, in terms of collaboration between the legal systems, in terms of eliminating the borders that still exist in this single market, which, sorry to say, is not a single market when it comes to citizens."
"That is why I am very happy; I have read the report by Mario Monti."
"There are many elements in this report, which say where we have to move."
"You know what is my bible?"
"The report, which was drawn up by one of your Members, contains all the elements on the free movement of citizens and all the problems that have to be solved."
"Now what I propose to you is to take them, one by one, and solve them, one by one, in full cooperation with you."
"When I put on the table a proposal, and you have seen how it goes, you will have so many proposals that you will have to work at night - I do not know if it is permitted under employment rules and human rights, but I will not care for your human rights as Members of Parliament."
"We will work until we have solved these problems - there are hundreds of problems to be solved and I cannot do it alone."
"I need your very constructive help."
"I know I will get this help but help me to work on one element after the other, even if it has to be one element per week."
"It is going to be on your table."
"I am willing to come to your committees as often as you call me, Madam President, and we will discuss this over, element by element."
"In five years' time, with your help, we will have changed this continent."
"The debate is closed."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item is Question Time (B7-0211/2010)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part one"
"Subject: Communication providing for a higher target for greenhouse gas emission cuts"
"A few days ago, the Commission released to the media a communication to Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions in which it raised the possibility of increasing the target for greenhouse gas emission cuts to be met by 2020 under the climate and energy package from 20% to 30%."
"A number of remarks need to be made on this proposal."
"First, lowering the costs involved in cutting emissions would give a much-needed breather to national budgets, which the Member States are currently struggling to balance."
"Second, greenhouse gas emission levels have been falling sharply as a result of the recession, although they may be expected to rise again as we emerge from the crisis and production is scaled up."
"As a result, the cost of making cuts will rise again."
"Third, it is questionable whether this is the appropriate moment to raise the target, as this would precipitate a fresh increase in reduction costs, which, at a time when we are just starting to emerge from recession, could meet with understandable resistance from the business world."
"What is the Commission's reaction to the above remarks?"
"Member of the Commission. - I will promise to start answering very briefly because the document to which the honourable Member refers is not a document adopted by the Commission and its release was not authorised, but later this month, the Commission intends to adopt the Communication to the Council and the Parliament assessing the benefits and the costs of the EU stepping up to a target of 30% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions."
"This communication was actually requested by the Environment Council in its conclusions dated 15 March this year."
"So, needless to say, we have had a very short time, but we think it is an important debate; afterwards, there will, of course, be a lot of details that we have to look at more closely."
"In addition, this communication will present, as requested under the ETS Directive, an analysis of the situation of energy intensive sectors that it has been determined are exposed to a risk of carbon leakage in the light of the outcome of Copenhagen."
"But let me just say one thing very clearly."
"It is not the intention of the Commission to take a decision to go to 30% the day after this communication has been presented."
"It is just one step to try to ensure that, when we have the discussions on these reduction targets, we have a very informed foundation to take this discussion forward from."
"That is the purpose of this - to give us the analysis, the costs, the figures and the calculations, so that we can have an informed debate."
"I really hope that Parliament will also take part in this debate."
"The document indicates that increased greenhouse gas emission cuts in Central and Eastern Europe will be of fundamental significance for achievement of the new target."
"It is true the Commission does note that such measures will require significant financial outlays, but it wants to look for this money in the structural funds for these countries."
"In other words, this would depend on redirecting means earmarked for other purposes, in particular, for reducing disparities in development between European Union Member States and the standard of living in these states, and would, for example, take place at the cost of development of the road infrastructure in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - I hope the honourable Member will respect the fact that I will not go into detail about one draft out of many that has been leaked."
"It would not be appropriate for me to do so."
"I said during my hearing at the European Parliament that we should take care that when we spend European Union money for different purposes, we also ensure that the different projects - infrastructure was mentioned for instance - are being climate-proofed."
"I do not, however, think that anybody can give an answer at this stage as to exactly how we would do that if we were to go to a 30% reduction by 2020."
"Instead, we are trying to provide an analysis and invite the Members of Parliament and the Council, among others, to take part in the debate."
"(RO) We voted today on the report on the amendment to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive."
"This is only the beginning of a new process where we can actually cut emissions and energy consumption in buildings significantly."
"As my fellow Member has also said, we still need funds."
"I hope that we have your support for a significant increase in the allocation rate from the ERDF for energy efficiency in housing, as well as for the creation of a fund, starting in 2014, for improving energy efficiency in the industrial sector too."
"Commissioner, does not the original question demonstrate the scale of the problem you face when addressing this issue?"
"Many Members here and many governments represented in the Council just do not accept the need for urgent action to prevent climate change."
"It is easy for them to sign up to pious resolutions at a time of economic prosperity, but, now that is not the case, they are reluctant to sign up to practical action."
"Do you not need to address the problem of climate change denial if you are to raise our ambitions?"
"Member of the Commission. - Firstly, I would like to study whatever you have agreed today on energy efficiency in buildings."
"There are many ways to cope with improved efforts there."
"There are also some alternative financial models that can be used so that it would be in the interest of those taking care of the buildings to make them much more energy efficient."
"There will be many ways of doing that - not necessarily requiring funds - and I would be happy to look into that."
"I agree very much with the questioner that one of the areas where we can do so much more in Europe would be within the field of energy efficiency and buildings."
"There is such a huge potential there and it is just stupid that we use a lot of energy that none of us really benefit from because we are not using it efficiently enough."
"In response to Chris Davies, and regarding climate change deniers: I try to address it when I meet it."
"Despite all the discussions - and particularly in the United Kingdom you have a huge discussion on this with East Anglia and, although the IPCC should be better at correcting errors when they find them - to this day, I have seen nothing that really goes against the main finding of science, namely that we have to address this issue and we have to be serious about it."
"I think there are so many other reasons - which climate sceptics should also agree with - that it is so important to do something with energy efficiency and energy technologies."
"If Europe is not ambitious here, I am very much afraid that we will lose the growing markets of this century to our competitors."
"Carbon leakage is not a case where if we do things, we risk losing jobs."
"I am really afraid that if we are too hesitant over the next number of years, we risk losing jobs on a very large scale."
"I am very happy to see that the new British Government also seems to be very keen on being ambitious in the field of climate change."
"I think that is very crucial to all of us."
"Subject: Action by the Commission on copyright"
"Article 118 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which gives the Union competence to legislate in the field of intellectual property rights, stipulates that: 'in the context of the establishment and functioning of the internal market, the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall establish measures for the creation of European intellectual property rights to provide uniform protection of intellectual property rights throughout the Union and for the setting up of centralised Union-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrangements'."
"The lack of a single EU legal framework governing copyright is a major barrier to the development of an internal market in copyrighted goods."
"What initiatives does the Commission intend to take in the area of copyright, pursuant to Article 118 of the TFEU?"
"I would firstly like to thank Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg for her question."
"It goes right to the heart of the current debates on copyright and the Internet."
"Unfortunately, too often, copyright is presented as an obstacle to the creation of a single digital market."
"I think that is unfair."
"Copyright allows the creator to sell what he has created and guarantees him a return on his investment."
"Moreover, that is not just true in the realm of cultural creation, which Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg knows so well."
"It is also true in the field of industry, of creation, of industrial innovation; a return on the investment, thanks to which the creator will then be able to go on creating other works and new content."
"This economic model, which underpins copyright, has existed for many hundreds of years, but rights management has evolved naturally with technologies, radio, television, cable, satellite, and, today, the Internet."
"Each time, new technologies have enabled us to switch to new economic models that have led to a change in the use and commercialisation of copyright."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rather than propose some radical copyright amendments, I want to protect creation while also searching for a legal framework that will allow for the emergence of new economic models."
"I announced that when I appeared before you on 13 January, and this is precisely the principle that will guide my action."
"Furthermore, this is the role that I envisage, with you, for the European legislator."
"The digital agenda adopted by the Commission on 19 May, at the dynamic instigation of my colleague and friend, Mrs Kroes, contains my roadmap, which covers copyright and the Internet."
"Moreover, this year, I will take three initiatives along these lines."
"Firstly, a proposal for a framework directive on collective copyright management."
"The idea here is firstly to enable collective management societies to organise themselves better in order to offer new Internet services, such as made-to-measure directories, or one-stop shops."
"On the other hand, the aim is also to align the rules on the governance, transparency and supervision of collective management societies so as to allow for more transparent pricing and returns for members of collective management societies."
"Secondly, a directive on orphan works: the objective is to create the necessary legal certainty to support the efforts to digitise our cultural heritage."
"I am thinking about a European definition of orphan works."
"Thirdly, I will present a green paper on audiovisual content and the Internet."
"Here, it is a question of analysing the conditions for the emergence in Europe of new video-on-demand services."
"In 2011, we will launch a dialogue with the various interested parties on subjects that have an impact on the emergence of new value-added content services on the Internet so that we can ascertain how to clarify the existing rules."
"The idea is to see what role technology can play in identifying and paying for digital content, to identify the issues surrounding the digital media, and to know how to combat the black economy of Internet piracy more effectively."
"My method will be simple: I want to listen to the various interested parties while proposing action to you."
"I want a Europe that allows for the emergence of new economic models."
"I have no preconceived idea of the type of intervention that will be needed, legislative or otherwise."
"Neither am I dogmatic or deluded about the chances of finding one-size-fits-all solutions."
"However, I would like to use this new process of recovery of the internal market and of the digital agenda - which, incidentally, Mr Monti spoke of in his report - to develop a real economic policy for the cultural sector in Europe."
"I welcome the initiatives being taken by the Commission."
"I have a supplementary question concerning the 2008 Green Paper entitled 'Copyright in the Knowledge Economy', in which the Commission admits that the current system of optional exceptions to copyright protection put in place by the 2001 directive is not fulfilling its purpose, in other words, that it does not facilitate distribution of works protected by copyright and does not reflect a balance between the rights of authors and the rights of people who use their works."
"Furthermore, what is important is that mandatory exceptions to copyright protection are highly necessary for libraries, for making works available to blind people and also for distribution of orphan works."
"I would like to ask what initiatives the Commission is planning to present in the near future in relation to these exceptions to copyright protection?"
"Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, you also asked me about a point that I would like to confirm, about how the Commission will act; you would like it to make a statement on the use of Article 118 of the treaty."
"I can confirm that, on this point, this is not the approach that we have chosen."
"Our preferred approach is to create a regulatory framework favouring pan-European copyright licences."
"This is a pragmatic approach that would allow us to achieve the desired results in a more effective way than the introduction of a new unique and centralised copyright."
"Moreover, I would say that this Green Paper is very important and must enable us to ask many questions, and to move ideas forward."
"In particular, I am thinking about the question of the partially sighted."
"You wonder why we are not more ambitious as regards the creation of a single European copyright."
"The biggest obstacle to the introduction of an EU copyright, Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, is that it would absolutely have to take precedence over national copyright in order to be effective."
"In other words, the European Union copyright should prevail over national copyright, which frankly seems difficult to sell, both culturally and politically."
"Even if such an approach were accepted by the Member States, it would have a rather limited impact because it could not be applied to old works."
"It could only be applied to recently created works."
"Therefore, the new copyright would not apply to all pre-existing musical compositions."
"I also said why I wanted to work on a directive concerning orphan works."
"However, before arriving at a definitive wording of this draft directive, I will be careful to consult those MEPs, yourself included, who are most involved in this issue."
"(RO) I would like to ask you if you are intending to revise the directive on copyright and related rights in the information society."
"I am asking this as we need legal certainty."
"Unfortunately, exceptions have been interpreted in different ways in different countries, which has resulted in different decisions on the same matter in different Member States."
"This is why I believe that it is useful for us to carry out a review, especially in the light of the new Treaty of Lisbon."
"Mrs Ţicău, to answer your question very clearly, for the time being, we do not intend to amend the catalogue of exceptions in the 2001 directive."
"We have adopted an approach that I believe is pragmatic and progressive, with these three initiatives that I mentioned on collective management, orphan works and the Green Paper, and it is therefore in that framework that we will deal with the concerns you express."
"However, we do not intend to amend the catalogue of exceptions."
"Subject: The EU's State aid map"
"Would the Commission be open to a wholesale review of the EU's State aid map for the period 2007-2013?"
"While there will be a review this year, is it true that the State aid map review only allows a form of 'exchange' as opposed to redesignating regions to reflect new economic realities following the financial crisis?"
"The current State aid map was agreed based on statistics from 2006."
"The European economy is now radically different."
"Would the Commission accept that this fact represents a weakness in the current map and how does it feel it can be addressed?"
"Member of the Commission. - I have been asked by Mr Almunia to answer this question."
"In order to ensure continuity of the regional development effort, the Commission decided in 2006 that the list of regions designated by Member States as part of the regional aid maps should apply through the whole period 2007 to 2013."
"However, the Commission recognised in its guidelines for national regional aid that situations might arise where adjustments are necessary and, in accordance with point 104 of the guidelines, Member States were therefore offered the possibility to proceed to a mid-term review of the regional aid maps regarding regions designated under Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"Three out of seventeen Member States concerned by the mid-term review have decided to use this possibility."
"Under the mid-term review, Member States can replace up to half of the regions at present eligible for regional aid by newly designated regions."
"Under certain conditions, it is also possible to increase the aid intensities for regions already designated under the original regional aid map."
"As part of the mid-term review, the eligibility of the newly designated regions, and of the possible increases in aid intensities, is assessed on the basis of the average of the most recent years of the Eurostat data as regards gross domestic product per capita and unemployment at the relevant NUTS level 3 region."
"This helps to ensure regional investment aid is targeted towards the economic development of regions which are disadvantaged in relation to the national average."
"The fact that only three of the Member States concerned by the mid-term review have decided to notify amendments to the regional aid maps seems to suggest that the majority of the Member States consider that the economic crisis has not substantially affected the set of regions in need of development aid."
"author. - Thank you very much for your reply."
"I find it amazing that only three states have actually applied."
"It is unbelievable."
"I come from a region where we have lost thousands of jobs: Dell - 3 000 jobs; and, just today, 800 jobs have been lost through the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, 300 of them in my area, which is the south of Ireland, and that has a Gross Grant Equivalent of zero per cent."
"Our government has reapplied, and I am hoping that that will change, because, if it does not, it ensures that the government cannot apply really active measures from a state point of view to bring in larger companies."
"That to me is very regressive and needs to change."
"So I will actively look for the Commission to pursue a different strategy, because I believe that the State aid map is out of date."
"Member of the Commission. - It might indeed be strange, as the honourable Member has pointed out, that only three Member States have asked for this mid-term review."
"However, that is the case according to the figures we had this morning."
"Of course, many Member States and many regions are severely affected by the economic crisis, but maybe some Member States are finding that there are other ways and other means to handle this because, as we have seen, very few have asked for this review."
"Seventeen Member States were given the possibility but only three have done so."
"I think the honourable Member would agree with me that the basic purpose of the long-term programme is, of course, that we should have continuity for the regions in order to plan for the long term."
"There are of course other means of addressing the crisis than this, but I am sure that Commissioner Almunia is willing to discuss this with you further on a later occasion."
"Part two"
"Subject: EU-Ukraine police cooperation"
"How is cross-border police cooperation developing between the EU and its most important neighbour to the east, Ukraine, and what measures is the Commission planning to take to step up cooperation?"
"Member of the Commission. - Thank you, Mr Posselt, for your question on a very important subject."
"Cross-border police cooperation with countries which are neighbours of the European Union is primarily a competence of the Member States."
"However, the European Union supports bilateral cooperation between the Member States and Ukraine mainly through the operation of Europol."
"On 4 December 2009, an agreement on strategic cooperation between Europol and Ukraine was signed that will allow coordination of the work to fight against international organised and serious crime and terrorism."
"However, the strategic agreement does not allow the exchange of personal information on suspects."
"That can only be exchanged with countries who have concluded an operational agreement with Europol, and, before such an agreement can be concluded, Ukraine needs to adopt a law on personal data protection and to ratify the 1981 Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data and its Protocol."
"This is part of a broader Commission priority to see Ukraine establish a personal data protection regime in line with European standards."
"That would allow the establishment of an actual independent data protection supervision authority, which could be supported by technical and expert assistance from the EU."
"The EU also supports financial police cooperation with Ukraine through a twinning project, increasing the capacity of the Ukrainian police and the European Union Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM)."
"And last year EUBAM, with the cooperation of FRONTEX, with OLAF and the South-East European Cooperation Initiative, supported the Nikoniy Joint Border Control Operation to improve cooperation between the Ukrainian and the Moldovan police forces in fighting cross-border crime and irregular migration."
"I just wanted to ask what the situation is with regard to supporting police training and reinforcing the justice and interior authorities in Ukraine."
"Does this take place as a focal area in the context of the Eastern Partnership, and are the Commission and also the European Police College involved?"
"Or does this only take place at the Member State level?"
"Member of the Commission. - We are, of course, in constant dialogue with Ukraine on this issue."
"My colleague, Commissioner Štefan Füle, has presented a matrix of cooperation and I am very much involved in this as well."
"It does cover home affairs in order to see how we can help the Ukrainian authorities to develop on these matters and how we can deepen our cooperation further."
"This will also be dealt with in a meeting with the Ukrainian authorities in only a few weeks time."
"Police cooperation and education as such are not foreseen in the immediate future but that could, of course, be discussed once Ukraine has carried out the necessary reforms."
"We are open to cooperation with them."
"They are an important neighbour."
"We have lots in common."
"We have common challenges concerning cross-border crime, so it would also be good for us if we could engage further in this."
"Of course, the Ukrainians also need to improve, but we are there and are ready to help and assist them, and we will see what this will lead to in the longer term."
"Subject: Spiralling crime rates in Europe"
"According to Eurostat data published a few months ago, there has been a major increase in the level of crime and violence in Europe directly linked to the economic crisis and therefore affecting with particular frequency those countries facing the most serious economic problems."
"Does the Commission intend to take bolder steps with a view to achieving more effective cooperation between the Member States in preventing and combating crime in Europe, given the need to defend the individual liberties of European citizens?"
"Member of the Commission. - The most recent edition of Eurostat crime and criminal justice statistics that was published date back to 29 May; it covers the period from 1998 to 2007 and it does not indicate the increase described by the honourable MEP."
"The Commission nevertheless acknowledges that organised crime is a threat to citizens and the economy throughout the European Union."
"The Commission is committed to come up with relevant proposals, and to implement the actions to prevent and to combat various forms of criminal activities, organised or otherwise."
"This is why these objectives are part of the Stockholm Programme comprehensive framework for EU action on the citizens, justice, security and migration policy for the next five years."
"Recently, the Commission adopted the Stockholm Action Plan and I think my colleague, Vice-President Reding, was here just half an hour ago to present it and discuss it with this plenary."
"Furthermore, before the end of this year, the Commission will present a communication on the internal security strategy and that will contain concrete proposals and threat assessments for the coming five years."
"Of course, organised crime will be included in this."
"Common threats require common responses, so common tools should be effectively used by all Member States, public authorities and private organisations."
"Let me mention three types of crime which are truly European and also have an international dimension: trafficking in human beings, cyber crime and identity theft."
"The Commission is determined to reinforce cooperation in this and is also preparing operational and legislative proposals on this."
"We will do this in cooperation with Member States, with the European Parliament and with NGOs and the private sector."
"Dialogue coordination and operations are key words for the future; sharing best practices, standards, guidelines, developing training and research should increase mutual effectiveness and understanding."
"The cooperation with candidate and third countries is important to tackle crimes effectively."
"I would like to underline that an ambitious approach in the decision-making process depends on the political willingness of Member States."
"The effective and efficient implementation of the adopted measures depends on the national resources allocated to achieve objectives."
"The Commission can support Member States by financial programmes to cooperate at a European level."
"As you all know, the Lisbon Treaty provides the European Parliament with new competences in this field, and I would like to stress your responsibility and important role in shaping security in the European Union."
"I thank the Commissioner for her reply."
"I wrote Parliament's report on the European Central Bank last year and one of the issues I raised was the significant increase in EUR 500 notes, and I think the EUR 200 notes as well, but significantly EUR 500 notes."
"I raised the possibility that these were being used for money laundering purposes, for criminal purposes."
"I understand now from the United Kingdom that there are real concerns about this."
"Could I invite the Commissioner to take up with the European Central Bank the concerns I have raised to see who it is who is using such large quantities of EUR 500 notes?"
"I have to say there has to be a reasonable suspicion of tax evasion or perhaps other criminal activity."
"Member of the Commission. - I just want to thank the honourable Member for this information."
"I will certainly look into it and see whether we can track some patterns in this."
"For the moment, I am not in a capacity to answer this but I will certainly look into it and thank you for suggesting this."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your reply."
"You were informative and honest in this particular reply in terms of the date up to which you have data, in other words, up to 2007."
"This question was put to you by me on 6 April 2010 and on 5 May 2010."
"As you know, three people tragically and needlessly lost their lives during peaceful demonstrations by Greek citizens claiming a better tomorrow."
"I shall repeat the question in order to obtain a more specific reply."
"Does the Commission plan to make a more systematic intervention and to make recommendations to the Member States on these issues?"
"Do you intend to collect data on these issues more directly and quickly, given that the problem appears to be getting worse, especially at this time, in numerous Member States?"
"Member of the Commission. - The Commission - and I myself - very much deplore the deaths of these three people in the riots recently, as described by the Member."
"It is always a tragedy when innocent people are affected by these issues."
"We deplore it, and our thoughts are with their families."
"As you say, we need to refresh our statistics all the time, and Eurostat is looking at this."
"Hopefully, we will be able to have a better assessment some time soon."
"We do not plan any initiatives for the moment on this."
"These crimes and these deaths are horrible, but the Commission's competence is limited to cross-border crime and to facilitating cooperation between national authorities and European authorities."
"For the moment, there is no initiative planned in this regard."
"Subject: A common EU visa policy"
"Under Article 77(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and pursuant to secondary legislation published on this legal basis, namely Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 (as amended) determining the list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement, Member States are bound to apply a uniform visa policy and reciprocity."
"Does the European Commission understand 'common visa policy' solely to mean laying down uniform rules for third countries within the internal EU area?"
"Or is it the case that this article of the Treaty on European Union - in addition to dealing with visa policy towards third countries - can also be understood as binding the European Commission and EU Member States to seek to achieve common conditions for all EU Member States in third countries?"
"Member of the Commission. - The visa policy of the European Union is harmonised and it is a common policy."
"It is based on three legal instruments applicable to Member States, namely Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, listing the third countries whose nationals are subject to visa requirements and those who are not; secondly, the visa code covering all procedures and conditions for issuing short-stay Schengen visas; and finally, Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 establishing the uniform format for visas."
"These rules apply to nationals of all third countries subject to visa requirement."
"The first Regulation I referred to establishes a list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing external borders; this is the so-called 'negative' list."
"There is also the positive list: those nationals who are exempt from that requirement on the basis of different criteria, amongst which reciprocity is a basic principle."
"This Regulation is applicable to all EU Member States except for the United Kingdom and Ireland and also to Iceland, Norway and Switzerland."
"In accordance with the principle of reciprocity, the EU considers that, in the case of nationals from third countries who are exempted from the visa requirement for travelling to the EU Member States, the third country should provide reciprocal treatment for the EU citizens by exempting them from the visa requirement when travelling to that country."
"When a third country on the positive list maintains or introduces a visa obligation for nationals of one, two or more Member States, the reciprocity mechanisms apply."
"This is the framework in which the Commission could take steps to obtain the restoration of the visa-free travel by the third country, or if that is not achievable, to propose retaliatory measures on the temporary restoration of the visa requirement for nationals of that third country."
"This system has proven to be quite efficient, as the steps taken by the Commission and drawn up in the periodical reciprocity report show, and under this reciprocity mechanism, applicable since 2005, 75 cases of non-reciprocity concerning 13 third countries of the positive list were notified by Member States."
"Since then, reciprocity has been established with most of these 13 countries, such as Japan, Panama, Singapore, Australia, Uruguay and Costa Rica, and recently the Commission concluded negotiations on a visa waiver with Brazil, and that will be submitted to you and to the Council very soon."
"Problems of non-reciprocity continue to exist for certain Member States vis-à-vis the US and Canada, and this is something that we always bring up with these countries."
"The mechanism does not apply in case a third country on the negative list maintains or imposes the visa obligation only on nationals of one or more member countries, or when the third country applies different conditions for citizens of different Member States."
"The community acquis does not contain rules for such cases and does not provide a specific mechanism, so it is very difficult for the EU to intervene."
"Commissioner, if the European Commission is the guarantor of the common visa policy, and if this policy is based primarily on the principle of reciprocity, how long specifically does the Commission intend to go on tolerating the unprecedented, asymmetric visa regime introduced by a third country, namely Canada, against an EU Member State, namely the Czech Republic?"
"Member of the Commission. - I am, of course, very familiar with the case that the honourable Member is referring to, and the Commission has been extremely involved in this."
"The Canadian authorities have established an office in Prague - that is one condition that we imposed on them - and they are also establishing a roadmap towards restoring visa freedom again."
"We have had several high-level meetings with Canada, the Czech Republic and the Commission in order to outline the steps that need to be taken."
"The Canadians have said that they will change their law and they will submit it very soon to their Parliament in order to change it."
"We are in dialogue with them and with the Czech authorities in order to make sure that the dialogue is still there, that there is a constructive atmosphere, and that we can move towards a solution to this."
"It will be discussed again by the Member States in the Council at the beginning of June."
"I am sorry that this conflict has not been solved yet but I can assure the honourable Member that we are trying, together with our Czech colleagues, to find a solution to this as soon as possible."
"Subject: Unresolved issues in the Turkey-EU Joint Statement of 5 November 2009"
"Bearing in mind:"
"the Joint Statement issued by Mr Atalay, the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Mr Barrot, Vice-President of the Commission, and Mr Billström, representing the EU Council Presidency, on 5 November 2009, in particular, point (3) which refers to the resumption of the formal negotiations on the Turkey-EC readmission agreement and point (5) which states that agreement has now been reached at technical level on the working arrangement between Turkey and Frontex;"
"the answer given by Ms Malmström, President-in-Office of the Council, to my question No. before the plenary sitting of the European Parliament on 16 December 2009; and"
"the constant harassment of Frontex aircraft by Turkish aircraft;"
"Will the Commission say: What stage has been reached in negotiations on point (3) of the Joint Statement?"
"Is there any linkage with the discussions with Frontex?"
"Is the harassment of Frontex aircraft linked to Turkey's refusal explicitly to recognise the EU's Aegean borders?"
"Member of the Commission. - I have a busy agenda today!"
"I would like to recall that we have had a difficult history in negotiations with Turkey starting already with the mandate in 2002, but recently there have been very many positive steps."
"Last year, the Council conclusion on illegal immigration urged accelerating negotiations with Turkey, and, also last year, my predecessor, Mr Barrot, visited Turkey together with the Swedish Minister Billström."
"There was a joint statement at that time moving forward."
"Since then, there has been progress."
"There have been several talks over the winter, and we are now very close to an agreement in negotiations on the readmission agreement with Turkey."
"The Commission is confident that the agreed parts of the text are balanced and that they reflect our needs while addressing Turkey's concerns."
"We are working in order to finalise this text as soon as possible and we are in constant contact with the Turkish authorities."
"The aim is to finalise this and to report on the outcome of the negotiations during the June Council."
"We will keep Parliament fully informed as it will be asked to grant its consent for conclusion once it is concluded."
"On the Frontex arrangement, there is no formal linkage between the negotiation of the working arrangement and the EU-Turkey readmission agreement."
"Having said that, the Commission is taking the necessary steps in order to ensure overall coherence in addressing similar issues in both acts."
"The Commission is not in a position to comment on the delimitation of the territory or the borders of a given Member State, as these issues are the sole responsibility of the Member States and the applicable provisions of international law."
"We would like to encourage Frontex and the host Member State to ensure that adequate information is provided to neighbouring third countries on the deployment of assets such as airborne means close to the borders before a joint operation is launched."
"Commissioner, the difficulty in giving a clear reply to a string of similar questions makes me realise that these negotiations are, in any event, difficult and, to my mind, confirms the question that numerous political issues are being raised by the Turkish side which are making it hard to conclude the negotiations."
"I would be most obliged if, as soon as these negotiations are concluded, as soon as there is an agreement, you would update us."
"I should also like to say the following: during the Turkish Prime Minister's recent visit to Greece, to Athens, a protocol was signed, a memorandum of cooperation with Greece on illegal immigration issues."
"What I want to ask you is this: can this memorandum, this - let us say - readmission agreement between Greece and Turkey replace the agreement between the European Union and Turkey which is being negotiated?"
"Member of the Commission. - Without knowing the exact details of the agreement made between Turkey and Greece, I think it shows the constructive mood that we are in as regards the Greek authorities on the one hand and the Turkish on the other."
"There is a parallel negotiation going on with Turkey."
"We are, as I said, very close to wrapping these negotiations up."
"There has been a very constructive atmosphere and I think this shows the necessity for the European Union of achieving this and also the interest on the Turkish side in reaching an agreement with us on re-admission."
"This is, of course, to the benefit of everybody."
"(EL) Commissioner, in other replies we have received, you expressly said that Frontex is negotiating technical issues with Turkey."
"I understand that."
"You recently told us in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, when you came and updated us on matters within your jurisdiction, that the final agreement with Turkey on illegal immigration issues was, as you said today, making good progress and was close to being wrapped up."
"In this agreement between the European Union and Turkey, should there not also be provision for Frontex between the European Union and Turkey?"
"Is Frontex not a very important factor in combating illegal immigration?"
"I do not know how much you can tell us of what is included in the negotiations, but does common sense not tell us that there should, at this point, be provision for operation and actions by Frontex?"
"Member of the Commission. - I had the opportunity to address the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs last Monday and I repeat what I said at that time, namely, that progress is being made on the negotiations with Turkey."
"Concerning Frontex and the border control of Turkey, they have reached an initial agreement on a draft working arrangement at a technical level."
"Discussions are being pursued by both parties and, for the time being, Frontex is awaiting a reply from Turkey in order to continue the discussions."
"Frontex is an important actor in this but, first of all, we need to get the agreement and then continue in parallel discussions with Frontex."
"I agree that there is a lot of room for cooperation here."
"Subject: EU counter-terrorism policies and CIA rendition"
"A number of recent developments have shed more light on Member State involvement in the US rendition programme."
"A 2010 UN Joint Study has revealed that EU Member States colluded with and participated in activities relating to the CIA rendition programme and secret prisons."
"Given these numerous abuses of power over the past eight years by Member States, and in the light of the Commission's proposed communication on a stocktaking of counter-terrorism policies, can the Commission provide details of specific measures it plans to take to ensure that EU counter-terrorism policies prevent such abuses in the future?"
"Member of the Commission. - Thank you to Sarah Ludford for this question."
"As you know, I have an interest in this and we have also cooperated in the past on this."
"It is needless to say that freedom and security go hand in hand, and respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law is at the heart of the European Union's approach to countering terrorism."
"Measures to fight terrorism must always be undertaken within the framework of full respect for fundamental rights, and the EU must be exemplary in this respect."
"This is not only a legal requirement but also a key condition to ensuring credibility and legitimacy as well as for promoting mutual confidence between the national authorities, and confidence among the public at large."
"The Commission will therefore continue to follow an approach on counter-terrorism which seeks to combine operational and legal effectiveness and feasibility with a clear commitment to the respect of fundamental rights."
"Practices referred to as renditions and secret detentions are a violation of human rights."
"The Commission has always stressed this, and it is up to the Member States concerned to commence or to continue in-depth, independent and impartial investigations to establish the truth."
"This is a positive obligation, deriving from the European Convention of Human Rights, in order to establish responsibilities and to enable victims to obtain compensation."
"We have, from the Commission side, encouraged Poland and Romania to carry out investigations into allegations of the existence of secret detention facilities, and we welcome the launch of criminal investigations in Poland in March 2008."
"The Commission has also written to the Lithuanian authorities welcoming their proactive attitude in initiating investigations."
"As far as the debate on rendition flights and its implications for EU aviation policy are concerned, the Commission draws some lessons in the context of the communication of civil and business aviation from January 2008."
"Furthermore, the Single European Sky, which entered into force last January, provides additional measures for monitoring the actual movement of aircraft, and we will continue to follow this carefully - within our powers, of course."
"In 2008, the Commission provided panoramic factual information in its public staff document on terrorism and fundamental rights."
"This is a synthesis of the replies from the Member States to the questionnaire on criminal law, administrative law, procedural law and fundamental rights in the fight against terrorism."
"All Member States have replied to this questionnaire, and we are right now, in addition, preparing from the Commission side a stock-taking exercise of the main EU measures and policy initiatives taken in the field of counter-terrorism until the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Counter-terrorism policy conducted at national level by Member States or the participation on the CIA rendition programme will not specifically be assessed in this context, but it is very clear what the Commission thinks about this, and we will continue to follow developments in Member States, including legal challenges brought against counter-terrorism measures in national courts, and to draw lessons from sustainable policy making at EU level."
"author. - Commissioner Malmström, I think never has the phrase 'poacher turned gamekeeper' been more appropriate, and I always welcomed working with you on these issues."
"I think what you said is somewhat encouraging in that it signals some strengthening in the oversight and mechanisms that the Commission will have for the future, but the fact is that there is the past."
"Member States participated in illegal CIA rendition, torture and disappearance, and there was a lack of oversight and accountability."
"There was a lot of rhetoric about human rights, just as there is now, but a huge gap between rhetoric and reality."
"We still do not have a full calling to account."
"Are there things that the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, can think of that could still be done not only to try and make sure that Member States respect their obligations in the future, but how we can still get investigations - including, I very much hope, a proper public inquiry now under the new UK Government - to make sure that we know fully what happened in the past and what went wrong?"
"Member of the Commission. - I think the work done by the European Parliament on this aspect has been extremely important in shining a light on the rendition programme and showing what has been happening."
"This has created momentum, but also strong public opinion to find out the truth."
"As I said, the Commission has been urging and encouraging full, in-depth investigations in the countries affected and will continue to follow up and ensure these are really being carried out."
"The Single European Sky proposal is there to help us to further monitor this."
"We will keep an eye on this and will continue to push for clarity."
"Besides that, there is not much concrete that the European Commission can do, but we are happy to work with the European Parliament in order to continue to push for clarity and to make sure that this is not something that would be part of the European policy against terrorism."
"(PL) I would like to ask you, Mrs Malmström, for information on something which is, in my opinion, an important matter."
"The fight against terrorism - and, of course, we all know very well that we have to fight terrorism - also needs European states to cooperate with each other."
"In relation to this, I would like to ask the following question: do you observe that there is a greater tendency on the part of Member States of the Union in terms of cooperation, and is there also a greater tendency in terms of exchanging with each other the different and very important kinds of information necessary to combat terrorism?"
"Have there been any positive changes I this respect?"
"Member of the Commission. - The fight against terrorism is, of course, one crucial element in the policy of the European Union."
"The main actions are being taken by national services, police authorities and national politicians."
"The European Union can support these initiatives, we can provide a certain legal framework, and we can make sure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is respected."
"We have some funding, we can provide support for victims and we can encourage further cooperation."
"My feeling is that there is a lot of cooperation going on between the Member States on this."
"Of course there is still the very sensitive issue of sharing intelligence."
"This is based on trust - or lack of trust sometimes."
"This has to be developed and it can only be done by harmonising and making sure that our European Union systems fully respect the rule of law and that they are trustworthy."
"This is an area where the European Union can help."
"In the Stockholm Programme and in the discussions leading to that, there was a clear willingness for Member States to strengthen cooperation - with each other, within the European Union, but also with third countries - in order to fight terrorism."
"This, of course, always has to be done with full respect for fundamental rights, and the CIA rendition programme is not part of this."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together:"
"Subject: Entrepreneurs and SMEs"
"In the light of the upcoming SME week (25 May - 1 June 2010) and the European Enterprise Awards (31 May), can the Commission give an update on the implementation of the Small Business Act particularly with regard to measures on investment readiness of entrepreneurs, improving their access to finance, reducing administrative burdens and, in particular, on Member States' initiatives and policy decisions to help SMEs tackle problems which hamper their development?"
"Subject: SMEs"
"Does the Commission have any plans to introduce measures to help existing SMEs across the EU who are struggling, and would the Commission consider introducing a special scheme to help young entrepreneurs trying to create successful SMEs in the Union, thus reducing the EU's reliance on FDI in order to boost industry?"
"Subject: SMEs and job creation"
"It is widely recognised that small and medium-sized enterprises are the key to reducing unemployment in Europe, yet they face a disproportionate regulatory burden when compared to larger companies due to economies of scale."
"If every SME in Europe could create one job tomorrow, this would have an enormously positive effect on employment levels."
"What is the Commission doing to promote job creation through SMEs with, for example, regulatory reform and investment?"
"What targets has the Commission set and how will it propose to monitor these targets?"
"Subject: European SME Week"
"Next week is the European SME week."
"Its aim is to promote entrepreneurship, innovation and competitiveness and to provide information concerning the work being done by the European Union and the authorities at all levels to support and fund micro-enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The greatest challenge being faced by small and medium-sized enterprises at the present is securing capital and funding."
"There are many small enterprises, small family businesses and start-ups which were very successful but are now vulnerable because they cannot secure capital."
"What can be done at European level to solve this problem?"
"Subject: Measures to reduce administrative costs for SMEs"
"Can the Commission outline what measures it is undertaking in order to reduce unnecessary administrative costs for small to medium-sized enterprises in the European Union?"
"Mr President, with your new Liberal hat on, could I ask you to clarify what questions will actually be taken?"
"Will Question 33, in Part 3, be taken?"
"We are all trying to attend several meetings."
"If you could clarify exactly the ones that will not be taken, it would be helpful."
"I think it extremely unlikely that we will get to Question 33."
"If you are waiting for that, I would not do so."
"Mr Tajani will now give a single reply and, after that, I will give the questioners - and other colleagues - the opportunity to ask a supplementary question."
"May I make the point that we are going to finish at 20.30 because the staff and the interpreters have to have something to eat before we resume at 21.00."
"Mr President, I have now been speaking in my new capacity for two years."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises continue to constitute a priority for the new Commission, which is convinced of the need to do everything it can to prevent the financial crisis becoming a social crisis that would chiefly affect small and medium-sized enterprises and their employees."
"Since the adoption of the Small Business Act in 2008, substantial progress has been made."
"The Commission has adopted five legislative proposals relating to the Small Business Act, two of which have already been implemented: the block exemption regulation on State aid and the directive on reduced VAT rates; the other three, the directive on late payment, the directive on VAT invoicing and the regulation on a European private company statute, are still under discussion here in Parliament and in the Council."
"The Commission has also set in motion the required non-legislative actions; an 'SME test' has now been introduced across the board for impact studies, to improve the quality of legislation."
"To give an example: the directive on late payment, and the exemption of micro-entities from accounting burdens."
"Member States have also demonstrated a strong political desire to implement the Small Business Act: for example, they have made the 'SME test' part of national decision-making procedures, and small and medium-sized enterprises were amongst the main beneficiaries of the measures adopted by Member States in the context of the European recovery programme to deal with the crisis."
"For instance, the creation and extension of loans and guarantees to small and medium-sized enterprises was among the measures adopted to improve access to finances."
"However, the chosen methods and the results obtained differ between States, and we therefore need to continue working on the implementation of the Small Business Act at national level."
"I therefore consider it crucial to pursue the courses of action undertaken, and ensure that the principles and recommended courses of action are implemented at both European and national levels."
"The policy in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises is fully supported by the Europe 2020 strategy, is an integral part of many lighthouse initiatives envisaged and will be subject to a specific check when the strategy is implemented in Member States."
"One of the 10 supplementary guidelines proposed by the Commission calls on Member States to implement a series of measures for small and medium-sized enterprises, according to the principles of the Small Business Act."
"The next stage will involve ensuring that Member States incorporate these measures in their national reform programmes."
"By the end of this year, we will have carried out an in-depth examination of the implementation of the Act, to measure the progress made and identify new courses of action that also take into account the Europe 2020 priorities."
"The main areas of action will include improving access to credit and innovation, encouraging the spirit of enterprise and promoting the internationalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those managed by young entrepreneurs, will be among the main beneficiaries of these new initiatives."
"Mindful of the difficulties that small and medium-sized enterprises currently encounter when trying to access finances, the European Commission has closely followed developments in the sector, collaborating particularly with the European Central Bank with the aim of carrying out regular surveys of the situation."
"The Commission has also drawn up a series of programmes that offer financial support to help small and medium-sized enterprises to gain access to capital that they need to develop their activities."
"The Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, for example, incorporates certain financial instruments developed in conjunction with the European Investment Fund, which provide incentives for risk operations and loan guarantee operations for enterprises."
"The Jeremie programme financed by the European Regional Development Fund offers a huge range of specific financial products to develop and strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises in European territory as a whole."
"Finally, the new European micro-finance instrument, a joint initiative between the Commission and the European Investment Bank, is specifically directed at micro-enterprises that have difficulty obtaining ad hoc financing."
"Access by small and medium-sized enterprises to credit has also improved, due to an increase in the sum of credit lines granted by the European Investment Bank to the intermediary banks that are responsible for reallocating the sums to small and medium-sized enterprises in the form of loans."
"In 2009, the European Investment Bank granted a total amount of EUR 13 billion to financial institutions; the equivalent of a 55% increase over the previous year."
"For your information, more than 75% of the EUR 21 billion granted in 2008-2009 reached the small and medium-sized enterprises to which they were destined, that is to say, 50 000 small and medium-sized enterprises all over the Union."
"A few days ago, the Commission also organised a high level conference where banks, risk capital funds and small and medium-sized enterprises came together; a meeting also attended by representatives from the European Parliament."
"This allowed us to examine the current market situation and to explore new ideas and strategies to improve access to finances for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"It was an important occasion for discussing possible courses of action to be undertaken to help enterprises in order to sustain recovery and economic growth."
"One of the courses of action that was decided upon was the establishment of a permanent discussion forum with financial institutions, risk capital funds and representatives from small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Quarterly meetings will be chaired by the European Commission."
"The conclusions from this forum will constitute the first stage of a strategy intended to establish a plan of action to provide access to credit and capital for small and medium-sized enterprises in our Union."
"Finally, I shall take advantage of this debate to inform Parliament that as part of the first European SME Week, more than 1 200 national, regional and local events will be held, concerning a wide range of issues affecting this sector."
"The SME week will take place between 25 May and 1 June, at the same time as the 2010 European Enterprise Awards ceremony, planned for 31 May in Madrid."
"All this is to confirm to you my personal commitment to ensure that employment in our Union can be defended by offering support to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The necessary restructuring of large-scale private industry will cause some jobs to be lost, and the only way we can bolster employment is by supporting the development of the small and medium-sized enterprises that represent the backbone of our European economy."
"author. - I want to congratulate the Commissioner on progress achieved."
"However, Commissioner, you talked about one of the major problems as being access to capital, and you mentioned the European Investment Bank."
"It has distributed funds to Irish banks to distribute on to SMEs."
"However, a considerable amount is not being distributed, mainly because of the mismatch between the needs of SMEs - refinancing of some sort - and the European Investment Bank objective, which is money for medium-term investment."
"So I want to ask you if you agree that some measures need to be put in place for SMEs which will require refinancing, and what role the Commission could play."
"Furthermore, would you favour some kind of enterprise guarantee scheme, similar to what is in the UK?"
"Mr President, I agree completely with the Commission's statement that SMEs are very important, not only due to the number of jobs they create but also because they are more stable than large companies that come in and have no loyalty to the region or to the country."
"I completely agree with my fellow Member Marian Harkin's statement that a lack of finance is the biggest hindrance at present, and the Commission has referred to this."
"As well as that, there is too much bureaucracy or 'red tape' in place."
"author. - I want to ask the Commissioner if he will look at the non-direct financing aspects of the problems that SMEs are encountering."
"For example, I do not know what it is like in your country, but in my country, there is no such thing as a bank manager any more."
"We are giving money to banks, but banks do not assess people on their track record, on their character and on the knowledge of their business."
"We got into the mess we are in because people were on automatic."
"To some extent, they are still on automatic."
"How do you win an election?"
"One vote at a time."
"If we can get one job in every SME in Europe, we will end the unemployment crisis."
"I ask you please to consult with the European Central Bank and European Investment Bank and try to bring your influence to bear to get us back to traditional bank managers who engage with SMEs and help them to develop their businesses."
"It will return a dividend."
"The obvious question is, does the Commission actually believe that SME Week can deliver on its aims?"
"Can I ask the Commission what action can be taken to ensure that the European Union and Member States create an environment in which entrepreneurs and family businesses can survive, develop and thrive and entrepreneurship is rewarded, not hindered, which is often the case in the present economic climate?"
"Mr President, I will be brief: I agree with the observations of all the Members of Parliament who have spoken in this debate."
"As regards the European Investment Bank, I took immediate action after taking up my position as Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship to meet President Maystadt and urge him to deliver the EUR 30 billion allocated to help small and medium-sized enterprises from the European Investment Bank."
"This is what I promised Parliament in my hearing, before it entrusted me with the job of Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship."
"To continue, the President's response was quite positive: he told me that, after an initial freeze, some EUR 6 to 7 billion of the EUR 30 billion allocated had reached the intended destination."
"I urged the President to speed up the delivery times."
"There is also a problem concerning the banks in our area - a point raised by the last speaker - because the European banking system is quite diversified: not all banks are the same."
"Some banks engage in financial speculation, but fortunately, we still have a banking network where the manager knows the businessman who goes to ask for credit, and so he can trust him, and also knows that the money he invests will be reinvested in the bank, and that what happened in the United States will not happen here."
"The meeting that I organised a few days ago, which was attended by many of your European Parliamentary colleagues, was really aimed at this: at developing a strategy."
"This is why I said that we have set up a forum that will later lead to an action plan for providing credit."
"The aim is for our small and medium-sized enterprises to be competitive."
"For them to be competitive, there must be innovation, but innovation is impossible if no funds are earmarked for this purpose."
"Hence, my primary commitment to involving the banks - even the banks supplying credit."
"Many of them have committed themselves to doing this in the future."
"We are taking strong action, with stimulus from the Commission, involving banks and financial operators and also the European Investment Bank, which sent two vice-presidents to take part in the debate."
"The aim of this action is to achieve at least some of these objectives, in the conviction that small and medium-sized enterprises represent the best instrument today for emerging from the crisis and - as I said at the start of my speech - for preventing the economic and financial crisis from turning into a social crisis."
"You can count on my total commitment to defending, protecting and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises - and that also applies to financial aspects - in the hope that they will be able to grow, and that new businesses will spring up, because our goal is still the same as ever: with a market economy that allows small and medium-sized enterprises to become increasingly competitive, we can create a genuine social policy, in the words of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I apologise to colleagues for the rather shortened Question Time because the previous debate overran by 25 minutes."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 20.30 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Principle of subsidiarity and universality of social public services in the EU (debate)"
"The sitting is resumed."
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (Β7-0218/2010) by Jan Olbrycht and Lambert van Nistelrooij, on behalf of the PPE Group, Heide Rühle, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Oldřich Vlasák, on behalf of the ECR Group, Peter Simon, Françoise Castex, Evelyne Gebhardt and Proinsias De Rossa, on behalf of the S&D Group, and Ramona Nicole Mănescu and Olle Schmidt, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on the principle of subsidiarity and universality of social public services in the EU."
"I would like to point out that the oral question which has been asked here was brought about by a decision of the European Commission on identifying which groups can make use of social housing in the Netherlands."
"That decision provoked a great deal of discussion and interest among Members of the European Parliament because it has important consequences."
"It has to be realised that in different Member States of the European Union, different definitions are in use for social housing considered as a public service."
"These definitions also concern the fact that we have different criteria for use of social housing, and that we have different ranges of responsibility as well."
"Responsibility rests with the public authorities, but the contractors are both public and non-public."
"Interest in social housing results, on the one hand, from regulations concerning public aid, but also concerns the definition which is used in the case of identifying qualified costs for structural funds."
"In relation to this, as a supplement to the question, it would be interesting to know whether the Commission thinks that there should be one definition for the whole of the European Union."
"Should the same principles function in relation to public aid in social housing?"
"Does the Commission intend to establish in each case a permissible level of domestic income as in the case with the Netherlands?"
"Is this type of action definitely in accordance with the subsidiarity principle which operates in the European Union?"
"Madam President, I would like to make reference to a press release that the Commission itself issued on 19 December last year in connection with the State aid decision on the Dutch social housing system."
"I will now quote from the statement. 'The Commission's decision confirms its long-standing policy line that national authorities have a wide margin in defining the criteria and conditions for social housing and other Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI).'"
"My question is as follows. How does this statement by the Commission fit in with the fact that, through this decision, the Commission laid down fixed income limits for social housing in the Netherlands?"
"Does that actually fall within the Commission's competence, and how does it relate to subsidiarity and proportionality?"
"Furthermore, I would also like to ask the Commission how the decision to formally recognise the necessity of a social mix whilst speaking out against social segregation can be compatible with the fact that, at the same time, a fixed proportion of no more than 10% above the EUR 30 000 threshold has been laid down whilst the Commission also states that if, at any point, more than 10% above this EUR 30 000 social housing threshold obtain housing, this will have to be made up for in other areas in the Netherlands?"
"That, it seems to me, is a very fixed and rigid arrangement when it comes to the issue of social mixing."
"How does that fit in with subsidiarity and - as you yourselves stated in your press release - with the 'wide margin in defining the criteria and conditions for social housing and other Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI)'?"
"Madam President, I, too, would like to address the Commission on this notification of aid for social housing by the Netherlands, the European Commission's response to which is that it must be brought into line with competition rules."
"It has therefore recommended a radical reform of social housing and its missions of general interest and, in my opinion, has developed a restrictive definition of what constitutes social services of general interest."
"In fact, the Commission recognises the social character of this public service, but underlines that it should be defined, and I quote, 'in direct connection with disadvantaged social groups' and that, consequently, the supply of social housing in the Netherlands exceeds the individual needs of disadvantaged social groups."
"The proposal for a reform of social housing thus presented by the Dutch Government limits to 10% the volume of social housing that can be allocated to other social groups, but always according to social criteria or in order of priority."
"This limitation amounts to undermining another public service mission that is fulfilled by the service of social housing, namely the objective of social and urban diversity, which is defined for social housing by the Dutch legislator."
"Therefore, the question for me, Commissioner, Members of the Commission, is on what legal basis in the treaty can the Commission call into question the universal character of social services and force a Member State to redefine the missions that it allocates to one of these social services?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the question put forward by the honourable Members falls into three parts."
"The first: whether the Commission is of the opinion that there should be one single definition of social housing in the EU."
"The second: the question on the principles of subsidiarity and universality."
"The third: a question of income limits for access to social housing."
"Before replying to these questions, I would like to underline that the Commission attaches great importance to social housing."
"Social housing is a key tool for active social and economic inclusion policies in the European Union."
"In reply to questions 1 and 2, I would like to be very clear."
"The Commission imposes no single definition of social housing at EU level and fully respects the principle of subsidiarity."
"The honourable Members rightly refer to the Commission's 2005 decision on State aid for services of general economic interest."
"This decision provides legal certainty in the provision of the services and reduces the administrative burden on the public authorities which finance them."
"According to this decision, aid to social housing which meets the conditions set by the decision receives preferential treatment, as it is exempted from notification - irrespective of the amounts involved."
"According to this decision, that exemption applies when social housing is qualified as a service of general economic interest by the Member State concerned."
"It is for each Member State to define the scope of social housing in line with its traditions, culture and state intervention."
"I would also like to refer to the Commission communications of 2006 and 2007, which clearly highlighted the Member States' responsibility and wide discretion as regards social services of general interest."
"Furthermore, this point was emphasised more recently in the Protocol on Services of General Interest."
"However, as the term 'social housing' suggests, what is involved here is not housing in general, but housing provided on the basis of social criteria."
"This is why the recitals in the 2005 decision refer to housing for disadvantaged citizens or socially less advantaged groups which, due to solvency constraints, are unable to obtain housing at market conditions."
"The Member States must therefore define a target group for social housing to allow social housing to be allocated in a transparent way and to prevent those most in need from being excluded."
"The Member States have wide scope for manoeuvre in determining the size of the target group and in applying the social housing systems."
"The Commission's role is limited to checking that there is no manifest error in the definition."
"This approach was confirmed in a Commission decision adopted in December 2009 on social housing in the Netherlands."
"This approach is also fully in line with Article 34 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which refers to social and housing assistance for all those who lack sufficient resources."
"A clear definition of social housing also ensures that State aid cannot be channelled into financing commercial activities outside the scope of services of general economic interest."
"Question 2 also refers to a universal right to housing."
"However, as I have already said, housing in general is not the same as social housing."
"Clear-cut, transparent eligibility and allocation criteria for social housing are in the interest of the beneficiaries and ensure the proper use of public funds."
"In reply to question 3, in which the honourable Members ask why access to social housing is limited to households with an income of less than EUR 33 000, I would like, here again, to be very clear."
"There is no income limit set at EU level for access to social housing."
"This amount concerns one Member State - the Netherlands."
"It was part of the changes introduced by the Dutch authorities to bring the national social housing system in line with the European State aid rules."
"The Dutch authorities set such a limit to identify the target group for social housing in the Netherlands."
"The Commission did not identify any errors with that definition of social housing and therefore approved the Dutch State aid scheme."
"I would add that the target group defined by the Dutch authorities is very wide and covers 43% of the Dutch population."
"At a time of crisis, and of debate on how to maintain a sustainable society and our competitiveness, we are discussing an apparent detail that, as I see it, nevertheless goes to the heart of many people's concerns."
"The issue concerned is who is to be allocated housing?"
"Particularly now that banks are being much more reserved than they were when the debate started - which, in the Netherlands, was in 2005, when the situation was quite different - it is clear that some people are really getting into difficulties."
"The threshold that has now been set is EUR 33 000."
"These proposals still have to be presented for approval to the members of the lower house of the Dutch Parliament, and they will tell us straight away that this threshold should, in fact, be in line with the threshold for the Netherlands' sickness insurance fund, which is approximately EUR 40 000."
"The debate in the Netherlands is still in full swing, therefore: it is not the case that everyone is now in agreement."
"I feel that insufficient room is left for flexibility, for tailor-made solutions."
"Member States must be able to adapt to circumstances."
"This 10% is very small."
"After I graduated, my income was also above the threshold, but I was able to keep on my rented accommodation for a quite a few years before deciding once and for all to buy and to go and live somewhere else."
"We are talking about flexibility; there is not enough elbow room."
"This leads me to the conclusion that subsidiarity - countries' ability to arrange things themselves within a much broader range - is not being sufficiently respected."
"Following today's debate, we must look at whether to come back again with a resolution."
"On the whole, I think that the Commission is making a good job of this, but I think that Member States' elbow room is excessively restricted, to the detriment of people who depend on it for their housing."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I follow this debate, I note that there is actually a great deal of uncertainty in relation to how the law is to be applied in these areas."
"Mr Andor, you just said that there is no European regulation laying down EUR 33 000 as a fixed limit."
"Dutch legislators, however, have laid down this limit of their own free will, probably because they were afraid that otherwise, the Commission would, at some point, require clear criteria to be put in place."
"This uncertainty leads to a great many difficulties in the Member States in relation to taking decisions themselves, specifically in terms of shaping those decisions so that they truly match up to what we need for these people and, in particular, for social housing, as these are people who do not have enough money to be able to move about freely."
"It is therefore very important for us to create a legal framework and legal certainty that also properly clarifies what is possible."
"Services of general economic interest, of course, really do need to be protected."
"They are provided at the local level in the Member States and they are universal and we need to ensure that they really are offered to everyone."
"We therefore have to consider - and I know this is being considered in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs - demanding from the Commission a legal framework to protect services of general economic interest, especially in the social field, and I think that such a framework, were it to be provided, would be a good thing."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we are talking here about legal basis, which is obviously very important."
"However, behind this legal basis, I would like to underline the fact that housing and, in particular, social housing, is clearly not a market like any other or a commercial activity like any other."
"Moreover, social housing is much more than housing reserved for people on low incomes or in need."
"There are the issues of social diversity, which we have spoken about, but there is also the integration of these houses and of the people who live in them into their neighbourhood, into their town, sometimes in town centres, sometimes on the outskirts."
"A great deal of work is done with the tenants, work to help them integrate and to establish solidarity, including among the different generations who live in these neighbourhoods and in this housing and, therefore, in this regard, I really think that this is a different kind of subject."
"In addition, during this legislature, we are going to work on services of general interest."
"It seems to me that coming here and underlining problems linked to aid or to limited access to social housing sends out the wrong signal."
"As for the income limit, which was mentioned by other Members apart from me and which is set at EUR 33 000, I think that it poses a problem because there is a whole range of very different families: single parent families, families comprising elderly people, families comprising members from past and present relationships, families that have separated."
"How can we calculate their incomes?"
"All of that leads me, like others, to call for more flexibility and subsidiarity if we want real social projects in these neighbourhoods."
"Madam President, Commissioner, you just said that the Commission attached great importance to social housing."
"Indeed, we are talking about a fundamental right that is not being applied in our Member States."
"Moreover, this is another stain on our current model of European integration."
"As for the rest of your answer, Commissioner, you recited the Commission's usual prayer book, but experience shows that the Commission, your Commission, and the European Court of Justice are passing judgment on the basis of the European treaties, in accordance with a fatal principle, that of free and undistorted competition, and are therefore creating illegal access to housing construction and to housing itself."
"Worse still, in 2005, the European Commission defined social housing as housing reserved exclusively for, and I quote, 'disadvantaged citizens or socially less advantaged groups'."
"The Commission is thus encouraging the creation of ghetto cities for the poor, to the detriment of social diversity."
"Like many Members, I support the idea of a new framework directive that is positive and progressive, but I fear that it is the very principle of competition enshrined in the treaties that should be changed."
"On the other hand, I fear that the statements made by President Barroso and confirmed today by the Ecofin Council which, in principle, recommend controlling the budgets, will lead to a reduction in the spending allocated to low-cost housing offices and, in particular, to social housing."
"I definitely believe that Europe must start from scratch."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like, in a way, to echo the opinion of Mrs Durant, who rightly affirmed that social housing is not a commercial sector or a sector subject to competition like any other."
"Commissioner, I believe that we will agree on this point."
"State aid is being called into question here."
"I wonder why, in an area such as social housing, we would not theoretically be precisely in the area of State aid."
"Indeed, we are talking about State aid for the beneficiaries of social housing, not so much for enterprises."
"Ultimately, aid is allocated because it is deemed necessary; it is not so much issues of competition that are at stake."
"I note - and I can certainly only speak on the basis of my own experience nationally - that social housing is linked to such different conditions that we should really be glad that the European Commission, the European institutions, Europe and Brussels are not, as is always felt, responsible for giving us a precise definition of aid, for telling us which citizen can benefit from which aid and under which circumstances."
"I would stress that what is at stake here are specific local conditions and changes in the family circumstances of each and every one of us."
"How could somebody who had a family, but whose family status then changes, somebody whose income varies in the course of his life, as Mr van Nistelrooij said, one day be granted the right to social housing, according to a number of criteria, only to then see it withdrawn?"
"I feel that this is unreasonable and, in these circumstances, I do not believe that the Commission should go beyond its remit again to propose to us, and ultimately impose on us, rules that would inevitably lack flexibility and probably also humanity."
"Madam President, I participate in this debate as the Employment Committee rapporteur on the future of social services of general interest."
"This oral question seeks to establish from the Commission what proposals it has to address a serious problem in relation to the delivery of social housing for citizens."
"I regret that the Commissioner did not indicate any such proposals rather than seek to justify the existing system."
"There is a persistent refusal by the Commission to come to terms with the need to create legal clarity and flexibility for Member Sates with regard not only to the delivery of existing public services - and particularly social services - but also to meeting new social needs."
"We must be able not only to provide citizens with a safety net in times of need, but also to provide a robust social framework which serves all citizens."
"Health, housing and education are services which should obviously be provided on a universal basis and not simply at the whim of the market."
"That the market is incapable of delivering universality on the basis of equality and equal quality in these areas is self-evident."
"These are all services which reach beyond the profit motive and deliver social value, which cannot be accounted for by a profit-and-loss balance sheet."
"They are also, as it happens, needed to create a solid basis for a modern economy."
"The present legal inadequacy with regard to what governments at both national and local level may do in the delivery of services identified as essential to the well-being of society cannot be allowed to continue much longer."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to place something on record: Community competence does not exist in the area of housing policy in general and of social housing in particular."
"However, in the decision that we mention in this oral question, the Commission does give a definition of social housing."
"As has been said repeatedly, Commissioner, the problem of social housing and of access to housing is a major problem today, at this time of crisis."
"Let us put a little bit of humanity back into our technical, legal, and even technocratic, debates."
"Over and above housing per se, social housing is the foundation of real integration, of real social inclusion for those who benefit from it."
"The definition that was given in the course of the review carried out by the Commission on State aid is entirely debatable."
"Commissioner, Descartes, the great French philosopher born in my region, the Loire Valley, said: 'The general interest is a circle of which the centre is known, but the circumference is unknown'."
"Therefore, I have two questions for you."
"The first is simple: what is the legal status of this definition?"
"Is it to be applied to all Member States?"
"The second question is much more general."
"In the opinion of the Commission, where does Community competence as regards the organisation of public services begin and where does it end?"
"For this question is important, after all."
"The universality and the accessibility of public services are at stake."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, right across Europe, our cities and communities have to struggle with problem districts."
"Right across Europe, we try to solve this problem by bringing these disadvantaged areas and the people living in them up to the level of normal life in the rest of our towns and cities."
"If, however, we now lay down criteria in the field of social housing, as the Commission is doing here, if we lay down criteria that explicitly - as some Members have already said - preclude a mixing of the population in these areas, that will undermine all the efforts made by the competent parties on the ground for decades."
"It will also undermine ventures that the European Union has promoted with its Community initiatives Urban and Urban II."
"If, here, we restrict the criteria according to which social housing can be subsidised in such a way that actually only the poorest of the poor, the most disadvantaged of the disadvantaged, receive a subsidy and can be helped within the framework of social housing, we will actually be putting up obstacles to this segment of the population mixing in disadvantaged districts, something that is, in fact, urgently needed."
"This will lead to more social exclusion of precisely these population groups and will only increase these problems in our cities."
"With that in mind, a broad definition and broad interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity are the order of the day, and I would be grateful to the Commission if it could briefly express a position in this regard."
"(DE) Madam President, what we have here is more of a global question, specifically that of the principle of subsidiarity and the universality of public social services in the EU as a whole."
"However, social housing has been set in the spotlight of this debate on the example of the Netherlands."
"This is not a one-off case - tenants' associations and tenants' representatives, in particular, have suspected for years that Europe's focus on competitiveness at the very least restricts social housing in Europe, if not aims to make it completely impossible."
"After the need for food and clothing, the need for housing is a basic human need, after all, and for that reason, housing is one of the social public goods, and preventing homelessness is a social challenge."
"An expression of this is the fact that in States that are considerate of the welfare of their citizens, either social housing is supported or else housing is individually subsidised based on people's income."
"Of course, we now have a special case in the European Union following the accession of numerous eastern, central and south-eastern European countries."
"Due to the different structuring of housing provision in the former Western and Eastern parts of Europe, there is a need, especially following the most recent enlargements of the European Union, to compare the structures of housing subsidies and housing provision in the Member States."
"As a result of the method of privatisation of housing in many eastern, central and south-eastern European Member States immediately following the political changes and, in particular, as a result of the perceptible shortage of housing in those countries, the European Parliament reacted by making structural funds available for housing in these countries."
"Despite that, housing policy continues to always be a reaction to the national, regional and, in particular, local circumstances in each case; in other words, it is a classic case of a policy area where subsidiarity applies, where there is no need for supranational regulation and where no such regulation exists."
"For housing as a public social good, market laws can only have a very limited application within the scope of public services."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, public services and social services are beset by enormous economic and political upheaval, the more so given national cost-saving measures."
"In the European Union, we are facing growing income disparities."
"Especially in times of uncertainty, the economic crisis and fears for the future, social stabilisers are more important than ever."
"In my home city of Vienna, the basic idea of social housing consists of bringing about affordable housing for broad sections of the population and not restricting this - as defined by the Commission - to disadvantaged citizens or socially less advantaged groups."
"The result of that is ghettoisation."
"I thus have no intention of changing my opinion in this regard - it should be a principle or a right of local self-government to define social services, including social housing, at that local level and to exclude social services from the scope of competition and State aid law."
"In any event, though, we need legal clarity in the European Union and a legal instrument at the EU level that covers and defines social services accordingly."
"Madam President, firstly, I would like to thank the Commissioner for clarifying some of the points which were raised in the questions."
"It has to be said that the provision of a house is an absolute necessity for everybody, particularly in the modern welfare state."
"Having a roof over your head is absolutely vital; it is a right and is something which everyone would agree that should be provided either through one's own means or through government agencies, etc."
"Having said that, there is a debate to be had on how much interference the government of any particular country should have in the provision of housing."
"In my own country, the property bubble was created by tax incentives - which were too generous and not well thought out - for builders to build houses and providing them with the planning permission - sometimes even in flood plains, which have since been flooded - and rezoning land which should not have been rezoned."
"Then, of course, the banks chipped in by giving generous loans to builders which they could not pay back and to individuals to purchase houses which they could not pay back."
"We therefore have the crisis we have at the moment."
"So there are a lot of questions there on how involved the state should be in the whole property development area."
"However in the provision of social housing, I think firstly basing it on income is just too prescriptive and does not make any sense for the reasons given by many people."
"There is definitely a role, I think, for the Commission in the broader sense, perhaps in giving guidelines on the provision of social housing, but to be too prescriptive in regard to such things as income, etc. does not make sense; it will not work and it should not be attempted."
"(RO) Social housing does indeed come under services of general interest."
"Unfortunately, the rate of youth unemployment has reached 20% in the European Union at the moment."
"According to the European Regulation, a rate of 4% of the European Regional Development Fund allocation can be used by all Member States to fund the building of social housing and the improvement of energy efficiency in buildings."
"Unfortunately, due to the economic crisis, the economic situation of European families is getting worse, and the unemployment rate, which is extremely high among young people, is a cause for concern."
"This is precisely the reason why I would ask you, Commissioner, to support us in raising this rate up to 15% during the forthcoming financial programming period for the building of social housing and energy efficiency improvements in buildings."
"In the majority of Member States, health care, education, social services and the care of young people and the elderly are managed by the State."
"These public services play a vital role in ensuring protection and the inclusion of all citizens in society, provided that they are accessible to all citizens."
"In order to ensure that this applies throughout the whole European Union, we call on the Commission to draw up a public services framework directive which will introduce minimum requirements in this area and guarantee both equal, universal access for all European citizens and good quality and transparency with these services."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, social housing is an economic service of general interest with an important role in the market, creating positive outcomes for the benefit of the whole of society."
"In accordance with Protocol 26, Annex to the Treaty of Lisbon, it falls to national, regional and local authorities to implement and organise this type of service."
"It is therefore hard to understand this restriction of the target market to families whose income is less than EUR 33 000."
"This is a measurement of poverty that is carried out in terms that are absolute and purely financial, and does not take into account the diversity of the 27 Member States; its line of argument can be summarised as one of simple solvency."
"Social housing responds to cultural and social questions; to proximity to a place of work; to the significant redefinition of the role of women in the market; and to the mobility of workers in the European area."
"The struggle in which the European Union is engaged to get out of the present crisis requires economic growth, which leads to immigration and ethnic, economic and cultural minorities, and the need for their integration, even with the risks of ghettoisation that are associated with it and which we must fight with fair balance."
"Is the Commission not intruding in the competences of the Member States?"
"Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon recognises the importance of the availability and accessibility of social services and the roles played by local and regional authorities in providing these."
"The issues of social housing are of extreme importance to people with low incomes, and it is a reality that the crisis has left a large number of people unemployed, who are in need of social housing."
"Currently, Member States apply different standards when deciding their criteria for social housing."
"It is understandable that the economic and social situations differ significantly in the Member States."
"In order to implement the right of access to universal services, I believe it would be reasonable to define general principles and to set the recommended upper income limit at EU level."
"However, we need to allow broad discretion for the Member States to make this lower, taking into account economic and social differences."
"(RO) I wish to thank the Commissioner for the clarifications he has provided on this issue."
"I do not believe either that there should be a single definition of social housing."
"Such a definition would be difficult to use in the situation where there are large differences in terms of standard of living."
"The issue of subsidiarity is relevant in this debate."
"I will digress slightly, if I may, beyond the specific scope of the question."
"I believe that there should be, nevertheless, a set of clearer standards, but, in another respect, for example, in situations which involve the application of new regulations on eligibility for housing for marginalised communities."
"This is a regulation which this Parliament adopted in February and which was also mentioned by Mrs Ţicău."
"I, too, wish to take this opportunity to say that I would welcome an increase in the funds available, based on this regulation."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I wanted to have this debate simply because I, like others here, am concerned."
"Several regions of Europe, including my own, are currently carrying out an assessment aimed at reforming their policy for allocating social housing in order to avoid the phenomena of ghettoisation and of grouping disadvantaged social groups together in the same buildings and the same neighbourhoods."
"Your decision runs counter to this policy of social rebalancing and of necessary social diversity."
"Commissioner, it is not right that the Commission is preventing the Member States from conducting policies of social diversity."
"Certainly, access to social services of general interest relating to housing could, on the one hand, be limited to certain categories of people, but, on the other, a certain room for manoeuvre should be left so that they are accessible to people on other incomes, in order to improve social diversity in our neighbourhoods."
"In any event, the balance between these two aspects should be defined by or with the Member States and the regions, and not by the Commission."
"(PT) Madam President, we all know that the right to housing is a fundamental right."
"The Member States of the European Union are therefore obliged to guarantee social housing for anyone who needs it."
"At a time of profound social crisis, where the number of people and families with high levels of debt, and who are finding it difficult to repay the loans with which they bought their houses, or who are enduring high rents, is rising, it is even more important to give full support to people and families who cannot afford suitable housing with adequate facilities and utilities."
"It is therefore essential for the Member States to be able to use Union and national funds to build social housing and guarantee the fundamental rights to which all citizens are entitled, bringing an end to social inequalities and encouraging social inclusion."
"The European Commission must take urgent action in this area, without threatening the principle of subsidiarity but supporting the universality of social public services."
"(SK) European centralisation is sometimes accompanied by fanfares, as we saw with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"At other times, however, it arrives unobtrusively."
"The creation of various EU support funds, which often deform the market environment, has made it necessary to introduce mandatory notification of the provision of State aid."
"The need then became apparent for exemptions from this obligation in the case of social housing."
"Suddenly, we have a European definition on our hands."
"If we define obligations at this level and then order those at lower levels to implement them, it is not subsidiarity."
"Responsibility for social housing is fully within the competence of national, regional and local authorities."
"Let us not question the ability of national societies and local communities to solve their own problems."
"They are the ones who know these problems best."
"They also know the options for solving them."
"(PL) It is clear that we are dealing with a problem which is different in different Member States."
"In the new countries, including Poland, we have very many regions where very many people do not have a home because of very, very low incomes."
"Those people are mainly taken care of by local authorities."
"It rests with the local authorities and regional institutions to help such people as quickly as possible."
"Without additional funding at the disposal of local authorities, and without public support, help for people who are in this most difficult situation is impossible."
"At the same time, it would also be necessary to consider how, in the future, by creating a common policy and a common definition in this area, to try to obtain additional funds which could be used by regional authorities."
"They would use the money and would create social housing, of which there is, truly, very, very little in many countries of Europe."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I fully agree that we have to look at this question in a wider context, in this case, in the context of the financial and economic crisis."
"In the last two years, we saw that this was a test of competition policies no matter whether it concerned the financial sector, the automotive sector or, in this case, the housing sector, and it was also a test of our social policies, whether it concerned children or the elderly or the homeless."
"In this set of questions which I received, these two issues - competition and social policies - overlap."
"That is why it is even more complex than it would be outside the context of the crisis."
"The crisis demonstrated an enormous market failure, not only in the financial sector but also in the housing sector, and it became very clear that market forces alone cannot resolve these problems, not only for the extremely poor, but also for larger groups of society."
"That is why I would be strictly against any principle that would restrict the concept of social housing to only the poorest groups in society, especially with respect to the diversity of European countries and the principle of subsidiarity."
"I would certainly insist on leaving the definitions in this context to the Member States themselves as I have said already in my introductory speech."
"Going back to the Dutch case, which has been the focus of the discussion, I would like to repeat that the Commission is not imposing the criteria that have been set in the Dutch context to any other country."
"In full respect of subsidiarity, it is for the Member States to decide the actual conditionality of social housing."
"This is confirmed by the decision concerning the Dutch State aid scheme, and I would like to recall that the limits set by the Dutch authorities - which apply only in the Netherlands - cover 43% of the Dutch population, which is certainly well beyond the poorest groups."
"The Dutch decision, moreover, has confirmed that the social mix and social cohesion are valid public policy objectives for which State aid may be justified, and not only for those living in extreme poverty or at risk of poverty."
"I think the social distress in this over the last few years has destabilised society on a much wider scale, and that is why we have to be sensitive to this."
"I would also need to add that the Commission only verifies aid given to housing companies."
"Any subsidy given directly to citizens is not subject to State aid rules."
"The discussion also touched upon a wider context, which is social services of general interest."
"That is why I need to address this as well and emphasise that beyond housing, other services of general interest and, in particular, other social services play a preventive and socially cohesive role which is targeted at the whole population independently of wealth or income."
"The Commission made this point clear in its 2007 communication when it highlighted the objectives and principles of organisation of social services."
"The Commission is committed to promoting the quality of social services."
"For instance, we support the development of a quality framework for social services of general interest within the Social Protection Committee."
"A few final thoughts in closing my answer."
"Since some of the questions concerned a longer timescale, spanning into the next financial perspective, I would agree that, in a variety of contexts, housing will be affected; indeed, refurbishment in the context of energy efficiency - which, from our point of view, falls under the category of green jobs - will certainly be an area where we will have activity, without, of course, trying to have a common European housing policy."
"There will also be other issues like housing for the most vulnerable groups of society such as the Roma, where there is already a beginning, and I think there will be continued support from the Structural Funds to address housing issues, in this particular case, for the extremely vulnerable marginalised groups in a variety of Member States."
"This also highlights the importance of having a very diversified view because countries are different in terms of their social needs, and certain decisions and solutions that are applied in high-income countries certainly do not necessarily have to be followed - and definitely not imposed - in other Member States."
"The debate is closed."
"Security and prevention measures on offshore oil platforms in the EU (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on security and prevention measures on offshore oil platforms in the EU."
"Madam President, 20 April was a dark day for the Gulf of Mexico, for the United States of America, nay, for the whole world."
"For exactly four weeks now, the industry and the authorities have been trying everything - without conclusive success thus far - to bring a halt to the enormous oil leak and to minimise the environmental damage, in particular, on the coast."
"The accident throws into sharp relief the risks associated with oil and gas supply works out at sea."
"The public perception has increased, and quite rightly so, not only in the United States, but also in Europe."
"Europe, together with Norway, produces more than 200 million tonnes of crude oil a year, most of it from the North Sea."
"Even if the exploration for and conveying of oil and gas does not take place under comparably extreme conditions or at the same depths as in the Gulf of Mexico, we must still plan for the possibility of an accident in the EU and be ready for it."
"We have the competent bodies and mechanisms in order to be able to react quickly to a potential accident."
"There is the European Maritime Safety Agency, we have rescue boats, we have civil protection mechanisms, we have good coordination of assistance measures, and Commissioner Georgieva was thus able to offer European assistance for ongoing measures in the Gulf of Mexico from an early stage."
"Our goal must be prevention, so as not to have to deal with the major clear-up after a disaster at all."
"Together with Commissioner Potočnik, I have therefore asked our offices to review applicable EU legislation."
"The European legislation represents the framework for safety and environmental protection measures, both in general and in the event of a specific accident."
"Our directives ensure minimum safety standards for equipment and they contain detailed minimum standards for the health and safety of workers."
"We will now review all these legal texts to see whether they provide an adequate and optimal toolset for a similar disaster or a worst case scenario."
"This means close cooperation with the national regulatory authorities, as a major part of the safety provisions governing conveying oil and gas and health protection is in the hands of the Member States rather than our hands directly."
"Of course, no set of regulations can offer a 100% guarantee."
"A lot depends on the approach and the behaviour of the operative field in our industry."
"We therefore have every reason to get together: politics and the industry must cooperate in order to ensure that the European environment and the public are as safe as possible."
"I want to put safety and sustainability in the transport of oil and gas at the heart of our stakeholder conversations."
"That is why, in the last week, I hosted a gathering of high-ranking officials from the major energy firms active in European waters."
"Commissioner Georgieva was also there."
"In this technically-oriented meeting, we asked the industry to ensure that all possible efforts were made to prevent comparable accidents in the vicinity of European coasts."
"We presented a catalogue of questions that were answered by the companies over the following days."
"There were 12 questions, and they very specifically included everything that is crucial to safety on oil platforms and gas platforms and for the waters, the coasts and the Member States."
"I see this meeting with the industry as the beginning of a process that will strengthen the transparency of the industry's operations and promote compliance with the regulations and the application of best practice."
"We are planning a second meeting in the upcoming months, when we have a better understanding of the causes of the accident, in order to evaluate the situation and to learn the lessons for Europe from the accident in the Gulf of Mexico."
"At this point in time, when the causes and circumstances have not yet been analysed, it would be premature to draw conclusions or to call for new legislative initiatives."
"If it should transpire, however, that a regulatory response is needed, I can assure you that the Commission will waste no time in submitting proposals for European legislation to you."
"You see, ladies and gentlemen, there are constant efforts in Europe to prevent a similar tragedy over here."
"Should a similar accident nonetheless occur, we have a number of measures and mechanisms to react effectively and without delay, and to minimise the magnitude of any such accident for citizens and the environment in Europe."
"I will be more than happy to report back to you after our next meeting on what we are planning."
"The explosion of the platform in the Gulf of Mexico is the greatest ecological disaster of its kind in history."
"Every day, 800 000 litres of crude oil are flowing into the Gulf, which means over 22 million litres since the disaster began."
"The oil slick now covers over 43 000 square kilometres, which is bigger than the Netherlands."
"At the moment, it is our duty to declare solidarity with the United States and all the victims of the tragedy, and to ensure that we give as much help as possible."
"In the light of this disaster, I think it essential that we immediately carry out a special assessment - a detailed and far-reaching technical inspection of drilling platforms operating in the territorial waters of the European Union."
"This should be the first step at supranational level towards ensuring the safety of Europe's seas."
"In addition, I would like to draw particular attention to the fact that if a similar disaster were to happen in the Baltic Sea, which is a closed sea, it would cause permanent and irreversible devastation in the entire region and its coastal areas."
"It is essential that all developments carried out in the territorial waters of the European Union should be subject to special monitoring, and that they should comply with the highest safety standards and be equipped with the most modern safety systems."
"In this respect, I think it is also essential to develop a common cross-border procedure for reaction and cooperation, which would be put into action immediately if a leakage of crude oil occurred."
"Observers in the United States point out that in many cases, permission to install platforms in the Gulf of Mexico has been given under pressure and in the interests of the oil industry, at the cost of the natural environment."
"It is hard, here, not to mention the decision to build Nord Stream, the Northern Gas Pipeline, which was a political decision which did not take account of the dangers this investment may present to the Baltic Sea ecosystem."
"Mr Oettinger, in the face of the drama in the Gulf of Mexico, drilling installations for extracting crude oil or gas should never be allowed to appear without a 100% guarantee of safety for the seas and oceans concerned."
"Decisions made under pressure from an industrial or political lobby should not be allowed."
"Commissioner, often it is not enough to simply increase prevention measures."
"The recent explosion in the Gulf of Mexico involved a platform which was only built in 2001 and its subsequent sinking is causing one of the biggest ecological disasters to date."
"Thus far, and it is 29 days since the accident, it has not been possible to stop the leak and, as Mr Sonik said, over 5 000 tonnes of oil a day are flowing into the sea in the Gulf."
"This massive pollution has happened at a time when a great many species, many of which are disappearing, are in full spawning season."
"I refer to five of the seven species of sea turtle, dolphins, numerous whales and numerous important sea mammals."
"Inevitably, man is also affected."
"This explosion, this accident occurred just when the area was starting to recover from the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina; it also claimed 11 lives."
"However, measures are being taken in the United States."
"In 1981, Congress voted for a moratorium banning offshore oil drilling in 85% of the coastal waters around the United States."
"The Obama government confirmed the moratorium after the accident, despite its initial statements to the contrary."
"At the same time, however, oil platforms are still being commissioned, mainly in the North Sea."
"There are, at present, hundreds of offshore platforms, drilling for both oil and natural gas."
"The recent accident in the Gulf of Mexico really did confirm the danger of annihilation of the marine environment from offshore oil platforms."
"Nonetheless, under European legislation, drilling for oil under the sea is exempted from the scope of the Seveso Directive on major accident hazards involving dangerous substances."
"This recent disaster shows us that no one is in a position to guarantee that a similar disaster will not happen in the European Union and, sometimes, merely increasing prevention measures does not suffice."
"The Obama government was forced to retreat by the scale of the disaster."
"Perhaps the time has come, in addition to extra prevention measures, for the European Union to introduce a moratorium banning offshore drilling in EU waters with immediate effect, to match the US moratorium?"
"We need to act at once, before an accident waiting to happen like that in the Gulf of Mexico comes knocking at our door."
"Madam President, the collapse of the platform off the coast of Louisiana on 22 April has caused an oil slick on an incredible scale."
"The latter raises three major issues."
"The fact that no systems were put in place in advance to stop a leak of this nature and on this scale is hard to understand, as is the absence of sufficient controls, on the part of the public authorities, over security systems required and implemented by the platform operators to avoid the risks of pollution and, ultimately, the specific risk relating to pollution by hydrocarbons of particularly sensitive and/or particularly inhabited areas."
"A moment ago, our fellow Member, Mr Sonik, reminded us of how disastrous such pollution would be in the Baltic Sea, for example."
"The North Sea has already seen at least two serious accidents on offshore platforms and is one of the regions of the world with the greatest concentration of platforms."
"Under these conditions, it is absolutely essential that we take stock of the situation to make sure that a similar accident is not possible off our coasts, and we are delighted, Commissioner, that an initiative of this nature has been taken."
"Having said that, what measures do you intend to take in the short term to improve safety and accident prevention on offshore platforms located in our territorial waters?"
"You spoke of minimum standards, Commissioner, but that is not enough."
"Secondly, what control measures are in place to ensure that safety requirements are fully met?"
"Having safety rules on paper is not enough; they have to be applied and their application actually monitored."
"What do you intend to do to move in this direction?"
"Thirdly, in the event of an accident, what resources are in place to avoid coastal pollution?"
"It is all very well having vessels and civilian forces, but what do we have at our disposal?"
"Is it not time that we demanded that operators have specific technical equipment that could be pooled?"
"Is it not also necessary, given the inclusion henceforth of environmental harm in EU law, to provide for an adequate system of compensation and associated financial guarantees?"
"Finally, oil companies are operating at ever-increasing depths, making intervention very difficult when there is an accident and putting the marine environment at risk."
"What measures are planned for offshore oil exploitation at greater depths and, in particular, in the Far North?"
"Finally, I will return to the question that our fellow Member, Mr Arsenis, asked just now: is it not time that we considered an extended moratorium under the same conditions as those that the United States wants to introduce?"
"We want and we need to move away from this oil-based society."
"Is it not time that we did so?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, I too feel that we need to stop those in industry from playing God."
"Today, more than ever, the industrialised nations are thirsty for oil."
"They are drilling everything they can, and at ever-increasing depths, which clearly increases the risk of accidents."
"In recent times, the industries have favoured exploration and extraction, to the detriment of safety and of the environment; every day for almost a month now, 800 000 litres of crude oil have been flowing into the Gulf of Mexico, and the environmental and economic damage will be catastrophic."
"I see a huge gap between the colossal sums spent on deeper and deeper extraction and the utterly inadequate resources devoted to the upstream prevention and the anticipation of risks."
"Like my fellow Members, I too demand several things."
"Firstly, I think we need to conduct an audit of all the oil platforms to check their state of repair, their level of safety and their compliance with standards."
"Of course, we also need to perform platform inspections, even if these inspections are the responsibility of the Member States, and we need inspections by the Commission of the inspections themselves."
"Furthermore, I think we need to protect the most fragile ecosystems once and for all."
"In this respect, as well as the initiative which you have taken and which I welcome, to try to ascertain how we could cope with such circumstances if a similar accident were to happen off our coasts, I do think that Europe must take initiatives to protect the most fragile ecosystems once and for all."
"I am thinking about Alaska, for example."
"We need an international convention on the same model as that which exists for the protection of resources in Antarctica, and Europe could spearhead this type of work and this type of convention."
"Finally, if we still needed one, this is a very good reason to invest more and sooner in renewable energies."
"The volcano - I will not say its name, because it is unpronounceable - was a sign for us on the issue of air transport; in the same way, this terrible accident is another sign for us on the issue of oil extraction."
"It is time for us to acknowledge that the folly of racing to extract oil anywhere and at any cost is behind us."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner."
"The world has watched in amazement, both at the immense flow of gas and oil from the ruptured pipe following the explosion and disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and at the seeming inability of both the industry and the US authorities to stem the flow; we must hope that recent developments will prove successful."
"We have had, as colleagues have mentioned, our own experience of platform disasters in the North Sea."
"I think of Piper Alpha as one example, and I believe that lessons have been learned from that."
"But let us remember that there is a significant difference between the depth of sea in which they are operating in the Gulf of Mexico and the depth of the North Sea."
"Let me urge that we are cautious and do not rush into new legislation."
"Let us be certain as to what happened."
"Let us be certain whether our existing rules would have prevented it happening here, and let us be certain that any new rules would prevent it happening."
"Accidents and acts of God do happen, and we cannot guarantee to prevent them."
"There has to be a limit to what we can do in order to prevent them."
"I would like to give you a final thought, when we are considering relative risk: that accidents like this put the relative safety of nuclear energy into a different perspective."
"Madam President, the oil rig leak in the Bay of Mexico is a real disaster, both environmentally and economically."
"Apparently, there were some irregularities in the granting of drilling permits by the United States Interior Secretary."
"This would constitute unforgivable irresponsibility, the consequences of which are incalculable and do not only affect the United States."
"We know that hundreds of offshore drilling authorisations are granted by countries throughout the world, and if these authorisations were granted just as irresponsibly, it would pose serious problems to the entire world."
"As MEP for a European outermost region and for the overseas countries and territories (PTOM), made up almost entirely of islands, nearly 130 in total, scattered over three continents, I must express my great concern for our islands in the face of offshore oil exploitation projects."
"That is why it is essential for the European Union, which must set an example, to review with the utmost rigour the security and prevention measures on its own offshore oil platforms."
"Furthermore, accidental or operational oil spillages into the sea, not necessarily caused by Europe, are estimated at several tens of thousands of tonnes each year."
"Is it not time the European Union took initiatives so that, henceforth, offshore platforms fall under an undisputed scientific authority, which should be established in the form of an international authority?"
"After Copenhagen and in preparation for Cancún, the European Union should pride itself on promoting real global governance where the search for, protection and exploitation of deep-sea resources are concerned."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, as a neighbour of the 'Swabian Sea', I would like to call on you to take the accident, the disaster, in the Gulf of Mexico as seriously as if it had happened in our own Lake Constance."
"You would then no longer have any drinking water and in my home town, there would be no more festival, with all the dramatic consequences that would involve, and much else besides."
"What does that mean?"
"Are you sure that the oil rigs far away from us - in other words, in the North Sea and the Baltic - will really stand up to the different storm conditions that we will have to face as a result of climate change?"
"Are you sure that your European Maritime Safety Agency really is equipped to deal with something like this?"
"You spoke about good coordination."
"We have already often experienced failures in radio contact between the different countries."
"Has that been checked, before an emergency incident occurs?"
"When something actually does happen, what is the legal situation in relation to lawsuits against the oil companies?"
"Would a risk fund perhaps be useful in this connection?"
"Finally, is it clear to you that the monitoring authorities in the US were much too closely interdependent with the oil industry?"
"Can you rule out us having the same problems at European level?"
"The stipulation should not be 'You can do everything, except ...'."
"(RO) I, too, welcome the Commission's initiative."
"I think that it is important for us to discuss this topic, even though the accident did not occur in an area under the jurisdiction of a European Union Member State."
"There are currently a huge number of platforms in Member States' territorial waters extracting oil."
"This activity is expected to increase at a time when the International Energy Agency estimates that only 5% of sea oil reserves are currently known."
"It is important for us to see what lessons we need to learn from the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and what the current situation is in waters where similar production activities are being carried out in EU Member States."
"If necessary, we must also take additional measures to improve the safety of workers on these platforms, as well as further measures to prevent accidents with disastrous consequences for Europe's vulnerable regions."
"Another lesson which we must learn from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, and from the past as well, is that we need to look very closely at how operating licences are granted and what current contracting practices are followed."
"We must ensure that companies cannot shirk from assuming responsibility."
"A company entering into a deal with a certain degree of risk which must be tackled with specific safety measures and can generate huge revenue must also be prepared to suffer the consequences if an accident occurs."
"If you have followed the course of the inquiry into this disaster in the United States, the chain of contractual relations established between several firms allows companies to pass the buck to each other, while oil continues to pour into the sea."
"We cannot put up with a similar situation here."
"This is why we must look at the legislation in this area and make any improvements to the legislative framework so that we can ensure we reduce the risks of such an incident occurring."
"Past experience shows that huge human and environmental losses remain in the wake of accidents, with the procedures for establishing liability capable of lasting for years on end."
"The Commission must ensure that the legislation for exploiting oil resources in safe conditions does not contain provisions which are too lax and assess to what extent this legislation needs to be amended in order to reduce the use of means of shirking responsibility."
"(PL) The example provided by the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico forces us to think carefully about investment projects under way in the European Union."
"I am talking about the Northern Gas Pipeline, which is being built in defiance of recommendations made by the European Parliament."
"The source of the gas will be the Russian Stockman field in the Barents Sea."
"The project plans the extraction of 24 billion m3 of gas annually in the first phase, but this will then rise to 68 billion. To obtain this amount of gas, many boreholes have to be made in a very short space of time."
"It will not be possible to stop the stream of 148 000 tonnes of methane, because there are no valves or transit stations."
"Damage to the pipeline will by no means mean its closure."
"Gas will continue to flow out until the fault has been repaired, because if water got inside, it would cripple the pipeline completely."
"Therefore, I call upon the Commission to carry out a thorough analysis of the dangers presented by development projects of this kind."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this debate is a timely one."
"We have not yet solved the problems in the Gulf of Mexico, nor do we know where the next problems will occur."
"That is the reason for my first question, Commissioner, which is as follows: where, at this present time, can Europe help with specialist expertise, the Joint Research Centre or with the various other bodies that we have so that we can attempt, together, to obtain a solution for the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico as quickly and as effectively as possible?"
"In reducing CO2 emissions by 20% and making up the difference through renewable energy sources, the European Union has chosen the right route, and we can achieve a very great deal through greater efficiency."
"Do you believe that we could, for example, launch new initiatives together with Norway within the European Economic Area?"
"(NL) Like other speakers, I am terribly shocked that it has been possible for hundreds of thousands of litres of crude oil to gush into the sea for weeks on end without us managing to stop it."
"I am also terribly shocked by the enormous damage this is causing and by the fact that the company in question, BP, is constantly playing this down."
"We are being forced to face the facts, and we have not even been able to assess all the longer-term consequences."
"It is essential, therefore, that we take the measures at European rather than national level that are needed to render such occurrences impossible in future."
"In so doing, we must concentrate on the procedural and also the technical aspects, by imposing the necessary safety systems."
"This has a cost, of course, but the cost of doing nothing would obviously be much higher."
"In the past, we took the global lead by imposing double hulls for oil tankers."
"I think that here, too, we should take the lead and set a good example."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, as a Member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and as shadow rapporteur for biodiversity, this disaster obviously has a personal impact for me."
"There is a lot of destruction of life that should be conserved."
"Someone has said it already today, but the truth is that, despite every precaution, accidents do happen, as there are limits to prevention."
"However, accidents are not confined to oil platforms - nuclear power stations, too, are not immune to incidents and accidents."
"In Austria, we have a saying, and it goes as follows: 'Does something always have to happen before something happens?'"
"In other words, does there always have to be an accident before we learn anything?"
"This oil disaster should make us all consider whether leaving behind nuclear power would not be a way forward for Europe."
"We should also concentrate all our mental energies and our financial resources on investing in renewable energy."
"(GA) Madam President, it is good that we are discussing this important issue but, at the end of the day, I do not know what will come of our talks or what effect we will have on large companies - the oil companies who own the oil wells which caused this damage and this disaster."
"At the same time, the Commission is to be applauded for their recommendations that measures be implemented here to ensure that the same will not happen in our own area."
"However, if there is one lesson to be learned from this disaster, it is that we desperately need to make other sources available to provide energy in our own area, particularly natural energy such as wind and solar power."
"The sooner we do this, the better it will be for everyone."
"If we do not succeed in doing this, the oil companies will be going further out in the ocean searching for oil and damage and disasters like this will happen not just once, but over and over again."
"We should not allow this to happen."
"(RO) We support the investments made in Europe's energy infrastructure, but only when they guarantee total safety for construction and production activities."
"I also take this opportunity to call for any project involving the underwater extraction or transport of hydrocarbons to be implemented only after a proper assessment of the environmental impact has been carried out."
"I have called on more than one occasion for European maritime accident intervention centres to be set up in every Member State with access to the sea."
"This type of accident also comes under this category."
"Last but not least, all companies involved in the underwater extraction and transport of hydrocarbons should offer guarantees and have insurance policies for paying out damages in the event of accidents."
"(LT) I believe that the whole world is watching with concern the events that continue to unfold today on the coast of the Bay of Mexico."
"Nobody could have envisaged and forecast that such a huge country, the world's leading nation, the United States would be unable to deal with what at first glance seems manageable."
"I think that we, Europe too, are contributing considerable funds and human resources towards solving the problems of climate change."
"However, nature has its own demands."
"I feel it is very good that we will have opportunities to learn from others' mistakes, but again, I would also like to remind you of the problem with the Northern gas pipeline and I believe that we, Europe, will be politically responsible for the exploitation of this gas pipeline and therefore, I would also urge the Commissioner to ensure that we once again review the conditions of the exploitation of this gas project, and I also welcome the opportunity and will to strengthen Europe's own rescue capacities."
"Madam President, honourable Members, like you, I am shocked, not only in my role as a Commissioner, but also as a citizen, when I see how nature is disrupted and destroyed in such cases for many years."
"Although we are shocked, we must still remain calm and level-headed, as frenetic activity and hysteria would be out of place here."
"The exact cause of the accident in the Gulf of Mexico is still unknown."
"Was it the technology that failed?"
"Was it human error?"
"I have confidence in the US Government and public to seek an explanation with the same thoroughness as exists in our interest in explaining the causes here in Europe."
"I also believe that the population of the United States of America expects, with the same shock and thoroughness, that lessons will be learned."
"In that regard, I have confidence in the United States as an industrialised nation, in its technical skills and in its democracy."
"As a second point, we must move away from oil."
"It is clear, however, that we have been going down the oil route for generations and this applies to the industrialised nations of Europe in particular."
"Our citizens have far in excess of 200 million cars - and you and I all drive them."
"I drive a lot, and I also fly a lot for business purposes."
"At the weekend, hundreds of thousands of people will be flying south once again, and spending their Whit break in Mallorca."
"When it comes to Greece and Spain, people say that only tourism can solve the economic crisis, and that means more flights to Athens, to Palma, to Marbella and to other destinations."
"We consume oil - all of us, you and I. It seems to me that even this august Chamber, this honourable House, is not exactly constructed in an energy friendly way."
"There are more neon lamps than MEPs here tonight."
"It is because of all that that I believe that we simply have to be aware that we still need many years of major oil consumption but that we must nevertheless be fully ambitious as we walk the path away from oil: 20% renewable energy sources in 10 years' time."
"We are a preparing a 'Roadmap 2050' and we will present the various alternatives to you in the course of the year."
"Expert opinions say that, in four decades, we can obtain 80% of our energy needs from sources other than fossil fuels and thus other than oil."
"Electromobility represents an option here, but the majority of vehicles will still not be electrically powered for many years and will instead be powered by oil in the form of diesel and petrol."
"It is clear that drilling for oil in the North Sea or the Gulf of Mexico represents an attempt to reduce dependence on a number of countries."
"Without this, without our own deposits, our dependence on the OPEC States and on countries that are not always characterised by democracy would be even greater than it is."
"There is one crucial difference though: in the North Sea, drilling takes place to around 150 to 200 metres, whereas in the Gulf of Mexico, the depth is 3 000 to as far as 4 000 metres, with far inferior opportunities to guarantee safety."
"Depths of 150 and 200 metres can be reached with manned submarines."
"In the Gulf of Mexico, human beings are, in principle, far away from the source of danger, far away from the technical safety provided."
"I also have confidence in our Member States."
"We have every reason to have confidence in our national authorities and our technical teams in the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway and Denmark."
"Also, in the partnership which currently exists between the European Union and our authority (the European Maritime Safety Agency - EMSA) and the national safety teams, we have an excellent, high level of cooperative safety between the European Union and those of our Member States that are bordering countries."
"In the case of Nord Stream, too, we naturally had to examine the issue of safety."
"This involved complicated safety and approval processes that were all carried out, and I want to make clear that Nord Stream will probably be the most modern and the safest gas pipeline in the world."
"Here, too, there is one crucial difference: if there were ever a problem in the gas pipeline, the gas could be stopped at the source or at the coast."
"Nord Stream is not comparable with what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico."
"Ultimately, we will have to take the path that leads away from oil, but we will need decades to go down that path."
"All of us in politics and in society must take that path."
"On the way there, and in the meantime, we must check whether our safety standards and laws and guidelines and safety teams represent the highest level."
"We have put the relevant questions."
"In the autumn, when we know the causes, when we have the answers, when we have grilled our energy companies, we will be happy to give you more information."
"I believe that the energy companies are well aware of the seriousness of the situation."
"I have one final point to make."
"There are already bases for liability for punitive damages."
"Incidentally, none of the parties involved in the United States disputes that."
"When it is clear who bears the guilt, the party in question will be liable and we can already see that this will amount to billions."
"In European environmental law, as well as in our national environmental regulations, the question of liability, of causing damage and of punitive damages is clear."
"This, too, will reinforce a precautionary approach when it comes to safety."
"I assume that, in a few weeks, we will know whether we in Europe have any legal or technical need to act, and we will then be happy to report back to Parliament again."
"Your words also show how important it is to you, across all the parties, to act in a foresighted and precautionary way on this subject rather than to react afterwards once a disaster has already occurred."
"That is how we work in the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"After the disaster involving the deep-sea oil rig on US shores, it is advisable for us, too, to draw a few lessons."
"First and foremost, we must assert that although deep-sea drilling showcases state-of-the-art industrial technologies, it is still not without risk."
"We must also state unambiguously that the increase in private investment in the oil sector must not mean that political decision makers surrender the right to strict environmental regulation."
"The oil disaster in the United States is a good opportunity for the EU to review its own safety regulations."
"These are still too general in nature."
"We only need to think about the directive on environmental impact assessments or the framework for occupational safety."
"The review is further justified because the rules that are somewhat more specific focus more on the steps to take after a disaster has occurred."
"Considerations to do with prevention therefore take a back seat."
"Learning from the US example, we need to delineate clearly the areas of responsibility for the oil well owners and operators and those of the supervisory authorities."
"Industrial regulations and voluntary undertakings by companies do not offer a reassuring solution."
"It is absolutely clear that legally defined safety guarantees are needed."
"Volcanic ash crisis (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Brian Simpson, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the volcanic ash crisis (B7-0217/10)."
"author. - Madam President, Mr Simpson apologises for not being present during the discussion on the ash cloud crisis."
"Ironically, in view of this evening's discussion, he has been caught up in the flight restrictions related to the ash cloud restrictions in the UK and therefore has been unable to travel to Strasbourg for the discussion."
"I will therefore be speaking on his behalf this evening."
"The oral question on the volcanic ash crisis is just as relevant today, in the context of the ongoing disruption to airspace, as it was at the time of the initial eruption of the Icelandic volcano last month, when we saw much of EU airspace closed for six days."
"We are now dealing not only with the aftermath of that disruption and its financial impact but also with the present ongoing uncertainty of continued and prolonged disruption to European airspace."
"While I believe that some important lessons have been learned and acted on following the unprecedented scale, duration and cause of the initial airspace shutdown, it is clear that the response at European level needs to be stepped up a gear in the face of ongoing disruptions."
"Faced with the challenges that the unprecedented nature and unspecified duration and the disruption is causing to air travel, I am concerned today to get assurances that the mechanisms we have in place for coping with the disruption are working effectively and that, where gaps have been identified over the last few weeks, these are being adequately addressed."
"I am pleased to say that the Air Passengers' Rights Regulation has proved vitally important in providing a safety net to ensure that it is not the passengers who bear the brunt of the financial consequences of the disruption and who are not left stranded by the chaos."
"The airspace closure has, however, raised important questions about airlines fulfilling their obligations when it comes to air passengers' rights, especially in the light of any compensation afforded to the aviation industry."
"What feedback is the Commission getting on the treatment of passengers, and what assurances can it give that airlines are fulfilling their obligations in line with the legislation?"
"Furthermore, the current situation has exposed the vulnerability of those passengers booked on third-country airlines for whom the air passengers' rights legislation does not apply."
"How does the Commission propose to address this gap in the legislation?"
"We also - very early on in this crisis - recognised the heavy financial losses suffered by the aviation industry during the airspace shutdown."
"My concern with any compensation package made available to the aviation industry is to ensure that compensation is directed at the different sectors of the aviation industry - not just the airlines - and that the compensation measures are of an EU-wide nature."
"I know that some Member States will be more sympathetic than others when it comes to giving financial aid to their airlines."
"What assurances is the Commission able to give that some conditions will be levelled to avoid any distortions in the compensation handed out at Member State level and to ensure a level playing field?"
"I now turn to the most pressing concern today, which is over the procedures in place for defining no-flight zones in the EU."
"The continued disruption to European airspace has once again put the procedures applied for defining no-flight zones under the spotlight."
"There are concerns that Member States are being over cautious in their implementation of no-flight zones and that aeroplanes are safe to fly amid higher densities of ash than are currently allowed by EU rules."
"The ongoing closure and opening of airspace by Member States over the last few weeks has very much highlighted the need for a more joined-up approach at EU level, rather than the differentiated approach we are currently seeing."
"I am also aware that the Commission has put renewed emphasis on improving data collection and modelling methodologies to give a more detailed picture of the risks involved for aeroplanes flying through an ash cloud."
"How does the new information we have impact on the restrictions currently in place and the definition of the no-flight zones?"
"Finally, we have seen the value of increased European coordination when it comes to responding to the ash cloud crisis."
"Further areas where we have recognised the importance of greater cooperation include the acceleration of the Single European Sky initiative and the creation of a mobility action plan to help the EU cope better during such crises."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to provide an update on the evolution of the Icelandic volcano crisis which, of course, is linked to aviation."
"The European Union has been heavily affected by the consequences of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano eruption in Iceland."
"The volcano eruption laid a cloud of volcanic ash over most of Europe."
"Volcanic ash contains many problematic substances that are harmful to aircraft and, in particular, their engines."
"The presence of this safety threat in the sky forced national authorities to take decisions, in accordance with the relevant procedures developed at international level, to close off all affected airspace."
"The European Union immediately mobilised resources to tackle the most pressing problems."
"Taking into account evolutions in the situation and the need for a more differentiated approach to the model and risk management procedures, the Commission took the initiative, over the weekend of 17 and 18 April, with the Spanish Presidency and Eurocontrol, to propose a coordinated European approach."
"As a result of this work, in full cooperation with Member States and the industry, new procedures were defined."
"At the extraordinary meeting of EU Transport Ministers that took place on 19 April 2010, this new procedure was endorsed, thereby allowing for a gradual reopening of airspace in a coordinated manner as of 08.00 on 20 April 2010."
"As a follow-up to this immediate action, the Commission produced a report addressing the impact of the volcanic ash cloud crisis on the air transport industry."
"It received broad support from the Council of Transport Ministers at its extraordinary meeting of 4 May 2010."
"Whereas the focus of the report was to address the current volcano crisis, it has nevertheless sought equally to address the European Union's need to be able to deal effectively with similar crisis situations in the future, should they arise."
"The events of the past 10 days have shown that the situation is far from being resolved at this stage."
"The volcano continues to be active, and recurrent closures of airspace continue to take place, depending on the weather conditions affecting the dispersion of the ash cloud."
"The Commission is therefore committed to ensuring a prompt follow-up to the Transport Council conclusions as adopted on 4 May 2010."
"I am happy to report the first steps taken as a consequence."
"The European Crisis Coordination Cell has been agreed with effect from 11 May 2010."
"The final arrangements for setting it up are being made this week."
"The nomination of a functional airspace blocks coordinator was endorsed by the Single Sky Committee on 7 May 2010."
"The designation of Eurocontrol's performance review committee as an SES performance review body was also carried out by the Single Sky Committee on 7 May 2010."
"The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has been given the task of defining binding standards for engine ash tolerance levels."
"The Commission will shortly be calling for the creation of a task force to explore how the current European forecasting and dispersion models can be improved so as to enhance associated risk assessment and risk management in such crisis situations."
"There is more to come as the Commission works towards meeting the Council of Transport Ministers' expectations, as expressed in their conclusions of 4 May 2010."
"The volcanic eruption in April highlighted to us that traffic in European airspace is not prepared with an appropriate response in the event of unexpected disruption."
"There has been no coordination, flexibility or effort to make the maximum possible use of flight conditions."
"The SES II package was adopted in November 2009 in record time, as is also mentioned in the Commission's briefing note."
"The package was adopted in spite of Member States' resistance."
"In fact, the translation and publication took longer than the actual negotiations."
"The crisis has come and we have seen the benefit of implementing the SES II package."
"In my view, if Member States dropped their current reservations, we could have a Single European Sky in next to no time."
"To do this, we require a network of direct routes and an efficient traffic control system which disregards national borders from now on."
"Unfortunately, there is no intention of this happening."
"The only solution therefore is for us to implement the SES II package extremely quickly."
"The Commission has tabled urgent measures which have actually already been requested in the approved regulations."
"They are excellent measures."
"However, the main action required is to create functional airspace blocks by no later than the specified deadline or by the end of 2012."
"This also requires the regulatory guide, which, unfortunately, is not mentioned in the Council's conclusions of 4 May."
"The guide's absence can be used by Member States as a pretext for delay."
"In addition, the guide must be the instrument used to ensure that, by the requested deadline, we not only have coordinated traffic zones, but a proper Single European Sky too."
"The guide must provide for traffic control within the blocks, coordinated with adjacent blocks so that there are no overlapping areas."
"Otherwise, we will replace the current national boundaries with the blocks' boundaries, thereby extending without any justification the deadline for implementing the Single European Sky."
"I do not believe that we need to consider in future that an SES III regulation will be required to combine the blocks."
"This approach also allows the SESAR system to be implemented in ideal conditions at minimal cost."
"In 2011. the last Member States will join the Schengen area."
"I believe that it is unacceptable for us to maintain borders in the sky when we do not have them on the ground."
"I want to start by thanking you for your answer."
"In my opinion, a number of questions have not yet been answered fully, and so I should like rather more explanation of several points."
"Mr Simpson's absence demonstrates that the issue is indeed still current, and that the consequences of such eruptions are unpredictable and can be far-reaching in terms of our citizens' mobility, and also in economic terms if the situation is protracted."
"As I see it, it also demonstrates that we cannot, in fact, rule out the possibility of something similar occurring in a few weeks' time, for example - in the middle of the peak summer season - and the airspace having to be closed."
"Consequently, we must continue to work not only on structural measures to improve the efficiency of our aviation and of our transport system in general - I shall return to this shortly - but also on better crisis management."
"A minute ago, you also talked about setting up a kind of coordination cell."
"More clarity will be provided on that subject this week."
"Nevertheless, could you perhaps already tell us a little more about the kind of task you envisage for this coordination cell?"
"What exactly should its initial tasks be?"
"The occurrences in April have made it abundantly clear that coordination between the parties concerned - such as airports, airlines and travel agencies - falls short, and that there is no mechanism for informing the parties concerned of what they have to do in such cases."
"Also, stranded travellers, for example, do not really know what their rights are."
"Thus, as I see it, we need a European preparedness plan to enable the right decisions to be taken rapidly and the right contacts to be developed."
"In fact, the same goes for the repatriation of travellers; after all, where tens of thousands of people are concerned, a system must be set up somewhere to facilitate this."
"Passengers' rights are a very important element."
"Europe has done a very great deal of work in this field, which is to be welcomed."
"As you know, though, there are gaps in the legislation."
"We are talking about third-country airlines, which do not actually fall under our legislation, and so I would advocate integrating these kinds of rights into our aviation agreements with third countries."
"I also think that we need to monitor the application of this kind of legislation by the Member States."
"We heard just this week that the Italian authorities have fined the airline Ryanair."
"That is good news, but what is happening in the other Member States?"
"Can we obtain an assessment of this?"
"Of course, there are also the numerous structural measures, but I do not wish to dwell too much on those: the Single European Sky that is under construction, and also the railways, for example."
"The railways proved not to be a viable alternative."
"There are many reasons for this: it has to do with different systems and also with circumstances such as our lack of so much as an integrated ticketing system."
"In my opinion, that is also very important, Commissioner."
"Therefore, a very great deal remains to be done, but you have our support in this."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have already held a debate about the ash cloud and the associated problems for aviation in the immediate aftermath of the volcanic eruption."
"We observed various things in this crisis."
"We observed, for one thing, that aviation really is essential for the transport sector, as it is not only passengers that get stranded, but goods, too, can be left untransported."
"In Germany, for example, BMW had some production bottlenecks due to not receiving deliveries."
"We observed that we need every mode of transport, including aviation."
"For another thing, we observed that it is a significant crisis for the airlines if it is not possible to fly for several days."
"A five-day break, the airlines said, could be coped with."
"A 20-day break, however, could perhaps have caused a collapse of the entire industry lasting quite some time."
"We need not talk about compensation just yet, the airlines themselves said, but if it had lasted longer, that would have been necessary."
"Passenger rights have been subject to varying comments from different speakers."
"They have now put to the test the rule that, in such extraordinary cases, too, everything can be done for passengers in relation to information, compensation and recompense to the extent that they need it and in the way we originally laid it down here."
"There are still two subjects in particular that I would like to go into. The first is the Single European Sky."
"We do not have a single European airspace, and that is something that was painfully absent this time, too."
"A single European airspace clearly would not have prevented the volcanic eruption, we all know that, but we would certainly have been better able to bring about the smooth evacuation of passengers."
"We have appointed a Functional Airspace Blocks (FAB) coordinator, of course."
"He is now starting work, and we all very much hope that his work will relatively soon be able to lead to a single European airspace."
"The question is also how long will it take until we actually achieve this?"
"Perhaps you are not in a position to answer that precisely."
"We have also discussed before whether better European coordination of the railway sector - something that we have long been wanting and, on paper, have long had - could have helped passengers to get home more quickly."
"In this regard, too, we observed quite clearly where our difficulties lie."
"I will now move on to my final question."
"Do we have good crisis management arrangements for cases like this?"
"We have the institute in London, which is actually there to provide information when there are earthquakes."
"It also deals with volcanic eruptions as a secondary responsibility."
"Now it has been producing computer projections based on second-hand data, and it has been criticised for that."
"What can we learn from other parts of the world where volcano eruptions are more common, such as the United States, Indonesia and others?"
"What other measurements do they take?"
"According to my information, they are better prepared for such situations."
"Perhaps we had not planned for this in Europe, but we do then have to learn the resultant lessons."
"We are a hi-tech location, we have a lot of opportunities, and researchers in Germany, for example, have called for a specialised monitoring network for those aerosols, those minuscule items, that volcanic ash contains."
"What else do you think that we can do?"
"How can we improve our technologies in the interests of aviation, the people and goods?"
"Madam President, the closing of European airspace was doubtless a necessary preventive measure in the interests of safety."
"Subsequently, and before the airspace had to be closed again, a more suitable technique to handle the problem should have been found."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that this clearly did not succeed at all, either in coordinating the measurements, in the analyses or in respect of passengers."
"The second time, too, the treatment of passengers who were held up due to flights that were downgraded was extremely inadequate, and it must be a priority to improve this."
"I find myself wondering when there really will be plans in place."
"Commissioner, you have, furthermore, not provided a very detailed answer to the question relating to funding and potential compensation for the airlines."
"That is a key issue, as this subject continues to be constantly under discussion."
"Quite how, then, is this to be solved?"
"Who, exactly, is to be compensated?"
"The airlines?"
"Do they then pass the money on to the passengers?"
"For example, will business people who missed important appointments receive compensation?"
"Will a dealer, a company, that had to wait for replacement parts receive compensation?"
"Why should it only be the airlines that receive compensation?"
"I do not regard that as justified if you compare it with the economic consequences of this crisis."
"Moreover, we really need to take account of the fact that, ultimately, the airlines have been receiving a long-term subsidy from European citizens through the abolition of the kerosene tax, meaning, of course, a priori that they already have a subsidy."
"Commissioner, this question is pending and I await an answer from you."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I should perhaps like to start by thanking Commissioner Kallas for his endurance during those five days."
"We might perhaps consider that the first two or three days could have seen a little more action, but on the whole, I believe that the Commissioners carried out their work extremely properly, and that the decisions of the Council were such as to give great encouragement within the context of the Single European Sky to the measures taken on the adoption of functional airspace bloc coordinators and the implementation of the measures by the European Aviation Safety Agency, and many others of these measures were taken quickly."
"At the same time, I think it very important that by understanding this pressure between business interests and the political interest, and by standing up for passengers' rights, the rule under current legislation that decisions about the opening or closing of particular airspace are taken by Member States was preserved."
"Since, if we were to imagine that, God forbid, an accident were to happen, then the Commission or the relevant European institutions might perhaps have exceeded their powers, and there would then arise a very big question, not about how large the losses to business were, but about who was responsible for the wrongly taken decision that helped bring about the accident in one particular airspace within the EU Member States, then the situation would be very different."
"As a consequence, I believe we should draw some conclusions from this relatively critical situation."
"In the short term, several measures have been taken, as I said, but, of course, as far as passengers' rights are concerned, as Mr El Khadraoui has already mentioned, several low-cost airlines in fact ignored passengers' rights (and these are not third-country airlines, these are airlines from EU Member States) and, in principle, abandoned their passengers for five days and nights; in reality, they will be the winners - they will save money - and this remains an unresolved issue directly in the sphere of implementation in relation to passengers' rights as they currently stand in the European Union."
"Another challenge in the long term is the lack of connection in several European states via other means of transport with the central part of Europe. Thank you."
"Madam President, first of all, I feel it is essential to point out that in this case, as in others, the precautionary principle must prevail, because human lives are at stake."
"However, if it is to prevail, its application must not result in extreme decisions that would lead citizens to view precaution as ineptitude."
"Therefore, in this case, why did we only take into account the use of an old virtual mathematical and meteorological model and ignore the pilot unions, which recommended test flights and the use of weather balloons?"
"Perhaps we might then have avoided total paralysis of the airports and the shambles that followed."
"While the VIPs have always been treated well, a large number of European citizens were abandoned by the whole world, including by their own governments."
"Finally, I repeat my request for a parliamentary committee of inquiry to bring to light the fraud that some people have been engaged in during this crisis."
"I will not repeat the thoughts already expressed by many speakers on the consequences of the Icelandic volcano, the closure of air space and the losses incurred by airlines and consumers, i.e. passengers, who were imprisoned in the airports."
"I am pleased to hear today that there will soon be decisions on the creation of the Single European Sky and that, according to the Commissioner, an airspace coordinator already began work in May."
"Today, however, as we are not sure whether we will be able to coordinate such unstable situations or even slightly similar situations in the future, I feel that we should think about how to develop and devote greater attention to other, alternative means of transport and ways of carrying passengers, as the German MEP mentioned, railways, for example."
"In our region, the Baltic Sea region, represented by Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia (which are on the edge of North-Eastern Europe), this situation with the eruption of the volcano has especially highlighted our need for good rail services and here I have in mind the Rail Baltica project."
"I understand that other European regions possibly have the same problem as well and the situation is not any better (is it?), but today I am talking about my region and therefore in this case, we would like to have the opportunity to reach Western and Central Europe through Poland, once Poland has joined our rail track."
"Otherwise, we will be isolated from the EU's transport system."
"Other countries have railways and possibly motorail trains, but our three Baltic States do not have this yet."
"Therefore, I would like to ask the Commissioner whether, in the immediate future, sufficient attention will be devoted or is being devoted to the suitable implementation of alternative transport projects?"
"With the help of the European Union, will we manage to gather the required political will and ensure alternative means of transporting passengers so that we can avoid such consequences in similar crisis situations."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Kallas for being here and for the work that he has done during this difficult time."
"This is a debate that had to take place, ladies and gentlemen, and unfortunately, I think it will not be the last of its kind. I will spare you any repeats of the statistics of this serious event and the negative impact that it has had on the economy."
"I simply wish to remember those who were affected."
"Firstly, there were the passengers."
"Ten million people were left without flights and with no guidance as to what to do."
"The impact on passengers was so great that the provisions of directives and regulations could not protect them."
"The exclusion of liability in contracts due to catastrophe or force majeure brings to mind the need for a joint fund to tackle the consequences of a global disaster such as that caused by the volcano."
"I now come to the airlines."
"The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that they lost EUR 1 700 million worldwide."
"The Association of European Airlines (AEA) assesses the loss at EUR 850 million at European level."
"This blow was all that they needed to accentuate a spiralling crisis that is threatening many airlines with closure."
"The other victim has been tourism."
"The consequences for tourism have been devastating."
"Firstly, due to the cancellation of contracts that had been made in advance, as is usual in this sector, and secondly, due to insecurity, which has caused a change in normal booking trends."
"This is my diagnosis, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"There can only be one conclusion: the European institutions do not have the tools to effectively tackle a crisis of this magnitude."
"Now I come to the criticism, because criticism is necessary and inevitable; self-criticism, if necessary."
"No one can be exonerated, because everyone involved acted badly, late and inefficiently, sometimes through no fault of their own."
"The Member States cannot be exonerated because, although the decisions were within their competence, they were still unable to act."
"The European institutions cannot be exonerated because they took four long days to react, and because their reaction, which invoked safety as their priority, did not unfortunately produce calm, but paralysis."
"I will now discuss the Commission's response."
"Today, the Commission is reiterating the measures that it had announced to us."
"In my view, they are reasonable measures, but there is a lack of clarity about the timescale for implementing them."
"We are not talking about something in the past."
"Even today, there is a latent threat of flights being grounded, and it is concerning that we are dependent on air currents."
"I know that we cannot fight the elements."
"This was said by a famous Spanish sailor regarding a big naval battle that we lost."
"The crisis will not help us to take measures."
"The Member States will be reluctant to provide resources."
"If we are mean, however, this volcano could do more damage to the European economy than is being forecast."
"I ask the Commission to be determined, and I ask the Council to urgently tackle the need to take decisions."
"I ask everyone to be generous in implementing alternatives to make up for the incapacities of the institutions."
"I do not hold the Commission or the Council responsible, but we need to acknowledge the diagnosis that the institutions have not been capable, as they currently stand, of solving a crisis of this magnitude and proportions."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Kallas for his work over the last few days and say that the crisis involving ash from the Icelandic volcano causing European mobility to be blocked, which even yesterday caused further closures of European airspace in Ireland and the United Kingdom, along with the two extraordinary Council meetings called by the Spanish Presidency at the Commission's suggestion, have taught us several things."
"Firstly, they have taught us that this crisis has affected the whole sector, not only airlines but also airports, and we congratulate the Commission on its comprehensive vision when considering the consequences and assistance."
"This has been done by Mr Kallas, Mr Almunia and even Mr Tajani, who has considered the impact on tourism and on the agencies."
"We therefore welcome this approach by the Commission."
"Secondly, while we already knew that the Single European Sky was necessary, we now know that it is urgent."
"This is why we need to definitively appoint the coordinator - a former colleague of ours who is highly qualified - and, of course, remove the obstacles that still remain in the Council."
"We also urgently need to launch the Single European Sky ATM Research system, which underlies the Single European Sky, along with guaranteed funding."
"Could the Commission tell us what reluctance or reservations it observed in the Council meeting on 4 May?"
"We need to know."
"We even also have the impression that there are Member States that are opening up airspace more than others, and that is not good in a very competitive sector such as air transport."
"In addition, although Parliament has been prioritising passengers' rights, and that has been reiterated, with strong reticence on the part of the Council, now the need has clearly been seen to review the application of these laws."
"We need the Commission to be implacable with the low-cost airlines that have spread confusion by lying to passengers and to the public."
"The necessary penalty proceedings must naturally follow."
"I also invite you, Commissioner, to launch a pilot project that my group proposed for the 2010 budget of having consumer offices in the airports to facilitate the necessary measures for passengers and consumers in the midst of the general confusion."
"While some of us were already fighting for rail networks, trans-European networks, as an alternative to modes of transport with a greater impact - and this has been demonstrated in Spain by the AVE high-speed train, for example, between Barcelona and Madrid - now we know that we urgently need to build an alternative secondary mobility system, as is prudently done with electrical and telecommunications networks."
"This is why the review of the trans-European networks with a view to the financial perspectives must be more ambitious."
"Madam President, my particular perspective in this debate is on the impact on the more peripheral airports and on airlines which are already in economic difficulties."
"I live on an island which is behind an island which is off the coast of Europe."
"As such, our peripheral airports and our airlines are particularly important for connectivity and mobility."
"There are a number of regional airports on the west coast of Ireland."
"We have Donegal, Sligo, Ireland West Airport Knock, Shannon and Kerry."
"Given our proximity to Iceland and our island status, we have particularly severe problems to deal with because of the ash."
"With reference to peripheral airports, I believe the Commission should fully promote international PSO routes in terms of connectivity of peripheral airports to hubs and that Member States should be given real flexibility when it comes to State aid to peripheral airports."
"Furthermore, there are many airlines already in financial trouble and they may go out of business because of this crisis."
"Let us not fool ourselves."
"It is not going to go away any time soon."
"This will lead to job losses in the airline sector and consequently, less competition in the market."
"We have to look very seriously at how the EU can play a constructive role, both from the perspective of an equitable distribution of financial assistance and the crisis management tools that are at our disposal."
"Finally, it is important to realise that current legislation was put in place to stop airlines cancelling flights because it suited them, but we are now in a position where airspace is closed and airlines cannot fly."
"The financial burdens are very significant on all actors - passengers, airlines and airports."
"The question is, who is responsible, and who bears the financial burdens?"
"(FR) Madam President, since this new volcanic eruption is confronting us with the same problems that we have already experienced, I would like to go beyond the crisis management and coordination system, in which progress has been made, and emphasise, as others have done, interoperability and the rail reservation system."
"Land transport and, in particular, the railways, must be able to take the place of air transport more easily when it is put out of service."
"It is not just volcanoes that put it out of service; it may actually be grounded on other occasions too."
"However, beyond this aspect, and more structurally still, I would like to ask you about risk cover by the sector itself in this type of crisis - and I stress by the sector itself."
"In fact, I think that State aid, every time that it is granted (or every time there is a problem), will very quickly prove to be untenable at budgetary level and will lead to quite unacceptable discrimination between airlines, between operators in the aviation sector, who would introduce identical demands and, finally, between the ultimate beneficiaries of this potential aid and those who would be excluded from it."
"Given the size of the airlines, I think we must do as we did in the banking sector and move towards prudential rules in their case, rules that would oblige them to provide themselves with a form of compulsory insurance."
"This insurance would enable them to cover this type of risk by pooling the cost of the cover, without always asking the Member States to insure them free of charge, particularly as airlines already benefit today from the historic tax exemption on kerosene and airline tickets."
"Finally, we must also ensure that these airlines duly compensate their passengers, but without passing the bill on to taxpayers."
"Madam President, we are all aware of the horrendous disruption caused, and continuing to be caused, by the volcanic ash cloud."
"More than 100 000 flights have been cancelled and around 12 million passengers have not been able to travel as planned."
"Goods and cargo have been delayed or not transported at all and businesses, both large and small, have been affected."
"Our European airlines and airports have suffered catastrophic financial losses."
"I believe that European airlines alone have lost more than EUR 2 billion."
"In all this chaos, one thing is clear: air transport is enormously important for the European economy, and as individuals, we depend on a thriving and efficient air transport industry where safety for crew and passengers is the first prerogative."
"As such, I applaud the decision of the Commission to respond decisively following the compulsory grounding of the European air transport sector."
"The Commission has recognised the need not only to consider financial compensation, but also the necessity to speed up the implementation of SESAR measures."
"As a general rule I believe that the state should not artificially support business."
"Risk, as we all know and accept, is part of running a business."
"However, these are exceptional circumstances."
"We have not seen such sustained disruption to the industry with such enormous financial losses since 9/11 and, notwithstanding the financial difficulties currently facing all Member States, I would urge them to back plans to support an industry which simply cannot sustain further losses."
"The question now is, what can and should be done in future to deal with such crises?"
"Firstly, airlines must be involved in discussions about possible airspace closures from the outset."
"Secondly, the SESAR package must be brought forward in a sensible fashion."
"I still have some reservations about the creation of a network manager."
"I am not fundamentally opposed to the idea, but I strongly believe some questions remain to be answered."
"For example, what would be the exact role?"
"To whom would this person be accountable?"
"How would this improve the current situation?"
"I look forward to serious debate on the issue, Commissioner, before any legislation is implemented, as a knee-jerk response could prove more damaging than intended."
"I also think it would be wise to look at North America and elsewhere to see how they deal with the issue of volcanic ash."
"In the UK, we apply the same terms of reference as the ICAO, but the Americans use a different method to calculate the ash drift."
"They seem to apply a more measured approach and I believe that we could perhaps learn something there."
"In addition, we must remember that when decisions are made in the EU regarding closing EU airspace, the impact of such decisions does not stop at our borders, and discussions with the remainder of the ICAP countries must take place."
"Finally, as European policy makers, we have a responsibility to develop a viable long-term strategic vision for aviation in the EU, taking into account the international dimension."
"I believe we should support the establishment of measures to improve risk management, settling justified compensation claims without distortion of competition, as well as promoting well balanced, cost effective structural reforms."
"(SK) The closure of air space after the April eruption of the Icelandic volcano confirmed that air transport is highly sensitive to various restrictions on flying conditions."
"Not only clouds of volcanic ash, but also heavy snow, whirlwinds, thick fog and other weather phenomena cause airline companies huge complications in the provision of regular flights."
"Responsible airline companies therefore conclude various policies with insurance companies, which are supposed to cover their financial losses resulting from unforeseen emergencies."
"The costs of this airline company insurance are, of course, included in the price of air tickets, and passengers also pay as part of the price of the air ticket for the airline company to provide them with the necessary services and alternative transport arrangements in the event of an emergency."
"I would like to emphasise and repeat once more, Commissioner, that passengers make a payment as part of the price of an air ticket so that airline companies will be able, in the event of an emergency, to deal with the resulting problems operationally, and to request appropriate compensation from the insurance company for the resulting damage later."
"An ordinary EU citizen who does not directly use aviation services has nothing to do with this business."
"It is therefore totally inappropriate to transfer such aviation losses to EU Member States."
"It is therefore quite right that governments who run their affairs wisely do not want to comply with these absurd demands."
"If anyone is to compensate airline companies for the restrictions arising from the exceptional weather conditions, it should be their insurers, who must fulfil contractual obligations within the scope agreed in their insurance policies."
"After all, that is how it works for every one of our citizens in the EU: if their house burns down, for example, or ice crushes the roof, they receive compensation only from their insurance companies, if they are insured at all."
"They will not get a new house or better accommodation from any airline companies or EU governments."
"Why should they, therefore, contribute towards making up for the lost profits of airline companies?"
"That would surely be absurd."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that in a healthy entrepreneurial environment, no support - and I mean no support at all - of this kind can be justified for airline companies from the governments, and therefore from the citizens, of the EU."
"(PL) In April, a volcanic eruption caused the complete paralysis of air traffic in European air space."
"This event, which was not, of course, caused by anyone, resulted in adverse effects both for passengers and for all European airlines."
"At dozens of airports, passengers were left to their own devices and did not have access to information about the resumption of flights."
"The only fairly specific information came from statements about the closure of more areas of air space."
"Although we cannot blame anyone for the forces of nature and their effect on our daily lives, we should ask very directly about this situation and sum up the actions of the European Union institutions which are responsible for matters such as ensuring the safety of air passengers."
"Unfortunately, I think their action was definitely insufficient and very delayed in relation to the event which had taken place."
"For after all, the total chaos in air traffic experienced by passengers, and their complete lack of knowledge about when flights would be resumed, show the EU institutions, including principally the European Commission, in an extremely bad light."
"Therefore, I would like to find out what the Commission intends to do in the future in the case of other volcanic eruptions."
"What steps will the Commission take to prevent a repeat, in a similar situation, of the paralysis of almost the whole of Europe and, most of all, to improve the flow of information directed to passengers which, hitherto, has been decidedly lacking?"
"I think that the measures currently proposed by the Commission are, unfortunately, not sufficient."
"(EL) Commissioner, the closure of two major airports yesterday, in London and Amsterdam, due to a new volcanic ash cloud, demonstrated that the grounding of flights in April was not the result of an improbable event with no long-term repercussions or risk of repetition."
"Moreover, Mr Simpson's absence from this evening's debate says far more than his presence."
