"The Belgian Presidency is convinced of this and I really hope this question will be on the agenda of the Laeken Summit."
"Recent events have made it abundantly clear that we have to move forward together, in a more harmonious manner and as a community."
"These are the replies I wanted to make to this debate, which, I believe, has highlighted some extremely useful and important principles for the days, weeks and months ahead."
"Madam President, I just wanted to make three clarifications."
"As Mrs Durant pointed out, the question of humanitarian aid is of course paramount. As many speakers have also shown, it is a priority at a time when winter is approaching and the people are in danger."
"I can only confirm our resolve to release the funds that have been allocated."
"Let me repeat that the amount for 2001 is EUR 100 million, channelled via the World Food Organisation and the non-governmental organisations."
"This being said, if we agree about the creation of safety corridors, I think it is then up to us to ensure, via the ECHO instrument, that the aid is delivered as effectively as possible."
"That, at least, is the Commission's resolve. I can only confirm it."
"Similarly, the Commission, in consultation with the international community and the Afghan people, including, of course, Afghan women, is assessing the reconstruction needs, as indeed it also did in Serbia, where that process was regarded as a model of speed and efficiency."
"Finally, at diplomatic level, Mr Prodi and Mr Patten, in particular, are quite ready to respond to the requests the Presidency of the European Union will no doubt be making to them in the next few days."
"Thank you, Mr Busquin."
"The debate is closed."
"Negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks."
"Mrs Durant has the floor on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to speak about the negotiations on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."
"The attacks of 11 September have only strengthened our conviction that multilateral instruments for disarmament and non-proliferation are more crucial than ever."
"Everything possible must be done to prevent terrorist organisations and their members having access to more powerful means with which to carry out their criminal activities."
"The fight against biological weapons must, in this context, be pursued at a more sustained pace, particularly given the threat of potential bioterrorist attacks."
"The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention is a crucial instrument in this process. The European Union and its Member States have committed themselves to ensuring that this convention is universally observed."
"The European Union will be launching, with regard to the Fifth Review Conference on the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention that will take place in Geneva from 19 November to 7 December 2001, a new call to those States that have not yet signed up to the Convention banning biological and toxin weapons, to ratify this as soon as possible."
"Strengthening this Convention is, furthermore, one of the Union' s priorities in the field of disarmament."
"The Council, therefore, attaches the greatest importance to concluding the negotiations that have taken place in Geneva, within the ad hoc group, on a legally binding protocol establishing an effective system that will ensure compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."
"In its conclusions of 11 June 2001, the Council of the European Union once again confirmed its commitment to contribute to the drawing up of a protocol containing a raft of practical measures that it had defined in its common position of 17 May 1999, as essential to the implementation of an effective instrument."
"In this regard, the Union regrets the fact that the special group has not managed to fulfil its mandate, which is to conclude these negotiations on a legally binding protocol before the opening of the Fifth Review Conference."
"The Union has, in fact, expressed its disappointment at the United States' refusal to accept the synthesis text presented by the chairman of the special group."
"The Council is, therefore, maintaining its position."
"The threat biological weapons pose requires an appropriate multilateral response."
"The Council will continue to emphasise the importance it attaches to the work that must lead to a legally binding instrument and, in particular, to maintaining the special group."
"The Union has noted the statement by the United States, according to which that country supports all multilateral mechanisms currently in force for the control, non-proliferation and monitoring of arms exports and has also noted their alternative proposals, which the Union is still studying."
"We have already discussed them with the United States and will continue to do so in the context of preparations for the Review Conference."
"The Union reserves the right to also formulate its own proposals."
"Lastly, the Union hopes that the gains made in the negotiations are preserved and that the Review Conference is able to take decisions that offer prospects for a rapid renewal of negotiations within the multilateral framework of the Convention, with the participation of all States involved."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I do not have a great deal to add to what Mrs Durant has just said."
"I simply wish to confirm that the European Union has, for its part, always been strongly in favour of the compromise text, convinced that it is as important as the agreements on the non-proliferation of weapons, provided that these are accompanied by effective verification measures."
"The Union is convinced that sending a negative signal on progress with international commitments on the non-proliferation of weapons would generally be damaging to world security."
"As has been said, the compromise has not been accepted."
"It is, therefore, unlikely that a resolution will be produced before 19 November, but regular contacts are being maintained between the United States and the European Union on this matter."
"The United States take the view, furthermore, that the events of 11 September and those that have followed do not change their position on the verification protocol drawn up by the ad-hoc group."
"On the other hand, for its part, the European Union maintains that this compromise text would have enabled a major breakthrough to be made at a particularly critical moment."
"The Union also takes the view that the dynamic of discussions in the ad-hoc group must be preserved, even if the form and the procedure have to be adapted to circumstances."
"The United States is in the process of drafting new proposals for protection measures against the risk of a biological attack, insisting on the need to defend itself against the risk of terrorism."
"The European Union considers that some of the United States' proposals are to be welcomed. Nevertheless, it also wishes to add others that are intended to improve the Convention and to encourage the development in the longer term of an instrument that is truly binding under law, but that is the very nub of the problem."
"The Union will also be proposing a mechanism that will enable us to pursue regular dialogue on the Convention and will open this up to all parties concerned."
"These measures will certainly be part of the discussions at the Fifth Review Conference."
"In conclusion, and as has already been said, one thing is certain and that is that there will be no protocol verifying the biological weapons convention in the short term."
"We are seeking to uphold the achievements of the ad-hoc working group."
"Consultation is taking place on a regular basis with the United States and we are trying, on the basis of their proposals, to complement them with our own, so as to preserve the spirit of open and regular dialogue with all parties to the Convention. This, in our view, is the key to multilateralism."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is said that proverbs are the expression of the wisdom of nations and, according to a French proverb, every cloud has a silver lining."
"The appalling disaster of the World Trade Center and the launch by a few madmen of a campaign of anthrax poisoning can at least be credited with waking up public opinion and, through public opinion, waking political leaders, making them more aware of the dangers of the development of an international form of terrorism that is bent on imposing its view of the world by all means possible."
"In this regard, one only has to think of the recent sabre rattling by Osama Bin Laden."
"I hope, by the way, that this will be his last, because he will surely soon have to account to international justice for his crimes."
"I hope, however, that following his imminent fall, the international community will pursue its action to control and ban biological and chemical weapons in order to eliminate the terrible threat that they pose."
"This is the reasoning behind Parliament' s drafting of the motion for a resolution that will be submitted tomorrow for the approval of our fellow Members."
"We are pleased to see the change in the attitude of the American government which, in July, withdrew from negotiations on concluding a protocol to implement the Convention, as you have just reminded us, Commissioner, and we hope that the new conference that is due to take place next week in Geneva, which you informed us about, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, will consequently take place under the best possible auspices."
"We wish to thank you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as representative of the Council, for having assured us of the Council' s desire to coordinate the actions of the Member State governments in this area."
"To this end, we call on the Commission to set up, under its own control, a specialist agency, that could rapidly intervene whenever breaches of the Convention are suspected."
"Could you, Commissioner, give us your personal opinion on this matter?"
"Mr President, earlier this year we expressed our disappointment at the lack of support from the United States for the reinforcement of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."
"In the wake of the events of 11 September and the anthrax attacks on the United States, the issue of bio-terror has suddenly become very topical."
"Biological weapons are threatening to become part of the asymmetrical warfare which typifies the fight against terrorism."
"The Convention is, of course, directed at states, but the effective implementation also makes it more difficult for terrorists to obtain these weapons."
"These weapons have been banned for a very long time, but are unfortunately still available. That is why we call for binding international rules in order to monitor compliance with the Convention better."
"Fortunately, the Americans are back at the negotiating table."
"They have a problem which they are unable to solve on their own."
"However, the proposals they have tabled contain too many loopholes."
"The tighter and more transparent the controls, the better, and that must also be the EU' s focus of attention at the forthcoming review conference later this month."
"The Convention must become an instrument in the search of manufacturers of biological weapons, but also for tracking down existing supplies."
"Russia used to implement extensive programmes."
"How were they wound up, and what happened with the expertise gathered?"
"It is rumoured that scientists who worked on these programmes have offered their services elsewhere."
"The anthrax attacks in the US compel us yet again to consider how we can stop the arms programmes in Iraq."
"For this purpose, the UN must launch new initiatives."
"Naturally, the Convention does not offer adequate protection against bio-terror, against the so-called non-governmental players."
"This also requires more and better cooperation with the police and intelligence services, as well as better criminal investigation methods."
"We need to offer our citizens better protection against possible attacks and the effects thereof."
"Many countries take measures in order to protect themselves against anthrax or smallpox better. The costs involved in those initiatives are enormous."
"Poor countries do not have those funds and could for that reason become the principal victim of a possible smallpox epidemic as a result of bio-terror."
"I would call on the EU and the EU Member States not only to consider the possible protection of its own citizens, but also to examine whether developing countries can be helped by setting up programmes to protect the people in the event of possible terrorist attacks involving biological weapons."
"Mr President, my group, the Liberal Group, wants to make three points, largely in the form of questions."
"First of all - and this point will appear in the compromise resolution which is not yet in print but it is certainly in our own resolution - my colleague, Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne, points out that the United Nations is extremely slow, or has been in the past, to respond when there are reports of breaches of use of these weapons."
"For example, when Saddam Hussein, in the early 90s, used these weapons in the marshes of Iraq, it took the United Nations three and a half weeks to get inspectors there, giving Saddam Hussein plenty of time to cover up the evidence of his crimes."
"Would the Council kindly point out to the United Nations that we need a much quicker response than three and a half weeks if such incidents happen in future, as we fear may happen."
"Secondly - and this appears in the Liberal Group's resolution and also in the compromise resolution - the anthrax problem in the United States has drawn all our attention to the need to react quickly and to analyse what is happening."
"There is no European Union-wide agency looking at this although, in the USA, there is the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta."
"Would the Commission be willing to undertake to propose the creation of a European Union agency, under its control, which would coordinate the work of the relevant national agencies in our Member States in the field of communicable diseases?"
"That would speed up our reaction and help us on a Union basis."
"My third question is addressed to the Council."
"I hope it is a hypothetical question."
"If the investigations in the USA show that the anthrax outbreak came from Iraq and therefore American public opinion becomes overwhelmingly in favour of an attack on Iraq and - I imagine that George Bush would find it very hard to resist such overwhelming public opinion - what would be the Council's position?"
"Would we encourage the EU to attack Iraq as well, or would we try to hold George Bush back?"
"Has the Council considered this?"
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, may heaven preserve us from the weapons which serve and are designed to protect us."
"After the attack of 11 September on Manhattan, the American people remained in the grip of fear following the anthrax attacks which, although they resulted only in a limited number of victims, have a massive psychological effect which reaches far beyond the United States."
"The deadly product that was used points, in terms of its concentration and purity, in the direction of laboratories in the United States itself which are reported to be the only ones in the world that could make the product."
"This clearly shows that the risks which our population faces as a result of the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons are insufficiently removed by current legislation."
"A conference on this subject matter is to take place in Geneva shortly, and we would remind you that in July, notably, the United States withdrew from the negotiations about the Protocol that is before us."
"The European Parliament adopted a resolution on 14 June to back the approval of this Protocol."
"However, we are convinced that an outright ban should apply to both the manufacture and the use of chemical and biological weapons by the international community, and that this ban should be legally binding."
"Current supplies should be destroyed expertly, and I fear that the Protocol too could still be too weak to cope with this."
"Mr President, we have had a treaty against biological weapons and weapons containing toxins for a very long time now."
"It cannot be applied and its application cannot be monitored without a protocol setting out how this is to be done, something we have been trying to achieve for years."
"We have not succeeded."
"The United States sabotaged the protocol, do not ask me why."
"I read papers by American analysts who say that they have not had time to complete various biological warfare programmes which are up and running."
"Be that as it may, following the awful events in New York and the anthrax attacks in the United States, we need to get back to the concept of monitoring and applying this treaty as quickly as possible, come what may."
"I was astounded to hear the Commissioner say that the position of the United States has not changed and that we are unlikely to have a protocol with provisions on monitoring and applying the treaty in the foreseeable future."
"We obviously need to withdraw what we say in the joint motion before you, honourable Members, about welcoming the change in the position of the United States."
"We have made a mistake."
"We must change it tomorrow in an oral amendment."
"Secondly, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have not told us how you intend to exert greater pressure on the United States, given that the whole business is down to them."
"Will discussion alone suffice, I wonder?"
"Thirdly, new factors have come into play, Mr President."
"It has been proven that genetic engineering can be used for this sort of weapon of mass destruction by applying research into vaccines and other forms of treatment which are easily hijacked for military purposes."
"I have tabled an amendment for tomorrow's vote."
"I think that we should adopt it and that the European Union should include this issue in the debate."
"Finally, if it turns out, ladies and gentlemen, as the FBI is saying, that the anthrax was made and supplied in the United States, are there any Members here who propose that someone, do not ask me who, should bomb the United States?"
"Mr President, since this is the first time I have spoken in this House, please allow me to greet the presidency, the Council and my fellow Members."
"The possible use of military technology and biological and chemical weapons by subversive groups is no longer a remote risk but a real civil defence problem."
"The loss of military secrets, experts and materials has now been verified and is the real basis that the strategy of terrorism can use to strike against the civil population, which is defenceless in the face of such new aggression."
"To address this new scenario of warfare, in which the enemy is well concealed in the meshes of civil society, protected by the very rights of freedom he is fighting against and where the targets are no longer just the armed forces but the civil population, it is vital to know what threats may be hanging over the safety of the citizens."
"In view of the fact that some nations have not signed up to the Geneva Convention on chemical and biological weapons, as we have heard, and have continued to develop these technologies of warfare, we appeal to the United States and the republics of the former Soviet Union, as well as all those states that have not taken part or signed up, to provide the international community with detailed information on the biological and chemical agents they know about which could, in some way, be traced or stolen by terrorist groups."
"The aim of all this is to acquire useful data as soon as possible to prevent the creation, stockpiling and spread of such means of mass destruction, and, at the same time, to prepare the necessary information measures for the staff of civil and paramilitary institutions to equip them to deal effectively and rapidly with these new scenarios of disasters caused by people without any scruples at all."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is an historic tragedy that the country which has refused to adopt truly effective controls on the use of biological and toxic weapons was the first to fall victim to these brutal attacks."
"Of course, this does not prevent us from expressing our deep sympathy with the American people and especially the families affected."
"However, I believe that this sign of isolationism and unilateralism, which is still very strong in America, must be viewed by the European Union, and in particular by the Council, as an opportunity to lobby the US very hard, not only on this issue but also on the International Criminal Court, for effective international agreements and monitoring arrangements in the wake of these dreadful attacks."
"It is grotesque that in recent days, Congress has debated a bill which vehemently opposes the establishment of the International Criminal Court - a Court which would deal with crimes like these, especially if they were supported and perpetrated by states."
"The second important point - and I would like to address the Commission in particular here - is how we, in Europe, are equipped, as far as is humanly possible, to defend ourselves against such attacks or to reduce their impact to a minimum."
"As has already been mentioned, the USA has an agency in Atlanta, a disease control centre."
"Does the Commission think this should be considered in Europe as well?"
"Of course, I know that when there is a problem, there is a tendency to call for a new EU agency to be set up, which raises further problems of control and supervision."
"However, in light of recent developments, I think that there are various arguments in favour of this type of agency."
"In general terms, I think that the Commission must do more regarding security against this type of terrorist attack, whether it involves biological or nuclear weapons."
"This is not a task which we can simply leave to the Member States."
"Certain safety standards in these areas must be set out at European level in response to this type of terrorism."
"I also believe that the Commission, together with the Council, must consider how we should deal with the installations, factories and laboratories which handle these hazardous products, especially genetically modified products, without encroaching unnecessarily on the privacy of employees while achieving a minimum of transparency, protection and prevention."
"Those who work in this kind of installation must therefore be prepared to accept a certain measure of control."
"Finally, I should like to ask the Commission once again what it intends to do to create this protection, not only in general terms but also as regards practical measures, in the coming years."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Minister, nothing has been said in this debate which I cannot support."
"Nonetheless, I would like to raise three points which, in my view, should be emphasised to a far greater extent."
"Firstly, in the long term, we cannot expect other states to adopt security policies which are different from those we practise ourselves."
"If we do not want proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in this area, for example, a clearer signal must be sent out by the European Union and its partners."
"Secondly, there has obviously been a paradigm shift and a change in strategy in the USA on the verification issue compared with the 1980s."
"In view of the urgency of these issues in the wake of 11 September, the European Union's diplomatic restraint, which I have often understood, is inappropriate, and I hope that the USA's unilateralism, which has just been mentioned, will be overcome on the basis of their own experience."
"The third problem is the most crucial."
"It is wrong to point to the USA alone."
"This paradigm shift has obviously taken place here in Western Europe as well."
"If I look at the model under discussion for the Biological Weapons Convention as well, namely the monitoring organisation for chemical weapons, there is currently a financial crisis in which EU Member States also play a role."
"We have witnessed deterioration in the monitoring provisions since the Convention was first adopted."
"Perhaps this is symptomatic, Madam Minister: in May this year, I asked the Council for its comments on these issues."
"I have still not received a response, and I suspect that we, too, are approaching this issue with insufficient vigour."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I simply wish to answer the questions asked by Mr Morillon, Mr Swoboda and Mr Dunn on the issue of whether an Agency should or should not exist."
"In the context of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, there was clearly never any question of discussing an Agency."
"The Union' s position was to propose a mechanism for pursuing dialogue beyond the Review Conference in the form of either annual meetings of the signatories as is done for the Convention on Chemical Weapons, or of meetings of experts, in other words, continuing the former ad hoc group as was explained in the current state of discussions on this Convention."
"Nevertheless, I should like to tell you that, at the Ghent Summit and, of course, at the request of the presidency of the European Union, the Commission has undertaken work on examining this issue in all its aspects and, therefore, on listing laboratories, in an attempt to see what type of response we can provide. At the Commission meeting yesterday, a joint briefing sheet was issued by Mr Byrne, the Commissioner responsible for Health and Consumer protection, to Mr Liikanen and myself, to see how we can implement, at European Union level, in agreement, of course with the Member States, closer coordination in order to achieve our objectives, without necessarily creating an Agency."
"This is, broadly speaking, the way things are heading."
"In this regard, I would say that in the field of research itself, and, therefore, of the potential for knowledge in this area, we are planning a meeting dedicated to this issue, on 13 December, in Brussels, of all experts from the Member States."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Shipbuilding (continuation)"
"The next item is the follow-up to the debate on the report (A5-0373/2001) by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning a temporary defensive mechanism for shipbuilding [COM(2001)401 - C5-0393/2001 - 2001/0153(CNS)]."
"Mr President, after congratulating the rapporteur, I would like to begin by stressing that the ship-building industry throughout Europe is facing a serious crisis which could affect the very credibility of the European Union and perhaps endanger the continued existence of this sector in the Union, given the unfair competition on the part of South Korea."
"Furthermore, it could represent an invitation or a stimulus to the Koreans to extend their unfair practices to other sectors of economic activity such as automobiles, electronics and steel."
"Of course, this invitation may not only extend to Korea itself but also to other countries, principally in that region."
"Transparency suggests a challenge: free competition in a free market."
"But a free market means the same laws for all, and given that this does not exist at the moment, our transparency in a world and at a time when we do not have the other elements necessary for the existence of that free market, as well as naivety, may result in a clear risk of disaster and also a lack of solidarity from the European Union towards the Member States and the cities of those States."
"This is the case with a city such as mine, Vigo, in the North East of Spain, where companies and families have made an enormous effort and a difficult sacrifice in order to be competitive."
"Solidarity therefore demands measures in defence of a sector which is also strategic for Europe; measures which impose the extension of the scope of the defensive support mechanism to all categories of ship built by the Korean shipyards and which also impose an extension of the period the defensive mechanism is in force until 31 December 2003, which is also the period in force of Regulation (EC) 1540/98 or, alternatively, until the WTO procedure against Korea is concluded."
"Mr President, our future, the future of our States and the citizens of Europe are at stake."
"Twenty years on will be too late."
"I believe that solidarity demands, and leads us to hope, that the Commission and the Council will act in the way I have mentioned."
"These are the reasons given by the companies and workers in the sector in the parts of Europe where shipbuilding is important."
"Mr President, those of you who know me will be aware that I do not usually speak in favour of public aid which distorts competition."
"That does not mean that I do not recognise that some of this public aid makes sense and must continue if it contributes to the objectives laid down in the Treaty."
"Despite this, and precisely because this is one of those cases, I would like to express my total support for the Commission' s proposal and the amendments presented by the competent committees, which propose a defensive and temporary mechanism in the ship-building sector in order to confront the unfair practices of South Korea."
"In this section, there is no room for solutions such as that proposed by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which, by taking an extremely orthodox position in opposition to public aid, would have disastrous consequences for the European shipbuilding sector."
"There is absolutely no doubt that the Republic of Korea is practising dumping in the sector, and for this reason the European industry cannot compete."
"It is true that the Commission has begun proceedings before the World Trade Organisation to combat this unfair competition, but it is also the case that, while this procedure is under way, the European ship-building industry could disappear, with significant repercussions for employment."
"We must bear in mind that there are two elements to this aid which make it worthy of support: firstly, it is transitional, it will only be granted until the WTO resolves the dispute in question, and secondly, it is defensive, it is a response to aggressive unfair competition by the Republic of Korea, and for these reasons it is perfectly acceptable."
"Furthermore, the amendments approved by the competent committee are acceptable, since they include certain types of ship which are also affected by these unfair practices on the part of Korea."
"The rapporteur has been informed of the existence of a possible legal report by the services of the Council which opposes these measures proposed by the Commission."
"While we do not know what these legal arguments are, we must be content with the legal reports of both the European Parliament and the Commission, which speak of the suitability of the aid as proposed by the Commission, which is neither substantially distorted nor modified by the proposals which have been approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would protest about the fact that the Council is not represented here today in order to provide us with the legal evaluation we requested."
"It is unacceptable that we, as a Parliament, do not have access to the same information as the Council."
"It is unacceptable discrimination between the two institutions."
"I should like to have seen us in Parliament postponing the debate on the proposal until we had received the Council' s legal evaluation."
"Unfortunately, that is not what the big two political groups wanted."
"The usual demand for transparency is transparently not so important when money is at stake and national interests to be looked after."
"I have, however, received an answer from the Commission regarding the regulation' s compliance with the WTO rules."
"The Commission sees no problems."
"There, I disagree."
"The Commission says that the regulation will not have any negative effect on third countries."
"That is incorrect."
"In future, a Japanese shipyard, for example, will compete with European shipyards that receive State aid."
"In that way, the regulation will have a negative effect on third countries, for example Japan."
"The Commission also says that the proposed regulation cannot be regarded as biased action by the EU against South Korea, something that would be contrary to the WTO regulations."
"The regulation states quite specifically that European shipyards can only receive State aid if they are in direct competition with Korean shipyards."
"Korea is mentioned specifically, then."
"A more biased course of action cannot be imagined."
"With this proposal, we, in the EU, are doing something that is downright illegal."
"I urge that what was adopted in Parliament' s committee be rejected, just as I should ideally like to see the Commission withdraw its proposal and instead concentrate on taking WTO proceedings against the Koreans."
"What is the Commission trying to do with all these amendments to extend the period of the regulation and to increase the number of types of ship that are eligible for aid?"
"Will the Commission confirm that it will on no account comply with Parliament' s requests today?"
"Will the Commission confirm or deny that it has plans to table an altered proposal that includes LNG tankers?"
"I very much hope that the Commission will answer these questions."
"Mr President, for years European shipyards have been condemning the dumping practised by South Korea in relation to the sales prices of the ships built there."
"Finally, and after so many complaints about it, the Commission has presented an initiative, with the acquiescence of the Council, and has proposed certain provisional measures to us, which consist of a temporary defence mechanism, specifically designed to counteract Korea' s unfair practices, putting a complaint procedure before the World Trade Organisation."
"Nevertheless, the Commission, in its proposed aid to ship building, only includes container ships and oil tankers."
"We believe that it should also include special ships for the transportation of gases derived from oil and liquefied natural gas, as well as ferries, bulk carriers and roll-on roll-off car ferries, all of which are included in the complaints presented to the WTO."
"It is time that Korea realised that the Union is determined to defend its shipbuilding industry in the face of unfair practices by any other country."
"Mr President, this Commission proposal has arisen following the problems resulting from the liberalisation agreements it agreed to negotiate within the OECD while at the same time it limited State aid to the shipbuilding industry, promoted the concentration of shipyards and later removed operating aid."
"Now that there are serious problems in the industry, which is of strategic importance to the European Union, particularly to ensure the security of supply on appropriate terms and to prevent excessive dependence on external sources, it has become necessary to support the European shipbuilding industry against unfair practices by Korea."
"Although the Commission proposal is important for the moment, it is only temporary and partial, and in the end, is on the same level as Korean unfair practices."
"In any event, it is important that the proposals that the rapporteur has made should at least be taken into account, including the extension of the expiry date of this 6% operating aid, in special cases up to a limit of 14%, and also the enlargement of its scope to other vessels."
"We therefore back this report in order to prevent the short-term aggravation of the economic and social problems that already exist in this area."
"Mr President, tomorrow never comes now that the European Commission has proposed to subsidise shipbuilding again."
"It was made clear in the past that the subsidies for the shipbuilding industry would be discontinued in mid-2001."
"The re-introduction of a temporary subsidy scheme goes against the agreements made and is unacceptable."
"The granting of subsidies to the shipbuilding industry is both unnecessary and undesirable."
"It is unnecessary because shipbuilding in Europe focuses on the construction of technologically advanced ships and not on the simple conveyer-belt production as is the case in low-wage countries."
"It therefore offers not a single solution to the problems in the industry."
"The granting of aid is undesirable because financially unhealthy companies remain in production thanks to subsidies, and efficient production is impossible as a result."
"The industry does not benefit from non-generic support."
"Structural solutions to the problems European shipbuilding is facing lie in healthy competition and structural reforms."
"The Commission proposal, however, will undermine these prospects for a long time."
"The internal market will be disrupted since the Member States will step in to implement the Regulation, and non-generic support will lead to unfair competition."
"With this proposal, Europe places itself in an untenable position."
"Lodging a complaint at the WTO is absurd if the Commission adheres to temporary support measures as suggested."
"We therefore share the overwhelming concern expressed by the original rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, with regard to this proposal."
"In fact, I cannot imagine that the duty Commissioner Bolkestein would think any differently about this."
"Mr President, colleagues, honourable Member of the Commission, the European Union and South Korea have been conducting so far fruitless negotiations in order to bring about sound competition into the world shipbuilding market."
"The Commission has now approved a strategy, according to which the matter will be taken to the WTO dispute settlement procedure."
"I support this decision and would like to thank all those Members of the Commission who actively contributed to this decision."
"At the same time, however, the Commission issued a proposal to the effect that operating aid could be allowed to individual shipyards temporarily during the WTO procedure."
"According to the Commission proposal for a regulation, any arrangements for subsidies would be exceptional and temporary measures and would concern a limited number of ship types only."
"At first glance the Commission proposal may seem justified, but in reality it distorts competition both in the world market and even within the EU and lacks any valid legitimate reason."
"The link between the subsidy mechanism and the WTO procedure is totally artificial."
"These matters have no natural connection and therefore these questions should be dealt with separately."
"All of us who are involved in politics understand this: this is politics, not a legal process."
"If we want to lean on the WTO, we ourselves must act according to the rules set by the WTO."
"By allocating subsidies, the EU itself is guilty of distorting actions of which it is now accusing Korea."
"This will bring discredit on us and will weaken our negotiation position within the WTO."
"I said that the Commission proposal distorts competition also inside the EU."
"Even if only certain ship types would receive subsidies, the subsidised shipyards would always benefit from subsidy monies and would therefore have an advantage over other shipyards."
"In particular this will impede the position of the high technology shipbuilding industry, which for very good reasons has responded to fiercening competition by concentrating especially on products representing more demanding technology."
"Among others my home country Finland has from the very beginning, as agreed, reduced shipyard subsidies, and we have invested strongly in the building of cruise ships and other high technology vessels."
"Consequently, through these actions Finnish shipyards have achieved world-wide competitiveness, which the Commission is now trying to take away from us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to express my satisfaction at the way in which Mrs Riis-Jørgensen' s report has been very fruitfully amended in committee, which will enable us to establish a defensive mechanism for our shipbuilding industry."
"We are all already aware of the difficulties that this sector has faced for years as a result of unfair competition from Korea."
"We are also aware that Korea continues to set prices below cost, that the Korean authorities provide their shipyards with subsidies, both direct and indirect, that bankrupt shipyards are kept operational, that South Korea' s production capacity increased by 170% between 1988 and 1997, whereas, during the same period, European production fell by 30%."
"And yet, during this time, European subsidies were ended."
"All attempts to resolve the matter amicably have been in vain and a case therefore had to be lodged with the WTO."
"I am pleased that this case has now been supplemented with a proposal for a defensive mechanism."
"The WTO procedure will probably last three years."
"It would be absurd to leave European shipbuilding unprotected for this time and the Commission has proposed a defence mechanism in the form of subsidies."
"I support this measure but I would add that Korean competition also affects oil tankers."
"One Korean company, with USD five billion' s worth of losses that have been absorbed by state banks, nevertheless won half of all industrial tonnage in 2000 - by dropping prices."
"At a time when the consequences of the 11 September attacks have led to a pause in orders for cruise ships, a sector which does not need subsidies, orders for oil tankers are much needed, which is why we must include this sector in the defensive mechanism."
"This is my contribution, ladies and gentlemen, to this very important debate on shipbuilding."
"I too wish to see Parliament give massive support to the Commission' s proposal."
"Mr President, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, for her tenacious and courageous fight for a free market economy."
"The rapporteur knows something of which other colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Commission ought to be aware: State subsidies of any kind damage the economy, impair the operation of the market and harm consumers."
"Subsidies make for inefficiency and increase costs."
"What is depressing is that fellow MEPs now want to make a bad proposal still worse."
"I come from Sweden."
"In the seventies, Sweden was the world' s second largest shipbuilding nation after Japan."
"I had my first job in what was at that time one of Sweden' s largest shipyards."
"We built the largest oil tanker in history."
"When competition increased from countries such as Portugal, Japan and South Korea, the Swedish state invested a total of EUR 2 billion in an attempt to rescue the shipbuilding industry."
"No industrial investment in Sweden has been so ill-starred, cost so much and resulted in so little."
"The necessary restructuring of industry came to a halt, and no new jobs were created."
"If we in the EU now want to show real solidarity with the shipyard workers and their families, the Commission' s and the committees' proposals must naturally be rejected."
"That would be an investment for the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I will get straight to the point."
"Our group supports the Commission proposal with amendments."
"Of course, we question the way in which we put up defensive mechanisms when there is talk of opaque, unclear and unfair competition."
"The rapporteur has suggested that we should not take any generic measures, as is now the case, namely according to types of ships and possibly a broader concept thereof, but has favoured measures according to regions and shipbuilding yards instead."
"Separate support must be granted within the agreements we have concluded in this connection."
"The question then actually arises as to the way in which people who, let us say, want to uphold the liberal principles, need to act the moment damage is being done."
"I will quote one example."
"At present, the Commission has instituted proceedings against the Schelde-Damen construction, that is to say, Damen, has taken over the company Schelde for 1 Guilder."
"Questions have been raised as to whether that is acceptable."
"My question is whether, in the spirit of the directive which is now being proposed, it could be possible that the Commission, let us say in an oblique way, is now also turning a blind eye to constructions which are being used in this context and in the above example."
"Mr President, the ban on State aid for what are mostly publicly-owned shipyards, the refusal to write off the debts run up by their previous private owners and the practice of handing them back to the private sector more or less free of charge are the mainstays of the policy exercised by the European Union which, in collusion with our national governments, has caused this strategically important sector to waste away."
"This sorry state of affairs has been exacerbated by a dumping policy, especially in South Korea."
"The blow which started with the seventh directive has been fatal for Greece's highly-developed shipbuilding industry."
"Thousands of jobs have been lost, working and health and safety conditions in the sector have deteriorated and we recently mourned the death of another five workers, sacrificed to capitalist speculation in the shipbuilding sector."
"Now we have a hypocritical proposal to give aid, the aid which was previously banned, to what are now privately-owned shipyards as their only means of salvation."
"Yet again we see the European Union's devotion to the interests of big business."
"The Communist Party of Greece takes the view that the only viable solution is to create a single publicly-owned agency which can withstand international competition and benefit employment and the economy."
"Mr President, during this debate, certain things have become clear and have enjoyed general consensus."
"There is a general consensus that the crisis is affecting the European Union' s shipbuilding industry. There is a general consensus that this crisis is due, amongst other things, to unfair competition on the part of the Republic of South Korea, which, according to Mr Caudron, consists of three elements: prices which are lower than costs, aid to shipyards and the maintenance of bankrupt shipyards."
"I have also stressed that the crisis is serious."
"Over the last 10 years, Korea has increased its capacity by 180%, while we have reduced ours by 30%."
"What have we done so far?"
"So far, we have signed an agreement with South Korea which that country has not respected."
"We have lodged a complaint which is yet to be dealt with."
"And recently, a twin course of action has been decided upon: firstly, to take the case to the WTO and, secondly, to establish the defensive, selective and temporary mechanism which we are discussing."
"It is as if Commissioner Bolkestein, faced with the non-compliances of Korea, had used the words of Cicero to Catiline: ""Quousque tandem abutere Catilina patientia nostra [How long now, Catiline, will you abuse our patience]""."
"I would remind those Members, almost all from the North, who have spoken against this decision, of a military aphorism which says that 'the mission of the artillery is to bomb the infantry, preferably that of the enemy' ."
"In this case, the weapons of the North are aiming at European positions, bringing to mind in many cases the situation of Japan or that of other industries."
"What does the European Parliament want to do?"
"Support Mr Bolkestein whole-heartedly and ask him to be more generous."
"To be more generous in relation to the field of protection: that is to say, as Mr Ortuondo has stressed, that it also be extended to those vessels which suffer from unfair competition, those which transport gases, car ferries, etc. and that he be less stingy in terms of the date of application."
"May God bless you if you do this, Mr Bolkestein."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commission for proposing a regulation for the shipbuilding industry which may be temporary and segmented but which somehow, once again, helps minimise the effects of protectionism, which exists in various trading blocs around the world and not just in Korea."
"In Korea it is not even a question of protectionism: it is a massive violation of WTO rules."
"We should like to believe that the complaint that has been made will have some effect and bring some discipline to this sector."
"The Commission has revealed, however, that it knows the proposed mechanism is not enough, and that it is only one step, and a step with all the negative baggage that stopgap measures entail, once we get beyond the deficit and crises of the shipbuilding industry, some of which have already been mentioned here, so I shall not repeat them."
"But while it is true that the Nordic countries support investment and alternative technology, and thus achieve added value and still manage to keep active in the market without great social upheaval, this is not equally true for other European Union regions, such as southern Europe, regions where this sector is the largest employer and supports employment in a number of services and subsidiary industries."
"It is often the only activity that generates development in these regions, and so the disappearance of this activity would be a social tragedy for certain regions, particularly in my country, in Spain and in Greece."
"But while we hope that the Commission will implement this regulation at least by 2003, we hope for a lot more for the future and a different attitude towards the sector."
"Mr President, on 5 December 2000, the Council decided that the granting of State aid of up to 9 per cent to the shipbuilding industry should cease for all Member States at the end of the year 2000."
"This was for two reasons: State aid had not proved to have had any major effect on the industry' s ability to survive, and there was a conviction on grounds of principle that State aid should be reduced as much as possible and preferably cease."
"Parliament shared this view as recently as last year."
"State aid to shipyards is, moreover, contrary to international trade agreements, a fact crystallised by the Commission' s attempt in the autumn of 1999 and the spring of 2000 to reach a negotiated solution with South Korea to the problem of their having violated current trade agreements by providing extensive State aid."
"Now that that attempt has failed, the Commission is instead tabling a proposal for a so-called temporary defensive mechanism for the shipbuilding industry, involving aid of between 6 and 14 per cent."
"According to the committee' s proposal, this is to continue right up until the end of 2003, at the same time as dispute settlement proceedings have been instituted before the WTO against South Korea as a result of the latter' s having violated current trade agreements."
"The reintroduction of extensive State aid within the EU would scarcely increase the prospects of solving the dispute with South Korea."
"It would make more sense to reject the Commission' s proposal and put every effort into the WTO proceedings against South Korea."
"In conclusion, I should like to put the following question to Commissioner Bolkestein: how does he think this proposal stands in relation to the EU' s competition policy through which we are trying to minimise, and preferably remove, State aid to industries in order to create fair and healthy competition between companies?"
"Mr President, my colleague, Mr Monti, has asked me to pass on his regrets to Parliament for his absence and to respond on his behalf."
"I should like, on Mr Monti's behalf, to thank Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her hard work and considerable input into this report."
"We are extremely grateful for the rapid handling of this file by Parliament."
"I also wish to take this opportunity to explain to Parliament the Commission's position on this report."
"Ideally, there would be no need for the Commission to present this proposal."
"I stress that operating aid is a particularly distorting form of aid, because it provides no incentive to improve efficiency and delivers no benefit in terms of competitiveness of the yards by, for example, encouraging training or research development."
"Nor, indeed, does it help the environment."
"For those reasons and after many years of operating aid being granted to the shipbuilding industry, the Commission finally decided to prohibit it as from the end of last year."
"However, to quote a well-known philosopher, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds."
"That being so, it is only right that the Community should take action against any unfair competitive practices, and it is within that context that the proposal for the temporary defensive mechanism should be seen."
"This proposal is one part of a two-pronged strategy against Korean practices and is designed to support the Community's action against Korea in the WTO."
"It is an exceptional measure, and is only taken in the light of a situation which led one representative rightly to quote Cicero saying: 'Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?'"
"It is, as I say, an exceptional measure, whose purpose is to put pressure on Korea to bring it to the negotiating table with the Community and to force it to bring an end to its unfair commercial practices."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, it is not in any way the beginning of a new, possibly open ended regime of operating aid."
"That emphatically is not the Commission's intention."
"I note that the proposed amendments to the Commission's proposal relate to three main issues."
"Firstly, there is the scope of the mechanism."
"Secondly, there is the information to be made available to the Member States and also to third parties through Member States."
"Thirdly and finally, there is the matter of its duration."
"I should like to respond to these points in that order."
"So, firstly, on the extension of the scope: the amendments proposed in the report would considerably widen the scope of the mechanism, which covers only those market segments that the Commission has identified, in its report on the trade barriers regulation, as having already been considerably injured by unfair Korean practices."
"The proposal strikes a balance between a high maximum aid ceiling of 14% on the one hand and limited eligibility on the other hand."
"It is therefore specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices."
"Any enlargement of the scope would risk changing the nature of the proposal."
"I would like to draw Members' attention to Article 2(6) of the proposal, which provides that the Commission will keep under review the market segments eligible for aid in the light of evidence clearly proving that a specific market segment within the Community has been directly injured by unfair and opaque competitive conditions."
"The Commission will, accordingly, monitor the situation and keep Parliament informed of any potential review under that provision."
"The second point relates to information provided to Member States and third parties through Member States, that is, the removal of the name and address of the applicant shipyard and prospective purchaser."
"That is the intention of the amendments put forward."
"The information that has been specified in Article (2)(a) of the Commission's proposal is the minimum necessary to allow third parties to submit useful comments to the Commission and to ensure the effectiveness of the transparency procedure."
"The purpose of that provision is to speed up the procedure."
"The alternative option would be to open the formal investigation procedure in all cases where the Commission has doubts about the compatibility of aid."
"That would entail the full publication of detailed information relating to the notification."
"Thirdly, there is the extension of the expiry date until 31 December 2003."
"It has been argued by some Members of Parliament that the expiry date of the mechanism is too early."
"But by the end of 2002 we will have a good idea of how the WTO action is proceeding."
"It would be a timely opportunity to take stock of the situation and to reassess whether special measures for shipbuilding are still considered necessary."
"The Commission can, at that stage, propose an extension of the defensive mechanisms to the Council."
"In addition to what I have just said on behalf of my colleague Mr Monti, I should like to reply more specifically to two or three questions that were put to the Commission just now."
"Firstly, Mr Blokland claims that there is a need for structural changes and not for more aid to ailing industries."
"I would agree with him that ideally subsidies should support structural change."
"Let us hope that in this case that is true."
"Various Members have raised the issue of compatibility with the WTO."
"In the Commission's view the proposal on a temporary defensive mechanism is fully compatible with WTO law subsidies, provided they are not prohibitive, are not drawn to cause so-called adverse effects and are legitimate national policy instruments as far as the WTO is concerned."
"Therefore the European Community has the right to grant aid to its shipbuilders."
"In fact the EC has been granting such aid to its shipbuilding industry for many years, up to 31 December 2000."
"Insofar as subsidies are not sanctions in the sense of the dispute settlement procedure, they are permitted policy measures."
"Therefore the recourse to dispute settlement can in no way be seen as limiting the normal rights and obligations of Members under the WTO agreements."
"Lastly, in reply to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen's question, as to whether the Commission would submit a new proposal for the reasons explained, the Commission does not see any reason to modify the proposal."
"Therefore the Commission has no plans to put forward a new proposal."
"The Commission is grateful for the support Parliament has so far shown for this proposal."
"For the reasons that I have outlined, the proposed amendments are not acceptable to the Commission."
"Nevertheless I very much hope that we can count on Parliament's continued support in this matter."
"Mr President, I am glad Mr Bolkestein confirmed that he will not submit a new proposal."
"But he also referred to the review clause in the proposal."
"Can you assure me today, Mr Bolkestein, that you are not going to give in to France by permitting it to subsidise its shipyards in order to get agreement in the Council in December?"
"Can you confirm that you will make no agreement with France before that meeting?"
"In reply to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen's question, I repeat that the Commission stands by the position I have outlined just now."
"Any further negotiations are, as far as the Commission is concerned, not in order."
"We will see what happens in the Industry Council at the beginning of December."
"As far as the position of one Member State is concerned, the Commission has nothing further to add."
") Mr President, my speech concerns a matter of procedure."
"My view is that from the point of view of the working of the Members of Parliament it is very unsatisfactory that reports are continuously moved to entirely different time slots on the agenda."
"Mrs Peijs' s report was originally due to be considered at the afternoon session, then we were informed that it has been moved to the session starting at 9 p.m., after that a notification suddenly appeared here at 5.15 p.m. that in actual fact its processing is starting now."
"This kind of tossing the ball back and forth is not acceptable with regard to getting the Members' time schedules organised."
"Another matter I would like to draw attention to is the absence of the Council."
"The Council question time is starting now."
"Surely they would have been able to arrive half an hour earlier to discuss, for example, this matter which is very important to the shipbuilding industry."
"The Council, however, is again conspicuous by being absent."
"I deeply regret that this is happening."
"I do understand your concern, Mrs Kauppi, but I must tell you that Council Question Time is also set on our agenda for a very precise time, which is 5.30 p.m."
"Members who have tabled questions will, therefore, be joining us in a few minutes. We must give them the floor."
"Having said that, although our debates are programmed into the agenda, it is impossible to predict exactly how long they will last, give or take a few minutes or a quarter of an hour, not least because the Commissioners and the ministers sometimes take up much more speaking time than the sitting staff plan for."
"This is why I would ask you to show some understanding and flexibility."
"We have two or three minutes left before 5.30 p.m. and I therefore suspend the sitting until Council Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.27 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Questions to the Council (B5-0338/2001)."
"On behalf of the Council, Mrs Durant is with us as President-in-Office of the Council and we thank her for being here."
"She is Vice Prime Minister and Minister for Mobility and Transport."
"As the author, Mr Staes, is not present, Question No 1 lapses."
"The fact that we have started on time today has probably surprised some Members who always bank on a delay, but not today."
"The second question has been withdrawn."
"Question No 3 by (H-0778/01):"
"Subject: Guidelines for the Cardiff Integration Process How does the Council intend to develop a common set of guidelines for the proper evaluation, follow-up and monitoring of the nine Council strategies, as well as the overall Cardiff Process, for environmental integration?"
"Will these guidelines include recommendations for a more transparent process and wider stakeholder participation in the development and implementation of the strategies?"
"How will the Council ensure full involvement of the European Parliament in the Cardiff Process?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Council would like to reiterate that the Cardiff process has led six Council formations to present strategies to the European Council that seek to integrate the environment into their policies."
"These strategies concerned the transport, energy, agriculture, industry, internal market and development cooperation sectors."
"The General Affairs, ECOFIN and Fisheries Councils plan to present the three latest relevant strategies to the Barcelona European Council in the spring of 2002."
"The nine integration strategies must be implemented in the form of sectoral measures, adopted by the majority, through co-decision with the European Parliament."
"In addition to the Cardiff process, we must highlight the Lisbon process, which integrates the 1997 Luxembourg social process on employment with the 1999 Cologne macro-economic process, which was given a third dimension in Gothenburg, an environmental dimension, made up of the strategy for sustainable development, which also seeks to achieve integration of the environment into sectoral policies."
"The European Union will present all this to the Global Summit on Sustainable Development which, as you know, will be held in Johannesburg in September 2002."
"By creating this strategy on sustainable development, the European Council has given priority, in terms of the environment, to climate change, to ecologically viable methods of transport, to the responsible management of natural resources and, lastly, to the management of risks to public health."
"Whilst continuing to function independently, the Cardiff process has been assessed and monitored since its launch in 1998, with results which are now integrated into the enlarged framework of the Lisbon process."
"The implementation of the strategy on sustainable development must, as decided at Gothenburg, be based on four points."
"The first point is an annual synthesis report by the Commission, which will now concern the three dimensions of the Lisbon process, including the strategy on sustainable development."
"A report of the same kind will also have to be presented to the Barcelona European Council."
"The second point is an evaluation and a political direction at the spring European Councils."
"The third point concerns structural indicators on sustainable development which will be, on the basis of a Commission communication, endorsed by the Council before being submitted to the Laeken European Council."
"The fourth and final point is a Commission communication on better regulation, which will mean that all the major proposals from this institution will be assessed beforehand for their effects on the strategy on sustainable development, including integration of the environmental dimension."
"The Council is currently working to implement the conclusions of the European Council on the structures of work."
"These will be designed with particular consideration given to the principles of governance in terms of transparency, stakeholder participation, better methods for regulation and the re-focusing of Community policies."
"Trying to put the principles of environmental sustainability into practice is no easy task."
"The Council is actually inventing the wheel."
"The impression that many of us have is that the discussions are taking place behind closed doors."
"I wonder whether the presidency is trying to open the discussion up, increase the transparency of the process and perhaps involve other organisations such as NGOs in the development of strategies."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council in particular what is being done to press for the working groups to identify specific medium-term objectives, clear targets and programmes of action, so that we have something to get our teeth into and have a demonstrable means of measuring progress and achievement?"
"I share your concern regarding transparency and openness, so that we can have specific indicators and results."
"I also share your concern to take into account the views, advice or specific results from other organisations, particularly NGOs."
"I have taken careful note of your suggestion, of your request to increase transparency and the involvement of all those who are helping to draw up strategies on sustainable development in the field."
"I do hope that in showing transparency, the Council will also be able to integrate the results that you mention in order to ensure that these indicators on sustainable development, which are being prepared and are due to be submitted to the Laeken European Council, can, as part of the process and in the run-up to Barcelona, be improved from the point of view of both transparency and their repercussions or in terms of taking into account the views of all those who are working specifically in the field in the area of sustainable development."
"Mr President, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Cardiff process is essential for sustainable development."
"The European Parliament, and especially its Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has already carried out very good preliminary work here, and I think that in this House, transparency and, of course, dialogue can really be taken for granted."
"We very often hold hearings here and make every effort to maximise dialogue with non-government organisations."
"My question relates to this issue."
"We have just concluded the WTO negotiations."
"What opportunities do you see to coordinate the Cardiff process in consultation with the WTO organisations?"
"Mr President, your concern regarding both transparency and correspondence or coherence between, firstly, the outcome of the Doha Summit, the final details of which we are awaiting, and, secondly, the strategies on sustainable development, is extremely interesting."
"Admittedly, as we saw at Doha, it is difficult, but interesting nonetheless, to integrate environmental policies into a much more multi-lateral context."
"This is an important step forward, considering our starting point."
"I think that this is a positive aspect and that, in the wake of the Doha Summit, we will now have to make the most of the achievements of Doha and use them within the framework of the measures that are to be implemented at European Union level, so as to ensure that sustainable development not only continues to be an honourable and bold ambition for everyone, but more importantly, translates itself, whilst observing the principle of transparency and following constructive dialogue, into specific measures in the field."
"I therefore feel that the correspondence between the two parts, what was achieved within a wider forum and what was achieved or is in the process of being achieved at European Union level and, in particular, what must be achieved at the Laeken and Barcelona Councils, should be coherent and should be the milestones of a structural position, that is specific and conducive to the integration of sustainable development in all the policies implemented at Council and European Union level in general."
"Question No 4 by (H-0781/01):"
"Subject: Landing of large numbers of illegal immigrants in the Canary Islands What measures does the Council intend to put forward to guarantee the integrity of Community waters around the Canary Islands, given the recent reports that motherships are being used to land large numbers of illegal immigrants from Africa on the Canaries?"
"Mr President, the Council has already responded, on several occasions, to the questions from Members of the European Parliament on illegal immigration by sea from the African continent."
"In particular, I refer to the answers to oral questions H-2701, H-0330/01 and H-0699/01 on illegal immigration in the European Union, and to the answers to written questions E-0085/01 and E-1045/01, which also tackled these problems."
"The Council has already taken several measures to combat illegal immigration."
"The action plans that have been drawn up for the countries and regions producing illegal immigrants and/or asylum seekers, within the framework of the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group, is a good example of one such measure."
"Another example is that of the rapid alert system that was developed within the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration (Cirefi)."
"Measures to improve the effectiveness of checks by Member States at maritime borders were launched as part of cooperation under the Schengen Agreement."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, these measures are now part of the Community acquis."
"Of course, Member States are responsible for performing these checks, and the surveillance of and checks on territorial waters are therefore a matter of their competence."
"The Council also stresses that the preparatory bodies are currently looking into introducing a good practice guide, the aim of which is to assist Member States in carrying out these checks."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the Presidency of the Council will realise that I am not satisfied by references to mere written declarations."
"The current situation in the Canary Islands amounts to a genuine invasion."
"Approximately one hundred people are arriving every week and, furthermore, we are sending them to the rest of the Community."
"A week ago, the Mayor of the city of Las Palmas in Gran Canaria sent two hundred immigrants to Madrid with one-way tickets."
"If the European Union does not look after this border, I can assure you that we will have a real invasion, which is going to change all the parameters."
"Perhaps my supplementary question should be, in relation to certain replies I received yesterday from Commissioner Vitorino on the Commission' s new proposals, whether the Council is considering those Commission proposals on the control of external borders, on immigration agreements with neighbouring countries and on the return of illegal immigrants in the EU to the countries of origin."
"Mr President, I can understand that you feel the answer that I have given on behalf of the Council may be insufficient in terms of a situation that gives you cause for concern and which you feel is extremely important."
"As I have just said, I can only refer to the competence of Member States regarding decisions taken at Community level."
"It is up to Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, to implement the necessary measures that were drawn up within the context of the Community."
"Question No 5 by , which has been taken over by Mr Ortuondo Larrea (H-0783/01):"
"Subject: Reference to nationalism in the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 21 September 2001 Following the horrific terrorist attacks which took place on 11 September and their tragic consequences, people in the United States reacted strongly, with clear expressions of nationalism or patriotism based on the democratic and moral values which underpin North American society."
"It was out of a similar form of democratic nationalism that most of the current Member States of the European Union were born in the face of despotic power."
"The fact that certain European states acted in a violent and imperialistic manner and were thus the cause of the tragic wars which have marked Europe's history should in no way detract from the peaceful aspirations which characterise the democratic nationalism to be found in most European countries."
"It is therefore surprising to note that, in the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 21 September 2001, which was held in response to the terrorist attacks against US citizens, the term 'nationalism' is once more used indiscriminately as being equivalent to racism and xenophobia."
"This is quite clearly offensive to all those Europeans who see themselves as peaceful, democratic and caring members of a nation and part of a national culture, as well as members of the European and world community."
"Does the Council not agree that it is manifestly unfair to link nationalism with racism and xenophobia in such an indiscriminate manner?"
"The Council would reiterate that it is not up to the Council to comment on the conclusions of the European Council."
"In this case, it is also beneficial to highlight that, in its conclusions of 21 September 2001, the European Council emphasises the need to combat any nationalist, racist or xenophobic drift."
"I shall stress this - any nationalist drift, which is not the same thing as nationalism."
"The term 'nationalism' does not actually appear in the text."
"The only terms that appear are 'drifts, abuses, in nationalist, racist or xenophobic terms' ."
"And in this respect, I do not believe that the position taken by the Council does contradict the position that you expressed in your question."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the European Council has been able to differentiate between Arab and Muslim religion and society, on the one hand, and fanatical Islamic terrorist groups on the other."
"However, in its conclusions of 21 September, the European Council expresses the need, as you have said, to combat any nationalist tendency, as if to be nationalist were a crime in itself or an attack on human rights."
"Does the Council not agree that to stress the need to combat peaceful nationalism, which defends the universal right to free self-determination, something which the United Nations approved, by exclusively democratic means, could be seen as a display of intolerance and fascism on the part of the governments of the European Union?"
"While it is true that there are radical nationalist groups, which support terrorism, there are also violent groups with unionist or environmentalist ideologies which also commit violent acts."
"Does the Council therefore believe that we should combat British unionism or environmentalism, for example, in all its forms?"
"Would it not be better to show prudence and democratic respect whenever we refer to nationalism, unionism, environmentalism or any other ideology?"
"I confirm what I just said. There is no reference to nationalism being a non-democratic movement in itself."
"There are references here to abuses and drifts, be they racist, xenophobic, exclusionist, but nationalism in itself is not referred to as something that generates these drifts."
"On the other hand, nationalism can sometimes be used for much more extremist purposes which should be condemned outright."
"This is also the case in the area of political action, where democratic political actions benefit democracy as a whole and the freedom of expression."
"Each time there are drifts, however, they are dangerous and they must be stamped out."
"I am grateful for the President-in-Office of the Council's last remarks."
"I belong to a national movement in my own country, Scotland, which over the last 100 years has produced great constitutional change without a single drop of human blood being shed or a single act of violence occurring."
"There are other places, as she knows, where similar constitutional changes have taken place and are continuing."
"The Council and the President-in-Office of the Council are perhaps wilfully missing the point in Mr Nogueira Román's question."
"It is a great mistake to say that there are some ends that tend to attract terrorism and therefore to attack those ends in themselves."
"The truth is that a terrorist is someone who thinks that an end justifies any means."
"It is absurd to believe that if the end is noble any means can be justified."
"Those who believe that, make whatever end they seek ignoble."
"I wish the Council would be less selective in its attitude to such questions."
"I share your point of view and I would also like to reiterate that, given the debate we have just had on the international situation, in regard to nationalism, as I said, or in other areas, and I shall use the example of religion, which is particularly topical in terms of current events in Afghanistan, the Council clearly believes that religion forms part of one' s private life, is a matter of individual choice."
"I shall take Islam as an example."
"Islam has nothing to do with the scandalous and abusive way that it has been treated by terrorists who use it in a way that borders on the disgraceful and to achieve vastly different goals."
"I can only repeat, in answer to your question, the Council' s belief is that, in Europe and throughout the world, we must also respect a democratic Islam, which, in fact, belongs to the sphere of one' s private life, or which is expressed in a legitimate way, but also to combat any form of religious expression which pursues any other scandalously repressive goal."
"Just to clarify the comments by my honourable colleague, Mr MacCormick, it was, in fact, the 1997 election of a Labour government which delivered the historic Scottish parliament that was democratically elected in 1999."
"If it had not been for that Labour government we would not have a Scottish parliament."
"I would remind Members that this is exclusively a Question Time."
"These clarifications can be made later outside the chamber."
"Question No 6 by (H-0784/01):"
"Subject: Illegal immigration into Greece from Turkey - breach of accession partnership There has been an enormous upsurge in illegal immigration into Greece from Turkey, with thousands of clandestine immigrants reaching Greek shores aboard Turkish smugglers' boats."
"The Turkish authorities make no attempt to prevent such immigration, which is in breach of the accession partnership, while the measures taken by the Greek authorities are inadequate to stem the constant flood of illegal immigrants on to Greek territory and, by extension, into the EU."
"Bearing in mind the climate of insecurity created by uncontrolled immigration into the EU, which was intensified by the terrorist attacks in the USA, what is the Council's position on the flow of illegal immigrants from Turkey?"
"What measures will the Council take in regard to Turkey as an applicant for EU accession, pursuant to the conditions laid down in the accession partnership concerning the prevention of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border management with a view to the adoption of the Schengen acquis, in order to prevent illegal immigrants entering Greece and to guarantee the security of the EU's borders?"
"In response to Mr Trakatellis' question, the Council has often expressed its concern regarding illegal immigration and also refers in this connection to the conclusions of the Tampere, Santa Maria de Feira and Nice European Councils, for example."
"Regarding the measures that it has taken and is continuing to take in this area, the Council kindly asks you to refer to the answers that have already been given to numerous questions submitted by Members of the European Parliament on illegal immigration."
"The Council reiterates that the Helsinki European Council decided to consider Turkey as a candidate country which aims to join the European Union on the basis of the same criteria as those that are applied to the other candidate countries."
"The Helsinki European Council stated that, and I quote, 'with a view to intensifying the harmonisation of Turkey' s legislation and practice with the acquis, the Commission is invited to prepare a process of analytical examination of the acquis' ."
"In accordance with the conclusions of the Feira European Council, the Commission will report back to the Council on the progress made in preparing the analytical examination of the acquis with Turkey."
"The Council formally adopted the accession partnership with Turkey on 8 March 2000."
"Under this accession partnership, Turkey adopted a national programme for adopting the acquis, which sets out the framework for the policy to be pursued and the timetable of legislative work, as well as the budgetary and administrative requirements that are necessary in order for Turkey to adopt the Community acquis."
"In line with the practice established for all candidate countries, the Commission will assess Turkey' s national programme for adopting the acquis in the 2001 regular report on the basis of the accession partnership."
"The European Union will closely monitor the implementation of the various measures announced as part of this framework."
"The national programme on the acquis contains various measures in the area of justice and home affairs."
"The main objectives on which progress was made during 2001 include the strengthening of border checks, the harmonisation of legislation and practices concerning visas with the European Union acquis, and, lastly, the adoption of the acquis in the area of immigration in order to prevent illegal immigration."
"The Council again stated its concern given the enormous influx of illegal immigrants from Turkey into Greece or transiting through Greece."
"The European Union asked Turkey to implement appropriate measures as laid out in the European Union report of November 2000."
"The EU is also keen to help Turkey financially in pursuing the implementation of the recommended approach, in line with the accession partnership."
"In this respect, the Council noted with interest Turkey' s intention to waive, in the medium term, the geographical proviso formulated with regard to the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees."
"The Council also engaged in active dialogue with countries that produce asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants within the framework of the High Level Asylum and Immigration group."
"As I said earlier in my reply to the question by another Member regarding the Canary Islands, this group, set up by the Council in December 1998, has the task of drawing up action plans for specific countries."
"In order to draw up these action plans, the group adopted a global, trans-pillar approach, taking into account aspects relating to foreign policy, economic development and also the management of migratory flows."
"One of the countries chosen for this action plan is Iraq, since it is a country that produces immigrants and which immigrants transit through."
"Because of its geographical situation, Turkey is obviously an important country of transit."
"As part of the action plan for Iraq, the Council has already launched a dialogue with Turkey in order to implement the European Union action plan concerning Iraq of 26 January 1998."
"One of the measures under the action plan is to negotiate a transit agreement with Turkey."
"I welcome the Council's lengthy reply but I still have two questions."
"As the Prime Minister of Greece, Mr Simitis, has said, we are working on an assumption of 260 000 illegal immigrants this year."
"Tell me, if you can, how two hundred and sixty thousand illegal immigrants can possibly pass through Turkey unnoticed?"
"This being so, exactly what action has the Council taken with respect to Turkey, with its candidate status and partnership agreement, to make it improve its border patrols and prevent these huge numbers of illegal immigrants?"
"Secondly, and more importantly, what exactly does the Council have in mind?"
"Is it in a position to design a joined-up policy to ensure that this matter is resolved satisfactorily and that borders and illegal immigration are safely controlled?"
"Of course, political asylum seekers are seeking political asylum, but there still has to be some form of control."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to confirm what I just said regarding the Council' s action to effectively implement the things that were decided on as part of the Turkish action plan."
"Furthermore, with regard to the more general question of migration, I acknowledge and the Council also freely acknowledges that, due to its geographical situation, Turkey is a country in a peculiar situation."
"And now, we are all acquainted with the consequences of this situation that you have highlighted."
"I would like to point out that, under the Belgian Presidency, we have in fact organised, for the first time, a conference, held in Brussels some weeks ago, on the issue of migration."
"This was a European Conference which was held as part of a necessary investigation into the issue of migratory movements."
"I think that this debate must run its course, and the Belgian Presidency wanted to launch this, independently of any decisions taken with regard to Turkey or Iraq, as part of the discussions that Europe is holding with both Turkey under the statute that was conferred upon it, and with non-European and non-candidate countries, to attempt to better manage the problems related to these migratory fluctuations."
"The point I should like to make to the Minister is that there is a huge contradiction where Turkey is concerned."
"On the one hand, it allows huge numbers of migrants to pass through it and, on the other, a stream of political refugees from Turkey itself or from other countries but who are open to prosecution in Turkey, such as Iraqi Kurds who might be prosecuted for their activities in Turkey, is turning up in Greece."
"How can these two things be reconciled?"
"By which I mean making Turkey stop, with the possible refoulement of immigrants entering the Community illegally via Greece, while at the same time protecting all those seeking political asylum, given that Turkey is a country which practises the death penalty and, as we saw in the Commission's progress report yesterday, a country in which democracy is sorely lacking?"
"The President-in-Office of the Council does not consider it appropriate to reply to the following question."
"She probably considers it not to be a question but rather a declaration by the Member."
"It is up to the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Question No 7 by (H-0788/01):"
"Subject: Statements by Mr Berlusconi Recently, the Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Berlusconi, made statements which essentially put the mass demonstrations calling for a different kind of globalisation on a par with terrorism."
"He also proceeded to make a number of comparisons and judgments about Western and Islamic civilisation which betrayed an ignorance of history and which the President-in-Office of the Council, the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr Michel, described as barbaric, absurd and untrue."
"In view of the fact that Mr Berlusconi's statements are totally contrary to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, as signed and proclaimed by the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the European Council meeting in Nice on 7 December 2000, can the Council state its official and collective position on this matter?"
"Mr President, it is, of course, not up to the Council to comment on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi."
"The Council would like to reiterate the terms used by the European Council in its conclusions, at the outcome of the extraordinary meeting held in Brussels on 21 September."
"The European Council, issuing an appeal to the international community to pursue, in all multilateral fora, dialogue and negotiation with a view to building, in Europe and elsewhere, a world of peace, law and tolerance, also emphasised the need to combat any racist and xenophobic drift and to reject any equation of terrorism with the Arab or Muslim world."
"From this perspective, there is no doubt that the official and concerted position, which you have been hoping and praying for, was already taken by the Council at its sitting of 21 September."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, my question touched on two issues."
"First, Mr Berlusconi's views, if I may call them such, on Arabs and Islam."
"It seems to me from what you have read out that the Council begs to differ from, not to say condemns these views."
"And that is good news."
"But I asked you a second question, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"In his statements, Mr Berlusconi equated the huge demonstrations being held all over the world, in both Europe and America, by people who believe that globalisation could take a different form and a different direction, with terrorism."
"In other words, he equated these demonstrations with terrorism."
"What is the Council's view on this issue, which is an extremely important issue and one which will no doubt crop up again in the future?"
"Mr President, I would like to reiterate that it is not for the Council to comment on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi and others, not only on the aspects related to Islam or any other equation of terrorism with the Arab world, but also on issues related to globalisation."
"I stand by the actions and the positions of the Council, which were adopted on 21 September and which I believe give a clear indication of the European Council' s point of view, regarding its determination to reject any equation of this sort."
"It is not for the Council to comment or issue an opinion on the statements made by Mr Berlusconi either."
"Question No 8 by (H-0791/01):"
"Subject: Inclusion of additional data on new EU identity cards The recent terrorist attacks in the USA have given rise to intense debate over whether more detailed information about an individual's characteristics and origin should be included on identity cards in the Member States of the Union."
"The Greek press reports that this issue will be discussed early next December in Brussels at the meeting of the Ministers of Justice, Internal Affairs and Public Order of the 15 Member States of the EU."
"Will the Council therefore say whether the deliberations which take place between those Ministers will also cover the following additional data to define more clearly the identity of European citizens and, in more general terms, EU residents: fingerprints, colour of eyes and hair, height, weight, blood group and subgroup, visible scars and other physical distinguishing features, hair growth, disabilities, nationality, place of birth, religion, family status, occupation, and academic qualifications."
"I would request a specific answer for each of the above mentioned points."
"Will the deliberations also cover the possibility of adding further characteristics to existing passports in all the UN Member States and, if so, which characteristics?"
"I would like to thank you for asking this question, as it gives the Council the opportunity to clear up what is obviously a huge misunderstanding on the part of the Greek press."
"At an extraordinary session on 20 September 2001, organised in response to the events of 11 September, the Justice, Home Affairs and Civil Protection Council held a wide debate on measures to be taken as part of the fight against international terrorism."
"It is true that the Council discussed including bio data, but only on visas to be issued to third country nationals."
"As a follow-up to this debate, the Commission recently asked the Council to submit a proposal for a regulation to enhance the security of this category of visas, by including a digital photograph on these, so that we can ensure that the passport holder really is the person to whom the document was issued."
"The Council would very much appreciate Parliament' s issuing an opinion on this new proposal as soon as possible."
"Lastly, you are almost certainly aware that identity cards of Member States' nationals are an area that falls within the exclusive remit of each of the Member States."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her extremely clear reply to my question."
"She has confirmed that the Council is discussing the inclusion of other information on passports or visas, such as a digital photograph, an extremely important element, and additional biometric data."
"Could you perhaps be more specific, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as regards what additional information you are discussing. Will it include biometric information other than a fingerprint and will it also include the person's religion?"
"This issue is of particular interest to Greece."
"I should also like to ask why you only plan to request information on the identity of third country nationals and not European Union nationals. As far as I know, the European Union has its share of terrorists, for example in Spain and Greece."
"Should we not be making it easier for European police forces to locate European terrorists?"
"I obviously wanted to be sure that the answer I gave was accurate."
"In fact, this does not only concern visas and, with respect to the data provided, this only regards digital fingerprinting."
"I can today reassure you on the issue of religion, for example."
"I think that it is important for Parliament, as I suggested, to issue an opinion on this proposal as soon as possible so that we can then forge ahead."
"But I can reassure you that we do not mean digital fingerprinting."
"Question No 9 by (H-0795/01):"
"Subject: Age discrimination Does the Council propose to change its current policy of discriminating against job applicants aged 45 and over in the light of the European Ombudsman's current investigation into whether such age discrimination amounts to maladministration?"
"The Council does not consider that setting an age limit of 45 years for the recruitment of civil servants at the starting grade constitutes discrimination in itself, because the difference in treatment established by this limit, on the one hand, is in line with the Treaty on establishing the European Community as well as the civil servants' statute and, on the other, is based on objective reasons, particularly relating to the concept of a career, which is at the heart of Community work."
"This consideration was twice brought to the attention of the European Ombudsman."
"We must also emphasise that the age limit is raised systematically, and up to a maximum of six years, in order to take into account family commitments, such as bringing up children, military service or physical handicap."
"The age limit is also raised in some other cases, in order to meet specific recruitment requirements due to the staff needs or the new requirements of an institution."
"This was the case, for example, for the recruitment of Nordic language translators and this also happened more recently for posts advertised for political and military staff."
"The Council' s General Secretariat would not deprive itself of the experience of an older candidate if this experience was indispensable, but it must also ensure that younger staff are recruited to fulfil the permanent tasks of the institution, such as translation or administration."
"Lastly, you drew attention to the fact that the process to undertake administrative reform and strengthen inter-institutional cooperation that is underway intends to establish an inter-institutional recruitment office."
"The question regarding age limit has not been touched upon during the preparatory work carried out to establish this office."
"The issue is also likely to be raised when reviewing the proposals on the reform of the statute, on which the Council, in its role of legislator, will be asked to comment."
"Whilst we await the results of this work, which should enable common rules for all the institutions to be drawn up, it does not seem appropriate to change the current practice used by the Council' s General Secretariat in the recruitment of civil servants at the starting grade of a career."
"The practice appears to be in line with the rules of law and is also in the interests of the institution."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply."
"I was alerted to this issue of age discrimination in the Council at our previous part-session when I was asked what I thought."
"My immediate reaction was that, while on the one hand we are trying to encourage fairer treatment of older workers, yet, on the other hand, in one of our own EU institutions - and from what the minister said in more than one - we are discriminating against those aged 45 and over."
"It is a sad state of affairs when those aged 45 are not considered for employment."
"What talent, knowledge and experience is lost because of this!"
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council what measures are being taken to treat all job applications equally?"
"It was interesting to hear about the inter-institutional recruitment office."
"What is the time-scale for its creation and what common rules will all institutions have?"
"I just wish to clarify something you said."
"The base age has been raised by six years."
"Does that mean it has been raised to 51 or has 39 been raised to 45?"
"Mr President, I just wanted to answer one of the specific supplementary questions that were asked."
"The limit is effectively set at 45 years, and it is not possible to recruit anyone over 51 years of age."
"Therefore this is a specific answer to one of the specific questions that I was asked as a result."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 10 and 11 will be taken together."
"Question No 10 by (H-0796/01):"
"Subject: Specific measures to provide refuge and support for the Afghan population Given the current situation and the risk of a full blown humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan, what effective action and measures is the Council going to take to prevent hundreds of thousands of women and innocent people being made the victims of indiscriminate violence or of cold and hunger?"
"Will the Council be opening humanitarian corridors and seeking political solutions?"
"Question No 11 by (H-0825/01):"
"Subject: Wave of Afghan refugees at the gates of Europe For a number of years, Turkey has been one of the main points of entry into Europe for economic migrants and political refugees."
"Following the terrorist attack in the USA, Afghans seeking shelter from the brutal Taliban regime and, above all, from the war, now make up the bulk of refugees on the move."
"Reliable sources report that tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are preparing to make the crossing from Turkey to Greece and Italy."
"In the Council's view, what is the status of the Afghan refugees?"
"Are they entitled to political asylum? Is a quota system being considered to accommodate them in European countries?"
"Is there any form of cooperation with the Turkish authorities?"
"What view does the Council take of the conditions in which they are 'housed' in Italy and Greece (immigrant reception centres, etc.)? What measures can the Council take in cooperation with the Greek and Italian authorities?"
"Mr President, as it has indicated in previous answers on the same subject, the Council fully shares your concerns regarding the humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan."
"At its session on 8 and 9 October 2001, the Council reaffirmed that the European Union and its Member States are doing everything possible in order to avoid a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and in the neighbouring countries, which must be organised in close collaboration with the HCR and other specialised agencies, the International Red Cross Committee, the United States, neighbouring countries and other partners from multinational organisations."
"On this occasion, the Council reiterated that, faced with the humanitarian crisis, the Community and its Member States have already released EUR 316 million."
"The Council warmly welcomed the first steps taken by the Commission to assist refugees and has invited the Commission to present further measures as soon as possible."
"In this respect, I would like to stress that the reserve for urgent aid, which amounts to EUR 25 million, to be used for humanitarian aid to help the Afghan people, was already approved at a budgetary tripartite meeting on 15 October."
"Furthermore, the Council restated the European Union' s determination to support, when required, a political process launched in Afghanistan, with the support of the United Nations, and to contribute to the reconstruction, modernisation, development and opening up of the country."
"Current events confirm the need for us to work towards this."
"The Council is in favour of opening humanitarian corridors but it stresses that this requires the cooperation of the forces in control of the situation on the ground."
"In this context, the Council deeply regrets that the Taliban regime has, on several occasions, obstructed the delivery of humanitarian aid, harassed NGOs, destroyed humanitarian buildings, refused to cooperate with international institutions and, very recently, demanded that convoys, trying to deliver humanitarian aid to the needy Afghan people, pay road tolls."
"Given the current situation in Afghanistan, it is obviously difficult to ensure that any measure can be totally efficient."
"However, you will no doubt be aware that the European Union, whilst fully supportive of the efforts undertaken to eradicate terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 September, is taking an active part in the humanitarian operation designed to assist the displaced people in the region."
"The position of the Council, when faced with such situations, has always been to work to keep displaced populations within the neighbouring regions, in order to facilitate their return, as soon as circumstances allow."
"I would reiterate that, on 20 July 2001, the Council adopted a directive on the temporary protection, on the territory of Member States, of displaced persons in the event of a massive influx."
"Since this directive will not be applied until December 2002, the Commission stated, at the Council meeting of 27 and 28 September, that it was willing to investigate how the rules specified under this directive could be applied, if necessary, before this date."
"From this perspective, the Commission has recently requested Member States to provide, on a fortnightly basis to Eurostat, statistical data on asylum requests and illegal entries of Afghan citizens."
"The Council does not have any information on the conditions in reception centres."
"And, in relation to this, I would like to say that the Council bodies are currently examining a proposal for a directive to set minimum standards for conditions in reception centres for asylum seekers in the Member States."
"Lastly, with regard to relations with Turkey, I reiterate that regular meetings take place between the Council bodies and Turkey, as part of the implementation of the action plan for Iraq drawn up by the High Level Asylum and Immigration Group, as I also explained in answer to a previous question."
"The next meeting is most likely to take place towards the end of November."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply."
"The serious problem we have is that all that European Union aid, those many millions of euros, is being channelled by means of Pakistan."
"Pakistan is the only country - together with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - which has been supporting the Taliban regime."
"It is a mistake to give the key to, and the administration of, the humanitarian aid to Pakistan."
"However, that is what is happening, and this political error is the reason why the aid is not reaching all the Afghan beneficiaries who should be receiving it."
"Madam President, now that Kabul has been taken, could you please change this so that European Union humanitarian aid is not channelled via Pakistan, as has been the case up to now. Let us not give the key and the administration to Pakistan, but let us do it directly so that it reaches the people of Afghanistan."
"I shall start by thanking the President-in-Office of the Council and the Belgian Presidency's entire team which, perhaps because it includes so many women, has given us some excellent replies."
"What you said about the provisions of the directive on a mass influx of displaced persons being applied before it is applied in the Member States was most interesting."
"Having said which, I should like to ask if, in cases such as that in Greece, where 700 people, mostly from Afghanistan and Iraqi Kurdistan, turned up in Zakynthos, Greece could apply the provisions of the directive, including making use of funds from the European Refugee Fund?"
"I would like to reiterate what I said in my first answer to the joint question regarding the early application of the directive."
"This obviously applies to all Member States."
"It is also from this perspective that we requested the statistical data to be provided to Eurostat on a regular basis, in order to be able to consider the early application of the directive due to the situation, which, at the time, could not be predicted."
"As for the other points, as far as the delivery of humanitarian aid is concerned, this is basically a matter for the Commission and, since this is the case, it is difficult for the Council to take a position on this subject."
"I shall take careful note of the comments regarding the aid deliveries."
"Question No 12 by (H-0797/01):"
"Subject: Death sentence for 16 Afghans for converting to another religion In Afghanistan, a prosecutor has brought 16 Afghans before a court in Kabul demanding that they be sentenced to death."
"They are being charged with conversion from Islam to Christianity, and the prosecutor is demanding the death penalty for all of them in accordance with the Taliban regime's Islamic laws."
"In a trial taking place at the same time in Kabul, eight aid workers with Shelter Now International have been charged with carrying out Christian missionary work."
"Here, too, the prosecution is calling for all of them to be sentenced to death in accordance with the country's Islamic laws."
"Germany, the USA and Australia are making diplomatic efforts to protect the eight aid workers' interests and ensure legal certainty."
"In a previous answer I received in the Chamber, the Commission stated that the three countries had said the European Union therefore does not need to become involved in the case."
"However, there have been no international diplomatic efforts, on the part either of individual countries or of the European Union, to assist the 16 Afghans who have been charged."
"Throughout the world, the European Union actively supports the abolition of the death penalty and religious freedom based on tolerance and respect for different beliefs."
"How is this reflected in the Council's actions in the case of the 16 Afghans who have changed religion?"
"What is the European Union doing, via the Council, to follow and monitor the trial of the 16 Afghans facing the death penalty in Kabul, and to influence its outcome, and what concrete steps have been taken to ensure that they enjoy legal certainty and protection and that their lives are spared?"
"The Council shares your concerns about the citizens of Afghanistan and foreign aid workers who are accused by the Taliban of religion conversion and preaching, and who are therefore facing the very serious threat of the death penalty."
"The position of the Council with regard to the death penalty is well known."
"The promotion and the respect of fundamental human rights, including the freedom of religion and belief, are an essential part of European Union policy on third countries and are, thus, included in the common position of the European Union on Afghanistan."
"The main international legal instruments ensure that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion."
"This right covers the freedom to change religion or belief and the freedom to express, alone or collectively, in public or in private, one' s religion or belief."
"The European Union has expressed its concerns regarding the human rights situation in Afghanistan on an international stage, particularly to the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, at which all EU Member States supported the draft resolution tabled by Italy on human rights violations in Afghanistan."
"Given that the EU Member States do not recognise the Taliban government, it is extremely difficult to communicate with them and to gain access to territories under their control."
"This was also the case before 11 September 2001."
"The bilateral diplomatic efforts to protect foreign aid workers, which have been made by diplomats from Germany, the United States and Australia from Islamabad, have not yet had any tangible results."
"Since military action began in Afghanistan on 7 October, it has become even more difficult, of course, to closely monitor the fate of the 16 Afghan citizens mentioned in the honourable Member' s question and to contribute to a political resolution of this matter."
"Believe me, this is something I regret, but you will also understand that the situation is now even more difficult to assess than before."
"I would thank the Belgian Presidency most sincerely for that answer."
"It was characterised by commitment and a genuine desire to do its best for these people."
"Kabul has fallen."
"The Taliban regime is fleeing."
"Afghanistan faces a new future."
"In that scenario, I really want you in the Belgian Presidency to do everything you can to obtain information about these 16 Afghans who are threatened by the death penalty."
"Are they still there in Kabul?"
"Have they been taken to Kandahar?"
"Can we rescue them?"
"What has happened to the eight aid workers from Shelter Now International?"
"I should be extremely glad if the Belgian Presidency were able to report here in Parliament that all 24 of these people had been found and were free and alive."
"It is my wish that you in the Belgian Presidency should do everything you can."
"There are new opportunities now that Kabul has been opened up."
"I would ask you if you believe you can obtain some information before the end of the year."
"As the author is not present, Question No 13 lapses."
"Question No 14 by (H-0806/01):"
"Subject: Priorities in the fisheries sector during the second half of the Belgian Presidency Will the Council, under the Belgian Presidency, outline its priorities for the fisheries sector during the second half of its term of office, taking into account the particular and unique requirements of peripheral countries such as Ireland which has 11% of Community waters in its jurisdiction but only 4% of Community quotas?"
"The Council refers you to the answer that it has already given to the same question asked at the September session of Question Time. The answer deals with the presidency' s intentions regarding the timetable of the Council debate on the Commission' s Green Paper, the extension of the multiannual guidance programmes and the rebuilding of those stocks at risk, as well as touching upon the issue of the redeployment of the fishing fleet and of fishermen who were dependent upon the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her response, even though it was very short and curt."
"Would the President-in-Office of the Council agree that fisheries are important to peripheral maritime areas throughout the Union where there is no alternative source of employment?"
"Would she also accept that in my country, Ireland, the fishing industry has not benefited to any great extent from its membership of the European Union, because the most prolific fishing grounds within a reasonable limit of our coast are being plundered by greedy maritime states within the Union."
"Would she, during her term of office between now and the end of the year, investigate what could be done for areas right around the Irish coast, including my own area in the west of Ireland, which once had prolific fishing grounds that have certainly not been plundered by our small inshore fleet?"
"Would she also accept that regional development policies and fisheries policies should not be looked at in isolation, but in tandem?"
"The Council has given an answer to this question on several previous occasions."
"Of course, I understand the importance and relevance of this issue from Mr Gallagher' s point of view, but other than that, I stand by what I have said, and also reiterate that the Council had already stated its intentions regarding extensions, annual programmes, rebuilding stocks and the redeployment of fishing fleets and fishermen."
"I can, therefore, only confirm the previous answers given by the Council to this question, whilst I clearly understand that this issue is a particular concern to Mr Gallagher."
"Mr President, you did not give the Belgian Presidency the opportunity to reply to my follow-up question subsequent to my Question No 12."
"Normally a follow-up question is answered, and a follow-up question to Question No 14 has just now been answered."
"I thought it was rather impolite not to give the Belgian Presidency the opportunity to answer."
"Mr Sacrédeus, Mrs Durant, the President-in-Office of the Council, has declined to reply to the question in some cases because she considered that she had already answered it, but I will communicate your request to Mrs Durant in any case."
"It is up to Mrs Durant to consider whether it is a question or whether it has already been answered."
"In any event, Mrs Durant, if you have any message for the Member, or any reply, you have the floor."
"I would simply like to confirm, Mr President, that, as I said in my detailed answer to your question regarding these 16 individuals, I obviously hope, as does everyone in the House, that these people can be spared."
"That goes without saying."
"And that, as far as possible, during our bilateral contacts, given the difficulty of the current situation, even if, perhaps, it gives rise to something positive, since, in the last 24 hours, we have witnessed the liberation of Kabul, and possibly of Kandahar, and the retreat by the Taliban, I sincerely hope that everything can be done to identify these people and to save their lives."
"However, I cannot commit to taking specific and particular measures here and now."
"In any case, bear in mind that everything that can be done will be done, but today, the situation on the ground in Afghanistan is extremely complicated."
"In my question on a point of order, what specifically I pointed out was that, in my follow-up question, I had indicated that a whole new situation had arisen in Afghanistan and Kabul now that the Taliban regime had fled the capital."
"The situation was different when this question was put to the Belgian Presidency a month ago and when the Belgian Presidency prepared its answer."
"A new opening exists."
"I would therefore thank the Belgian Presidency for the follow-up answer it has given me, to the effect that it will take action on the new situation in Afghanistan."
"Question No 15 by (H-0807/01):"
"Subject: Revision of the common position on Cuba On 11 July 2001 I asked the Council whether it intended to revise the EU's common position on its relations with Cuba."
"On 5 September I received a detailed and satisfactory written answer."
"I also welcome the Belgian Presidency's initiative aimed at resuming the dialogue with Cuba, a country which has shown a strong interest in cooperating with Europe and counts the EU Member States as its main economic partners. Now that the President-in-Office of the Council has visited Havana and conveyed his impressions to the Council, I should like to raise the matter once again."
"Does it not appear anachronistic and out-of-place that Cuba should be the only Latin American country with which the European Union has not signed any kind of cooperation agreement, largely owing to the EU's current 'common position' on Cuba?"
"Does or does not the Council consider that the time has come to revise and update that common position, which does not reflect the stance taken by each of the Member States towards Cuba, and the text of which appears obsolete, in addition to the fact that it has not had any effect in the direction which its supporters claimed to have expected?"
"Is it correct that, in the current debate within the Council on the revision of the EU's common position on Cuba, there is one national government which is fundamentally opposed to any such revision, thus effectively blocking an updating which is in our view right, urgent and vital?"
"Once again, this honourable Assembly is inviting the presidency of the Council to discuss relations between Cuba and the European Union."
"I therefore hope to seize this opportunity to reiterate several points, and perhaps to clear up some misunderstandings regarding these relations."
"The European Union' s common position on Cuba remains the basis of the European Union' s policy on this country."
"As laid down in the Treaty on European Union, common positions are an instrument of the EU' s common, foreign and security policy (see Article 12) and the decisions concerning the common foreign and security policy are taken unanimously (see Article 23)."
"At the ninth revision of the common position on Cuba on 25 June, the Council noted that the common position was still valid."
"The EU' s objectives regarding Cuba are as before: to encourage a process of peaceful transition towards democratic pluralism and the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"In parallel with this, the Council has always shown its willingness to maintain an open and constructive dialogue on all the issues of common interest."
"In June, the Council restated its intention to maintain this approach."
"It also showed a favourable opinion on establishing an open, political dialogue and on finding a future framework agreement on cooperation based on the respect of democratic principles, the principles of human rights and the rule of law."
"It is also in this spirit that an exploratory mission by the European Union' s troika, led by the deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Louis Michel, visited Havana on 23 and 24 August 2001."
"Moreover, at the ninth revision of the common position, the Council urged the European Commission to step up its efforts to cooperate, particularly with civil and non-governmental organisations in Cuba, to enable greater numbers of EU players on the ground to contribute more effectively in achieving the objectives of the common position."
"Furthermore, and as you yourself point out, the Member States of the European Union are Cuba' s main economic partners."
"However, we must remember that it was the Cuban authorities who broke off dialogue between the European Union and Cuba, when they cancelled the EU' s troika mission at Director-General level, virtually the day before it was due to take place, on 27 and 28 April 2000."
"It was also the Cuban authorities that, in May 2000, withdrew their request to sign up to the Cotonou agreement."
"In addition, and as the Council already noted at the ninth revision of the common position, there has so far been no firm indication that the Cuban government has had a change of policy and is moving towards achieving the objectives of the common position."
"The next meeting between the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs and the EU troika has been scheduled, at Cuba' s request, to run in parallel with the 55th UN General Assembly which is currently underway, and, at this moment in time, I am as yet unable to give you any details of this second meeting."
"Mr President, the Minister' s reply leads me to ask her whether she is aware that, a few weeks ago, a delegation from the European Parliament visited Cuba."
"During that visit, our colleagues spoke to the Cuban authorities, to the church, to NGOs and to the eleven resident Ambassadors of the countries of the Union."
"All of them, apart from one Ambassador, agreed that the common position is useless, because it does not contribute to the progress of the Cubans nor to the progress of relations between the European Union and Cuba."
"Therefore, the Minister, President-in-Office of the Council, must know that that common position has been surpassed, it is obsolete and an anachronism. It is unjust and scandalous that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which the European Union does not have any cooperation agreement, which puts it in a difficult position - in the disastrous situation it is in at the moment - in terms of helping with the reconstruction of what was destroyed by Hurricane Michelle."
"Mr President, as I said to you in my answer, I do believe that the recent visit by the European Union troika and the meeting, which is currently being held in parallel to the United Nations General Assembly, will certainly be of use to the Council' s work in this area."
"Nonetheless, I am committed to our will and our objectives which still aim to encourage a process of peaceful transition and above all to develop a dialogue, which is as frank, open and as constructive as it possibly can be, on all the issues of common interest."
"I can only confirm therefore the benefits of these bilateral relations and hope that they are able to be of use to the future positions of the Council."
"Thank you very much, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. Your reply was really very interesting."
"I was a member of the delegation referred to by Miguel Ángel Martínez and I was able to witness the fact that NGOs, Ambassadors and even the so-called dissidents in Cuba consider the common position to be of little use."
"I wanted to point out, Madam President, that if there are many Members here who feel the common position relating to Cuba is unjust, it is because, for example, we have a customs agreement with Turkey and we all know that Turkey does not comply with basic human rights."
"In fact, the Kurdish Member of Parliament, Leyla Zana, who was awarded the Sakharov Prize, is in prison, and a European delegation has not been able to visit her over recent days."
"We also have very special agreements with Morocco, another country which does not comply with human rights."
"What we are saying is that the common position relating to Cuba demands that the latter make changes before we reach a cooperation agreement and that is what seems unfair to us, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"We therefore always insist that this review - which is going to be at the last minute - should take account of the opinions of all these people in Cuba, and we also note that two different yardsticks are being used."
"Although it is not a question, Mrs Durant can make a comment if she considers it appropriate."
"Question No 16 by (H-0810/01):"
"Subject: Reversing depopulation in rural areas Has the Council, under the Belgian Presidency of the EU and in consultation with the forthcoming Spanish Presidency, considered the need for an active EU policy aimed at reversing depopulation in rural areas in the Member States, including Ireland, will it make a statement on the issues to be considered, including financial aspects, pilot projects, studies and involvement of relevant NGOs, and will it call on the Commission to publish a Communication on policies aimed at reversing depopulation in rural areas?"
"First of all, I would like to reiterate that, as part of the European regional policy and particularly in the current 2000-2006 programming period, there is the possibility of supporting economic and social redevelopment in Objective 2 rural areas, which have a population of less than 100 inhabitants per kilometre."
"The Council would also like to draw your attention to the fact that, following the Commission' s presentation of the second report on economic and social cohesion, representatives from the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament met last June, at the initiative of the Swedish Presidency of the Council, in Lycksele, in the north of Sweden, in order to share their experiences and discuss the future of depopulated zones, including rural areas, a matter on which the presidency that Belgium assumed this quarter, continues to work."
"The Council believes that the first thing we must do, at this stage, is to seek to use the full potential of the current regulations in order to combat depopulation and impoverishment of specific rural areas."
"This task is primarily down to the Member States, which should respect the criteria defined at Community level."
"Given that the Commission' s proposals for the future programming period are not expected until 2004, the Council believes that it is still too early to launch a new debate on the implementation of European Union policy for rural areas that are depopulated or becoming depopulated, which would extend beyond what is currently in force."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her reply."
"Does she agree that there is a need for greater coordination between national policies and those designed to achieve rural development objectives and that there should be more concentration on decentralisation and the creation of new employment opportunities in the regions?"
"What new action can now be taken to encourage and achieve this objective?"
"Will the President-in-Office of the Council ensure that this matter is placed on the agenda for further consideration by the Spanish Presidency?"
"I can only confirm what I have just said, in other words, that I believe, and the Council also believes, that the full potential of the current regulations must be exploited."
"Given that this concerns a Community framework in which specific actions must be taken by Member States, I am in favour of going further in using the current regulations, rather than prematurely engaging in another debate on the implementation of a policy for these areas."
"I think that the existing framework can be better exploited, not only at Community level, but also, and more importantly, at a lower level, in other words at the level of Member States which must strive to implement policies within the context of criteria defined at Community level."
"Question No 17 by (H-0814/01):"
"Subject: European citizenship, students and state benefits Has the Council considered the conclusions of the European Court of Justice handed down in its ruling of 20 September 2001 (following a case brought by a French student studying in Belgium who had been refused a minimum living allowance) which confirm that students living in a Member State other than their own are entitled to the same benefits as nationals of the host state and that the judgment was retroactive, and the immediate implications for all the Member States resulting from that judgment?"
"Judgment EC 184/99 that you mention, Mr Crowley, was only handed down on 20 September 2001."
"The Council has not yet had an opportunity to study the full implications of the issue and, as is standard practice, the Council will respect the judgment of the Court and will, of course, draw conclusions from this."
"In any case, it is up to the Member States to draw conclusions from the judgment."
"This is a rather short answer, but this is simply because the judgment has only very recently been handed down."
"I appreciate and understand the constraints which the President-in-Office of the Council has with this question."
"However, on a number of occasions in this House I have raised the issue with regard to, in particular, Erasmus students who have been treated differently in different Member States."
"One of the consequences of this judgment is that there will now be an obligation on all Member States to ensure that there is a common system available to give assistance to those students who are in Erasmus programmes or who are studying in full-time programmes in countries other than their own Member States."
"Therefore I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to bring up this matter immediately at the next Council meeting, if possible so that there will be no more delays, so that opportunities will no longer be denied to many students who have not benefited up to now, or whose parents have had to pay for them to study abroad; and so that these anomalies and inequalities will be removed in future."
"I can only take note of your formal and urgent request to bring up this issue and repeat that the Council will respect the judgment passed by the Court as soon as it has studied all the consequences and implications of this judgment."
"I shall, however, take note of the fact that you would like the Council to bring up this matter."
"I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether she can confirm my belief that European citizens are entitled to benefit from this decision, whether or not the Member States have put provisions in place to interpret the decision?"
"Am I correct in thinking that from the date the decision is made citizens are entitled to benefit from it?"
"At this stage, and because the Court handed down this judgment so recently, I do wish to stand by what I said, but I certainly understand the way you would like to interpret this judgment."
"I do hope that the Council will have time to study the implications of the judgment and to identify how far it is possible to confirm, invalidate or interpret the question you have asked."
"I therefore hope that the Council will be given the time it needs to examine the implications, and therefore the consequences of the judgment that the Court handed down in September."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"For information, I am referring to a previous Court decision which decided that, irrespective of whether a Member State had put implementing provisions in place arising from its decisions or the decisions of the Council or the Commission, citizens are entitled to benefit from those decisions."
"I am simply asking the President-in-Office of the Council if she can confirm that the outcome of this particular court decision means that citizens will benefit, whatever those benefits may be, from the date of the decision and that no Member State is entitled to seek to restrict that."
"As President for the sitting, I take note of your interpretation."
"It has been communicated to the Council."
"I shall take note of the points that you have put forward, but I stand by the answer that I have given."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 18 and 19 will be taken together."
"Question No 18 by (H-0816/01):"
"Subject: Sellafield and the threat of terrorist attacks The European Council, meeting on 21 September 2001 in the wake of the terrible events in the United States, declared that terrorism is a real challenge to the world and to Europe."
"It has moved to block the funding of terrorist organisations as a decisive aspect of meeting this challenge."
"What contingency plans has the Council considered to respond to the threat of attack by terrorists on nuclear installations in the EU, and, in particular, on the Sellafield plant, taking into account the totally unacceptable decision of the British Environment Secretary to give the go-ahead on 3 October 2001 for the opening of the MOX (mixed oxide) plant at Sellafield, formal approval of which had been delayed because of the falsification of records by BNFL?"
"Will it now use its good offices to urge the UK government to rescind its latest decision, will it call on the Commission to intervene in this matter, and does it accept that the only solution is the closure of the Sellafield plant?"
"Question No 19 by (H-0824/01):"
"Subject: Sellafield MOX Fuel Plant In the light of the UK government' s approval on 3 October 2001 of a new plutonium fuel facility at the Sellafield nuclear complex, will the Council state its position on this proposal, particularly with regard to the security aspects, given that there are worrying reports that such a facility will increase the global trade in plutonium, that such trade will increase the threat to global security, that transportation of 'weapons usable' material makes it vulnerable to terrorists and that the atrocity of 11 September raises the risk that Sellafield could be targeted by terrorists, with catastrophic results for the populations of the UK, Ireland and globally."
"The £470m MOX Plant, built five years ago by the state-owned British Nuclear Fuels plc but not yet operational, has yet to establish that the economic benefits of such a plant outweigh the health and environmental detriments, as it is required to do under EU law."
"At the extraordinary session of 21 September, the Council decided that the fight against terrorism will, now more than ever, be a strategic priority of the European Union."
"It is clear from the many meetings that the various Council formations and the European Council have held and will hold on this issue under the Belgian Presidency that the Council attaches a great deal of importance to this fight."
"From this point of view, we should also reiterate the European Union, in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council meetings of 8 and 9 October 2001, reaffirms its commitment to non-proliferation and disarmament."
"More specifically, regarding the two questions that have been asked, the Council would like to draw attention to the fact that, overall, measures concerning the physical security of nuclear plants are an area of national competence."
"Quite aside from the specific circumstances that you mention, the Euratom Treaty specified safeguards of nuclear materials used for civil use in the European Union, in other words, all the measures that enable us to verify that nuclear materials and equipment are not used for anything other than the peaceful purposes for which they are intended."
"It is up to the Commission to ensure that these provisions and the ensuing Community regulations are implemented, particularly Regulation No 3227/76 concerning the application of the provisions on Euratom safeguards."
"The Euratom Safeguards Office has the specific task of verifying, by deploying inspectors if necessary, that the operators of nuclear power plants respect the security control obligations enshrined in the treaty, as well as those stipulated in Regulation No 3227/76."
"There are several legally binding instruments at international level, which the United Kingdom and the other Member States are party, such as the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material of 3 March 1980, several provisions of which cover, for example, the theft or other illicit means of obtaining nuclear materials, and which require other Member States that are contracting parties to cooperate and assist the party that is the victim of the crime."
"More generally, the Treaty on European Union contains provisions on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters among Member States, notably in Article 29."
"It is on this basis that the Council is currently examining a proposal for a Council framework decision on the fight against terrorism."
"This proposal includes provisions drawing up - a list of terrorist offences in Article 3, a list of minimum sentences and penalties in Article 5, as well as provisions on extradition and prosecution in Article 11 and cooperation between Member States in Article 12."
"I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her lengthy reply, much of which I have heard before."
"Is the President-in-Office of the Council aware that British Nuclear Fuels is technically insolvent?"
"Is she aware that its liabilities for cleaning up after the closure of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste run to GBP 34 billion, while it has GBP 235 million worth of shareholders' funds on its balance sheets?"
"Would she also agree, under those circumstances, that there is not the slightest economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant, let alone for seeking to expand its nuclear operations into the future, and that, indeed, the plant should be closed?"
"If the Commission would - as we have requested for years - have an independent nuclear inspectorate look into the Sellafield operation, they would have found this out some years ago."
"Perhaps they can find it out now."
"I would like to draw the President-in-Office of the Council's attention to the fact that she has not addressed the second part of my question relating to the fact that British Nuclear Fuels has not yet established the economic benefits of the MOX fuel plant, which it is obliged to do before it can commission it under existing EU regulations."
"I would also draw her attention to the report of Parliament's STOA Committee."
"This is a research committee which has commissioned an extensive report on both the Sellafield plant and Cap La Hague plants, and it has raised fairly serious concerns about the emissions to air and water from both the Cap La Hague and the Sellafield plants."
"It draws attention to the inadequacy of the Commission's capacity to carry out its functions under the Euratom Treaty, and it has also drawn attention to a German study which has indicated that both the Cap La Hague and Sellafield plants have something like ten times the permitted dispersal-to-air of radioactive pollution."
"I would say in response that the work, the responsibilities that you expect in terms of control or arbitration are responsibilities that have been passed on to the Commission and I am not currently in a position to give you, on behalf of the Council, any details on these."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I have asked the President-in-Office of the Council if she would address the second part of my question, and she has not done so either in her first or second replies."
"The President-in-Office of the Council may judge whether she has sufficiently replied to the question."
"Mr President, the second point was in fact more of an observation that you made as part of your question."
"However, with regard to this comment, I can only repeat that these details are more of a matter for the Commission than the Council, as far as, for example, conformity to Community legislation is concerned."
"As the author is not present, Question No 20 lapses."
"Question No 21 by (H-0820/01):"
"Subject: Dioxin rules threaten fish in the Baltic A Commission proposal on the limit values for dioxin in fish could be a death blow to the Swedish fishing industry."
"According to the Swedish Fisheries Board, the proposal would probably result in a total ban on the sale of salmon and eels from the Baltic."
"The sale of Baltic-caught herring and small Baltic herring for human consumption would also be at risk."
"In the worst case two or three thousand fishermen could lose their jobs."
"Sweden will be hardest hit as Finland and Denmark also have fishing grounds in the Atlantic."
"It is important not to act in too much haste in this matter."
"The Swedish view is that for the time being it would be better to provide dietary advice on how often fish may be eaten, combined with a vigorous campaign against the release of dioxins, than to set limit values."
"That was regarded as satisfactory in public health terms as the quantities of toxin are extraordinarily low and fish is an important source of nutrition."
"Could the Council adjust the Commission proposal to avoid the destruction of much of Sweden' s fishing industry?"
"The presidency of the Council is currently focusing all its efforts with a view to reaching a solution that gives a balanced compromise, which will enable us to guarantee the protection of public health, whilst avoiding creating the sort of economic disruption that you described."
"The presidency is thus in close contact with the Commission and members of the Council, so that this solution can be approved by the Council by the end of November 2001, during which time the Council is due to issue an opinion given that the Commission' s proposals were submitted at the end of August 2001."
"I would thank the Council of Ministers for its answer."
"I think it is extremely positive that an attempt is being made to reach a compromise."
"I intended to ask the Council of Ministers whether the compromise is based not upon absolute limit values but upon applying dietary recommendations in connection with the consumption of fish from the Baltic."
"Is it a compromise along those lines that is being considered?"
"I also want to emphasise that the opportunity to eat herring from the Baltic, including the variety indigenous to the Baltic, is not only an economic issue but also an important cultural issue."
"Prohibiting fish from the Baltic would be rather like prohibiting mussels and pommes frites in Belgium, something I imagine would be unthinkable."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would say that this is a question of an almost cultural nature."
"You may reply to it as you see fit, subject to the relevant consultations with the Council' s team."
"At this stage, it is difficult for me to clarify the subject of these recommendations."
"I can tell you, however, that if there were no chips in Belgium, this would, in my view, be a considerable national problem."
"It would, however, be of secondary importance in relation to the question that is of concern to you, but it is difficult for me to respond to this question at the moment, as it will relate to both the nature of the recommendations which will be made and also to finding the best possible compromise from an economic or any other point of view."
"As the author is not present, Question No 22 lapses."
"Question No 23 by (H-0838/01):"
"Subject: Belgian Presidency and the Regulation on models and designs Has the Belgian Presidency succeeded in convincing the Member State whose attitude was preventing the Regulation on models and designs from being adopted?"
"In response to your question, the Council would like to inform you that it noted, at the 27 September meeting of the Internal Market, Consumer and Tourism Council that there are no longer any barriers in the way of adopting the proposal for a regulation on the Community designs or models."
"The proposal is currently being finalised by the legal linguists and is scheduled to be formally adopted by the Council at the end of November, or at the beginning of December."
"I would first of all like to congratulate the Belgian Presidency on having managed to convince the Belgian government to withdraw the linguistic objections which, according to what was said earlier, were hindering the approval of the Regulation on models and designs."
"Furthermore, we are pleased that, again under the Belgian Presidency, this Regulation, which is so essential to the operation of the internal market, and also to the operation of the Office for the Harmonisation of the Internal Market in Alicante, can be approved immediately."
"It is not a question and therefore, unless the President-in-Office of the Council wishes to make any comment, we can end this Question Time by stating, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, that since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 24 to 27 will be replied to in writing."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 7.02 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Cross-border payments in euro"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0357/2001) by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on cross-border payments in euros [COM(2001) 439 - C5-0379/2001 - 2001/0174(COD)]"
"Mr President, in 1990, the Commission issued a Green Paper on payments, and that marked the beginning of talks with banks about cross-border payments, among other things."
"Initially, the banks expressed objections, with good reason, and we have worked for years to accommodate those objections."
"We now have an international bank account number, the IBAN, we have a bank identifier code, the BIC, the reporting requirements to the Central Bank have been lifted when amounts up to EUR 12 500 are involved, and that coincides with the permitted maximum of the money-laundering directive."
"There is a format to transfer payments fully automatically."
"To my disappointment, this resulted only in ever more expensive transfers."
"At the end of 2000, Mr Bolkestein and myself were in this plenary when the Commissioner promised on that occasion that he would take measures if nothing had changed in the first six months of this year."
"In July, the Commission and Parliament established, each following their own extensive inquiries, that nothing had changed."
"Quite the reverse, in fact: the situation had deteriorated."
"The Commissioner kept his promise and presented his Regulation, and I realise that the banks have simply missed two opportunities."
"In November 2000 and even in July of this year, there would have been enough time to set up a substantial self-regulation scheme, something which all parties would have preferred to this wrap over the knuckles."
"The European Banking Association has made a manful attempt to set up a cheap payment structure, step one followed by step two, for which they also received praise by the European Central Bank in its 2000 annual report."
"I would endorse this, but would at the same time express my astonishment about the fact that only a very small number of banks have joined the initiative."
"Much to the delight of Parliament, the Council in Ghent expressed its approval of the Regulation, and we hope that this will impact positively on the Internal Market Council."
"I will now turn my attention to the amendments."
"I am unable to support Amendment No 9 on self-regulation."
"As I have already stated, although we welcome the idea of self-regulation, the proposal should have been backed by all banks."
"It should be accompanied by monitoring, guarantees, sanctions, etc. However, the liberal amendment creates confusion about the date of entry into force and in strict legal terms, something like that cannot be provided for in this Regulation."
"The other new amendments are the result of the sound cooperation between Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for this sound cooperation."
"I now have high hopes for the Internal Market Council reaching agreement on 26 November, something which the Ghent Summit called for."
"The changes I would propose with regard to the Commission position are as follows."
"First of all, I have suggested changing the date of entry into effect from 1 January to 1 March, by which date all countries will have completed their transitional periods."
"Moreover, at this rate, we will not make 1 January with the notification in the Official Journal practically speaking."
"I would propose a few amendments, namely 10, 13 and 16 with regard to cheques."
"I do not want cheques to fall within the principle of equal costs as referred to in Article 3, because an increasing number of banks would actually like to do away with the cross-border cheque."
"Guarantees concerning cheques are very different in all countries."
"The cheque does remain within the scope of the transparency section of the Regulation, which is stipulated in Article 4."
"Another proposal for change concerns the obligation to communicate with the banking country by using the IBAN and BIC codes."
"Some banks, such as the Postbank and Internet banks, have their own codes and should not, therefore, be forced to use the IBAN and BIC codes."
"Finally, I should like to turn to Mrs Torres Marques' earlier amendment."
"Some Member States had difficulty coming to terms with yet another institution, and that was never our intention."
"We have solved the matter with a consideration for redress procedures and an article about sanctions, something which we happen to attach great importance to."
"I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein for his courage and for the fact that he kept his promise."
"His offices were always available for consultation, and all this could well result in this Regulation ending its march through the institutions on a positive note."
"Parliament is expected to provide broad support."
"Mr President, we have certainly had a packed agenda today."
"We have had research from Mr Caudron, we have voted on Mr Jarzembowski's report on port services and we have had shipbuilding courtesy of Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, but looking up at the people in the galleries I have to say that these may all have been important issues for the economy or for society, but in many cases it will have been nothing but gobbledegook to our listeners."
"This issue is different."
"Last summer in Austria I, myself, unintentionally parked illegally and felt dreadfully guilty."
"However, my bad conscience about this parking offence was very quickly eclipsed by concern about how much it would cost me to transfer the 200 Austrian schillings for this parking ticket from Germany to Austria."
"I therefore went straight to the Austrian authorities and paid in cash because I was afraid that the bank charges might be more than the actual fine."
"This is an experience familiar to many people."
"What is decisive, and this is something which we should also always bear in mind in this House, is how Europe measures up when people encounter it in their everyday lives, and in many of the areas on which we are working it proves to be far from perfect."
"On 1 January we will get the euro."
"There is a German word, 'begreifen', which means to understand, but which incorporates a notion of grasping or touching."
"The public will be able to touch the euro and that is why confidence in the euro will grow from that moment on."
"However, we must also make sure that all of the appropriate arrangements are in place so that the public are able to treat payments within Europe in the same way as payments within their own countries."
"That is why this regulation is incredibly important, and I very much regret the fact that the idea of it has only just occurred to the Commission."
"I drafted an opinion once before, nine months ago."
"At that time I was still being told by the Commission that there were steep mountain tracks between the banks, and I said that if money could be made with mountain tracks it would be."
"If money can be made with motorways then it will be."
"We need motorways in the banking sector too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank Mrs Peijs for her persistence and consistency, which have certainly paid off here."
"In 47 days the euro coins and notes will be available to everyone in the euro zone as a common currency, in my opinion, the greatest European Union project ever in terms of creating identity and fostering integration."
"The euro zone will be a domestic market within the internal market."
"We are all called upon to do all we can, not only in connection with cross-border payments, to bring down the barriers to the creation of this domestic financial market."
"The difference in cost between national and cross-border transfers in the domestic market stands in contradiction to our objectives."
"A Commission study has shown that although these charges have been steadily falling since 1993, even today, at some banks, people are still having to fork out up to EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 to another country in the EU."
"That is why this Commission proposal and the report are needed."
"Nevertheless, I wish to say on behalf of my group that we would welcome a genuine system of bank self-regulation, a system which is sustainable, comprehensive and credible."
"It is true that the proposals currently on the table are moving in the direction of a system of self-regulation of this kind, but we do not think that they go far enough."
"That is also why this report is being tabled here."
"Should a credible and sustainable system of self-regulation be forthcoming then we would be prepared to vote against the regulation at the next reading, which would allow the Commission not to implement its proposal for a regulation."
"However, we are waiting on the banks."
"The ball is in their court."
"We must adopt this approach because none of the measures taken so far have been sufficient."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of Mrs Torres Marques, who for pressing reasons cannot be here, but I shall keep to her ideas and the meaning of her speech."
"The European Parliament and especially its Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has for years been insisting on the need for banks to set up payment systems in the euro zone that would allow citizens to use the euro as if it were a national currency."
"Despite the existence of fixed exchange rates between the various currencies in the euro zone, cross-border payments are processed with the same charges as domestic payments."
"The citizens do not understand this: why are payments within the euro zone processed as if they were international payments?"
"Is there or is there not a euro payment zone?"
"The banks have perfected their credit and debit card and electronic purse payment systems at a national level, they have perfected their international operations, and they have forgotten about the euro area."
"Well, the euro zone is for us a region with a single currency which should have monetary rules in common that are easily understood by the citizens."
"It is just as well that when a recent Commission study revealed that, far from having fallen, transfer charges in the euro zone had remained high, it showed the need for the draft regulation that we are now examining. The regulation seeks, from January 2002, to equalise the charges for cross-border credit and debit card transfers that each bank performs in its own domestic market."
"The Commission proposes that the same should occur with bank transfers and cheques from January 2003 onwards."
"The Party of European Socialists agrees with the rapporteur' s proposals, and therefore this draft regulation deserves our approval; we also hope that an agreement can be reached with the Council at first reading."
"Implementation of the regulation must not, in any event, cause domestic charges to rise."
"In fact, cross-border transfers only represent 1% of the total payments made by the banks, and they are electronic payments which entail an effective reduction in staff costs for the banking system."
"Thus any use of this regulation to raise charges on domestic payments must be firmly rejected by the European institutions."
"The citizens have, in fact, already condemned and rejected it."
"Of the main amendments approved, we highlight the one concerning the penalties to be applied in the event of infringement of the regulation by any banking organisation, as well as an indication of the procedures to follow in other situations, so as to give some assurance to the citizens who use the euro."
"I believe that, with the approval of this regulation, Parliament will be contributing to a smooth launch of the new currency for the citizens, giving the euro greater credibility and strength, and easing the indispensable cultural and economic transition."
"We hope that, after the decision of the Ghent European Council, this legislation will be approved as quickly as possible."
"This political decision will be good for the euro zone, but most of all it will be good for the European Union."
"Mr President, sometimes in politics, we have to make a choice between something that is terrible and something that is unpleasant, and now is, in fact, one of those times."
"A solution to the problem of cross-border payments is now really in sight, and that is surely something to be welcomed."
"Partly thanks to the tenacity of this Parliament, an arrangement will be put in place, and I think that the name of our rapporteur will remain inextricably linked with this."
"Her tenacity has largely resulted in the current proposal to do something about this problem."
"Consumers and businesses must be able to rely on efficient, safe and cheap services in the field of cross-border payments in the internal market once the new currency has been introduced."
"After all, this euro offers the opportunity of bringing Europe truly closer to the citizen, as was stated a moment ago, and of making Europe tangible."
"That is why it must be possible to use this currency as European currency without obstructions or excessive costs."
"Not one citizen will understand why the remittance of euros from one country to another involves such high costs."
"The banks are responsible for this, for that is where the problem lies. But, needless to say, it is not those banks, but we as politicians, who ultimately get the blame."
"After all, we have launched the euro, so we are saddled with the problem."
"However, it is not just our problem, it is also the problem of the banks."
"In the first place, that is why the conversion must be as smooth as possible and it is therefore a good idea to concentrate all our efforts on that event."
"Banks must be able to give their full attention to the successful introduction of the euro notes and coins at the beginning of next year and after that, the euro zone can, in terms of payments, develop into one country with one market."
"In my view, the new amendments tabled by our rapporteur are particularly fitting in this connection, and we will be supporting them."
"What we do not like in the proposal is that it could, of course, lead to a situation in which even the internal payments, which are, or at least seem to be, now mostly free, will become more expensive for the consumer."
"That too will do nothing to boost the euro' s popularity. It is therefore important to avoid this situation."
"Finally, why is it a choice between two evils?"
"We are not bankers and therefore do not know how bank charges should be calculated, nor do we want to know, in all honesty, for that is why we have bankers."
"Self-regulation is therefore the big favourite as far as our group is concerned. We have tabled an amendment in this connection."
"Should this not be accepted, and the banks have so far not been sufficiently prepared to do something about this, then these measures will unfortunately be inevitable."
"Mr President, the introduction of the euro has created great expectations with the citizens."
"One of those expectations is that when they use the euro in the relevant Member States, they will pay the same price for using means of payment other than cash."
"It is therefore unsatisfactory that shortly before the introduction of the euro, an adequate solution has still not been found to the problem of charges for cross-border payments."
"In this matter, a large proportion of the blame must be apportioned to the banks and financial institutions."
"Self-regulation in the sector appears not to be working."
"That is why I have great admiration for the efforts by Commissioner Bolkestein and rapporteur Peijs, who tenaciously worked to find a solution."
"There are sound arguments why banks should not charge anything at all for electronic cross-border payments."
"Current technology enables these payment transactions to be carried out at low cost and the same technology can also be used for cross-border payments."
"The use of different charges is not desirable and contravenes the concept of an internal payment market and a common currency."
"For banks, electronic payment means a saving since less labour-intensive PIN payments are encouraged."
"I therefore support the view of the European Commission and rapporteur Peijs, and hope that a prompt introduction of this measure will strengthen consumer confidence."
"Mr President, on 26 October 2000, I explained to Parliament why the current level of bank charges on cross-border payments in Europe are due to technical obstacles which will disappear in time, or so we hope, but which are currently unavoidable."
"Under these circumstances, the reason why some Members are portraying them as evil is because they are inexorably seeking to achieve a uniform internal market and because there has been a backlash from the pro-euro propaganda, which promised the impossible."
"Having made these points, I shall leave it there."
"The proposal for a regulation that is before us today belongs to the next stage."
"Since the market is putting up some resistance, it is proposed that we use force to make it submit, by decreeing compulsory equality of bank charges on internal transactions, as on cross-border transactions."
"We believe this text is untimely, not only because it denies the realities of the market, which will exact their revenge in one way or another in the future, but for four other reasons."
"The first is that it undermines subsidiarity, because this issue should be a matter for Member States."
"The second is that it undermines the freedom of pricing, which we actually believed was carefully safeguarded by the Commission. For the euro, however, which of our grand principles would we not allow to be sacrificed?"
"The third is that it undermines the commitments repeatedly made to use regulation as sparingly as possible because, in being directly applied to the Member States, such regulation undermines the national parliaments' power of transposition, which is, in fact, perfectly legitimate."
"The fourth and final reason is that this will lead to many rather veiled forms of unequal treatment of citizens, since the actual, but banned, costs of cross-border payments will have to be passed on to other banking products."
"There, then, are many more reasons than are needed for rejecting this regulation."
"Mr President, Parliament has for years demanded that the Commission take action so that consumers' bank charges in the euro area can be reduced."
"The current situation, in which for a payment of EUR 100 you may have to pay as much as EUR 23 bank handling charges, cannot be tolerated."
"Other colleagues, too, have referred to this matter."
"Besides, at the beginning of next year the problem will only get bigger, when twelve euro area Member States move over to euro cash."
"Developing the payment system and reducing the costs incurred both by banks and subsequently by consumers is therefore one of the top-priority items on the 'urgent' list of our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I am sure that the Commission will agree with this target we have, but the means to achieve it differ in part from Parliament' s original wishes."
"Structural problems must not be solved by force."
"Cross-border bank charges can permanently be reduced only, and indeed only, if we are able to create technical standards for automated handling of payments in the euro area."
"The current high costs are caused by the fact that payments have to be processed manually."
"This paper chase, as old as Adam, is costing both time and money."
"However, since there is not sufficient consensus in the banking sector so that this kind of technical standard could have been produced, Parliament has in several reports on the matter emphasised the role of the European Central Bank in the development of a payment system."
"In fact, Parliament did, towards the end of last year, demand that the ECP should assemble a working group of qualified experts in the field, who would be given the task to create a suitable standard."
"The idea of Parliament was that the group would have carried out the work during this year and a proposal would have been made public before Christmas."
"In this way, a new standard, binding upon all banks, would factually have existed before the euro zero hour at the turn of the year, after which the commercial banks could have implemented it at their required time schedules."
"This kind of arrangement would naturally have also given a competitive edge to those financial institutions, which are able to make a transfer to the new system faster than others."
"It is regrettable that this was not achieved."
"Therefore, this time it is unavoidable that we have to read the Commission report, which in all respects truly is not in accordance with Parliament' s original wishes."
"Mr President, I think that the Commission proposal has, in fact, come just at the right time, better late than never, and makes it clear that the currency union is not only being completed in the interests of the markets and business, but also in the interests of consumers."
"I should like to recall that we have been working on this issue for over 10 years, as the rapporteur rightly said, and that we have always supported self-regulation and voluntary agreements, but that in this sector it has, in the end, always been necessary to adopt legislation, in order for example to bring about quicker, more reliable and above all cheaper transfers."
"Here I am, of course, also thinking of the double charges which both those who made transfers and those who received them had to pay."
"Happily, this is now in the past, but this experience in the European Parliament taught us precisely that it is necessary to enact legislation."
"That is why I welcome both the tone and form of the regulation."
"It does not dictate prices, but it does state quite clearly that domestic and cross-border credit transfers must be treated on the same footing because we are in an internal market."
"This internal market requires a European payment system, and not just for large payments, like TARGET, but also for retail payments, for the transfer of small amounts."
"Everyone is affected by this: mothers or fathers who have children studying or undergoing training abroad; those of us who order books or wish to pay for a journey or a hotel in another European country."
"Those who have a holiday flat or even a holiday home are affected by this."
"All of them suffer as a result of this situation, including migrant workers who receive their wages in one country and want to send them home to their families."
"We need to think of them."
"An average of EUR 24 to transfer EUR 100 is quite simply too much and unacceptable."
"I strongly reject Mr Maaten's proposal."
"We have tried everything; now we need to make decisions."
"I must also say that I do not understand Mr Karas's plea."
"Why should a proposal be forthcoming now, in the next two or three weeks, when it has been overdue for over 15 years?"
"I have to say also that the proposals to postpone all of this to 2005 are really unacceptable in my view."
"The rapporteur's argument is as far as I am prepared to go, and I therefore think that we need to secure a broad majority in favour of this long-awaited project here in Parliament, because a European payment system would have been a reality long ago if the banks and building societies had wanted it."
"Mr President, it is clear that the banks have been toying with this issue for years and have, at long last, thrown away this opportunity, making it necessary to introduce binding rules in a regulation."
"It is not on for EUR 18 of bank charges to be debited for transfers of, say, EUR 100, and often this is done twice, once from the sender's account and once from the recipient's."
"It is not on quite simply because the financial institutions have, for some considerable time, had the technical means to carry out transfers, honour cheques and make card payments quickly and at a reasonable cost."
"We must be careful to ensure, however, and this has already been mentioned several times - that, as cross-border charges go down, domestic charges are not increased correspondingly."
"Should this be the case then, in the future, domestic charges will also have to be laid down in a regulation."
"We should clarify this too."
"One snag is the fact that there are moves to postpone the deadline by two months."
"On this point, I am afraid that I cannot go along with the rapporteur."
"The banks have always been able to raise interest rates and bank charges overnight."
"In the space of a month and a half it will now also be possible for them to lower their charges to a standard level."
"I hope that there is not a majority in favour of the amendments concerned."
"Mr President, I thank the Commission for the brave proposal for a Regulation and congratulate Mrs Peijs for her long-term commitment to this matter, without which we probably would have been unable to convince the Commission and the Council of the need for this legislative initiative."
"In fact, I also support all amendments which Mrs Peijs has tabled on behalf of our group."
"Despite this, it is regrettable that some three years following the launch of the electronic euro and on the eve of 1 January 2002, we are still having to work on a piece of legislation of this kind."
"It is beyond me why the banks, which otherwise find each other so promptly and efficiently in a cross-border context and are united in effective professional organisations, should be forced by law to organise themselves properly and to automate in order to be able to work more cost-effectively in the internal market, and no longer to discriminate."
"The binding nature of the non-discrimination rule will raise a few eyebrows, but there is no alternative: leaving things as they are would be worse, for we would then accept what some small businesses and consumers fear, namely that the benefits of the euro will pass them by and that cross-border payments will continue to cost some EUR 20 each."
"There is one concern I have, and I should like to ask the Commissioner a question in that connection."
"How can we prevent this Regulation from being seized by the banks as an excuse to increase the charges for domestic payments, and how does the Commission itself view this proposal?"
"Is it being regarded as a big stick in order to get a last-minute gentlemen' s agreement out of the banks or, Commissioner, do you intend to continue to move towards a Regulation?"
"I hope that you as Commissioner remain resolute."
"Mr President, as Mrs Peijs stated a moment ago, I was standing on the same spot in this House in October last year, talking about the same issue, namely the establishment of a common payment area."
"The Commission had just published its fourth or fifth communication on that subject and in it, it was stipulated that the internal market and the single currency had to be accompanied by a common payment area."
"This Parliament then levelled criticism at the Commission for being too passive."
"I remember this well."
"Mrs Peijs wondered when the Commission would spring into action."
"Well, the Commission has listened carefully to Mrs Peijs and has acted accordingly, no one will be able to deny this now."
"The Commission has submitted a draft Regulation which is based on a simple principle, namely that each payment in euro is to cost the same, irrespective of whether the payment is national or cross-border."
"This is of the utmost importance to the citizens, as has been noted by many Members of this Parliament."
"Today, the euro is a virtual currency, especially for the citizens, but on 1 January 2002, the currency will become tangible, for from that date onwards, 300 million Europeans will be using the same bank notes and coins."
"Today, European citizens still accept that a cross-border payment costs more than a national one."
"The reason is that different currencies are involved, but after 1 January, that will no longer be the case."
"The citizens will then question the usefulness of the euro if cross-border payments are still as expensive as they are now."
"In this connection, I should like to remind you that our latest study into the cost of cross-border payments has yielded baffling results."
"It transpired that in the year 2001, a cross-border payment of EUR 100 costs no less than EUR 24 on average."
"We carried out a similar study in 1993 and unfortunately, we had to establish that no progress at all had been made in eight years."
"That is why the Commission has decided to introduce a Regulation as a tool."
"The market itself has failed to come up with solutions to the posed problem, and with this interventionist measure, the legislator wants to force the economic operators to set up the infrastructure which the market requires."
"As Mrs Peijs knows, I am a staunch Liberal, and I regret the fact that I had no choice but to propose such a binding document for the banks."
"However, it is the only way to persuade the economic operators to take great pains over the new systems which are vital for the smooth running of the internal market."
"It is therefore with satisfaction that I have noted that the first results are rolling in."
"In one section of the bank sector, the plan is now being put forward to set up a new system for cross-border payments."
"And that proves that the present proposal for a Regulation is also realistic."
"After all, the saying 'where there is a will, there is a way' also applies to the bank sector."
"What took me rather by surprise is the idea of the bank sector that since they, as banks, have committed to implementing the plan, we, as Commission, can withdraw our proposal for a Regulation."
"Firstly, we should not overlook the fact that this plan can only count on a proportion of the bank sector."
"Indeed, there are three European pressure groups for banking and only one of those has written to me to propose this plan."
"That is an important fact."
"After all, a payment system is a network, and a network develops at the rate of the slowest members that belong to it."
"All it takes is for a few members of a network to refuse to develop any further, and that will throw a spanner in the works for the other members."
"That is, in fact, one of the reasons why in the past ten years, no progress has been made whatsoever."
"Secondly, the proposed plan is too late."
"It was only announced in a press release two weeks prior to the discussion of the proposal in Parliament."
"However, the Commission has been asking for this matter to be looked into for the past eleven years, but in all that time, too little progress has been made, and for those reasons, the Commission is unable to give a positive response to those MEPs who proposed to grant the bank sector a certain level of self-regulating authority."
"The bank sector has had sufficient time, and it, at least a section of it, is now coming up with a proposal."
"It is too little, too late, and that is why the Commission must resort to the proposals of a Regulation."
"It is therefore illogical to demand withdrawal of the proposal just before the first benefits are becoming visible."
"Accordingly, the idea to suspend the Regulation, as proposed in Amendment No 9 by Mr Maaten, seems unacceptable to me."
"I repeat what I have said a moment ago: the proposals for self-regulation are too late."
"Any call from the Commission to the banking world is being, or has been, backed by this Parliament, which is encouraging."
"In this connection, I would praise many MEPs and particularly the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, who has worked tenaciously to achieve the goal, namely to reduce the cost of transfers."
"In this respect, Mrs Peijs is the mouthpiece of the citizens and illustrates the great significance for industry, not least the small- and medium-size enterprises."
"The Commission proposal specifically embodies what is referred to as the Europe of the citizens."
"I should like to turn to yet another bone of contention, namely the date on which the present draft Regulation should enter into force."
"Some MEPs have in this connection referred to the opinion of the European Central Bank which states that the ECB is in complete agreement with the objectives which we aim to achieve with our proposal, but that we, the Commission, are said to go too fast and are too demanding."
"The bottom line in the ECB' s argument is that the banks need more time to set up the necessary infrastructure and logistical provisions."
"That is why the European Central Bank proposes 1 January 2005 for the Regulation to come into force."
"On the one hand, I do not dispute the fact that time will be needed to set up this infrastructure, but on the other hand, we should not make a mountain out of a molehill."
"After all, for years, banks have claimed that cross-border payments only account for 1% of the total transfers."
"Consequently, the entry into force of the Regulation in 2003 will not involve insurmountable additional costs, and if our expectations are fulfilled and if it transpires that the price reduction results in a greater use of this means of payment, then there will be even more reason to go full steam ahead with the activities."
"The report by Mrs Peijs contains sixteen amendments, seven pertaining to the recitals and nine to the articles."
"One single amendment is not acceptable, namely Amendment No 9 on the suspension of the Regulation which I mentioned a moment ago."
"One amendment constitutes a legal problem, namely Amendment No 4 on the rise in costs for domestic payments."
"It concerns a political statement which although I fully endorse it, does not fit in a legal document."
"Moreover, in this connection, I should like to refer to the last speaker, Mrs Thijssen, who asked me whether it is possible for banks to compensate for the losses incurred with regard to international payments by national payments."
"As has been rightly noted, this proposed Regulation is not a price measure: indeed, the charges for transfers are not specified, and that means that, in theory, the charges for national payments could increase."
"However, an essential component of this Regulation is transparency."
"Banks must notify their customers of the price structure for the different types of transfers and they must also inform their customers when those prices change."
"That means that total transparency will apply in terms of what this is all going to cost, and the Commission assumes that, based on the normal rules of competition, the different costs for domestic payments will be kept under control and will therefore not increase."
"Amendment No 6 stipulates that the Member States must assume their responsibilities with regard to the application of this Regulation."
"The Commission can identify with the first part of the amendment."
"The second part, however, comes across as somewhat mysterious, and the Commission is finding it difficult to pass judgment on it at this stage."
"With Amendment No 10, the person who tabled this amendment hopes that the principle of non-discrimination will not apply to payment cheques."
"As it happens, the Commission has never wanted to promote the use of cheques and therefore agrees with the amendment."
"In addition, rapporteur Peijs would like the entry into force of the Regulation to be postponed until 1 March 2002."
"That does not pose any problems for the Commission."
"We can thus accept that amendment."
"The other seven amendments are acceptable in principle, although some will need to be edited."
"This proposal will be discussed by the Internal Market Council in some ten days' time, on 26 November."
"I am convinced that we will reach an agreement, not least because the European Council in Ghent has requested the Council to reach its findings promptly and has endorsed this proposal."
"I know that the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, also has numerous contacts with the Council and I think she will share my feelings on this score."
"I should like to thank Mrs Peijs for the excellent document she has drafted and for all her efforts since 1989 to reduce the costs of cross-border payments."
"I hope that second reading will be nothing but a formality, in which case the text will be ready for publication in January."
"Finally, I should like to ask Mrs Thyssen a second question."
"She has also asked me whether the Commission is prepared to stand by its decision, and not to succumb to the pressure of the banks, and whether she considers this as a big stick."
"No, Mr President, this is intended as a Regulation and the Commission is thus certainly planning to adhere to its original brief and to ensure that this Regulation enters into force in March next year and that cross-border payments will cost no more than national transfers."
"Finally, allow me to thank Parliament as a whole for the sound cooperation."
"It shows how progress can be made if both institutions, Parliament and the Commission, are on the same wavelength."
"This proposal demonstrates the specific benefits of Europe to the citizen and enhances confidence in the European Union."
"Mr President, I would not want Mr Bolkestein to return home thinking that there are extremely mysterious goings-on in this Parliament."
"The first part of the amendment which the Commissioner mentioned remains unchanged, something which he, in fact, endorsed."
"We, too, thought that the second part was set out in a rather peculiar way, all the more so since it was not Parliament' s intention to set up a new institute."
"We have converted this part into a recital, which contains more or less the same question for redress procedures as the 1997 directive."
"With this, I believe that all mysterious elements have been removed, and we will thus all be able to concentrate on the second reading."
"Mr President, the Commission has taken note of what Mrs Peijs said a moment ago and will specify its position in due course."
"Many thanks, Mr President."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0352/2001) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC, Directive 92/80/EEC and Directive 95/59/EC as regards the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco [COM(2001) 133 - C5-0139/2001 - 2001/0063(CNS)]"
", rapporteur. (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am really sorry but, as far as this draft directive is concerned, I am unable to help reconcile the two institutional bodies."
"I am sorry, but I must recommend that the Commission proposal be rejected."
"As you know, cigarettes are not a tax-free commodity."
"They are already subject to excise and value added tax and in Europe these taxes are extremely high, accounting for 70% to 80% of their price."
"The Commission has proposed a fixed minimum tax of EUR 70, in addition to the system of proportional taxation which already applies."
"The argument is that, instead of converging, taxation diverges from one country to another in the Union."
"That is the first mistake."
"It is not true that there are tax divergences; there is no particular convergence, but that is not the same as divergence."
"There is greater convergence on cigarettes than there is with numerous other items, as confirmed in the independent study by the Directorate-General of Research of the European Parliament, which naturally was not written solely to back me up."
"Why does the Commission feel that taxes should converge?"
"Because they are one reason why prices differ, which is one reason why smuggling and tax fraud are on the rise."
"Of course, these need to be stamped out and Parliament has repeatedly proposed measures which, unfortunately, have not been taken up, in order to stamp out cigarette smuggling."
"But if price differences are to be wiped out, the difference in price itself needs to be wiped out."
"The Commission has admitted that we do not know if tax convergence will bring about price convergence."
"It is certain there will be no convergence because the industry is a monopoly industry and can therefore engage in strategic price setting."
"These prices are not the result of market forces, they are competitive weapons used by the monopolies and we are living in cloud cuckoo land if we expect them to level out."
"Similarly, the Commission proposal makes no provision whatsoever to harmonise value added tax, which fluctuates from one Member State to another by as much as 100%."
"How can taxation be harmonised unless value added tax on cigarettes is harmonised at the same time?"
"Indeed smuggling - if it is smuggling to buy cheap cigarettes in one country of the Union in which the tax on them has been paid and sell them in another country in the Union in which they are more expensive, which in my view it is not, it is the normal working of the single market, but insofar as it is smuggling or if the tax is not paid, as in the case of England, where the situation will not change and which has a serious cigarette smuggling problem, with 50% of cigarettes smoked in England smuggled in, precisely because the tax costs as much as the price of the cigarettes, the situation will not be affected in England because the Commission proposal will not affect prices in Belgium, Holland or France, which is where the smuggled cigarettes come from."
"On the contrary, prices will rise in the Member States in the south, especially, of course, if we accept the candidate countries into the European Union; or rather when we accept them, which I hope we shall, prices will rise there as a result of this directive by up to 200% to 400%."
"Just imagine if there are derogations to cover this sort of price increase and just imagine what will happen with smuggling from the Ukraine or Russia or from China or India if we allow this sort of price increase."
"The public health argument, that is, that higher prices reduce smoking, has also been wheeled out."
"How do we know it will?"
"Because we have statistics."
"But the statistics are based on legal cigarettes."
"The increase in the price of cigarettes does indeed reduce legal smoking, but it encourages illegal smoking and in England the mafia is having a field day and has put the cigarette market completely out of kilter for precisely this reason."
"Furthermore, Commissioner, I must say that the Council has not demonstrated the necessary respect or tact vis-à-vis Parliament, because a week before we submitted our opinion, it presented us with a political agreement in which it attempts to force our opinion."
"I hardly think that is the way to run democratic institutions but if, nonetheless, that is how Parliament is to be run, then one wonders why we won the Cold War."
"And I heard you say in your previous speech that you are a dyed-in-the-wool liberal."
"This makes we wonder how you can come along and support a measure from which, in the economic sector, only large monopolies stand to gain for reasons which, unfortunately, I cannot go into now, but you know full well that I am right, while, in the political sector, you come along with something which looks to me very much like totalitarianism."
"I think that this sort of difference between the theory which we espouse and the practice which we follow should give you food for thought."
"Mr President, the rapporteur is proposing rejection of the Commission's proposal."
"We, in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are rather reluctant to do this without telling the Commission why, at least without giving the Commission a written explanation."
"However, in conclusion it has to be said that the directive cannot remain as it is."
"In its opinion, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market also made a number of comments."
"It confined its comments to its particular field."
"The issue of health protection undoubtedly has a role to play in this proposal for a directive."
"However, this is not an issue for our committee."
"The question of whether the minimum excise duty should be EUR 140, 120, 100, 80 or 60 is also undoubtedly significant in connection with health protection, but not for the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"For us, it was exclusively legal considerations that mattered."
"In this respect, the directive would appear to have two essential weaknesses, which mean that it does not stand up to scrutiny against reasonable internal market considerations."
"Firstly, the system of having a minimum incidence of excise duty comes under pressure from the fact that value added tax is imposed on top of this minimum rate."
"If I take a country where the rate of excise duty is the bare minimum required and the rate of value added tax is also very low, then I have to conclude that there are distortions of competition if I compare it with a country where the rate of excise duty perhaps exceeds the minimum and there is a relatively high rate of value added tax."
"That is why we think that in the future, instead of requiring a minimum incidence of excise duty exclusive of value added tax, it would be appropriate to work on the basis of a system which provides for a minimum rate of excise duty inclusive of the applicable value added tax."
"The second point concerns Article 3(1)."
"We think that this proposal no longer draws a proper distinction between cigarettes and cigarillos or cigars."
"The proposal tries to give the impression that cigarillos with filters are cigarettes with dark-coloured wrappers and that they should be taxed accordingly, like cigarettes."
"We believe that this is wrong."
"The health effects of filters can certainly be disputed, but it ought to be indisputable that a cigarillo with a filter is in any case slightly more healthy than a cigarillo without a filter."
"If, however, I treat cigarillos with filters as equivalent to cigarettes for tax purposes - and I am not a cigarillo smoker! - then I penalise the fundamentally healthier product by taxing it like a cigarette."
"That is why I think that improvements also need to be made here."
"We agree with the conclusion that the proposal should be rejected."
"Even if it sounds harsh, technical improvements are necessary."
". (NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I would thank the Commission for the proposal on upward convergence of excise on tobacco."
"Parliament requested this a few years ago and the Commission is now meeting this request."
"In our view, the proposal is an improvement on the current situation and also solves a number of problems, including that of continuing to allow for exceptions, as is the case for Sweden now and the accession countries in future."
"For that reason, we believe it is a considered proposal. We did, however, table a number of amendments."
"Firstly, there is the issue of VAT which Messrs Katiforis and Wieland also mentioned."
"I share their point of view on this score, and that is why my group has re-tabled the amendment that was already adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, namely to include VAT in the equation."
"Secondly, our committee was of the opinion that the issue should be clearly placed in the context of existing negotiations in the World Trade Organisation, for the latter plays a major role in this."
"Thirdly, we believe that a great deal must be done against smuggling."
"I do not subscribe to the rapporteur' s point of view that an increase in excise will, in itself, promote smuggling or, vice versa, that a reduction in excise will lead to a drop in the incidence of smuggling."
"I am of the opinion that completely different measures should be taken against smuggling, which are, in fact, the topic of debate in the World Trade Organisation."
"Furthermore, we have tabled an amendment on tobacco subsidies, a much-debated topic which is also relevant in this context."
"We have also tabled an amendment in which we state that, concerning products which are less unhealthy, we should be working towards a system, maybe not now, but in 2005, whereby the excise on those products would also be lower."
"We therefore support the gist of the Commission proposal, as well as the position which the Council has already adopted in this respect."
"Mr President, this is one of the few occasions on which I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Katiforis, not because we talk the same language or are from the same country, but because we agree on what is called common sense."
"I am sorry, but common sense is nowhere to be seen in this proposal for a directive, which we, too, propose should be rejected in its entirety."
"If it is not rejected, we are all in danger of exposing ourselves because, if this sort of directive is adopted, it will have exactly the opposite of, what the Council says, are the desired results."
"I should also like to point out that it would be most useful if the Council were present rather than absent, like their common sense."
"The Council says that the aim is to combat tax evasion and cigarette smuggling."
"If we increase tax, then we shall increase tax evasion."
"We all know that, the higher the tax, the more attractive tax evasion becomes."
"If we increase the price of cigarettes, as is proposed, then we shall, without question, increase cigarette smuggling because we shall be making legal cigarettes more expensive than smuggled cigarettes."
"So we shall be working counter to our aims."
"Again, the Council tells us that one of its aims is to protect public health and that this aim will be achieved by people giving up smoking because cigarettes are more expensive."
"And who can say that people stop smoking when cigarettes go up in price?"
"The best case scenario is that there will be no change in the consumption of cigarettes."
"The worst case scenario is that smokers on low incomes will change to cheaper, that is, more harmful cigarettes."
"Is that what we want to achieve?"
"How clever of us!"
"Similarly, the proposals in the proposed directive are wrong because, first of all, they restrict application to five, mainly southern countries."
"The other ten are not affected because they are already at the topmost point."
"Secondly, the cost of living will rise in these five countries, four of which are southern countries, without any increase in wages, thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures."
"I also think we should ask ourselves what the candidate countries have to say about this proposal for a directive?"
"Do they think it shows the European Union's concern for them?"
"And it would be helpful to know how their governments are going to persuade them that integration into the European Union will benefit consumers, when they will have to pay 200 to 500% more for cigarettes under this sort of directive."
"Finally, I should like to express my disappointment with Ecofin for its rushed attempt to pre-empt tomorrow's vote here by issuing details of its compromise agreement."
"That was a mistake on their part."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for this proposal."
"The rapporteur gives me no option but to disagree with him."
"Only yesterday in this House we passed a resolution giving the European Parliament's opinion on the third round of negotiations for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control."
"This House should never forget that tobacco is the biggest cause of preventable illness and disease across the European Union."
"It is like no other product."
"Each year half a million EU citizens die needlessly due to tobacco."
"In Scotland, which I represent, 13,000 people died last year due to smoking."
"The Commission proposal will help people to stop smoking."
"This proposal will introduce a cash minimum amount of cigarette duty."
"Currently the rule is expressed as a percentage of tax, inclusive of the retail selling price, and therefore has little effect on Member States and applicant countries where retail prices are already low."
"The more expensive a packet of cigarettes, the bigger the incentive to stop smoking."
"Some say that the most effective way to help smokers cure their addiction is to make cost the issue."
"Therefore any measures to reduce smoking are more than welcome and are more important to my mind than any arguments which support the tobacco industry."
"As regards smuggling, unlike the rapporteur I believe this proposal will prevent smuggling within the EU."
"Minimum EU rates of duty are sensible and effective in tackling the scourge of smuggling."
"The Commission's proposal is a good proposal and therefore should be wholeheartedly supported."
"Mr President, it strikes me that the Katiforis report does not explain why the European Commission proposal to change excise duty rates for tobacco is being rejected."
"It appears impossible to underpin this position."
"As this new proposal introduces changes to existing directives, the legal base is not at issue."
"One of the reasons for change is the fact that the Member States miss out on a huge amount of excise on account of fraud and smuggling."
"The internal market, therefore, still leaves something to be desired, and there is also competitive distortion."
"If the discrepancies between the Member States become less pronounced, fraud and smuggling will be discouraged and will, hopefully, even vanish altogether."
"Furthermore, the necessary increase in tobacco excise for a number of Member States, following on from this proposal, will not cause any damage to health."
"For the reasons already stated, I welcome a minimum excise duty of 57%."
"Where smuggling practices persist and even involve tobacco manufacturers, the European Commission will need to take additional measures."
"I have already called for the dismantling of tobacco subsidies several times."
"The amendments by Mr Maaten therefore receive my unqualified support."
"The European Union is still very much lacking credibility on this score."
"On the one hand, tobacco consumption is discouraged by warning labels, bans on tobacco advertising and higher excise, while on the other hand EUR 1 billion goes up in smoke in the form of tobacco subsidies."
"Supporting tobacco growers in the switch to another crop which also entails subsidies, is a very generous solution and therefore deserves Parliament' s support."
"I call on the Council to support the European Commission proposals and to stand up to the pressure exerted by one or two Member States."
"Moreover, I object to Mr Folias' appropriation of common sense."
"I could claim with just as much justification that everyone is entitled to their own stupidity."
"Mr President, the position taken by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal under discussion has surprised me."
"It diverges considerably from the position taken by this Parliament in 1996."
"At that time, Parliament urged the Commission to make proposals for upward harmonisation of tobacco prices, based upon higher duty rates across the Union for reasons including health protection, and to consider measures to reduce the scope for price manipulation by cigarette producers applying widely diverging pre-tax on the markets of each Member State."
"The present Commission proposal is consistent with that opinion."
"That is why I say that the advice of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee has greatly surprised me."
"The Commission is doing what Parliament wanted in 1996 and therefore it is odd that the report should not accept the Commission's proposal."
"The changes proposed will bring about increased convergence in duty rates within the European Union and, as such, improve the functioning of the internal market, both now and as it will be after enlargement."
"They will also reduce the incentive for excise fraud within the Union."
"More surprisingly - and Mr Blokland has just drawn attention to this - the draft report does not set out the reasons for rejecting the Commission proposal."
"That is the least that the Commission would have expected."
"According to the working document presented by the rapporteur to EMAC in June, the main justification is that the introduction of a minimum amount of taxation of EUR 70 for cigarettes constitutes a shift towards specific taxation, and would disadvantage small- and medium-sized producers in southern Member States."
"I would like to emphasise that this is emphatically not the view of the Commission."
"The introduction of a fixed amount in euro does not alter the structure of excise duties on cigarettes."
"Member States affected by the introduction of the fixed amount will retain the flexibility they enjoy at present to determine the proportions of the specific and ad valorem components of cigarette taxation, as other rules remain unchanged."
"I would also like to point out that the Commission proposal has received broad support in the Council."
"Last week in the Ecofin Council the Member States unanimously agreed a compromise text produced by the Belgian Presidency, which is clearly in line with the Commission's proposal."
"For cigarette taxation, the most significant element is the introduction of a minimum amount of duty of EUR 60 at the initial stage and EUR 64 at a later stage, rather than the EUR 70 proposed by the Commission."
"The adoption of the proposal is also extremely important in view of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union eastwards."
"Mr Folias has quite rightly drawn our attention to that aspect of the proposal."
"The existing minimum taxation requirement - the so-called 57% rule - allows for a higher degree of price manipulation and would not in itself be sufficient to reduce to a sustainable level the gap between the tax and price levels of the present Member States and the candidate countries."
"Such a situation would result in substantial revenue loss for present Member States, especially those having borders with candidate countries."
"The requirement for a minimum amount of duty will avoid this happening and ensure the proper functioning of the internal market after enlargement."
"The Commission is aware that achieving the amounts in euro will require a significant effort from most candidate countries. Therefore, it has proposed that the Council grant limited transitional periods to candidate countries for reaching the minimum rate of taxation."
"Next, I was pleased to see that the two Parliament committees that have issued opinions on the proposal - the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with Mr Maaten as draftsman, and the Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with Mr Wieland as draftsman - accepted the general thrust of the proposal, subject to a number of amendments."
"Most of the amendments proposed in Mr Maaten's report have been re-tabled in this plenary."
"The Commission broadly shares the concerns of Mr Maaten on the need to pay more attention to health policy and to combat fraud and smuggling."
"I do not see why Mr Katiforis cannot accept the arguments relating to health."
"It is a well known fact - and I am sure he is aware of it - that 75% of smokers started before the age of 18."
"Report after report and study after study confirm that for young people under the age of 18, price clearly is a determining factor in terms of smoking."
"I was pleased to hear both Mrs Stihler and Mr Blokland support the view of the Commission that there is a direct link between price and quantity consumed and that therefore the price very definitely has a bearing on health."
"Mr Folias said that if the price goes up then cheaper cigarettes will be purchased and smoked."
"According to that reasoning, if the price went down then more expensive cigarettes would also be purchased."
"That is something that, in reality, is not noticeable."
"Therefore, with all due respect to Mr Folias, his reasoning is not in line with reality."
"While I am answering specific questions by Parliament, I have to say that I do not understand the argument by Mr Wieland - referring to the legal aspects of the case - when he says that the interplay of VAT and excise taxes would be illegal."
"Of course they have a bearing on competition and smuggling, as we all know, but why should this be illegal, as he maintains?"
"The point of view of his committee is based on the legal state of affairs."
"He says that there is a problem in that cigarillos of a certain dimension and character should be treated as cigars and not as cigarettes."
"Well, I have some here."
"If you showed an average citizen of the European Union this packet of cigarillos, took one of them out - of the same dimensions and weight as an ordinary cigarette - and asked them if it was more like a cigarette or more like a cigar, I would wager Mr Wieland 144 packets of cigarettes or cigarillos - whichever he prefers - that the average citizen of the European Union would classify them as cigarettes."
"Most of the amendments proposed in Mr Maaten's opinion have been retabled for this plenary."
"The Commission broadly shares these concerns on the need to pay more attention to health policy."
"But the amendments require no change to the proposal."
"According to the existing review requirements, the Commission already has the obligation to take into account the wider Treaty objectives, including health."
"New developments, resulting for instance from the conclusion of a WHO framework convention on tobacco control, will thus automatically have to be taken into consideration in a subsequent review."
"The Commission and the Member States have also taken a number of initiatives to combat fraud and smuggling following the conclusions of the high-level group on fraud in the field of excise duties."
"To conclude, for the reasons I have given, the Commission is still convinced of the merits of its proposal and still considers the proposals by the Commission to be a direct reply to Parliament's own opinion expressed in 1996."
"Therefore the Commission invites all Members of Parliament who have expressed an opinion contrary to that of the Commission to reconsider their position on this issue very carefully before tomorrow's vote."
"Mr President, Commissioner, you have just shown us an example."
"May I ask you whether the Commission is of the view that tobacco products, like Commissioners, should be assessed not on their packaging but on their content?"
"Mr President, the Commission always looks at content, rather than form."
"But the form in this respect is important."
"If you ask the ordinary citizen of the European Union, ""What is this?"
"Is this more like a cigarette or more like a cigar?"""
"Because it is exactly the same size as a cigarette, has the same width and the same weight limits, he will say, without a shadow of a doubt, ""This is like a cigarette"" and not ""This is like a cigar""."
"That is the Commission's opinion too."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"European Council in spring 2002"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0528/01) by Mrs Randzio-Plath, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission's synthesis report in preparation for the Spring 2002 European Council."
"Mr President, in March 2000, the Lisbon European Council set out a new strategy for the coming decade."
"At that time we were working on the basis of very optimistic economic data and really thought that we could bring about sustainable growth of at least 3%, along with economic reform, full employment and also social inclusion."
"Today our starting point is more difficult because the global economy has gone in the opposite direction and even the European Union, despite its readiness to reform and the reforms which it has already implemented, is experiencing an economic downturn."
"That is why the following question is now much more urgent than it was during the preparations for the first spring summit in Stockholm: how does the Commission intend to continue this ambitious process of making the European Union, on the basis of innovation and knowledge, the most dynamic and competitive economic area in the world, and enabling it to overcome the problems which I have described?"
"This question is all the more pertinent for the spring summit in Barcelona because, after evaluating a strategy of this kind for two years, it ought to be possible to identify the areas where national and European policy have actually been guided by the quantitative and qualitative objectives and see to what extent it has been possible to bundle measures together and make them visible."
"The Member States' budgets have actually shown uniform increases across the board in investment in research and development, innovation and further development of the information and communication society."
"The few figures which are available to us in the European Parliament unfortunately do not yet speak the specific language which we would have liked, because we had hoped that the Lisbon strategy and its consistent implementation would also have yielded visible added value as a result of economic, financial, employment and social policy being coordinated at European level, so as to demonstrate to the public the benefits which European policy can have for them and quite specifically how it can improve their quality of life and work."
"We should certainly also ask what approach has been adopted to achieve the ambitious aim of increasing investment in the European Union."
"How has cross-border investment in infrastructure actually been made visible apart from through reports?"
"The European Parliament needs to ask all of these questions because, in drafting its synthesis report, the Commission has the duty of actually producing a blueprint for the further consultations at the spring summit, which will then, of course, in the end, form the broad guidelines of the future economic policy of the European Union and its Member States."
"In the current economic downturn and at a time when we are also facing particular challenges because of the adverse economic consequences of the terrible terrorist acts of 11 September - and in considering these issues we have to take into account a new aspect, the collapse of consumer confidence - we must also ask ourselves the following question: what can we do to stop a self-fulfilling prophecy, which states that we are sliding into recession, from becoming a reality?"
"The Commission therefore bears great responsibility for taking more of a lead on setting targets and taking more practical action to reform the economy, not only with respect to the labour market, but also with respect to the other markets, full employment and also social inclusion, by issuing specific guidance on these areas."
"Of course this also raises the question, and I should also like to address this particularly to you, Commissioner, of whether the tax situation, where unfortunately we still have countries pursuing independent national policies rather than coordinated ones, does not have an adverse impact on investment in the European Union and, in particular, on cross-border investment."
"Commissioner, the European Parliament is still not clear about how it is actually, finally to be involved in this whole process, which is now approaching its second spring summit."
"So far we have not been involved as partners in the macro-economic dialogue."
"There are no plans to organise another forum with all of the stakeholders, as was done before the Lisbon meeting."
"It really is legitimate to ask whether the European Parliament's involvement is adequate and whether it is therefore able to represent the interests of the people in this process of setting priorities for the European Union's economic and structural policy."
"We really are in a situation where we need to mobilise our forces and rally optimism."
"How do you envisage doing this in your synthesis report?"
"What working methods do you intend to choose and which guidelines do you intend to issue in it?"
"Mr President, in reply to the questions from Mrs Randzio-Plath, I should like to say first of all that the Commission's synthesis report for the spring European Council in March 2002 is currently being prepared."
"As requested by the European Council, that report will assess the progress made on the economic, social and environmental dimensions of the Lisbon strategy."
"I mention the environmental dimension in particular since the Göteborg Summit."
"Part of this assessment will consider the progress made by Council and Parliament on the Lisbon reform agenda."
"The assessment will draw on the series of structural indicators which have been proposed by the Commission in its communication of 30 October 2001."
"As Mrs Randzio-Plath knows, those structural indicators are a very accurate reflection of the progress made and the Commission thinks it is a valuable instrument."
"The objective of sustainable development will underpin the assessment of each strand of that strategy."
"The focus of the synthesis report will also depend on further work by this Parliament and the Council up to the end of this year."
"It is somewhat early, therefore, to be specific about the contents and structure of the reports at this stage."
"I agree nevertheless with Mrs Randzio-Plath that the synthesis report will need to take account of the likely situation by the time the Barcelona European Council is held."
"This means, on the one hand, the new international situation to which she has referred, and, on the other hand, the introduction of the euro on 1 January next year."
"At the recent informal summit in Ghent, Heads of State and Government and the Commission renewed their commitment to pursuing the Lisbon strategy of structural and economic reform and social renewal with determination as a response to both those factors, the new environment and the introduction of the euro."
"Continuity and the long-term focus of the reform agenda will need to be maintained, especially in view of the current economic downturn."
"The economic situation in the euro area and worldwide has made it necessary to adjust economic policy."
"But the confirmation by the Ghent European Council of its commitment to the stability and growth pact has brought confidence that the basic policy framework of economic and monetary union will be preserved and it has certainly facilitated the recent further adjustments in monetary policy."
"This shows that economic policy coordination is working."
"Nonetheless there is still further scope for strengthening economic policy coordination in line with the proposals put forward by the Commission, with a view to fostering a common assessment of the economic situation and appropriate economic policy responses."
"To reinforce that message, Mr Prodi is writing to this Parliament, to the President of the Council and to the Heads of State and Government this week, urging them to continue their efforts to make progress before Barcelona on key elements of the Lisbon reforms, such as the Community patent and the telecoms review, in line with the existing timetable, as well as on a number of the financial services proposals."
"The synthesis report by its nature covers a wide area of the Commission's activity."
"A number of Commission services are therefore contributing to its preparation and this work is being monitored at political level by a group of Commissioners dealing with growth, competitiveness, employment and sustainable development."
"The report should be adopted by the Commission on 15 January 2002 and will be submitted to this Parliament on the same day."
"By submitting the report at an early stage, it is intended to allow the other European institutions to give their views on the report in good time in order to contribute to the work of the European Council in Barcelona."
"I believe that is precisely what Mrs Randzio-Plath wants."
"Lastly, with regard to the open method of coordination, that is largely intended in the context of the Lisbon strategy to develop indicators at Member State level and to share best practice and experience."
"It is used in line with the principles set out in the White Paper on governance in areas where legislative action under the methode communataire, the Community method, is not possible."
"I hope I have answered the questions put by Mrs Randzio-Plath."
"As I have said on earlier occasions, I shall be delighted to come and make a presentation to her committee and discuss what the Commission intends to do at the Barcelona Summit in further detail."
"But it would be useful if my future discussion with the EMAC committee could take place after 15 January, because by then both Parliament and I will be in possession of the documents that will be the Commission's input into the Barcelona Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Liberal Group I would like to support the position expressed by the Chairperson of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the issue we are debating."
"I am pleased that Commissioner Bolkestein has said that he is willing to discuss the content of the proposed synthesis report in committee, since it must be the basis for a discussion at a meeting which we hope will be very important and which will take place in my city and the city of the President for this sitting."
"We therefore have a special interest in Barcelona being a genuine success and that it be remembered as a truly significant advance in terms of the commitments we have been taking on since the meeting in Lisbon last year."
"I would like to insist on one aspect which both the Commission and the Liberal Group have been highlighting."
"This is the need to consolidate and clarify the mechanisms and objectives in the field of economic and monetary policy."
"There is a degree of confusion, as you know, and this has been discussed both in the Commission and in this House, between the Europe of the euro (which, as the Commissioner has said, is now close to completing its final stage with the introduction of notes and coins), the external representation of the euro and, on the other hand, the system for adopting decisions in the field of economic and monetary policy."
"We know that this situation is unsatisfactory and the current crisis highlights this."
"We hope that the present situation can be genuinely overcome, in the way that Commissioner Bolkestein' s colleague, Commissioner Solbes, has often said optimistically."
"However, at the same time he has been obliged to lower the growth forecasts."
"I would therefore like to insist on this aspect and on another which the Commissioner has not mentioned and which I believe is very important within the various elements of Lisbon and their subsequent implementation: the training and technology element."
"Lisbon set the objective of a fully competitive society by 2010, in which we would be able to overcome our technological and scientific backwardness in comparison with the United States, which was the term of reference established in Lisbon."
"I believe that this is an element which also has to be introduced into this synthesis report, and at subsequent meetings views have been expressed in agreement with this."
"I thank Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mrs Randzio-Plath for the remarks they have made."
"I stress the fact that progress made since Lisbon has been insufficient."
"In the area of financial services, for example, the Commission intends to have a mid-term review meeting in February next year to stimulate more political interest in perfecting the internal market and achieving the difficult targets we were set by the Lisbon European Council."
"But I stress that we have not done what we should have."
"Considerable difficulties remain and we must use the meeting in Lisbon to make further progress."
"It would be a good thing if Ecofin ministers were present in Barcelona so that they could do, on the spot, what members of the European Council want them to do."
"So far members of the European Council have engaged in laudatory statements but when ministers have to deal with the subjects at hand the political will seems to evaporate."
"If the Ecofin ministers were to be present at the Barcelona Council perhaps they could solve these problems there and then."
"In the case of patents, the European Council has instructed the Council to come to a decision before Christmas this year."
"I am not optimistic."
"That underscores the need for the Barcelona European Council to be practical and emphasises the need to make more progress than have been made up until now."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Conversion of vessels and of fishermen dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0395/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163(CNS)]"
"Mr President, the European Parliament is offering the Commission the opportunity to correct the proposed regulation it delivered to Parliament and the Council."
"The intention of the report, approved by the Committee on Fisheries that we are discussing at the moment, is to correct the rigidity of this proposal, which is currently preventing progress being made in finding solutions to problems for the people affected by the non-renewal of the EC-Morocco fisheries agreement."
"From the time the agreement expired, on 30 November 1999, until the time it became clear that a new agreement would not be reached, owners of more than 400 vessels and some 4 300 fishermen were both hopeful and fearful at the time when negotiations between the Community and Morocco were being prolonged."
"It was not until 26 March 2001 that Commissioner Fischler announced that it had been impossible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"From that moment, the Community set itself the objective of converting the affected fishing fleet."
"By presenting this proposed regulation, the Commission is conforming to the guidelines set by the Nice European Council of 7 December 2000."
"At that Summit, the European Council ordered the Commission to propose a specific action plan for the restructuring of this Community fleet."
"I must state clearly that this proposed regulation does not conform to the needs of the sector in question."
"Once again the Commission seems to be presenting proposals, the objective of which we do not understand, that do not amount to decisive action in support of a fleet and certain regions which are suffering a serious crisis."
"In fact, rather than helping to preserve most of the fleet and its economic activity, the Commission is presenting a rigid proposal which, if the Council approves it without the substantial amendments approved by the Committee on Fisheries, will have the effect of breaking up a fleet for which the ship owners and local authorities of those regions feel capable of finding alternatives."
"This proposal must therefore be amended in the way approved by the Committee on Fisheries, so that the actions proposed may have a beneficial effect on the sector in question."
"The Committee on Fisheries does not share the Commission' s breaking-up approach."
"The Commission could have focussed on the existing opportunities in alternative sectors, such as the processing industry, aquiculture and especially the promotion of fisheries products."
"In the same way, the proposal excludes sectors directly affected by the non-renewal of the agreement, such as the non-extractive fisheries industries."
"The land-based companies, during the long negotiation process, have suffered a series of economic setbacks that have led to employment rationalisations and redundancies, leading to considerable losses."
"Today they are faced with a future just as uncertain as that of the fleet they depend on."
"Faced with this breaking-up approach, the sector affected and the regional authorities have reached verbal agreements with companies and ship owners from various Maghreb countries to create mixed companies, and in this way, according to the estimates of the sector, in the small-scale sector, around a hundred vessels could be relocated with the help of this specific measure, if it were more flexible, thereby reducing to 26 those vessels destined for scrapping."
"This would maintain an economic activity which is vital to certain regions and ensure that those who want to continue being ship owners and fishermen are able to do so."
"The amendments contained in the Committee on Fisheries' report, in summary, modify the proposed regulation in the following fashion:"
"In addition to ship owners and fishermen, the land-based fisheries industry which was directly linked to the existence of this agreement are included, provided that their losses exceed 70%."
"The requirement that the people affected must have been subsidised for a period of at least nine consecutive months as a result of inactivity in order to benefit now from this specific measure is removed."
"This requirement leads to the exclusion of those people who, sometimes temporarily, found alternative work while waiting for a new fisheries agreement with Morocco to be reached."
"This is all the more serious if we bear in mind that these ship owners and fishermen had not been warned that, if they found an activity, they would be penalised when it came to conversion."
"The Committee on Fisheries has also rejected the requirement to return aid granted for modernisation."
"It is not right to apply penalties of a backdated nature in the case of aid which was not subject to these conditions at the time of being granted."
"The Commission' s proposal intends to increase public aid per ship owner by 20% in the case of scrapping or transfer to a third country."
"The Committee on Fisheries believes that fishermen must also benefit from this increase of 20%."
"We have also redistributed the sum allocated to this specific measure in such a way that the amount intended for scrapping is 30%, for the creation of mixed companies, 35%, and for socio-economic measures, also 35%."
"This would lead to better implementation of the specific measure."
"Lastly, I will mention the budgetary aspect."
"In accordance with the conclusions of the Nice European Council, the Commission proposes granting up to EUR 197 million for this specific measure."
"It proposes implementing the flexibility instrument in 2002 and allocating the appropriations corresponding to heading 2 of the financial perspectives."
"The saving resulting from the non-renewal of the agreement has been EUR 500 million."
"It is natural that the Community should also contribute to the cost of converting this fleet."
"Mr President, this House may be listening for the last time to words relating to what, for fourteen years, we have known as the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"Tomorrow, on voting on the report we are debating today, our institution will write the last page of a story that has been told since August 1987, when the European Union signed its first fisheries agreement with that country, but which for Spain goes back almost twenty-five years."
"There are therefore Community fishermen and ship owners whose lives have been exclusively linked with the existence of the Moroccan fishing grounds."
"Our obligation today is to close this chapter with the greatest possible dignity and responsibility towards this sector, which is going to suffer an unprecedented fisheries conversion."
"We must thank the Commission for their efforts over the last two long years to try to make tomorrow' s vote unnecessary."
"But, given that the situation is irreversible, we must also recognise the solidarity contained in the Commission' s proposal, its recognition that the end of an era cannot be marked by the spectacle of us being miserly towards those people who are waiting anxiously for this plan in order to carry on living and working, the financial cost of which is fully justified."
"We hope that the other institutions have sufficient dignity to accept this need."
"The amendments introduced by the Committee on Fisheries, above all, contribute to adding a greater degree of flexibility in order to allow Community solidarity to truly benefit a very heterogeneous fleet, which over the last two years has not ceased to seek its own solutions; solutions which greater legislative rigidity may contribute to blocking."
"Furthermore, our main obligation is to approve this report in order to provide the necessary legal basis so that on second reading of the budget the necessary appropriations can be provided to finance the restructuring plan."
"This restructuring plan will no doubt put an end to part of an historic fleet, but it must not mean the end of fisheries relations with Morocco."
"It is impossible to imagine that Morocco really wants to turn its back on the European Union, amongst other things because we share two seas and we are obliged to be neighbours, and Morocco can only benefit from this proximity."
"I therefore ask the Commission to remain receptive and promote any mutually beneficial fishing cooperation initiative which may arise in the future."
"It only remains for me to thank the rapporteur for the wonderful work she has done."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the draft Council regulation on the promotion of the conversion of vessels and of fishermen dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco, which is the subject of the excellent report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, deserves our unreserved approval."
"The proposal shows that the European Union cares about the fate of such vulnerable and fragile activities, whose survival depended on the renewal or non-renewal of a fishing agreement with Morocco."
"European solidarity works and continues to work."
"That is for the sceptics."
"The Commission proposal considers the problems of conversion from its economic and social angles."
"It also has the merit of mobilising new money, EUR 197 million, which is compatible with the mobilisation of other resources already allocated under the Structural Funds."
"In Portugal there are 570 fishermen who receive support under this programme, 400 of whom live in Sesimbra, a small, attractive fishing and tourist town very close to Lisbon."
"Of these 400 who live in Sesimbra, 150 are already over 55 years old, which means they can be moved into early retirement, since at this age it is difficult to retrain them for a different job."
"In simple terms, while the shipowners are liable to receive supplements of 20%, the same is not true for the fishermen, which to me seems an injustice."
"Now, the fishermen will be able to get EUR 10 000 euros over one year if they do not do any other work."
"The possibility of a 20% increase, although modest, would allow them to raise that sum to EUR 12 000, which would make it rather more attractive."
"Furthermore, the proposal has quite a rigid structure and should be made more flexible, allowing the Member States, in this case Portugal and Spain, to adapt better to situations that are truly complex and sometimes do not fit within the rigid stays of the regulation."
"This flexibility should be accepted so that the aid already granted by the end of 2001 should not all be accounted for under the part of FIFG Article 4 intended for socio-economic measures, and all of it within the Lisbon and Tagus valley region, and it would be better if it could be diluted in other programmes."
"Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I entirely agree with the content and proposals of the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, which I think are lucid and sensible, particularly those dealing with the possibility of supporting processing activities that were dependent on fishing."
"Indeed, it does not make sense that certain fishery-dependent processing and marketing activities, which in this case have been hit very hard, should not also be funded."
"For this reason, too, we are grateful for the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos."
"Mr President, I am pleased to inform the House that the UN Fish Stocks Agreement will enter into force on 11 December."
"This follows the thirtieth ratification by Malta, shamefully with no ratifications by the EU."
"Turning to Morocco, the Greens will be voting against this proposal, not because we oppose compensation for fishermen put out of work, but because we oppose this particular package."
"Firstly it provides increased premiums for only certain people, those involved in Morocco."
"This discriminates against other fishermen and ship owners."
"Secondly, it will fund even more transfers of vessels to third countries, including flags of convenience, and there are still no controls in place to prevent this."
"Thirdly, it sets a very bad precedent if every time an agreement collapses or problems entirely foreseeable arise, we decide to dish out huge sums of European taxpayers' money."
"Clearly, the problem with fisheries agreements has to be addressed."
"Morocco is the first, but there are more to come."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mrs Miguélez for the excellent work she has done."
"Its quality is all the more notable insofar as it deals with an issue which is hugely traumatic for a large number of people who depend on fishing in Portugal and in Galicia, Andalucia and the Canary Islands in Spain."
"It is a question of finding the best possible way to alleviate the effects of what I believe to be, if you pardon the expression, the chronicle of a death foretold."
"For a long time my group has been warning the House of the risks of not linking the fisheries agreement with Morocco to the association agreement."
"Today all I can say is that the Kingdom of Morocco has not shown the willingness to negotiate that we expect from a trading partner."
"I would like to acknowledge the Commission' s efforts to lessen the impact of the lack of an agreement with Morocco, but I am not going to repeat what has already been said."
"It is sufficient to refer to the interventions of the rapporteur and Mrs Fraga, for example, to realise that the Committee on Fisheries has considerably improved on the Commission' s proposal, by making it fairer."
"In this respect, it only remains for me to ask, as my group will do, the House to approve the report of the Committee on Fisheries, written by Mrs Miguélez, tomorrow, and that, once approved by Parliament, the report may quickly be provided with the appropriate financial instruments so that it can be implemented."
"And, in this respect, I would like to make it clear that the budgetary flexibility instrument is essential."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it would be horrendous, to give an example, if an Objective 1 region, with the highest unemployment rate in the European Union, which also suffers the consequences of the competition created by the very favourable agreements which we, Europeans, have granted to Morocco in the fruit products sector, not only suffered the effects of a tough conversion as a result of the lack of an agreement with Morocco, but that, furthermore, as a result of the budgetary miserliness of certain people, it also ended up without Structural Funds."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since it is so late, I will try to be very brief and concise."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez, for the good work she has done despite the urgency of the issue."
"I would also like to congratulate all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for the work they have done."
"I believe that together we have all been able to meet the demands of the circumstances: the rapporteur, the authors of the amendments, those who have made it possible to reach compromises and the Members who have supported us."
"The urgency procedure, as I said, always obliges us to work more quickly than we would have liked, but, even so, the result has been very positive."
"I now hope the Commission takes account of the significant improvements which the Committee on Fisheries has introduced into its proposal."
"I will highlight the extension of aid, better coverage and, above all, the flexibility introduced into the application of the various measures under discussion."
"Secondly, we must speak about the funding of this plan, although this is not strictly an issue for our committee."
"In Nice, the Council made a political commitment at the highest level, at the level of Heads of State and Government, to the people affected by the dramatic situation created following the failure of the negotiations with Morocco."
"I believe that the European Commission has also been able to meet the demands of the circumstances, and I would like to acknowledge that here: the use of the flexibility instrument and the EUR 197 million it proposes for funding demonstrate this."
"I therefore congratulate them."
"I now ask Parliament' s Committee on Budgets and the Council to support the European Commission and the European Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries and reach the necessary compromise so that this essential EUR 197 million can be used for the proposed purpose."
"There is a political commitment and a favourable opinion from this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries and we strongly urge that they be complied with."
"Mr President, it is vital that this report should be approved so that a decision can be taken at the next Fisheries Council on the restructuring programme for the fleet that operated in Morocco and that has been idle since the end of 1999, affecting Portuguese and Spanish fishermen and shipowners and the populations of the areas where they live."
"The fact is that compensation for the stoppage finishes at the end of this year."
"The central question, then, is the allocation of EUR 197 million for the restructuring programme that is to commence in January 2002, which should be improved along the lines proposed in the Miguélez Ramos report."
"For our part, we consider the proposal the Commission has made of using a flexibility instrument in the budget to be acceptable, and we regret that the matter was not made clearer during the first reading of the budget by the European Parliament, inserting the amounts on the line and requesting the use of the flexibility instrument, as in fact the Committee on Fisheries had proposed, as our chairman has just reminded us."
"It is, therefore, important that the next Budgetary Council should stop blocking and take these proposals into account, creating the solution that will allow the fleet restructuring programme to come into force early next year."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is late, but we are awake, wide-awake even."
"The alarm bells are ringing, the Gordian knot has not yet been hacked in two, but Parliament, I hope, is not giving up."
"What is at stake here?"
"At stake are jobs and the way the people of Europe perceive the EU."
"Thanks to the emergency motion tabled by our colleague, Daniel Varela, we have an opportunity this evening to discuss an issue which is as problematic as it is urgent."
"It concerns how to deal openly and honestly with the consequences which the failure of the negotiations with Morocco have had for the Iberian peninsular."
"The bare facts are quickly stated: since November 1990, we have heard, the EU fleet - in practice deep-sea fishermen from Spain and Portugal - has no longer been able to fall back on the resources off the coast of Morocco."
"The 4 300 fishermen and 400 vessels affected are hoping that the compensation payments will be continued when they expire in December 2001, as Mrs Miguélez Ramos has explained to us so convincingly."
"Behind these figures there are people, families and whole communities who are committed to a traditional industry and we now need to give that industry prospects for the future."
"In so doing, our efforts should certainly not be confined solely to giving financial handouts."
"It is much more important that we - and here I would bring the Commission and the Council on board too - succeed in producing a comprehensive plan which is convincing and whose aim is to provide reduced, but no less profitable, fishing activity, or alternative work."
"I would take this report as a further direct indication of how extremely important and urgent it is to reform the European Union's common fisheries policy, a task which is occupying all of us at the moment."
"It is no coincidence that the individual key words - external relations, trade agreements, capacity reduction and extensive restructuring - are also a leitmotif in the working documents on the reform."
"The current situation in Spain and Portugal also highlights the fact that it is now high time to conclude a package which is really worthy of the name reform."
"It is unacceptable to reduce members of a proud industry to the level of being simply recipients of charity."
"As a Community of values we must not allow this."
"Falling yields have, I believe, helped us to recognise the huge challenges."
"Let us now work together to identify the right action to take and let us show the flexibility which the rapporteur and also other colleagues have reminded us is so important."
"Mr President, the proposal that the Commission is putting forward is to be welcomed but needs improving."
"I shall highlight three aspects in this regard: the first is that there is no sense in the rigidity that the draft regulation imposes regarding the percentage of the funding to be allocated to each type of measure."
"What would make sense would be to allow each Member State the flexibility, within the overall envelope, to allocate these funds according to its own needs, with clear rules. For instance, in the case of Portugal, funds for destroying vessels should be reduced and funds for restructuring some of these ships and for the social part should be increased."
"Secondly, an envelope of this kind should also include funding for the economic conversion of the areas most affected by fishing, and include in this compensation framework collateral activities such as the processing industry."
"This would mean, right from the outset, that the financial envelope would need reinforcing, which unfortunately has not happened in this proposal by the Commission, which even so is arguing about certain problems of budgetary procedure."
"The third aspect I should like to highlight is that, in the Commission' s view, the aim of this aid is essentially to close a chapter in the common fisheries policy, which was the agreement with Morocco, without making the effort which I believe was needed to expand the fishing possibilities for these countries in third countries' waters, and without duly providing for measures, which again were needed, to help these companies become more international more easily."
"The Committee on Fisheries has tabled some amendments, and I should like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, who has made such an effort in this process."
"We, ourselves, have also tried to do our part with amendments that will clearly improve this proposal where it has gaps."
"As Mrs Fraga Estévez said, since there was no political ability to negotiate at the right time, I hope that there will now be dignity in the answers we are going to give to the fishermen affected."
"I also hope that this House will approve the proposal by the Committee on Fisheries and that the Council will do the job it has to do."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking and congratulating Mrs Miguélez Ramos, the vice-chairperson of the Committee on Fisheries, for her report on this extremely important regulation which aims at facilitating conversion for those thousands of fishermen and hundreds of vessels whose activity has been suddenly cancelled because it has not been possible to conclude a new fishery agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco."
"Beyond the availability of existing instruments, the Community has decided to make a special effort with a twofold initiative."
"Firstly, the Council regulation aiming at widening the scope of existing provisions and, secondly, additional credits for a specific action."
"While the proposal for additional credits is currently being discussed by the budgetary authority, today's debate focuses on the legislative proposal."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the emergency procedure should allow the adoption of the regulation by the end of November instead of the end of December."
"The report includes 18 amendments, which may be grouped in a few categories, which I shall review now."
"The first group consists of Amendments Nos 1, 2, 5, 10, 11 and 13."
"The Commission does not believe that the land-based industries - that is to say, fish-processing factories, as well as services to vessels - ought to benefit from the new regulation, nor should the coastal regions themselves."
"Indeed, regional development programmes already exist, and those industries in need of conversion or those coastal communities in need of diversification should benefit from the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund."
"Aquaculture and the fish-processing industry should benefit from the financial instrument for fisheries guidance."
"The second group of amendments consists of Amendments Nos 3 and 4."
"The Commission does not believe that all fishermen and vessel owners who have received indemnities in 2000-2001, irrespective of the actual duration of the cessation of activity, should benefit from the new regulation."
"Therefore a minimum duration of compensation, as a simple criterion, has been proposed and a nine-month duration has been considered a reasonable minimum."
"Moreover, until now, no evidence has been given that such a duration would penalise those who have tried to find alternative activities and are still in a difficult situation."
"The third group consists of Amendments Nos 6, 7 and 8."
"With respect to the age of vessels to be withdrawn, the Commission has proposed to reduce the minimum age to five years in the case of the exporting of vessels."
"All other rules should be maintained."
"Moreover, the Commission has proposed that the accumulation of grants for construction should be prevented premiums for withdrawal."
"Any alternative rule would be against the sound management of public money, and therefore the Commission could not support those amendments."
"On Amendments Nos 9 and 12, the Commission would stress that social premiums for fishermen are already available in the existing regulation."
"Nonetheless, it may support increasing those premiums in the new regulation."
"However, Spain and Portugal should guarantee that such increased premiums do not create distortion in relation to equivalent social premiums that may be available for workers of other industries in the same Member States."
"I turn to Amendments Nos 14 and 15."
"The additional credits are not structural funds."
"Providing them allows the Commission to set up some rules. Those rules should be in line with today' s priorities, which amount to scrapping redundant vessels and also to social measures."
"No 'adjustment' or 'variation' should be allowed."
"Then there is Amendment No 16."
"From the Commission' s perspective, granting a joint enterprise in the fisheries sector is quite a risky action."
"Two legal provisions limit that risk: firstly a bank guarantee, and secondly, a partially delayed payment (that is, after two years of satisfactory operation)."
"The budget rules for using additional credits imply the relaxation of the second provision, but the Commission is willing to maintain its financial risk at the same level."
"Therefore it has proposed to balance that loss by increasing the bank guarantee to 40% of the premium."
"But that is a purely mechanical calculation."
"Then there is Amendment No 17."
"If the budgetary authority decides to earmark all the commitment credits dedicated to the specific action in the budgetary year 2002, the wording of that article should remain unchanged."
"Otherwise it should be adjusted accordingly."
"Lastly, Amendment No 18, which has no practical consequence."
"The wording of Article 7 should remain consistent with the wording of the equivalent articles of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999."
"In conclusion, the Commission has a favourable opinion of Amendments Nos 9 and 12, and my colleague, Mr Fischler, will propose to the Fisheries Council that it includes them in the new regulation."
"Amendment No17 may be considered, depending upon the decision taken by the budgetary authority."
"I was speaking on behalf of my colleague, Mr Fischler, who, I am sure, will deal with any questions that I was unable to answer."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.20 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, I had not managed to reach my seat."
"I wanted to make a very brief comment: my name does not appear on the attendance register and I wanted to say that I was present at both the sitting and the corresponding vote."
"I know that this relates to Monday's sitting, but I did want to have it included in the Minutes."
"Many thanks."
"Obviously I did not sign in, but I was here and I did take part."
"Thank you!"
"Very well, Mr Ebner, it will be rectified."
"Are there any other comments on the Minutes?"
"Madam President, before the debate begins, I just want to pass on the feelings of the people in Ireland regarding the future of our national airline Aer Lingus."
"Prior to the terrorism in New York, it was a star performer in the airline industry, carrying 1.1 million passengers."
"It is a great provider to our national economy."
"There is a great wish that it not be regarded as the government giving national aid to keep this flying."
"That is not really a comment about the Minutes, and besides, there is going to be a debate on that subject."
"Are there any other comments about the Minutes?"
"(The Minutes were approved)."
"Madam President, I just wanted to bring to your attention the arrest in Greece a week ago of twelve British subjects and two Dutch subjects."
"Among the British subjects were two of my constituents, Paul and Lesley Coppin from Mildenhall in Suffolk."
"They have been arrested by the Greek authorities on charges of espionage."
"These people are plane spotters, aviation enthusiasts, on holiday in Greece."
"It does seem to me rather extraordinary that they are still being held in custody in a fellow Member State, and I wonder if there is something that you can do to bring this matter to the attention of the Greek authorities in order they be released as soon as possible."
"Mr Van Orden, we have taken note of your comments and we shall take whatever action is appropriate."
"Economic and employment situation in the air transport sector and in the industrial and related services sectors"
"The next item calls for statements by the Council and the Commission on the economic and employment situation in the air transport sector and in the industrial and related services sectors."
"Mrs Durant will now speak on behalf of the Council."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the American Airlines plane crash in New York on Monday 12 November has, of course, reminded everyone of the difficult and dreadful plight of the air transport sector."
"There is a risk that this latest accident will worsen still further the economic and social crisis that the sector has been facing since 11 September."
"However, this should not make us forget the roots of this crisis, which is the result, not only of the combination of economic problems directly linked to the attacks on 11 September, but also of previous structural difficulties which were revealed and aggravated by the events of 11 September."
"As President of the Council of Transport Ministers and a Belgian Federal Minister, I am particularly concerned about this situation."
"It seems to me more than ever vital to implement structural, economic and social reforms so as to enable the sector to overcome the current crisis, to give it a boost in the form of social measures, and to lay the foundations of sustainable development in this sector in the long term."
"In order to do this, we must understand the real roots of the problem and identify the obstacles that must be removed, and I should like to make a start on that here and now, with you and with Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The main cause of the fragility endemic in the European air transport sector is its over-fragmentation, along with a lack of both consolidation at Community level and strategic alliances."
"Up to now, the Community structure has been based on the desire to create a single market in which optimum conditions for competition are guaranteed."
"The extreme competition that results from this, in a sector where marginal costs are relatively low, gives rise to problems of over-capacity and at the same time prices that are too low in relation to the average costs borne by the airlines."
"This particularly fierce competition has therefore helped to make the airlines more fragile, and so they are vulnerable to any economic upset because their margins are so small."
"The American air transport industry has for a long time been much more concentrated than its European counterpart, which together with other factors has helped it to cope, for better or worse, with the crisis which is affecting the United States in particular."
"Although the difficulties in the air transport sector were caused not by the attacks of 11 September but by structural considerations, the events of that day imposed new constraints on what was already a difficult situation, and it was those constraints which precipitated the current crisis, and which have been made worse by the present context of an economic recession."
"I shall list the major constraints, in chronological order. Firstly, US airspace remained closed for four days, then passenger confidence was reduced and there was a considerable fall in the amount of air traffic operating - 20% fewer holiday flights compared with the year 2000, particularly on transatlantic routes where there was a drop of 30% - and to top it all there was the tragic accident two days ago, which will no doubt make the situation even worse."
"Then there is the fact that insurance companies have decided to raise insurance premiums for both passengers and aeroplanes in the case of accidents due to a state of war or to acts of terrorism."
"They have also decided to limit the airlines' coverage for third-party damages in the same circumstances to USD 50 million."
"What is more, additional security measures of necessity mean additional costs for airports and airlines."
"Last but not least, American aid, consisting of USD 15 billion in immediate aid and Federal credits to companies in addition to USD 120 million for suppliers of services, have now caused distortions in competition in relation to the European industry, in particular because they have made possible predatory practices on the part of certain companies on the transatlantic routes."
"The economic and social consequences for Europe of this combination of structural and economic factors are well known: airlines are experiencing serious difficulties, some of them even going into liquidation, investment is at a standstill and the whole air transport sector is experiencing a terrible crisis."
"What has been the Council' s response to all this so far?"
"At their meetings on 14 September and 16 October, the Transport Ministers had already discussed the consequences for this sector of the attacks on 11 September, as had the European Council of Economic Affairs and Finance Ministers at its meeting on 21 September, with a view to issuing a rapid and coordinated response from all Member States which would make it possible to support the restructuring of the sector while at the same time trying to retain the basis for healthy competition."
"The meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers on 16 October in particular examined the proposals contained in the European Commission' s Communication of 10 October on the economic situation of the air transport sector, with a view to implementing a certain number of its proposals."
"First of all the Council very rapidly coordinated Member States' measures to deal with the insurance situation."
"It decided that state aid provided to airlines and suppliers of services in order to make up for insufficient or non-existent cover for risks resulting from war would be extended until 31 December."
"Such schemes have to be declared to the Commission and examined by it on a monthly basis."
"As regards the cost of additional security measures, Member States have agreed to take these on board initially, without this being regarded as state aid."
"However, they have emphasised the need for users and operators to contribute towards this cost in the long term, when the situation has become more normal again."
"As for the four-day closure of airspace, the Council requested and obtained from the Commission a certain amount of flexibility to enable limited aid to be granted beyond that period, on the basis of objective criteria of course, to airlines which were the victims of the closure of airspace and its consequences."
"Both the Member States and the Commission believe that this support must respect the major elements of the Community acquis regarding the containment of state aid to the air transport sector, and must not under any circumstances cause distortions in competition."
"We do not accept the idea that American companies should use state aid in order to smash prices."
"Our companies are suffering from the unfair competition practised by the American airlines."
"We must not allow such a situation to continue within the European Union."
"This is why the Presidency supports the Commission' s proposal to adopt a code of conduct together with the United States, precisely in order to prevent or remove such distortions in competition."
"In addition, the Council has taken into account the request by certain airlines for more flexibility in applying the procedures for allocating time slots."
"Moreover, one of the key factors in the rapid recovery of air transport is the winning back of passengers' confidence."
"With this in mind, the Presidency and the Commission have worked very hard, with the support of the other Member States, in order to define and implement, as rapidly as possible, measures intended to reinforce security at airports and on board aircraft."
"This will be a two-stage operation: the first stage, which is a matter of priority, will be to apply, on a Community-wide basis, the recommendations of the European Civil Aviation Conference on passenger and baggage checks at airports, which are the result of many years' experience."
"The earlier these checks are carried out, the more effective they are."
"As you know, the Council has invested a great deal of time and energy, particularly through the Council-Commission joint experts group, in order to achieve a policy agreement among Member States as of the forthcoming Council meeting on 7 December."
"In a spirit of close coordination with the European Parliament, I believe that it is very important to achieve our aims as quickly as possible."
"The Council of 16 October also expressed the hope that the European Parliament should be in a position to give its opinion on this subject as quickly as possible."
"In other words, I believe that the public would find it hard to understand if the Council or Parliament were to drag its feet on such a crucial issue."
"The Presidency is at the disposal of the European Parliament in order to facilitate a close dialogue between the two institutions, and to enable the Members of the European Parliament to benefit from the expertise of its specialists, with a view to the rapid adoption of measures."
"At a second stage we shall be studying the advisability of additional security measures on the basis of the final report of the joint Presidency-Commission ad hoc group, which will be submitted on 7 December."
"Some of these measures will perhaps require legislative initiatives supplementing the first stage, represented by the 'Security' regulation currently being examined."
"The Council on 16 October thus made it possible to react coherently to the crisis in the air transport sector, but we should now be seeking to reconstruct a solid and sound foundation in this sector, even though we know that the current crisis may continue for several months."
"As my contribution to today' s debate, I propose to share with you my personal analysis of the prospects that exist for this sector and the measures that should be taken."
"This debate, which the Council has not yet embarked upon, is all the more necessary within this House, because there is no doubt that in the months to come Parliament will be involved in it."
"In structural terms, therefore, we must ensure that the sector is allowed to restructure itself, by reorganising the skies over Europe around a number of major alliances."
"One way of enabling the airline companies to restore their real viability is to improve the way in which the pressure of competition is channelled in this sector, in particular by having recourse to some form of consolidation."
"Without going so far as to recommend mergers or shareholdings which would require a full-scale remodelling of the system regulating competition, the creation of alliances or commercial alignments would be enough to enable a start to be made on the relieving of some problems."
"For example, it would make it possible to limit the over-capacity which is such a burden on the sector' s performance, and to reduce the effects of excessive competition on certain routes."
"It is a question of allowing economies of scale and of network, which are particularly highly developed in this sector, to operate properly."
"Together with the Commission, we must also think about adopting a strategy which will enable us to cope with similar situations. In particular we must study the adjustments to the European competition rules that will be required, at the same time overcoming, if possible, the current legal obstacles."
"This raises the sensitive issue of how the companies concerned can be controlled, and it means that we need to think more about the role of the European Community in relation to third countries, and in particular the United States."
"In effect, we must allow the major European airlines, around which future air travel will be organised, to be better armed to face their major North American rivals."
"With this in mind, I personally support the eventual granting of a clear mandate to the Commission, to negotiate with our international discussion partners, particularly in America."
"It is important for the future of civil aviation that the European Union should speak with a single voice."
"However, I believe that the preliminary and essential stage in this step forward is to establish a regulatory framework for the air transport sector which will be more coherent and complete."
"This 'internal' framework should lay a healthy foundation for the redeployment of the sector and enable us to avoid any distortions in competition."
"Out of the wasteland we have at the moment, we need to create a clear and binding regulatory corpus."
"This movement needs to cover all areas of aviation, whether safety, security, the fight against noise pollution or more general environmental protection."
"With this in mind, the Commission' s proposals for a 'single European sky' should be examined without delay."
"This project is the point of departure for a whole range of regulatory measures and should be as detailed as possible in order to build up a strong and united European market."
"The European Union must in time become an equal partner in international negotiations, particularly with its American discussion partners."
"I hope that I and my fellow members of the Council of Transport Ministers will have an opportunity to come back to the question of the Community' s competency in international negotiations on matters concerning air transport."
"We shall have to give some thought to the conditions governing such a mandate, and the guarantees that will be given to Member States regarding the transparency of negotiations conducted in the name of the Community."
"In-depth action must also be taken to deal with the social aspects of the crisis."
"The bankruptcy of Sabena and the redundancies announced draw attention to the importance of and the urgent need for this."
"The collapse of an airline causes job losses not only within that company itself, but also among its subcontractors."
"Sabena was the key client of many businesses, not only Brussels-National Airport itself, but also the various providers of airport services."
"We cannot rethink the civil aviation sector without rethinking the whole of our social policy in the context of liberalisation."
"The Belgian Presidency therefore believes that it is vital that it is able to intervene to support social plans and retrain employees, while at the same time respecting the principle that public money should not be used to subsidise companies."
"It is also vital that there should be a more far-reaching analysis of the social and environmental impact of the liberalisation of air transport, with a view to creating the conditions for greater harmonisation in this area."
"Finally, it will be necessary to develop more specifically targeted measures by the European Social Fund."
"In effect this means that the programming documents drawn up by the Commission and the Member States will have to be adjustable so as to cater for crises in any sector."
"This will allow prompt reaction to any increase in the number of people seeking jobs, so that they can be retrained as soon as possible and their knowledge and skills brought up to the necessary levels rapidly and appropriately."
"The problem lies in encouraging people to be adaptable."
"Among the other vital requirements I will also mention the need to implement an information monitoring system at Community level, with regard to redundancy decisions, the need to increase consultation with social partners, and finally the need to introduce crisis-forecasting management into the European Change Observatory set up on 23 October in Dublin."
"In this respect, it is important that the 'Employment and Social Policy' Council meeting on 3 December should study the Commission' s communication on the restructuring of undertakings, which the Commission announced at the time of the Marks & Spencer crisis last summer."
"It will be a question of having to consider the concept of the social responsibility of undertakings in the context of restructuring measures."
"The December 'Employment' Council will certainly enable an agreement to be reached on the directive on informing and consulting workers, which also represents a definite step in the right direction in the form of the consultation of representative bodies in times of crisis."
"Finally, looking at the long-term prospects, the challenge we are facing also includes the task of ensuring that civil aviation becomes a sustainable activity."
"Security and safety, economic stability and respect for the environment are the essential components of sustainable development in this sector, which leads me to my last point: the need to make progress in the environmental aspect of the sector."
"The responses to economic and social difficulties that are needed in the short term, like the measures on security standards that are needed in the medium term, must in no way prejudice the task of continuing and expanding the efforts being made in this area."
"Environmentally responsible growth in this sector will, in the long term, be the vital condition for the survival of this form of transport."
"We made considerable progress at the ICAO General Assembly in Montreal in September."
"We must take advantage of what the European Union obtained on that occasion - and believe me it was not a foregone conclusion - in other words that consideration should be given to local, national and regional differences when defining these public policies, in order to adopt European regulations which effectively guarantee a high level of environmental protection."
"We must put into practice the progress that has been made in policy, in particular by rapidly adopting adequate anti-noise measures, but also by adopting measures to reduce greenhouse effect gases, in the context of the undertaking that we gave in Kyoto and confirmed in Bonn and Marrakesh."
"Even though European airlines have been less badly affected than their American counterparts, we must ensure that we put in place, at Community level, a regulatory framework that will ensure that they really are viable, and this means in particular revising the competition rules."
"Moreover, it must be possible, in a crisis, for the regulatory framework to guarantee a high degree of social protection."
"Together we must build up a civil aviation industry which is sustainable at economic, social and environmental levels."
"We must act, and we must act quickly, in order to guarantee that from now on civil aviation will once again become the bridge between peoples and the bringer of peace that it always has been."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, European air transport policy had and still has serious structural weaknesses."
"The events of 11 September have exacerbated the current situation exponentially."
"The number of passengers on the main carriers has fallen dramatically and has now bottomed out at 20% lower than in 2000."
"The airlines recently announced 30,000 redundancies."
"Two national carriers, Sabena and Swissair, have folded."
"When Sabena folded, 7,500 people lost their jobs from one day to the next."
"And we cannot exclude the possibility of further job losses in the industry at European level."
"Last week I met European partners representing all sectors of the air transport industry."
"Their description was most interesting."
"The airlines operate in a global village."
"A global village which has been hit by an earthquake and all its buildings, both large and small, strong and weak, are teetering."
"So how are we to cope at European level with part of a problem of truly global dimensions?"
"I think that it is important for us to send out a clear message, and I agree completely with Minister Durant here: we shall not be doing the industry any favours if we allow the economic crisis provoked by 11 September to delay decisions to restructure and unify the industry."
"The main message must be that the proper response is to restructure the airline industry."
"It is important that we agree that we cannot help the industry with a massive injection of public funds but, at the same time, we must understand that we cannot restructure in a time of crisis without additional economic and social tools."
"The communication which the European Commission approved on 10 October entitled ""The repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the air transport industry"" is an initial reaction to this extraordinary situation and therefore focuses on restoring confidence by planning additional safety measures, coupled with economic measures to support the industry."
"Of course, I fully agree with the Minister that, because of our institutional configuration and specific policies in the European Union, we are unable, unlike the United States of America, to react directly and support European airlines."
"This communication contains a number of important points and measures."
"The European Commission is examining measures, in the light of state aid rules, on compensating airlines for the damage which they sustained over the four days during which American airspace was closed."
"This compensation must be granted without exception to all airlines licensed by the Member State."
"The European Commission will examine various measures, again in the light of state aid rules, on compensation for the cost of additional insurance and continuing state intervention up to the end of this year."
"The Commission is currently checking a number of medium-term monthly insurance plans on the basis of competition rules and internal market legislation relating to insurance."
"And it is examining the possibility of a longer-term solution to the problem of insurance within the framework of the European Commission."
"Finally, the Commission and the Council of Transport Ministers have called on the Member States to check that third world carriers can provide the same level of insurance cover as that which is going to be required of European airlines."
"If we are to be able to restructure and stabilise the air transport industry as we must, the problem of ownership and control needs to be resolved now more than ever."
"The restrictions imposed on airlines by traditional rules of ownership and control in bilateral air transport service agreements make mergers and acquisitions and external investment very difficult, even if the companies are in dire economic straits, which is why the Community desperately needs a dynamic common policy in the external relations sector."
"The European Commission has been asking the Council for years now for negotiating guidelines on an EU/USA air traffic agreement in order to set the procedure in question in motion."
"This sort of agreement would benefit our air transport industry."
"Finally, given the rules on landing and take-off slots, the Commission takes the view that the situation is highly critical and agrees to propose that airport coordinators allow carriers to keep the slots which they did not use during the summer of 2001 and during the current 2001/2002 winter period for the same programming periods next year."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has set out the specific problems and the need for a direct European policy and agreement at European level very clearly."
"I will not go over them again; instead I shall focus a little longer on the question of the social crisis."
"As I mentioned earlier, there have already been 30,000 redundancies in the space of a few weeks across all sectors and we are currently conducting a study to see what the repercussions will be on sectors working with the airlines."
"The analysis of the cause of the redundancies is throwing up many and varied factors."
"Some are due to the crisis per se, which started last spring."
"Others are due to a fall in demand."
"Some to the delay in adjusting capacity in order to correct the ratio between supply and demand after years of strong growth."
"It is difficult to analyse the causes for all the redundancies immediately, but we shall certainly have to see where we can intervene directly and what part the European Union and the European Commission should play."
"First of all, there is a relatively complete legal framework which allows companies to negotiate with their employees in order to find new working models in a bid to keep redundancies to a minimum."
"British Airways and Alitalia, which have made a great many employees redundant, are already working with and keeping the workers' representatives abreast of developments."
"But of course legislation cannot stop the current round of redundancies, which is why available Community resources need to be used to deal with the fallout from the crisis."
"There is an economic tool at European level - I refer to the European Social Fund - which can be used in three ways: first through the European Employment Strategy, for training and retraining employees made redundant or, often, in order to help them maintain their skills, which they risk losing on such a specialised job market."
"The second way is by subsidising salaried employees whose jobs are at risk."
"The problem of small and medium-sized satellite enterprises surrounding the airlines has already been raised."
"The third way is for local and regional authorities to mobilise action programmes through the Social Fund to deal, for example, with the closure of small airports or local problems caused by redundancies or crises in specific sectors, so that they can be dealt with at regional level."
"As far as the financial regulations for the European Social Fund are concerned, it is regulated at European level, but we have the flexibility to redirect funds in times of crisis or in special circumstances."
"Certain measures for Sabena will be jointly funded by the European Social Fund."
"These are the legislative and social tools currently available."
"Of course, one of the most important tools in times of crisis is social dialogue and discussion with the social partners."
"The European Commission set the European sectoral dialogue on air transport issues in motion following the crisis on 11 September."
"We have already held meetings with the social partners through the Social Dialogue Committee and it has been decided that a European workshop will be held on 3 December, attended by all the sectors at social partner level and by national delegates from the fifteen Member States, in order to discuss the specific question of the repercussions on employment and the nascent social problems, in a bid to reach a joint agreement on measures which we can take into direct consideration."
"Madam President, at this time of crisis, when it is hard to find answers and a recipe for recovery, we need proper and direct collaboration both between the European institutions and between the European institutions and the social partners before taking further steps."
"Mr President, the reason for this urgent resolution is self-evident."
"I should like firstly to thank the representatives from the other groups involved in drawing together this compromise."
"It is true to say that since the attacks on the USA in September the aviation industry has suffered catastrophic consequences, not least on passenger confidence, but in addition for the tens of thousands of jobs which have already been lost worldwide and in particular across Europe."
"Unfortunately this situation is not confined to the airline industry."
"The knock-on effects are now evident, both in the aerospace manufacturing sector and in tourism."
"In my own country, the United Kingdom, the slow recovery following the foot-and-mouth epidemic has suffered a major setback which is truly hard to bear."
"Whatever the failures of some of the companies in the European Union to face the challenges of the business world, the vast majority of businesses have, through no fault of their own, found themselves on the brink of bankruptcy, or even worse."
"I recall my own government, along with other national leaders, insisting within three or four days of the incident that help would be given as quickly as possible."
"Unfortunately, apart from the short-term assistance concerning insurance cover, which should have been 180 days as at the outset in the United States, no financial help has been forthcoming."
"I am not aware of any compensation for financial losses due to the closure of US airspace and airports, or for the additional security measures that the aviation industry has been expected to put in place."
"It is Member States which should assume responsibility for security costs."
"In short, the situation is a disgrace, not least because job losses outlined two months ago by many businesses are already escalating due to the lack of help."
"We in this Parliament want action - and we want it now."
"We are not interested in waiting for some case-by-case consideration by the Commission which may be agreed some time in the future."
"We demand that interim financial aid packages be made available now to those eligible."
"In conclusion, I must inform the Commission and the Council that it is my intention to keep this issue at the top of the agenda and I expect at the very least a report back to this Parliament at the November II part-session on the progress that has been made."
"I hope that fellow MEPs will support the comments I have made, because we must remember that thousands of livelihoods are at stake."
"Inaction is not an option, nor is a lecture on environmental issues, because at the rate we are going we will not have an aviation industry to worry about."
"Madam President, I came to the Chamber this morning with a prepared speech about the situation in the airline industry."
"I have radically altered that, in view of what I have heard from the President-in-Office and the Commissioner this morning."
"Frankly, what we have heard is totally unacceptable."
"We are faced with a classic scenario of the Council of Ministers fiddling like some modern-day Nero while the aviation industry of the European Union burns."
"Madam President-in-Office, we are in a deep crisis."
"You, more than anybody else, should know that from your own Member State."
"Airlines have gone bankrupt."
"Others are on the brink of bankruptcy - and what response do we get?"
"We get a suggestion that the Commission can go and sit down with the Americans and talk to them about the aid they are giving to try and level the playing field."
"By the time that happens there will not be a European civil aviation industry left to put on that level playing field!"
"We need action now."
"We do not want fiddling at the edges, we want direct action so that our civil aviation industry can survive and have a future of its own."
"The response from the United States after the events of 11 September was direct and straight to the point."
"They made USD 5 billion available to their airlines straight away and offered another USD 10 billion in indirect aid to help them over other crises should they arise."
"And what did we do?"
"We fiddled at the edges and said, ""Well, we might do this"" and, as Mrs Foster said, ""Well, we said you could pay compensation for the lost days""."
"That is not enough."
"We need direct action now."
"What appalled me today was the tone of the contribution from the Commission and the President-in-Office."
"It is as if they are accepting that airlines will have to go bust and that thousands of jobs will have to go, without doing anything to stop it."
"Before today I suspected that Member States wanted to use this crisis to consolidate the industry, to get rid of some of the airlines."
"Well, today the President-in-Office all but admitted that this is the case."
"If that is so, then I condemn it."
"Members of the trade unions are with us today in the gallery."
"I say to them: I give you the support of my group in the quest to keep a European civil aviation industry alive."
"Sadly, from what I have heard today, a similar commitment from the Council of Ministers seems to be a good way off."
"I just wonder, Madam President-in-Office, whether people in history will remember the Belgian presidency of the year 2001 as the presidency that oversaw the demise of Europe's civil aviation industry."
"Madam President, I feel that a situation such as this requires us to keep calm."
"My group supported the motion and is prepared to take part in any way it can in any action addressing the current situation quickly and immediately - and, I hope, effectively."
"Three lines of action must be pursued: defending European industry fully against any unfair competition from the United States in the future; speeding up the restructuring of European industry itself; and meeting the obligations, which we had, moreover, already established before the crisis, to ensure, in any event, improved conditions of safety and respect for the environment than those hitherto in operation."
"Europe has many objectives, which it must pursue simultaneously if we are to pull ourselves out of this situation."
"This certainly means that we need the Council to confer a negotiating mandate upon the Commission as soon as possible, we need to be able to speak with one voice before the United States and we need to be able to monitor what happens on that front."
"In other words, we must either defend ourselves or ensure that we all play according to the same rules in this situation."
"However, the need to defend ourselves against attack from an industry which has taken less time to complete restructuring, which has regained its competitiveness first, must not be used an excuse not to change the current situation."
"Therefore, we need to honour our aid commitments, within the limits laid down for aid for the past financial year, for insurance costs and for the extra security costs, but no more than this."
"We must consistently maintain state aid within this framework and, what is more, be very astute in our management of the restructuring phases."
"There is no doubt that European industry will have to go through some rather painful stages as it re-establishes itself and, therefore, it is quite likely that there may be more bankruptcies."
"However, there are different ways of handling them."
"That is a fundamental point, one on which it might be appropriate for both the Council of Ministers and the Commission to do more, to produce a few more proposals on how the transitions are to be handled."
"One tiny example: the bankruptcy of Sabena or the restructuring of the new Sabena has led to a debate now on the allocation of slots on European routes."
"There are small, competitive companies able to take on, to employ people who would be willing to take part in co-sharing operations on European routes."
"Well then, we must not restrict ourselves to defence but be open to these possibilities too, in short, to a faster developing market: we must have the courage and the ability to keep up with it with active as well as defensive measures."
"In this way, I feel we will also be able to meet the needs of the trade unions and workers very well, aware that this is the right way to ensure that there genuinely will be jobs in the long term."
"One last point: this issue affects the services related to the aviation industry as well as airlines; it affects the whole tourist industry."
"If we do not succeed in restoring the confidence of our fellow citizens and persuading them to start flying again, much of the work we are doing will be wasted."
"I have not yet heard anyone address this matter, but I feel it is the final task before us all."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my group supports the policies set out by the Council Presidency and the Commission."
"I believe that we should be careful not to miss the point here."
"The air transport sector is experiencing a cyclical and structural crisis, as has been pointed out, but the whole of the European economy - and of the world economy - is also in crisis."
"The real response to the employment problem is therefore, of course, to relaunch growth and general policies of social solidarity and job creation."
"As far as the air transport sector is concerned, and in connection with the meeting on the social dialogue referred to by Mrs Diamantopoulou, I believe that the deterioration in working conditions and wages that is starting to occur in this sector is obviously a point to which we must pay a great deal of attention."
"Moreover, at the level of the European Union, we would like to see the Community' s competition policy adopted and, far from preventing the restructuring of the sector, coming to the aid of that sector, and we should also like this medium-term restructuring policy to be compatible with the policies set out in the White Paper on transport policy, in other words the development of a multi-mode transport policy which reflects, in the medium term, the real situation regarding costs for all sectors as a whole."
"Finally, and I believe that it is necessary to draw attention to this point, this Parliament has always voted, by a clear majority, against any spiralling in state aids."
"I would find it hard to understand if the majority of this House were to unleash a spiralling growth in state aid to one particular sector."
"Finally, on the subject of the United States, let us be clear among ourselves."
"The United States of America have presented us with a policy which is a fait accompli."
"Their position on aid to their air transport sector is unacceptable and contrary to fair competition at international level."
"Since we cannot, apparently, take the issue to the WTO, it is essential that in the context of the overall partnership between the United States and Europe, the European Union should be able to protect those legitimate interests which will, in the long term, work to the benefit of both the American and the European airlines."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, the economic and employment situation in the airline industry and in the related industrial and services sectors is critical."
"Although this situation was not caused solely by the events of 11 September, it was made much more acute as a result."
"Air passengers' confidence has fallen leading to a reduction in passenger numbers, losses have been incurred because of the closure of American airspace and airports, insurance cover has been withdrawn and there has been a decline in the numbers of tourists from the USA and the Far East: these are the main causes, as is the cancellation or postponing of orders for new aircraft."
"The fundamental causes of this crisis are, however, of a structural nature: crippling competition between the airlines, built-in overcapacity, a general economic recession and bad decisions by management."
"This motion for a European Parliament resolution refers to a host of necessary measures, for example compensation for the closure of airspace and airports, financial support or guarantees from the Member States to compensate for insurance cover being withdrawn, proposals on providing financial support to the European air transport sector so as to establish a level playing field with the United States and strategies to safeguard or create jobs."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left supports this motion, although we are aware that it is intended as a very short-term measure and can only constitute a first step, but a step which should be taken immediately."
"In the medium and long term, we need a harmonised European airspace, higher standards of quality and safety, highly trained staff, high social standards and no low wages."
"The mass redundancies which were announced in the air transport sector even before 11 September are absolutely unacceptable to us."
"We need a strategy to coordinate the different modes of transport; we need an all-embracing European transport strategy."
"This problem cannot be solved on a mode-by-mode basis."
"Mr President, after the shock of 11 September, the tragic scale of the crisis in the aviation industry and its related services was already apparent, but the situation has become even more complex with the events of recent days."
"We are now faced with a problem: the problem of the crisis in general and a problem of safety too, which, if the theory on the plane crash should prove to be true, would prompt us to focus more closely on the issue of servicing of aircraft for safety purposes."
"Without a doubt, the state of war and the economics of war then precipitated events into a genuine crisis for the airlines which has already had extreme consequences for Sabena and Swissair."
"As has already been pointed out, the crisis, due to many different causes, not least - there is no doubt - clear strategic mismanagement of the sector, with airlines (which we might describe as too individualistic) unwilling to form consortia, which would have allowed them to streamline human, structural and financial resources; we have seen pricing policies which are misguided and often seeking to evade competition law; there are airports - such as Malpensa, to quote an example from my country - which are unreliable in terms of safety as well."
"It is clear today that, in the current situation, the issue has reached dramatic, critical proportions, with the loss of at least 30 thousand jobs in Europe and 180 thousand jobs worldwide."
"In Italy, my country' s national airline company has contemplated recapitalisation."
"It is preparing itself to take draconian measures, with a further 1 000 job cuts on top of the 2 500 already announced."
"Italiatour, Eurofly and the IT services company Sigma Travel will be drastically reduced in size, if not abolished."
"The recapitalisation will have to be endorsed by Brussels."
"The Commission had already authorised, on 17 October, payment of a public subsidy of EUR 387 million, but Alitalia needs EUR 1.5 billion and we do not know how useful the shares created by the Treasury by issuing bonds will be."
"Strengthening commercial links with Air France or joining the Skyteam consortium are likely to be more effective in terms of structural reform."
"In conclusion, we endorse the joint motion for a resolution and we feel that the situation calls for various different types of action from the European Union, extremely urgent action which, with the precious help of the European social partners, will succeed in firmly stopping the severely critical situation from further deteriorating now."
"Subsequently, however, it will be necessary to plan action to modernise and streamline the sector and to take clear, incisive measures to boost tourism, which, as has already been pointed out, is a sector which, all too often, to be honest, is discussed at length but in which very little is as yet being done."
"Lastly, we hope that the forthcoming reflections on the White Paper on transport will lead to resolute, incisive undertakings to support the transport and tourism sector' s economy, helping the many workers and their families, in particular, who must not be allowed to suffer further misfortune."
"Madam President, the terrorist massacres of 11 September and last Monday' s aircraft disaster have jolted us into an awareness of the transience of life and to the way in which our society is interconnected."
"An attack in the United States is also an attack on the rest of the civilised world, and vice versa."
"Now the effects are making themselves increasingly felt, we must also look to solve the economic implications."
"In our opinion, the solution should fit into the line that the European Union has adopted in the transport sector."
"In principle, businesses must operate without direct government subsidies."
"Whether or not we should make an exception in this case should, however, be placed in the correct context."
"After all, aviation is a worldwide market."
"It is not acceptable, therefore, for European companies to go under because governments refuse to grant emergency aid, while elsewhere, government participation keeps companies afloat."
"In view of the measures which the United States has taken, the zero option has been ruled out for the European Union."
"We will need to establish, therefore, how far we can, want, and are able to, go, and the sooner the better."
"This question is not restricted to aviation. Indeed, in addition to aviation, there are all kinds of related industries, including tourism, that have been hit hard."
"We must also distinguish between short-term and long-term measures."
"In the first instance, aid must remain restricted to the industry affected and to the damage which is the direct result of 11 September."
"The payment of insurance costs is logical and, in principle, a certain compensation for lost income is also necessary, because otherwise there would probably only be a few airline companies left in the European Union."
"However, that does not mean that we will prevent already financially unstable businesses from folding under the veil of compensation."
"I would now like to focus on the longer term."
"Since aviation has acquired a global character and attractive services are on offer, businesses are increasingly forced to seek economies of scale."
"As a result, fewer companies will remain in business, not only in the European Union, but also outside."
"The sector will then become truly global."
"National and bilateral legislation, as well as certain existing rights, must be tailored to this."
"It is not national claims, but the market that plays a decisive role in respect of such rights."
"In that light, I endorse the measures which the European Commission is proposing and I expect that they will also be able to benefit the European Union in other areas."
"Madam President, the bankruptcy of the Belgian airline company Sabena a few days ago is not only the biggest bankruptcy in Belgian history, but it is first and foremost a human and social tragedy for between approximately 7 500 and 12 000 workers."
"It has already been said, and it is obvious, that Sabena is not an isolated incident."
"There are a huge number of airline companies that are going through very difficult times, and the events of 11 September have only made matters worse."
"I am aware of this, but with regard to Sabena, it has to be said that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Durant, has kept two fundamental facts from this Parliament."
"Firstly, Sabena has been continuously loss making for the last 40 years, except for one year, and that was probably thanks to an accountancy trick."
"For the past 40 years, the taxpayers have had to inject no less than BEF 62 billion into that company."
"Secondly, the cause."
"Sabena was a Belgian public company with all the hallmarks of the Belgian State and of the Parti Socialiste."
"That translated into political profiteering, political appointments of the manifestly incompetent and political interference by the Belgian Royal House to keep the company in French-speaking hands."
"For that reason, the alliance with KLM was sabotaged. Everyone knows that in my country."
"In fact, parliament is currently setting up a parliamentary inquiry committee in order to scrutinise years of mismanagement, and, in my country, this is saying something."
"We are all agreed that the airline industry is having a bumpy ride, and we must find a solution in Europe on the basis of a policy of ""Europe first"" as long as the Americans are putting ""America first"" ."
"However, in the Sabena dossier, we must first of all identify those responsible, notably in the Belgian Royal House and in the successive Belgian Governments."
"Mr President, needless to say, airline companies, the aviation industry and tourism are the primary and most visible victims of 11 September, but let us not forget that outside tourism, many small- and medium-sized enterprises and their workers in the supply industry and in the geographical vicinity of airports, will also be directly affected by the tragedy."
"In Belgium, the small- and medium-sized enterprises expect one redundancy per job lost at Sabena."
"In our view, it should be ensured that government aid, in whatever form, benefits all industries affected."
"We are also relying on the fact that the measures which the Commission can take are carried out promptly and on a large scale."
"The following measures spring to mind in the first instance: the creating of scope for government investments in the safety of air transport, the prompt handling of specific financial aid dossiers and extended flexibility, albeit limited in time, in slot management."
"The extremely difficult situation should also prompt the Commission to clamp down on competition-distorting practices in transatlantic relations."
"In this day and age, we are dependent on many factors."
"If they all go wrong at the same time, we will end up with a right mess, and Sabena is a tragic case in point."
"As a Belgian MP, I would urge that DAT be treated like any other airline company that is being affected by the effects of 11 September."
"DAT should also be seen as a company that is being restructured, and must have access to the same facilities which other companies would have at their disposal in the same situation."
"Finally, I wish the workers and independent businesses that are the victims of this situation a great deal of strength, and I hope that we can offer them better prospects in the short term."
"Mr President, faced with the social catastrophe which the collapse of Sabena represents for Belgium, I should like to add a little humanity to this sitting, by dedicating my first words to all those who, from one day to the next, found themselves, to put it bluntly, deprived of their jobs."
"I would ask those who would seek to use this specific issue in order to criticise public enterprises to measure well the responsibilities of all those concerned."
"Yes, Europe is responsible when, along with the Commission, certain parties urge rapid, inhumane and brutal liberalisation, and yes, Europe now appears to everyone to be the real driving force behind this process."
"People no longer want this kind of Europe."
"They now want to construct with us a social Europe, the Europe that we defended at Lisbon, which develops convergence indicators in order to increase employment and combat unemployment, in other words a Europe which refuses to be dictated to by the market."
"The 12 000 Sabena workers who were dismissed at the beginning of this month are the first victims of this wave of liberalisation in civil aviation."
"The results of other European companies are giving cause for concern."
"Thousands of people are afraid of being thrown out of work, and they cannot understand the intransigence of the European Commission over repayment times for bridging loans to the Belgian company, while the United States are spending billions of dollars on subsidising their national airlines so that they can keep their European slots."
"They find it unacceptable that the Commission should give preference to sanctions and ukases, in the name of the virtues of liberalism and the market, while at the same time that out-of-control liberalism culminates in companies in Europe closing down one after the other."
"By setting up the Lisbon process, the Community authorities and the Member States have proved that they are capable of taking into account the human and territorial consequences implied by every decision."
"Such blind liberalisation will do nothing to advance the cause of the European idea or to increase confidence in Europe' s institutions and in our plans for peace and social progress."
"It will inevitably lead the public to reject this European and simplistic vision."
"Commissioner, the European Parliament' s vote on the Langen report two days ago, confirmed that there are certain sectors that should not be open to competition, and among those sectors are the sectors with which you are concerned."
"Let us be clear about this, we do not reject the idea of modern and efficient public enterprises, and we do not want them to be sacrificed and ridiculed."
"We are waiting for a forward-looking vision of economic development, a project which is humane and intelligent, and which will enable sustainable development to be achieved."
"I hope that that is what we shall see on 3 December."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, what has happened with Sabena in my country is very tragic, and I am pleased that the Belgian Government is making a huge effort to try to cushion the direct and indirect social effects."
"Needless to say, that is never entirely possible with a bankruptcy of this scale, but it is important nevertheless that an effort is also being made indirectly, in the area of training and in-service training."
"I should also like to ask the Commissioner to advise soon whether something will also be done at European level, what the amounts will be that are involved and what kind of efforts will be made in respect of various airline companies."
"Sabena is, of course, a spectacular case, but social tragedies are also unfolding in other airline companies."
"That is where a European approach and European support are needed, so that people know that Europe is doing something, for my fellow MEP quite rightly pointed out that at the moment we have a one-sided image of Europe which, in my view, should be rectified."
"One thing is clear to me."
"In my opinion, the role of the Member States and of an individual approach to aviation per Member State is over."
"We have been saying this for years, even if some people in this Parliament still believe that a national approach must be maintained."
"That era should finally come to an end, in my view."
"We must opt for a European approach."
"National state aid to airline companies makes no sense whatsoever."
"We must decide very quickly on whether - and I share your view in this, Mr Simpson - European aid to a European sector is possible and on the conditions under which that can be done."
"However, I do not think the problem is solved by saying: OK, they put USD 5 billion on the table, we will put EUR 5 billion on the table."
"In my view, the problem will not be solved in that way, for this financial solution must be accompanied by a simultaneous restructuring scheme."
"There was no point in getting the Belgian Government, or possibly the European Government, to bail out Sabena once again and to keep it in the air."
"Sabena had to restructure and do something, which happened in too painful a manner."
"They have waited for too long to do this rationally."
"Instead, it is now happening in a chaotic manner."
"That is unfortunate, but I believe we should learn from this."
"The fact that Sabena is the first national airline company to go bankrupt in the Union speaks volumes."
"We tend to hold on to national airline companies, and those days are over, as various MEPs have stated today."
"We must adopt a European approach."
"That implies air traffic control, security measures and agreements with third countries."
"Mrs Durant, I am pleased that you are offering a window in this respect, but I hope that you can convince all your colleagues, for that is exactly what the opposition in the Council was about."
"Member States are reluctant to relinquish this authority, and refuse to join forces at European level, and we are now paying the price for this. the Americans are able to adopt a joint policy, but we are not."
"You are not represented at international level when aviation is at issue."
"It is the fifteen Member States that conclude agreements with open skies etc. and that compete with each other politically."
"I hope, therefore, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that you will be able to convince your colleagues."
"And I hope that everyone here in this Parliament is convinced of the fact that we must at long last respond at European, rather than national, level."
"Mr President, I actually believe that, faced with the recession in the aviation industry and in air transport, we need some strong decisions in order to restore confidence and open up real prospects."
"I personally am not satisfied with the Commission' s response, which favours the speeding up of restructuring in the air transport sector."
"I am in favour of a European approach. We can discuss and comment on the content of that approach later."
"As for restoring confidence, I believe that confidence is actually a product of safety, and the safety dimension in this sector, as in others, is dependent upon the expertise, competence and qualifications of the staff employed."
"Commissioner, I am absolutely in agreement with you on the urgent need to develop the social dialogue, but we cannot just be content with a social dialogue at a time when people are facing the problem of redundancies."
"Is anyone really listening to the employees concerned?"
"They too have comments, and thoughts, and proposals, and in view of what we have just decided regarding the consultation of workers, perhaps that could be implemented much more rapidly."
"I also believe that restoring confidence involves learning lessons from the present crisis and putting a stop to the process of liberalisation that is currently underway."
"Frankly, I do not believe that the liberalisation that has developed in this sector has contributed towards its development. In fact I would rather say that it has contributed towards its difficulties."
"Restoring confidence also means, at any given moment, taking responsibility for providing assistance."
"I believe that the limited targeted measures are insufficient to cope with this crisis."
"Since the American aid is considerable, I believe that there should be compensatory aid in the air transport sector, but that it should also be made conditional upon maintaining jobs."
"Finally, I believe that we also need to open up prospects."
"It seems to me that among our long-term prospects we should be looking at how the European Union can work, not towards concentrations, but towards the development of international cooperation, on safety and the management of air traffic, between the airlines and the public authorities."
"Mr President, I believe that we should also increase cooperation between air and rail transport, and that airports should be integrated into the trans-European networks."
"Mr President, the terrorist attacks in September have disrupted the operations of many airline companies in Europe, resulting in job losses in the aviation industry and a reduction in the number of overseas tourists coming to Europe."
"We want to ensure that we retain competitive airline companies in Europe."
"I agree with the key proposals included in the compromise resolutions that are before us today."
"It is important that the Commission works out a set of proposals which make it possible for the European airline industry to withstand the competition resulting from the massive help which the American Government is giving American airlines at this time."
"We must ensure that the European aviation industry receives equal treatment vis-à-vis our American airline counterparts, particularly when it comes to addressing transatlantic arrangements."
"For example, from an Irish perspective, Aer Lingus is highly dependent on transatlantic travel."
"Other EU airlines also make a substantial profit from their transatlantic routes."
"It is important that these EU airlines can compete against the American airlines which have received state aid from the American Government in recent times."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like to comment on just two aspects, socially acceptable and economically reasonable restructuring in the aviation industry."
"Madam President-in-Office, you were too generous in your comments just now when you said that the Council had in fact responded consistently."
"I have my doubts about this, Madam President-in-Office, and I should like to urge you in the strongest possible terms to ensure that the same subsidies - whether it be for insurance cover, whether it be compensation, or whether it be possible restructuring aid - are granted or not granted in all of the Member States."
"It is not acceptable for airlines to be supported in a particular way in one Member State and not in another when all are supposed to be competing fairly in an internal market."
"This cannot work."
"We want to establish fair terms of competition between the airlines."
"As President-in-Office of the Council you must ensure that this is the case and you, Commissioner, must, if necessary, take the Member States to court if there are distortions of competition here which destroy the internal market."
"Secondly, Madam President-in-Office, you rightly referred to the fact that restructuring is necessary."
"Probably there will be a number of larger global players and some regional airlines."
"They cannot be bound to Member State A or Member State B. We need a functioning European and global air transport market."
"This can only happen, Madam President-in-Office, if the Member States cede their responsibilities for take-off and landing rights to the Community and if we administer the take-off and landing rights together."
"Only then can we give our airlines a chance to compete on fair terms in the global market."
"I would earnestly request that in the next few weeks you do all you can to bring your influence to bear on your Member States on these two points."
"Mr President, in making our decisions on the aviation industry in Europe we have to take account of the interconnectedness of our economies and politics in Europe and globally as well."
"The fact is that Aer Lingus in Ireland had already been hit by the downturn in the high-tech industries where much of the lucrative business travel for Aer Lingus had already been badly hit because businessmen and women were simply not travelling back and forth across the Atlantic."
"Clearly, 11 September virtually wiped out that business."
"Tourism is also a major linchpin in the economy of Ireland."
"Our airline is an important asset in that area of the industry."
"If we allow that to go down the drain, who is going to service the Irish tourist economy?"
"The Council and the Commission are, I am afraid, confused."
"They are minimalist and grudging in their response to this crisis for the Irish airline."
"That is perceived to be so by the workers of Aer Lingus and the Irish people in general."
"We will pay the price in Europe for that perception."
"It is important that we recognise that the national carrier in every Member State in Europe is as important as the national anthem or the national flag."
"You can shake your head, but that is the reality."
"We have to take that into account."
"We may regret it, but we must take it into account in dealing with this crisis."
"Finally, there are four things I would ask the Commission and the Council to address."
"There is an urgent need for a reply to the Irish Government's request to the Commission for permission to assist the Irish airline with the compensation that is due as a result of 11 September."
"There is an urgent need for the reform of the competition rules."
"There is an urgent need for assistance to help companies create alliances at a European level, which will ensure that the national carriers are not annihilated."
"Finally, we need firm proposals for the social fund package that has been talked about here today."
"Parliament should be discussing those proposals when we next meet in Strasbourg in December, not next June."
"Mr President, the fact of the matter is that, even in the air transport industry, the law of the jungle and the savage neo-liberal policy which applies are such that mergers have taken place and national airlines which enjoyed periods of strong growth in the past have gone bankrupt, a blatant example being the bankruptcy of Swissair and Sabena."
"And no doubt others will follow. In the medium term at least, two or three large airlines will survive in Europe to share the pickings with the American behemoths which, with the connivance of our governments, have taken pains to penetrate and take over the European market."
"The terrorist attacks on 11 September have intensified the crisis and been used as an excuse for cutbacks and mass redundancies."
"And in what is already a dismal situation for many national carriers, along comes the Commission to administer the coup de grace by prohibiting state aid, at a time when the US government is injecting its behemoths with massive amounts in aid."
"There can be no doubt that this situation is here to stay and, the more capital is concentrated, the more the workers and consumers will be expected to pick up the tab in the form of job losses and more and more expensive tickets."
"That is why the only solution is to support the fight to get this policy reversed and get rid of those who apply it."
"Mr President, we have to restore public confidence in aviation and we have to let the market decide what happens to the airlines themselves."
"Restoring public confidence means getting security screening right and improving the quality of staff, training, job procedures, pay and conditions."
"It means, perhaps, ensuring that there is a state-run security operation at airports and paying accordingly."
"That may well create more jobs."
"So far as the airlines and their financial viability are concerned, we do not want more intervention, more bureaucracy and more delay."
"We need targeted assistance in areas like insurance and the cost of security."
"We must let the market decide what the future of the airline industry shall be."
"As was said earlier, Sabena made a profit in only one year out of the many years that it has been in existence."
"Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Air France and KLM are not far behind."
"Why the devil should we support Aer Lingus when Ryanair can make money without any difficulties at all - like Easyjet, like GO, like Buzz?"
"All those airlines can make money at a difficult time."
"Why should we therefore bail out the Sabenas and the Aer Linguses with their overcapacity, with too many routes, too few passengers and too much state pride?"
"I have two specific questions that I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Firstly, I am led to believe that there are problems with the Sabena slots that have been offered, in Britain, for example, to British Midland and British European Airways."
"They may have them for a short time but there is some suggestion from the coordinator that they may be lost in six months time if DAT is reformed and wants those slots back."
"That is unacceptable."
"If Sabena cannot fill those slots then others should be allowed to use them."
"Secondly, what is being done to ensure that the staff at Brussels airport does not restrict the movement of those new-slot airlines as a result of picketing and delays at the airport?"
"We need guarantees of freedom of movement on the ground as well as in the air."
"On the one hand, in the name of what is in this case totally blinkered liberalisation, they require full adherence to the State aid system, which prevents any action being taken to support airlines. On the other hand, there is a genuine danger that we will find ourselves - there have already been 30 000 job losses within the space of 30 days - with 100 000 jobs being lost in 100 days, in a sector which, moreover, enjoys little in the way of social protection."
"For two months, we have been saying that 11 September changed the world and the balance of society."
"It would be a shame if we were to miss the political significance of this and fail to review the order of our priorities."
"In European integration based on social cohesion, in a Europe built on the fundamental principle of work, what priority should we today give to the risk of an uncontrolled wave of unemployment?"
"Do we still think we can prevent the inevitable market crisis?"
"We are all aware that this crisis has roots in the past, that it is more than just a consequence of the events of 11 September, that it is also the result of excessive market fragmentation."
"However, we do not feel that going to the opposite extreme - bringing about a huge merger which would ultimately only save three national airlines: the French, British and German companies - would be a healthy solution."
"We are actually not so very far off this situation, considering what happened to Sabena and the engineered drop in the nominal value of the shares of a large number of airlines which are in danger of selling at a loss."
"A prime example is Alitalia."
"Lastly, Mr President, I welcome the code of conduct for US airlines intended to avoid piracy in the market, provided that, as others have said, the European governments do genuinely intend to enforce it, for otherwise it will be just another list of unfulfilled good intentions."
"Mr President, the International Transport Agency anticipates that a total of 200 000 people will lose their jobs in the airline industry worldwide in the wake of the attacks."
"This organisation also expects that the total losses incurred in this industry will amount to 7 billion this year, and that it will take twelve months before the industry will recover."
"That is what we are facing here: a worldwide crisis which has major ramifications for Europe."
"That is point one."
"Point two - and this has already been mentioned by a number of speakers - is that this industry had been in a very bad way for a long time."
"I often have to take the floor when we deal with enormous job losses, and it is always a sad occasion. This time is no exception."
"However, there is something peculiar about it this time round. Part of the guilty party is sitting directly opposite me, namely the Council itself."
"We ask in our resolution for a European airline industry and a European airline policy."
"What the Council has offered us is a policy of national carriers where everyone acts in their own self-interest and everyone wants to conclude their own agreements with the United States."
"Mr De Rossa said that the national carrier is as sacred as the national anthem."
"If that is the attitude, then we will never solve the problem, of course."
"If we all act in our own self-interest, we will be unable to reach a European solution."
"We will then end up in a frosty restructuring programme, which is exactly what is now threatening to happen."
"I think we are all agreed that that should not happen, but we must get the idea out of our heads that we can still have national carriers in this internal market."
"It is impossible to pursue sound social policy if the economic backdrop is in total disarray, and as far as that is concerned, the Council is innocent in all of this."
"The Commission has made a very good effort."
"There are many proposals before us, but these have all been rejected by the Council."
"The first thing the Council should allow the Commission to do is to talk with the United States on its own."
"If that is not done, other things should not be discussed either."
"Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September have certainly changed the face of the aviation industry and will probably have more effects in the months to come."
"Today I want to deal with the effect they are having on the regional areas of Europe, rather than the major cities like London, Birmingham and Paris, because they will survive and receive support."
"We in Northern Ireland watched with interest as Sabena pulled out, and then Aer Lingus, which provided a service from Belfast to Shannon for transatlantic flights and was used by many people in Northern Ireland."
"The Republic of Ireland's Government said it wanted greater cooperation with Northern Ireland, but the first time there is a bit of trouble, it runs away!"
"That is the kind of cooperation we Unionists have to put up with!"
"No one can persuade me that some of these large companies have not used this situation to put some of their own problems right."
"British Airways stayed in Northern Ireland and stood by its staff through bombs and bullets."
"What has it done?"
"It has pulled out of Northern Ireland as well!"
"I condemn it for that."
"I hope, Commissioner, that you will ensure that it is not allowed to keep those slots in order to open up more lucrative routes and that if other companies are prepared to start up from the regions those slots will be given to them."
"I certainly feel very strongly about this."
"I am not in favour of giving large amounts of money to bail out inefficient companies."
"To some extent Mr Atkins is right: there are other companies out there which are making money and they have to be supported."
"I say to the Commission and the Council that they cannot come here and give us a lecture."
"They will have to come back with firm and positive proposals."
"It is time for action and time for a dose of realism."
"If the Council and the Commission cannot do it now, we will harry them until they do!"
"Mr President, briefly, on the subject of the discussion that we have just heard, I do not believe that anyone here, either the Council, or the Commission, or any one of us, has exclusive rights to indignation in the face of the social problems that are occurring now for each of these airlines, and perhaps for some of them more than others."
"I am particularly well-placed to know all about that."
"I believe that this social crisis that is being experienced by a certain number of those who operate and work in the air transport sector is obviously a challenge to all of us."
"However, I also believe that, despite this challenge and the need to react to this problem, to follow the road that we took in the past, via massive state aid, would be to avoid or conceal a situation which was already in existence before 11 September."
"This is a fragile sector, in which the profit margins have been extremely low in recent years. Therefore, despite the indignation that we all feel in the face of the current social problem, I believe that to imagine that simply returning to massive structural aid will solve the problems in this sector would be to evade an obstacle which will confront us again later, in an even more dramatic form."
"I really believe, on behalf of the Council, even though this debate has only just started in the Council, that it will not be easy, and what you have said today demonstrates that."
"We well know how much Member States are attached to their national airlines and how important that attachment is, and here I am speaking more on my own account than on behalf of the Council, where we shall soon have to start these discussions."
"We have made an immediate start by giving immediate and specific responses in this sector."
"Yes, there is aid in various forms."
"There are specific and targeted forms of aid with regard to the closure of airspace, and the possibility of providing even more, on the basis of objective criteria."
"There has been aid in connection with insurance facilities."
"There are other types of aid, not financial aid, regarding the problem of time slots, so as to enable the airlines to keep their heads above water, or at least not to sink any deeper."
"There have been responses."
"I also believe that what we have done regarding the matter of security is an immediate response concerning those elements which will restore passengers' confidence in the safety and security aspects, which are obviously so essential if the public is to regain confidence."
"I therefore believe that the responses which have been given by the Council and the Commission are immediate responses."
"It is true that the social crises which we are experiencing in various European airlines, and particularly in Belgium, and which also call for social responses involving taking these problems into consideration, should not cover up the urgent need to begin a debate, within the Council, on a more structural consolidation of the sector. This is without a doubt the only way of giving to this sector, in structural terms, not only the social responses which it needs, but also economic responses, and responses which will guarantee its long-term survival, not forgetting - as some of you have mentioned - the need for multi-mode transport systems, the need to place air transport too in the context of short-distance journeys at European level, the development of the high-speed train and any other alternatives which will enable us, in that context too, to provide responses at the level of a common transport policy."
"However, I really believe that a return to massive state aid would be a step in the wrong direction, a step backwards, and a step which would, above all, risk leading us, at a later date, into even more serious difficulties."
"By contrast, we have provided specific responses, and there are other responses to come: the security regulation, which I hope we shall be able to agree on on 7 December."
"I also hope that it will be possible for Parliament to contribute its views on this subject to the debate as well."
"There is still an enormous amount of work to do, but I really think that the time has come to begin these discussions on structural consolidation, in addition to the specific responses which have already been provided and which were necessary in the very short term."
"Mr President, this has been a highly political debate in which the problem now facing all the Member States has been aired, as have the widely differing views and approaches which are reflected in both the European Parliament and the Council."
"Two major sets of issues have been debated."
"The first relates to the restructuring of the airlines."
"The second relates to the need for social intervention."
"As far as the first is concerned, I think that all the speakers agreed on the need for restructuring and for a new airline model in Europe."
"There are three points worth making here: first, the present traditional model of ownership and control obviously will not allow the degree of restructuring we would like, or rather the degree of restructuring required."
"Meaning that we need a new approach, with a more European dimension."
"The second point is that, in today's global world, Europe is not negotiating with one voice."
"This works to the detriment of the European airlines."
"And the third point relates to state aid."
"The point was made that we are debating whether or not to support the airlines and that, when we finally make our decision, it will be too late, because the European airlines will already have gone out of business."
"The law on state aid is not the Koran."
"Let us assume that a decision is taken on state aid."
"What tool do we have at European level?"
"Can we decide to give state aid to airlines?"
"Of course not."
"What we can decide at European level is a yes or a no and the facility to grant state aid then shifts to the national level."
"Meaning that we have national governments with different capabilities, different frameworks and different airlines."
"Meaning that we will probably end up with a direct distortion of competition and the internal market."
"Consequently, the state aid path is a hard path to tread as things currently stand in Europe."
"To focus on three of the points of the dialogue, I would simply highlight what was said repeatedly by the members and the Belgian minister."
"That now more than ever we need a European transport policy, not national policies which at the moment are leading nowhere fast."
"As far as the second line of approach - social policy - is concerned, I analysed the potential for intervention under the Social Fund in my first intervention."
"Policy to deal with the social fallout and employment needs to be taken, of course, at local, national and European level."
"As far as intervention under the Social Fund is concerned, as we have been asked directly to table proposals, I should like to say that, depending on their particular circumstances and the problems which redundancies cause them, the Member States will need to table proposals to change their current programme for the community support framework so that it can be approved by the Commission."
"This has already been done in other sectors with large companies being restructured both in Great Britain and France."
"Consequently, it is up to the Member States to act fast and adjust their Social Fund programmes along these lines."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Combating social exclusion"
"The next item is the report (A5-0372/2001), by Mrs Figueiredo, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between the Member States to combat social exclusion [C5-0439/2001 - 2000/0157(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as is well-known, and as the recent Commission report on social inclusion confirms, poverty remains at excessively high levels."
"Although the latest available data on incomes in the Member States does not capture the whole complexity and multi-faceted nature of the scale of poverty and social exclusion, it does show that in 1997, around 18% of the population of European Union, in other words, more than 60 million people, lived in homes in which the income was less than 60% of the average national income and that around half of these 60 million people had lived below the relative poverty threshold for three consecutive years."
"This situation shows how crucial it is that we implement a global strategy for combating poverty and social exclusion, defending human rights in all their aspects, and that this programme is an instrument that must be implemented urgently."
"One year ago, in this House, we approved at first reading the report on this Community programme of providing incentives for cooperation between Member States in the fight against social exclusion as an important aspect of the strategy to combat poverty which the Council spoke of so much at the Lisbon summit in March of 2000."
"At the same time, however, the Member States have given new commitments, with the definition, in Nice, of the objectives of the fight against poverty, and in Stockholm, where they committed themselves to promoting sustainable development and quality jobs, confirming their desire to thereby contribute to reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion."
"National plans for social inclusion were also drawn up, identifying a set of factors that considerably increase the risk of poverty and social exclusion, such as unemployment, especially long-term unemployment, low income, low-quality employment, lack of proper housing, unstable health, immigration, early school-leaving, gender inequality, discrimination and racism, disability, old age, family breakdown, drug addiction and alcoholism, and living in a highly disadvantaged area."
"Sometimes, these risk factors interact and combine over time, and it is therefore necessary to break the recurring cycle of poverty and to prevent intergenerational poverty and new forms of poverty, including info-exclusion."
"It is in this context that the programme becomes especially significant, as yet another instrument with which to fight poverty and social exclusion, which as we see, is continuing to increase."
"Lastly, after overcoming the Council' s intransigence on aspects that Parliament has always considered to be essential, specifically with regard to the programme' s budget, the participation of NGOs and financial support for them, the role of the European Parliament and the promotion of innovative approaches, we have reached the end of a long process that includes a second reading on 17 May this year, various working meetings with the Belgian presidency and conciliation, in which, finally, consensus was reached on 18 September."
"With regard to the agreement that has been reached, it is important to mention the aspects dealing with the budget and its increase by EUR 5 million to EUR 75 million for the five years of the programme, which is still insufficient, but, given the Council' s intransigence, not reaching an agreement would have meant the programme not coming into force at the beginning of next year."
"A decision was also reached on promoting innovative approaches and financial support for actions undertaken by NGOs, which has increased from 80% to 90% in exceptional circumstances. It is also worth noting that agreement was reached on the participation of NGOs, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, in preparing and holding the annual Round table on the situation' s development and the programme' s implementation."
"It is also important to point out that the role of the European Parliament has been acknowledged, specifically in the timely consideration of the synthesis report for the Spring Council, which the Commission will draw up annually and which will examine the overall coherence of policies with social cohesion, including the progress made under this programme."
"Lastly, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank everyone who has taken part and contributed to this proposal' s success and for the consensus reached in the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Mr President, may I express my political group's satisfaction with the fact that, for the first time at European level, we are now ready to apply a Community strategy to combat social exclusion."
"We have urgent challenges to meet."
"Not only is it unacceptable for so many million citizens in the European Union and candidate countries to be living below the poverty line, but the knowledge society which we are creating and the increasingly multicultural society in which we live in Europe harbour new risks of social exclusion."
"What is important is that this social programme will give us the chance to process our policies on the basis of modern scientific data, on the basis of statistical studies and on the basis of exchanges of best practices, including with countries outside the European Union, such as those in the European Economic Area."
"This is particularly important for Member States unused to applying strategies based on social research, the very countries which now face the most serious social problems."
"The European Parliament, as the rapporteur, Mrs Figueiredo has just said, had high hopes of this Community programme."
"Nevertheless, it supports the joint text brokered during conciliation with the Council and is satisfied with the constructive part played by the European Commission."
"The rapporteur has already listed the main points of this conciliation."
"We particularly wanted to highlight the innovative approach which the European Commission has promised to promote in order to ensure that citizens with special difficulties are integrated into society."
"The ground which we need to cover between now and 2010, the timeframe and political milestone set in Lisbon, will be a long, hard haul and it is crucial, in our view, that the European Council in Laeken set its stamp very firmly on this effort."
"We have special need of such decisiveness at this time when, as the previous debate highlighted, we are feeling the economic and social fallout from the crisis provoked by 11 September more and more acutely in Europe; at the same time, the Member States need to move into action by instigating public dialogue and integrating the fight against social exclusion into all their policies."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs had quite a struggle over this issue of combating social exclusion."
"I should like to point out that it was more or less unanimous throughout the procedure, and was served by an excellent rapporteur."
"However, conciliation, which we had thought would be easy, since we were so much in accord with the Council' s motives when it adopted the Commission' s proposal, proved surprisingly tough and difficult."
"I should therefore like to remind the House, briefly, of the reasons for our insistence."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and, I am sure, Parliament as a whole, approves the choice of the open-cooperation method."
"It has proved its worth in this area."
"We also agree that social exclusion is a complex and multi-facetted process, and that it is necessary to study it in greater depth, particularly as regards its links with poverty."
"There are people on the margins of society who are not poor, and not all poor people are excluded, but the area of overlapping is a very large one."
"It is not possible to separate the two problems."
"However, one of the major strengths of the open-cooperation method is the fact that it allows the exchange of good practice."
"It is here that Europe has a responsibility, or I would prefer to say a duty, to experiment and to lead by example."
"The information already collected enables us to launch innovative schemes and pilot projects with confidence."
"In addition, Commissioner, you are a politician, as we are."
"How could you imagine for a moment that we could sell to our voters the idea that, on a problem as serious and as evident as social exclusion, Europe is able only to finance studies, and is not able to take any practical action?"
"This sort of thing is suicidal as far as Europe' s image is concerned, hence the innovatory approaches that you have finally conceded to us."
"Fortunately you have other mechanisms, we know, but given the importance of this preoccupation it was necessary to include it."
"The controversy over the budget arises from this. You have granted us only five million."
"Since we know that you had plans ready for carrying out these studies, we would like to have a guarantee that there will be money available for innovative experiments."
"In the same way, the NGOs must be able to work without having to look for unlikely external sponsors."
"Well, we have achieved this, and the text has been improved."
"I wish the Commission all the best in carrying out the task that lies before it."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her serious and very committed work on this issue and also the work that our own committee has done, as Mr Rocard has just pointed out."
"This action programme is a very serious and important step forward for the European Union."
"It is part of the recognition of the huge problem of social exclusion which is not only the result of poverty, although it is of course linked to it."
"Some of those links are picked up in the excellent report by Mrs Lynne which we will be debating later, concerning the European Year of Disabled People, and in Mr Nobilia's report which recognises the problems faced by elderly or disabled people in exercising, for example, their freedom of movement because disability benefits are not included in the coordination of social security systems."
"In our discussions on this action programme, Parliament has insisted on the need for civil society to be involved in the programme itself and its evaluation."
"This involvement is critical."
"It is clear that the top-down policies, and the hope that overall economic growth would somehow overcome the poverty and lift the poorest out of that state, have not worked."
"It is the constructive involvement of the people themselves that is part of the solution."
"We therefore expect that the research and programmes funded with this modestly increased amount of money, a limited range as Mr Rocard has just said, will not just concentrate on policy but also on the process of policy formulation and funding decisions, which in itself could be an innovative dimension."
"I recently attended a local government conference looking at the national social inclusion plans."
"Speakers representing organisations from groups which often experience social exclusion - poor people, those with disabilities, those from minority ethnic groups etc. were asked whether they would rather see the implementation of a few policies that have worked elsewhere or have a full programme of real consultation, even if they did not then get what they wanted."
"The answer, without exception, was that they wanted to be consulted because that implied respect for their experience and their opinions."
"It is also my hope that the activities funded under this programme will not just concentrate on work as the answer to exclusion."
"It is not a solution if the work is poorly paid and exploitative."
"I, like many others, look forward to reading and evaluating the results of this programme and hope that they will make real progress in tackling social exclusion."
"Mr President, like Mrs Figueiredo, we also welcome this action plan against social exclusion."
"We think that certain things have been achieved - as always, in conciliation processes not everything we want is achieved - and, although the budget is still low, the budget for NGOs has been raised and the role that the European Parliament plays is very important."
"I think that there is some fine wording in this document: I would remind you of Article 2 - which asks for a high level of employment and a fight against poverty - and point out that the Council considers the current levels of poverty that still exist in the European Union to be unacceptable."
"However, we are running the risk that applying this action plan - whose implementation next year is welcomed by all of us - will be like putting a small sticking plaster onto a large gaping wound."
"In the previous debate we talked about the virtues of the market in terms of sustaining airlines, yet we talk less of the 12 000 jobs at Sabena."
"We run the risk of losing much blood whilst we try to stem its flow with a small sticking plaster."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, this plan against social exclusion is very welcome."
"Mr President, I should like to warmly welcome the final outcome of the conciliation procedure and make a point of congratulating Mrs Figueiredo who, thanks to her meticulous work and by working with all sides, managed in the end to give us this tool much more quickly than we anticipated."
"Mr President, the speakers referred - and this is important - to the shortcomings and limited potential of this tool as it stands."
"However, we have to start from the fact that we are talking about a policy area which does not come under European jurisdiction."
"We have no jurisdiction to exercise policy but, for the first time, the Member States have decided to work together."
"So, within the framework of this joint decision to work together, three things have happened."
"First, national action plans against exclusion and poverty are being submitted, for the first time."
"Secondly, the Social Protection Committee and the European Commission are working together to find a joint policy framework, again for the first time."
"May I remind you that we do not even have a common definition of the word ""poverty"" in the European Union."
"Thirdly, we have the programme, which is a first tool, but an important tool nevertheless."
"What is important is that, first, the budget has been increased as a result of significant pressure and intervention on the part of the European Parliament and, secondly, we have achieved a common position between the Commission and Parliament during conciliation on 90% funding for organisations which really do not have any resources of their own."
"So what does this tool do?"
"I can sum up the basic elements of this tool in seven points. One, it supports and helps the structures in the Member States to collate data and analyse and research the situation in all the Member States."
"Two, it helps us work together and develop joint social indicators, for the first time."
"Three, it supports the procedures used to monitor and implement national action plan programmes on employment."
"Four, it supports the exchange of best practices and programmes."
"Five, it involves all the agencies, local authorities, non-governmental organisations, governments, foundations and universities."
"Six - and I should like to highlight this point - it specifically involves associations of people who are the victims of poverty and exclusion and, seven, it allows us to raise public awareness of the huge problem of poverty, which cannot be dealt with simply by governments and European programmes but which needs to galvanise the whole of society into action."
"Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Announcement by the President"
"First of all, ladies and gentlemen, I have some information which I would advise you, if I may, to listen to."
"In view of the fact that the World Trade Organization meeting in Qatar lasted longer than expected, Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler will not be able to attend our sitting this afternoon."
"I therefore propose that we should continue our debates between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., while we should stick to the planned timetable for topical and urgent subjects of major importance, and of course for the vote."
"Madam President, when will my report be debated - the Lynne report on the European Year of People with Disabilities, 2003?"
"Will that now be at around 3.30 p.m.?"
"We have a sign language interpreter arriving now for the debate at 5.30 p.m. because everything has been changed around so much that we do not know when this report is being debated."
"I have deaf members of the public attending and we have the sign language interpreter."
"So can we please stick to some sort of timetable?"
"Mrs Lynne, you were quite right to bring this information to my attention."
"I think that we can at least leave your report at the time that was originally planned for it, in other words at 5.30 p.m."
"Mr President, we understand the reasons why Commissioners Lamy and Fischler cannot be with us this afternoon."
"Could you confirm, however, that there will be an opportunity for those two commissioners to report to us on the important negotiations at Doha and whether the EU's views were accepted or not."
"Of course, Mrs McNally, we shall certainly be holding this debate with the Commission in December, but we cannot really blame the commissioners in question for not being able to come back any earlier."
"Madam President, I wish to say a few brief words, just to clarify something."
"I was not able to take part in yesterday' s vote on the Caudron report, and consequently did not spot a mistake that I would like to point out to my fellow Members."
"As a result of a mistake by Parliament staff, a proposal for an amendment - No 20 - that we had tabled to the Caudron report on the research programme was mistakenly included in the Euratom report."
"I do not intend to dwell on this subject, because other amendments by other Members have addressed the same issue. I do wish to make this observation, however, because people were probably surprised that the insertion of the amendment made no sense at all in the context of Euratom."
"Mr Ribeiro e Castro, we are happy to take note of what you have said, and we shall see that the necessary correction is made."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I was in the Members' Bar before we started voting."
"I saw a piece of baggage on a chair. For approximately 15 minutes nobody came for it."
"A man approached and I asked him whether it was his bag."
"I told him that, in view of the security situation, it was advisable to stay with one's baggage and that, in addition, to be in the Members' Bar you had to be invited by a Member."
"He was extremely arrogant and annoyed."
"He took his bag and marched away."
"He said that he knew Mrs Muscardini."
"She then arrived in the bar; I asked her that if she knew the gentlemen, and said that due to the security problems, I had informed him politely of the situation."
"I should like to say to this House that we as Members of this Parliament also have a responsibility."
"We have been asking for security measures to be stepped up and we all, therefore, must take responsibility for the people we bring here or allow here in our name."
"I would just ask you, Madam President, to remind the House of our responsibilities for future security."
"I congratulate you, Mrs Foster, on your vigilance. You acted very properly in the circumstances."
"Vote"
"Madam President, I should like to make it clear to my fellow MEPs that, if Amendment No 9, tabled by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, is adopted, the issue will be sent back to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"That will be the correct method of proceeding, for it will give us more time to investigate the legal consequences of this proposal."
"I received an answer from the Council yesterday, stating that it did not want to express an opinion on the proposal' s legal validity as long as the proposal was being debated in the Council."
"I simply believe it would be wrong for us to proceed to a vote here in Parliament before such a legal evaluation has been made available to us."
"I find the Council' s answer totally unacceptable."
"I would ask my fellow MEPs to support Amendment No 9 so that we can obtain a new reading in the committee."
"Thank you, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, for having so clearly explained the significance of this amendment, which I shall now put to a roll-call vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0352/2001) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC, Directive 92/80/EEC and Directive 95/59/EC as regards the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco products [COM(2001) 133 - C5-0139/2001 - 2001/0063(CNS)]"
"Following the rejection of the proposal by the Commission"
"Madam President, may I say to both you and the Commission that I believe that Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure applies here, meaning that you have to give the Commissioner the floor in order to ask if the Commission intends to withdraw its proposal."
"That is the first step."
"I agree, and this is why I was giving the floor to the Commission."
"Thank you, Mr Katiforis. I believe Mr Bolkestein wishes to speak."
"Madam President, I understand that the report by Mr Katiforis has been accepted."
"That means that the Commission proposal is rejected."
"I would like to say first of all that the Commission very much regrets this vote, in particular because the Commission's proposal is precisely what Parliament asked for in 1996."
"This is an unusual situation."
"Parliament asks something of the Commission."
"The Commission does what is asked of it and Parliament rejects what the Commission has done."
"However I shall apprise the Commission of this regrettable result next week when the Commission next meets, and I shall confer with my colleagues and with President Prodi on the course of action to be taken now in connection with the rules of the Treaty which are perfectly clear."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I should only like to comment on this point very briefly."
"Firstly, the Commission proposal was flawed, but what is even more important, Commissioner, is the fact that elections have been held in the meantime, and the Commission should also take note of this."
"We really cannot spend any more time on this matter."
"Madam President, of course it is also a pity that the Council tried to pre-empt Parliament's opinion with a political agreement and did not have the courtesy to let Parliament express its views first."
"That by way of a brief reply to what Mr Bolkestein just said."
"But may I say that, pursuant to Rule 68 of the Rules of Procedure, Mr Bolkestein's answer is incomplete."
"The Rule is clear."
"We ask the Commission if it intends to withdraw its proposal."
"Mr Bolkestein has not said if it intends to do so."
"He said that he would confer with his colleagues on the course of action to be taken now, from which I conclude that the Commission refuses to withdraw its proposal."
"Consequently, we need to proceed to the third paragraph of the Rule, which states that the matter has to be referred back to the committee responsible, without voting on the draft legislative resolution and I propose that we do precisely that."
"I quite agree, Mr Katiforis. This is the view we should take of the matter."
"Madam President, Mr Katiforis is quite correct, but if the precedent in this House, is anything to go by, now that Parliament has made a proposal, in five years' time the Commission will come forward with an idea which we will reject again."
"(Parliament decided to refer the matter back to the committee responsible)"
"Report (A5-0395/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation aiming to promote the conversion of vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco [COM(2001) 384 - C5-0407/2001 - 2001/0163(CNS)]"
"Before the vote"
"chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"Madam President, it would be an oral amendment, which would be a new Recital 12."
"It would also apply to the draft legislative resolution and would read: ""The proposal was not foreseen in the financial perspective."
"The financial envelope of the proposal should be covered by additional resources."""
"Madam President, as rapporteur of this report I would like to make two points: firstly, that this very amendment tabled orally by my fellow Member Mr Wynn has been rejected at the vote by the Committee on Fisheries on the day my own report was voted upon."
"The second is that I do not oppose this amendment being tabled and it should be this House that decides upon its content."
"Madam President, is it clear that the vote is only on the legislative part of the proposal and not on the budgetary part?"
"We shall discuss the oral amendment that Mr Wynn has just mentioned, which does, of course, have financial implications. I am sure that everyone understands this."
"Madam President, with regard to the amendment tabled by the Chairperson of the Committee on Budgets, I support the proposal made by our rapporteur and, also, in agreement with what the Commission said, I would like to say that we have always spoken about this proposal from the point of view of fisheries and we do not involve ourselves with the budgetary aspects."
"However, although what Mr Wynn proposes is true - that, as is stated here, the proposal was not included in the financial perspectives - it is nonetheless certain, and for this reason the House must also be provided with this information, that the Commission has requested the use of the flexibility instrument, providing this proposal, in due time, with EUR 197 million."
"Therefore, we are in favour of this proposal from the Committee on Budgets, but we would remind our fellow Members in this committee, and the Council, that they should come to an agreement with regard to the use of this instrument and provide the proposal with this EUR 197 million, which is necessary so that fishermen and the families affected can resolve this problem."
"(The President noted that there was no opposition to considering the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0384/2001) by Mr Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the approximation of the civil and commercial law of the Member States [COM(2001) 398 - C5-0471/2001 - 2001/2187(COS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0363/2001) by Mr Chichester, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Commission Green Paper Towards a European strategy for the security of energy supply (COM(2000) 769 - C5-0145/2001 - 2001/2071(COS))"
"Before the vote"
"Madam President, I have noticed that there are not just a few minor linguistic errors."
"Entire paragraphs of the text are different. It looks like the translator has translated a different text."
"Please could this be checked. And I should like to take this opportunity to say that errors have crept into Greek translations on other occasions."
"If you spoke Greek you would understand what I am about to say."
"In one section, the words tuberculosis and malaria have simply been transliterated into Greek instead of using the Greek terms."
"I am very sorry, Mr Alyssandrakis."
"I can only attempt to ensure that the versions in the various languages are properly monitored and checked."
"I am told that this will be done and not only for the Greek version, because other versions are also affected by these mistakes."
"We shall, therefore, ensure that everything is put right."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0356/2001) by Mrs Schörling, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Commission White Paper on Strategy for a future Chemicals Policy [COM(2001) 88 - C5-0258/2001 - 2001/2118(COS)]"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, I should like to ask you to look into what this vote has cost European taxpayers."
"I should also like you to make money available for a course through which the committee can learn to work together."
"It is quite outrageous that we should sit for an hour voting on what should have been resolved by the committee."
"They really must get their bloody act together before long."
"This endless piddling about cannot continue!"
"Mr Blak, I think that from now on, we should count the cost of all votes."
"Report (A5-0341/2001) by Mrs Flemming, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on pricing policies for enhancing the sustainability of water resources [COM(2000) 477 - C5-0634/2000 - 2000/2298(COS)]"
"Before the vote on the entire motion for a resolution"
". (DE) Madam President, I deeply regret the fact that I must now recommend to my group that it reject my own report in the final vote, because I, like my group, really do not think that it is fair for a national problem to be brought before the European Parliament."
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Madam President, I just wanted to follow up the previous point of order and ask when are we going to be able to debate the proposals in Mr Corbett's report - which I understand are stuck in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - so that this ludicrous procedure, with six pages of plenary amendments on one report, can be reformed."
"We will be a laughing stock if we do not reform and get our House in order."
"Report (A5-0323/2001) by Mrs Corbey, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on implementation of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste 2000/2319(INI)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0336/2001) by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on a global partnership and a common strategy for relations between the European Union and Latin America [2000/2249(INI)]"
"Before the vote"
"Madam President, I should like to say that it states on the agenda that voting will be from 12 noon until 1 p.m. and that it will resume at 6.30 p.m."
"I really do think that we ought to keep to the agenda."
"I must point out, ladies and gentlemen, that yesterday, we exceeded the time allocated and that consequently, Mr Posselt' s comment would have applied yesterday too."
"I shall, therefore, consult the House: who wishes to continue?"
"(The House decided to continue voting)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0704/2001), by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy, on arbitrary arrests and the political situation in Laos."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on negotiations within the framework of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention following the recent anthrax attacks"
"Before the vote on paragraph 2"
"Given the uncertainty about the precise position of the President of the United States, I propose correcting the second part of paragraph 2 to say ""including the search for effective procedures"" instead of ""the establishment of existing procedures"" ."
"Madam President, there is a short oral amendment which has been agreed by all signatories of this compromise resolution and reads as follows: in paragraph 2, after the word 'terrorism' , a new sentence saying: 'Demands that national governments assume responsibility for additional security costs.'"
"If there are no objections to this oral amendment, the motion for a resolution I am putting to the vote will include the oral amendment that Mrs Foster has just explained."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, you have presided over 358 separate votes just now."
"I hope colleagues will agree that this underlines the need to reform our Rules of Procedure."
"Madam President, I gather from the display that the next report is the Bouwman report."
"Does that mean that there is not going to be a debate on the WTO?"
"That debate will take place in December, Mr Rübig, because, as I said, Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler will not be able to join us in time."
"). I am afraid I cannot agree with Mr Corbett's point about the votes in this plenary."
"There are many committees in this Parliament, which do not have representation from every Member State."
"Therefore we will find those people will be disenfranchised and that is becoming a greater problem as the European Union enlarges."
"We must have the opportunity for members from every Member State to be able to vote on these reports and on these important amendments."
"Madam President, a number of colleagues have remarked that it is a very bad thing to have so many votes on these occasions, but I would like to congratulate you on having kept us going."
"I do not know for what purpose my constituents elected me if it was not to exercise discretion and choice in deciding what things to vote about."
"I do not think we do a more important thing than cast our votes for and against proposals in this House and objecting to that is a very foolish thing."
"Moreover, if one looks at the votes cast today, there were very few foregone conclusions: there were close votes on all the roll-call votes and that seems to me to show the need to test these matters by voting."
"The idea that we should have fewer votes seems absurd."
"That said, I should like to make a remark about the Watson report."
"Once we have got to the point of having Community law, if that law is defied it seems perfectly obvious that there have to be within our nation States - and nations which are not States - criminal rules which uphold it, otherwise the States pass laws which they are not able to enforce and the Community becomes a laughing stock."
"Of course, that requires a proper safeguard and proper defence rights."
"These days we are thinking about defending our civilisation."
"Our civilisation is to do with giving people proper rights of defence and I am sad at recent developments in the United Kingdom that seem to be ending these rights."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE Fatuzzo (PPE-DE)."
"(IT) Madam President, although I had requested the floor to speak about ten documents, I shall limit myself to the explanations of vote on the Figueiredo and Chichester reports."
"Proposal for a recommendation by Mr Watson (B5-0707/2001)"
"The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has voted against this recommendation because implementing it would be synonymous with finally withdrawing vital and crucial policy areas - namely policing and criminal law as these relate to the ordering of our ordinary lives - from the jurisdiction of the Member States and transferring them to the EU."
"The recommendation is an absurd rhetorical demonstration of the parliamentary majority' s disconnection from reality, and in a double sense. Firstly, it is - even now - politically unthinkable for the governments of the Member States to endorse the adoption of a recommendation that would make it possible to introduce EU criminal law and to establish a federal police service."
"Secondly, adoption of the recommendation would be out of step with actual social conditions which indicate that Parliament' s dream of a European federal state will prove to be a nightmare."
"There are not one, but fifteen, different juridico-political cultures and systems in the EU."
"EU criminal law and an EU police service would, at best, severely damage the Member States' legal traditions and, at worst, consolidate a centralised system without democratic control and, moreover, do so without solving the problems faced by the Member States."
"The core of European cooperation should be diversity and respect for other countries' legal systems."
"Figueiredo report (A5-0372/2001)"
"Madam President, of course, I voted for the Figueiredo report on the conciliation committee text on combating social exclusion."
"I have to say that, in Italy, first the centre government, allied with the European socialist parties, increased the minimum Italian pensions greatly, from EUR 382 to EUR 490 per month; now, Mr Berlusconi' s centre-right government has increased them from EUR 382 to EUR 490 for people over 70 years old and has extended the categories of people entitled to receive them."
"I call upon the other 14 States of the European Union and the 12 candidate countries to help pensioners and elderly people in the same way, and not just pensioners and elderly people but non-pensioners as well, for the right to life belongs to all people, whatever their age."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this report and I wanted to take this opportunity to say what a pity it is that the European Parliament and the European institutions are not as popular as they might be with the electorate and the people of the European Union because we are not in a position to respond appropriately and quickly to problems which arise and which we are aware of."
"We have already seen this once this week with the transport of animals and now we are seeing it again with cross-border payments."
"Over the years the public have become angry and have been forced to suffer losses, and now we are in the situation that we are lagging behind; hopefully this initiative of Mrs Peijs will now at least be implemented quickly."
"As early as the time of the introduction of the euro I brought this issue to the attention of the Commissioner responsible, Mr Monti, and I asked the Commission to take action on it as quickly as possible."
"As we can see it has taken years, and that is a shame because so much damage has been done."
"I believe - to stress this once more - that we need to listen more closely to what members of the public have to say, pay more attention to their problems and then take appropriate action."
"I should also like to add that I had indicated that I wished to make an explanation of vote on the Flemming report."
"Obviously this will no longer be necessary."
"We have voted against the proposal for a regulation on cross-border payments in euro, which is designed to prevent banks from imposing charges, falsely giving the impression that such payments are free."
"This absurdity, which is motivated only by the desire to make people think that the euro itself removes all commissions on cross-border payments runs the risk of proving expensive for all of us in all kinds of unwanted ways."
"Furthermore, this proposal is of very dubious legal value."
"Its legal basis is Article 95(1) of the EC Treaty, which deals with the establishment of the internal market."
"It should, therefore, apply in the same way to the fifteen members of the Union."
"It does not, however, because three Members of the Union are not part of the euro zone."
"Given these circumstances, it would probably have been more appropriate to make the regulation' s legal basis Article 123(4) of the EC Treaty (last phrase) concerning measures to adopt for the introduction of the euro, and does not, therefore, apply to the countries participating in the single currency."
"Article 123(4), however, requires unanimous approval in Council, and Article 95 only requires a qualified majority."
"This is probably the factor that tipped the scales in making some countries less reticent."
"It is nevertheless difficult to imagine the reality of the legal situation in countries that are not members of the euro zone, that are forced to pay a premium for cross-border transfers made out in a currency other than their own."
"To this bizarre situation we can add the absence in the regulation of any article referring to possible sanctions against recalcitrant banks."
"Of course there is none, since the Community has no jurisdiction on this matter."
"The European Parliament has sought to close this loophole by voting for an amendment that calls on the Member States to define and adopt sanctions that will act as a ""deterrent"" , but this type of request has no legal force."
". There are only 46 days remaining before euro notes and coins are introduced across the twelve countries that are participating within this new euro currency regime."
"Phasing out national currencies and introducing a single new European currency is not an easy task."
"There are over 290 million people who live within the twelve new euro zone countries alone."
"However, I do believe that EU Governments have been very pro-active with regard to implementing broad information campaigns concerning the forthcoming practical changes."
"It is very important that both small and large businesses contact their local banks and estimate how much currency they will require to carry out their businesses commencing 1 January next."
"Surveys carried out within the EU have shown that banks are confident that all ATM machines will have all the necessary stock of the new euro currency notes."
"The European Central Bank is satisfied that the requisite amount of the new euro notes will be dispersed to financial institutions in non-Euro zone countries."
"I believe that the five-week period for the changeover is of the correct duration."
"It would simply be too much to ask small companies in Europe to deal with two different currencies for what was originally planned as a six-month period for the changeover."
"I welcome the fact that the different consumer associations in Europe will be vigilant during the changeover period so as to ensure that the interests of consumers are protected during the timescale of the euro changeover."
"I, of course, support the need to introduce measures which reduce costs between domestic and cross-border payments."
"There is a very strong consumer case to be made for changing the current system which is in operation."
"We must strengthen confidence in the structures of the new euro currency."
"However, this proposed regulation which is before us today does not discriminate between efficient and inefficient payment systems."
"This regulation does not adequately address the relationship between the euro and other non-euro Member State currencies."
"I believe it is fair to say that the euro tends to promote economic stability."
"I think there has been clear evidence of this since the tragic terrorist attacks which took place in America last September."
"We do not want to give international currency speculators an opportunity to play off one national European currency against another."
"This would only result in broader devaluations in the value of the euro which is exactly what took place in the Autumn of 1992."
"The euro is good news for European businesses."
"It reduces export costs."
"It is good news for European travellers and it contributes to the medium to long-term economic stability of the European Union."
"I have voted in favour of Mrs Peijs' s report and wish to emphasise the quality of the work that our rapporteur produced."
"I am very pleased that our House is finally making a statement on an issue as important as this."
"The patience of European consumers has clearly reached its limit."
"It has to be said that the banks have gone too far by making one promise after another that they fail to keep, content in their certainty that Brussels would not dare restrict their freedom to impose charges."
"The Commission has now been negotiating with them for eleven years... in vain."
"The banks have always refused to make the necessary investment to keep the cost of cross-border transfers down."
"At the same time, the current system allows them to build up a considerable pot of money for themselves."
"Consumers are not the only ones to bear these unjustified bank charges: they have a particularly serious effect on SMEs that export their products and the competitiveness of these companies suffers for no good reason."
"This situation, which has been incomprehensible to SMEs since the advent of the euro on 1 January 1999, is in danger of becoming explosive, with the euro entering into circulation in less than two months."
"How is it possible that the euro zone is only a single payment area for notes and coins, with all other means of payment being discouraged by punitive bank charges?"
"How can banks justify a transfer from Lille to Bastia costing less than the same operation between Lille and Brussels?"
"One fear still remains and that is that the banks will use their freedom to impose charges to increase domestic prices in order to compensate for the lack of earning opportunities in the euro zone."
"Nevertheless, as Commissioner Bolkestein said, 'The banks know very well that the public has legitimate expectations' ."
"We can only hope that the banks really are aware of this."
"The European Union is made up of sovereign states, each with a seat in the United Nations and, so far, each boasting its own currency."
"The banks form part of national payment circuits and impose a heavy fine on cross-border payments and money transfers."
"From January 2002, twelve EU Member States will act as if they are one country financially speaking."
"The banks are in favour of this as long as this enlarges their own scope, but not if they have to forgo the additional payments from their customers."
"It seems appealing to demand that the costs for national and cross-border payments in euros should become the same."
"That has been Commissioner Bolkestein' s wish for a long time and is now also being proposed in the report by Mrs Peijs."
"I can endorse this, as long as it means that banks forgo their levies on cross-border payments."
"However, recital 5bis does not prevent new levies from being imposed on national payments by way of compensation for the fact that revenue from foreign payments has fallen by the wayside."
"Instead of imposing a heavy fine on a small minority of payments, including mainly business payments, all payments will then attract a minor fine."
"That means that the large majority of customers will incur higher costs."
"I shall vote against this, as this is highly detrimental to the ordinary account holder."
"Chichester report (A5-0363/2001)"
"Mr President, the document tabled by Mr Chichester addresses the issue of energy supply and, in places, advocates the use of nuclear energy."
"I have already stated on a number of occasions that both I personally and the Pensioners' Party are in favour of using nuclear energy."
"I would like to stress, in particular, before this House, that I feel the candidate countries' nuclear power stations should be allowed to operate at full capacity."
"In my capacity as a member of the joint EU-Bulgaria interparliamentary committee, I recently visited the Bohunice power station in Slovakia and the Kozloduy power station in Bulgaria."
"Where their reactors meet certain safety requirements, these States should be allowed to use nuclear energy, for they do not have the economic resources to sustain an additional unnecessary cost just so they can replace one type of energy with another."
"Where nuclear power stations are safe, we must allow them to be used, particularly those in the candidate countries."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the tabling of the Commission's Green Paper on a strategy for the security of energy supply."
"It is with great regret that I see that yet again too little attention has been paid to renewable sources of energy."
"We will only achieve the Kyoto target if we give preference to these sources of energy."
"I am therefore very disappointed at the vote on the Chichester report because here too nuclear energy is still the preferred option."
"With the consumption of energy increasing and the sources and reserves of mineral fuels decreasing, the energy supply issue is a very important aspect of the internal and external policy of the EU and the Member States."
"The Chichester report may highlight the need to save energy, improve energy efficiency and develop more efficient transmission systems, but it places its hopes for resolving the problem in the liberalisation of the market and competition, on the one hand, and in controlling supplier countries, on the other."
"This approach works to the benefit of more general imperialist interests and to the detriment of the workers and society as a whole, in both supplier and consumer countries, which are being sacrificed so that the multinationals which create and exploit recessions and provoke wars which allow them to control the energy-rich areas of the world can make a profit."
"Energy policies to make use of domestic energy sources obey the same diktat, with adverse repercussions on grass-roots interests, growth and the supply of high-quality, safe and environmentally-friendly energy to the country as a whole."
"The problem is exacerbated by the liberalisation of the energy market and the privatisation of power stations and transmission grids."
"We consider that the strategically important energy sector (supply of raw materials, generation, transmission grids) should be in the public sector and should be subject to periodically adjusted national planning which takes account of national requirements and international circumstances."
"Energy policy should safeguard cheap energy for grass-roots needs, guarantee the safety of workers and citizens and ensure that the environment is protected."
"These should be primary objectives and should take precedence over any economic factors."
"Transport policy needs to be revised so that greater use is made of public transport, renewable sources of energy need to be supported and encouraged and research is needed into the most efficient generating systems and the cheapest, least-polluting consumption systems."
"The EU and the Member States need to respond to the need to protect the environment and to fail to reduce emissions to Kyoto levels is to practise wicked works."
"Major climate problems, the hole in the ozone layer and so on must not be resolved at the expense of growth in the poorest countries, at the expense of the workers or by fatalistically accepting the destruction of our planet."
"Workers in Europe and throughout the world and the 2 billion people with no access to electricity are demanding and fighting for a different energy policy which opposes imperialist interests and preferences and the monopolies which are usurping the energy sector."
"A policy which respects and protects the environment, a policy which will create the foundations for humane living conditions."
"This being so, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have voted against the Chichester report."
"By making as issue out of Europe' s energy dependence, the report is masking the fact that we are dependent mainly not so much on other countries as on the huge oil corporations which often also control other sources of energy."
"This is the dependence that Europe paid a high price for during the oil crisis in 1973, when these corporations decided to impose a general price increase on oil to increase the profits of their less profitable wells."
"It is this dependence on oil companies that has led to the 'serious risk of price instability in the short run and lack of resources in the long run' , which concerns the report."
"It is not the unfair distribution of the world' s energy sources, a geological factor, that threatens the rational use of resources in a way that respects the natural environment, but rather the fact that their management is controlled by huge private groups, which are solely concerned with their profit margins, when they themselves are not suffering from the erratic fluctuations of the market or even of stock speculation."
"The problem does not only affect Europe: the world' s resources cannot be managed rationally and distributed amongst everyone if a collective effort is agreed on at world level, which would mean an end to the stranglehold of private groups on these resources and a completely different organisation of the economy."
"During the debate in plenary on Tuesday evening, I stated my support for the 'Chichester' package on the security of energy supply, despite its calls for the liberalisation of the energy sector that I could not have supported had they been proposed in isolation but which, as it happens, are part of a whole multifaceted and bold 'package' , which takes the European discussion on this matter forwards."
"This is why I have voted in favour of the 'package' ."
"Incidentally, I still do not understand how someone can advocate a liberalisation that seeks to bring prices down and which takes the form of promoting the 'least costly' sources of energy and, on the other hand, complains about being increasingly dependent on external sources as consumption increases (or is not decreasing) due to the fact that prices are very (or too) low."
"I hope one day to receive a clear explanation of this point from the 'founders' of liberalisation."
"The Chichester report seeks to present a 'European strategy' for the security of energy supply."
"It is very difficult, however, to discern in the resolution, even one clearly stated guideline."
"It could be saying anything and its opposite."
"The resolution dodges the real issues underpinning a 'strategy' ."
"Is it possible to restructure the energy sector without a real concerted public policy that is supported and has been fully discussed?"
"Can we leave things up to the 'market' , in other words, to the whim of private financial interests?"
"Is energy a 'common asset' or just a commodity?"
"To what extent is the nuclear risk acceptable?"
"The resolution is dotted with pipe dreams."
"For example, in order to permit the renewal of nuclear power stations, it calls for ""appropriate measures"" that will guarantee the ""elimination"" of radioactive waste and the ""safety"" of the power stations."
"This is asking the impossible."
"Apart from being confused, the Chichester report falls in line with neoliberal policies."
"Paragraph 18 wants to ""promote further market opening in the EU"" and paragraph 42 considers that ""it is essential to complete the liberalisation of energy markets' ' ."
"Whereas only a public service policy can meet social and environmental requirements and guarantee ""sustainable development"" in this economic sector."
"We are voting against the motion for a resolution."
"- (PT) Some of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur suggest that the increase in installed capacity of nuclear energy in Europe is crucial if we are to comply with the Kyoto protocol."
"This argument is irrational and lacks objectivity."
"All the information available suggests that the opposite is true."
"The European Union has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 4% between 1990 and 1999 and will be able to meet the quota for remaining reductions by 2012 (4%) through low cost measures."
"According to data from the European Commission, we will be able to comply with Kyoto by implementing measures costing less than EUR 20 per tonne of CO2."
"The promotion of nuclear energy does not feature amongst these measures proposed by the European Commission in the European Climate Change Programme and the Framework Directive on Emissions Trading."
"The issue of Member States' energy supply is a fundamental aspect of their security which falls mainly within the competence of national sovereignty."
"Given the major interactions of energy choices, however, it might be useful to do as the Green Paper does and opt for a longer-term approach and study this issue at European level."
"This study must, of course, be carried out without any ideological prejudices that might demonise or romanticise any particular source of energy."
"Otherwise, we will be leaving rational discourse behind."
"This is the approach adopted by the Chichester report, emphasising, as does the Green Paper, the need for Member States to maintain a balanced combination of energy sources, which gives nuclear energy its rightful place."
"This is the only way not to make European countries more dependent on external sources."
"It is also the only way to ensure that the European Union can fulfil its international commitments on limiting CO2 emissions."
"Research and development in nuclear energy must, therefore, continue in order to build on our scientific and industrial lead in this field, in order to guarantee our countries maximum independence in the field of energy resources, to preserve the environment and to achieve a satisfactory elimination of waste end-products."
"I am sorry, with regard to this last point, that the Caudron report has not attached sufficient priority to this line of research, which is crucial."
"Unless we move ahead in this direction, the growth in demand will lead us fatally towards fossil fuels, which are as worthy of criticism in terms of the environment as they are problematic in terms of security of supply."
"Flemming report (A5-0341/2001)"
"Mr President, just before I begin on the Flemming report I want to speak about the Katiforis report, which we rejected."
"I feel very strongly that by rejecting that report we have done nothing today in this House to promote public health."
"We should never forget that tobacco is the biggest cause of preventable illness across the EU and that each year half a million EU citizens die needlessly due to tobacco."
"The Commission's proposal would have helped people to stop smoking and it is very sad that we did not support this."
"However, on to the matter at hand - the Flemming report."
"Although the report was rejected, I should like to explain why I and my two colleagues from Scotland supported some of the amendments."
"Firstly, we believe that, in line with Amendment No 3, no country may be obliged to hand over water against its will and free of charge."
"The amendment speaks for itself, and that it is why we supported it."
"Amendment No 5 was concerned with the more technical matter of water basins."
"We agree that water basin areas are not suitable bases for water pricing policies in all regions."
"Much of our water in Scotland is in inter-basin management and, therefore, we had to support it."
"Thirdly, the rejection of the Flemming report probably was ensuring that no one report could be hijacked by such a national interest."
"I hope we will continue the discussion on water, as so many of our citizens are very concerned with this issue."
"The report fully endorses the Commission communication, the philosophy of which is to treat a natural resource, water, as a commodity and as a basis for implementing other negative sectoral policies, such as agricultural policy."
"We categorically oppose this philosophy and the negative proposals tabled in order to implement it."
"The report is geared towards ""pricing policies to enhance the sustainability of water resources"", which involve recovering the cost of water-related services and limiting the consumption and use of water by making it more expensive."
"At the same time, the report is gripped by the familiar ""polluter pays"" principle, resulting in new incentives and profits for business."
"The price - and it is a very high price - of the measures proposed on the hypocritical pretext of supposedly securing the sustainability of water resources, will be paid by the consumer, for which read farmers in southern Europe, given that, as both the Commission communication and the report state, it is they who consume the most water and pay less than the ""real cost"" for it."
"This policy will cause costs to rise and will wipe out even more small and medium-sized farms, which are already suffering the disastrous consequences of the common agricultural policy."
"Predictably, the report divides the cost into financial, environmental and resource costs and considers that only the financial cost has been calculated in the past."
"Thus, to refer to the report yet again, it states that the cost of building and operating dams on rivers due to over-extraction (by farmers) ""may be passed on to the users"" or, if water needs to be treated because it has been contaminated, for example by fertilisers, then farmers should pay the cost."
"We are opposed to any attempt to treat water as a commodity."
"We categorically refuse to allow the Commission to appoint itself as the guardian of water resources and, on the pretext of ""encouraging sustainable water use"" to add, yet again, grist to the mill of private interests and allow them to penetrate and operate in what is a purely public utility sector."
"The entire endeavour is nothing more than yet another chapter in the Community's catastrophic policy. It will work to the detriment of consumers and farmers and, at the same time, champion the promotion of other policies, such as the policy to wipe out the agricultural sector."
"Water resources cannot be protected and managed rationally using suppressive pricing policies and collection measures paid for by the consumer."
"Only a few large companies charging a high price for their ""environmentally-friendly"" profile stand to benefit from this policy, which gives them yet another opportunity to rake in vastly inflated profits."
"The report' s recitals state that water ""is not a commercial product like any other"" and that ""access to water is an inalienable human right"" ."
"Such statements, however, carry little weight with Vivendi, Suez and other huge corporations, who have appropriated the water 'market' for themselves in order to squeeze enormous profits from it, with the blessing of the State."
"These statements look more like a desperate plea, considering the industries that pollute and ruin the planet' s resources for the greater good of their shareholder' s bank accounts."
"In the twenty-first century, at a time when the world has never had such great technical capability, the fact that an entire swathe of humanity does not have access to running water, let alone drinking water is largely due to the social barbarity of capitalism."
"The issue of water, which is vital for hundreds of millions of human beings far exceeds the geographical boundaries of Europe and, if we are to solve it, and many other problems, humanity would need to put an end to the dictatorship of the market, of profit and of competition."
"The rapporteur supports this system and envisages the ""sustainable management of water resources"" by means of pricing and rate setting."
"This would mean, once again, that those with the means, both individuals and particularly industrial groups, could continue to waste water, even to pollute, whilst others who are poorer, will continue to do without."
"Society should provide water, this vital commodity, free of charge to everyone and its management should be planned according to the real needs of the population and subject to democratic control."
"It is quite clear that the current organisation of the economy, based on the quest for profit, is fundamentally incapable of guaranteeing a ""sustainable management of water resources"" and consequently represents a threat to the future of mankind, in this area as in many others."
"People themselves consist largely of water, and the bulk of our food is also made up of water."
"Similarly, we very often deal with water in our jobs and households."
"Without a continuous supply of water, we would not survive."
"Whoever appropriates water, takes possession of their fellow people."
"That is why the water supply should not end up in private hands."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy rightly concluded that access to water is a human right and water is therefore not a commercial product."
"The question now arises as to how we manage water shortages and water pollution."
"The fair principle that the polluter pays is useful to cream profits from polluting companies, but not a sound argument to considerably increase the costs for households."
"It is better to increase the amount of clean and fresh drinking water available by desalinating sea water than by digging deeper for ground water or by redirecting rivers to storage reservoirs."
"There was a time when the Soviet Union wanted to fill the Aral Sea with water from rivers which flow to the North Pole."
"These days, Spain wants to tap half of the Ebro' s water to promote tourism in southern Spain."
"This will be at the expense of fauna and flora in the current river basin."
"Thanks to criticism on this, the Right has blocked this decision."
"This proves that money and prestige are still worth more than sustainable environmental management."
", in writing. (PT) Despite protests from Portuguese NGOs and myself, the Portuguese government is insisting on adopting an uncompromising approach to the Alqueva project, by preparing to fill the dam to a height of 152m."
"This Communication and the report on sustainable water pricing show that filling the dam to a height of 139m, as I have been proposing, would not only enable more than 600 000 trees and habitats of enormous importance to be saved, but would also be more sustainable in economic terms."
"We risk deforesting to a height of 152m and then, due to the price of water, seeing that filling to a height of 139m is enough for agricultural requirements."
"Over the past few days, Member of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Alexander de Roo, has insinuated both in this House and in the media that the Liberal shadow rapporteur, Chris Davies, has changed his position under pressure from the Aznar Government in connection with the possible election of Pat Cox to President of Parliament."
"This was an absurd and unfounded allegation."
"Mr Davies has conscientiously attempted to reconcile his own dislike of the Spanish project (shared by myself) with the position of the majority of the liberal group that it is inappropriate to criticise a specific country in a general report."
"Today' s vote illustrated that our group has abstained and that Mr Davis and various Green members of the ELDR Group have voted in favour of the criticism levelled at Spain."
"However, by voting against the Liberal amendment (which, in turn, led to the rejection of the entire report), the Greens have missed a major opportunity of stopping the Spanish project on the basis of general principles."
"Although the intentions of the Group of the Greens may have been noble, their method was neither effective nor conclusive."
"At the moment, the European Parliament does not have a single position in this weighty matter."
"Riis-Jørgensen report (A5-0373/2001)"
"Shipbuilding has for years benefited from considerable subsidies from Member States and from the European institutions."
"This has not stopped it from shedding its workforce or even from closing entire dockyards and sacking their employees."
"Dockyard owners are attempting to have these subsidies extended in the name of competition, but the money that would be given to them would continue to increase the profit of these companies and to be shared with their shareholders even if the latter withdraw their capital as soon as the dockyards become less profitable and invest elsewhere, without a care for the fate of the workers."
"This is made easier for them by the fact that many dockyards are tied to industrial groups such as Alstom, which have interests in several sectors and which make redundancies in some whilst receiving subsidies in others."
"As we have no intention of giving any kind of help to the shareholders of the huge shipbuilding corporations, we have voted against the report."
"If shipbuilding is necessary for Europe' s economy, it must be brought under state control. The answer is not to subsidise its private owners with money that we will never see again."
". (DE) My group welcomes the Commission's proposal to introduce a temporary defensive mechanism for European shipyards in the light of the breakdown in the negotiations to put an immediate end to the unfair international competition in the shipbuilding sector."
"We also fully support the parliamentary amendments contained in the report, and in particular the one extending the duration of the measure until the end of 2003."
"For some time now, together with colleagues from other groups, my group has been highlighting the general problems faced by European shipbuilding and the specific problems resulting from the international situation."
"In September, the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left visited eastern Germany to familiarise itself with the situation faced by shipyards there and made renewed pleas to the Commission to take action."
"We see it as positive that a Commission proposal has now at last been tabled, which assures the yards, which have clearly suffered considerable damage because of unfair Korean trade practices, that help is at hand in the form of solutions which can be implemented quickly."
"Many of these yards are in structurally weak regions with very severe economic and social problems and form the core of the existing economic structure."
"Their existence and prosperity are the only way to secure thousands of jobs and safeguard the economic development of these regions."
"However, my group also believes that further measures are necessary to safeguard the future of European shipbuilding, which is one of the essential branches of European industry."
"These might include, in particular:"
"programmes to promote investment, which will have a long-term structural impact and create jobs;"
"the promotion of European cooperation on research and development in areas which affect the maritime economy;"
"the development of a coordinated maritime policy at European level;"
"the formulation and implementation of a European transport policy which seeks to move freight and passenger transport from the land to the sea."
"We call on the Commission to take a stance on the fundamental issues surrounding the future of European shipbuilding in the first half of 2002 and to propose an action programme to resolve the medium- and long-term problems."
"I have voted in favour of this proposal because it is the lesser of two evils."
"Nevertheless, this feet-dragging over unfair competition, now with South Korea, is allowing business to shift to the Far East, leading to the eradication of all shipbuilding activity in the European Union, including repairs and renovation as well as the building of new vessels."
"Without operational and technologically up-to-date shipyards, our strategies for maritime safety, employment and regional cohesion will be at risk, and will be hard to recover with palliative measures."
"Katiforis report (A5-0352/2001)"
". (IT) Like all the Members in Chamber, I feel that the protection and safeguarding of human health are vital."
"I therefore consider that it is of the utmost importance to uphold the position calling for the introduction of both a minimum excise duty of 57 % and a minimum payment - EUR 70 - with the aim of increasing the sales price of tobacco."
"The measure is very important in that it will discourage regular consumers from using tobacco. Furthermore, it will have a preventive effect in that it will discourage those tempted to use tobacco for the first time from doing so."
"As I have already pointed out in a written question - reference number P-2140/99 - to the European Commission, I find it absurd that we should increase European financing and contributions to tobacco growers while, at the same time, declaring that we are working to combat smoking."
"I therefore call upon the European Parliament to support this measure and throw some light on the matter."
"Quite clearly, the proviso must be that the Member States, as Community bodies, also increase their endeavours to prevent, control and curb illegal trading and trafficking in cigarettes."
"(IT) I voted for the Katiforis legislative resolution on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 92/79/EEC, Directive 92/80/EEC and Directive 95/59/EC as regards the structure and rates of excise duty applied on manufactured tobacco products, which calls upon the Commission to withdraw its proposal for a number of reasons unanimously upheld by the entire Italian section of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (Republicans, Democrats and members of the Italy of Values party)."
"The proposal to revise the current subsidies for tobacco growing would have had a disastrous effect on the economies of entire rural areas which are some of the most disadvantaged in the European Union, as can be seen from a recent European statistical analysis carried out by Eurostat."
"The Commission addresses the 'tobacco issue' purely from the point of view of health, which is why it attempts to question the provision of Community aid to growers and goes so far as to propose an early revision of the COM in tobacco in order to reduce quotas and cut subsidies to the sector."
"We feel that this opinion errs in that it is too rash, and I am glad to say that it was amended at the Gothenburg Summit."
"We are convinced that it would be wrong to penalise an agricultural sector which is at the heart of the economy of countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain."
"Instead of reducing cigarette consumption, the Commission' s proposal would have created nothing but problems for manufacturers, who would have been forced to change the process of importing supplies from third countries with the result that national productions would have been replaced by lower quality imports."
"Lastly, we feel that the position of those who advocate combating smoking by abolishing aid to tobacco growers is ambiguous."
"Strangely, in fact, the Member States which do not grow tobacco but which have not banned smoking would receive sums benefiting their Northern European style of agriculture, which is already sufficiently subsidised, and, what is more, they would hypocritically continue to rake in millions of euro in taxes and excise duties on tobacco products and accessories."
"Schörling report (A5-0356/2001)"
"To its credit, the Schörling report points out that ""The EU is the world's leading producer of chemicals"" and that ""it is high time that we developed a new strategy for controlling chemicals"" ."
"We know that the ""vast majority of existing chemicals - that have been on the market for at least 20 years - have never been properly tested"" and we discover that certain serious diseases are on the increase and that ""a link between these diseases and exposure to chemicals is likely"" ."
"The report therefore recommends the rigorous control of chemicals available on the market, testing prior to any distribution of these products - and the withdrawal of any products that do not pass these tests - and a range of restrictive measures for manufacturers and commercial distributors, intended to force them to guarantee minimum safety standards."
"This position does consider the interests of the public but is unpopular with the Union des Industries Chimiques, a French employers' organisation which, in a letter to Members of the European Parliament, protests about the constraints that we are attempting to impose on companies that manufacture or sell chemical products."
"This shameless lobbying by chemical company owners is in itself enough to make us vote for the Schörling report and for the measures it proposes, even if the rapporteur elsewhere declares herself to be in favour of the market."
". Both the White Paper from the Commission and the report drawn up by Mrs Schorling are flawed, the latter fundamentally."
"The report is based on the general assumption that there are a large number of chemicals that pose a threat to both human health and the environment, and ignores the positive health and environmental benefits to society arising form many man-made chemicals."
"Paragraph 16 of the report seeks to extend the REACH system to cover chemicals manufactured in volumes of under one tonne per year; this will lead to a possible twenty-fold increase in the number of chemicals requiring authorisation, and an impossible workload for those given that task."
"The scope should be limited to those chemicals produced in volumes over one tonne, as set out in the White Paper."
"Paragraph 38, which sets out which substance shall be classified as being of very high concern, is too broad for any authorisation system to be workable."
"The definition should be restricted to CMR (categories 1 and 2), and POP substances, as defined in the Stockholm Convention."
"The provisions of the report will lead to an unacceptable increase in the amount of tests carried out on animals."
"A report by the Institute of Environmental Health in the United Kingdom, estimated that 12.8 million animals will be needed in the testing of 30,000 chemicals."
"These figures have been echoed by many European animal welfare groups."
"The rapporteur recognises this problem, but places too much faith in the availability and acceptability of non-animal tests."
"Furthermore, to gather ""base-set"" level of information simply for chemicals manufactured in volumes over one tonne per year will take approximately 36 years alone, according to the IEH report."
"The timescale set out in the report (2008) is thus completely unrealistic."
"The European chemicals industry has been consulted far too late, and its attempts at self-regulation (e.g. Product Stewardship, the Long Range Research Initiative and ""Confidence in Chemicals"") have been completely ignored by the rapporteur in this report."
"Since the proposals in the report look likely to increase the administrative burden on the industry (particularly SMEs), as well as dent its competitiveness on a global scale, this is a serious oversight."
". (DE) I have just voted against the Schörling Report."
"The Group of the European People's Party/European Democrats, to which I belong, did not manage to secure a majority in favour of its constructive amendments."
"What has now been adopted has clearly been influenced too much by ideology."
"Of course this is about environmental safety, but it is also about competitive and innovative jobs in the chemical industry."
"Over the last few weeks I have been investigating the consequences of the Schörling Report by talking to those whom it will affect."
"I have visited production plants and had discussions with management, workers and unions."
"None of those parties is calling into question the aim of the Commission's White Paper, which is to secure the sustainability of the chemical industry."
"From an ecological point of view, we obviously need the greatest possible protection of the environment and consumers."
"From an economic point of view, we need uniform basic conditions so as to ensure that there is fair competition for SMEs, users and processors."
"From a social point of view this is about having a high level of health protection and high standards of industrial safety."
"At least we were able to prevent the registration requirement for substances with a production volume of one tonne per year from being introduced."
"As it is, the current classification of substances above 10 tonnes per year and the reporting requirement before they are put on the market is only being managed by the authorities with great difficulty."
"The European People's Party Group did succeed in one respect: there was no majority in favour of double testing all chemicals."
"This does not increase safety and is costly in terms of time and money; incidentally it is completely unnecessary because the authorities already examine these data."
"I do not consider it acceptable to find substitutes for dangerous substances and methods which should otherwise be banned."
"You cannot define a substance as 'dangerous' on the basis of its properties, but only on the basis of its uses."
"Take a knife: it is extremely useful at home and in everyday life, but it becomes dangerous if it is used as a weapon for anything from attacking people to hijacking aircraft."
"It is also regrettable that it has been agreed that confidential data should be made public: if production volumes, procedures or special compositions, which account for a market advantage, all have to be declared, then we may as well do away with competition right now."
"This is the lifeblood of our companies."
"Any competitor can easily imitate ingenious systems."
"We need to establish once and for all which data are subject to property rights and which are not."
"Before the second reading in Parliament, I hope that the three committees working on this will put their heads together and come up with a more balanced proposal."
"- (PT) I am delighted, not only with the content of the European Commission' s new policy on chemicals, but also with the importance it is attaching to this policy, as clearly demonstrated in the strategy approved by the European Union for the 'Rio+10' Conference, which is due to take place in 2002."
"I welcome, in particular, the following points:"
"1) A complete ban, within a generation, in other words by 2020, of discharges and emissions into the environment of all dangerous substances."
"2) The creation of a single system for the registration, evaluation and authorisation of chemicals (REACH), replacing the current system that treats new substances and existing ones differently."
"3) The adoption of the precautionary principle, through reversing the burden of proof for substances that cause great concern."
"It will now fall to the manufacturer to prove that a product is not dangerous."
"I welcome the Schörling report but prefer, where the tonnage threshold is concerned, the position of the European Commission."
"This system, if it proves feasible, will protect Europe' s citizens."
"Using the same system to evaluate substances produced in volumes below and above one tonne per year will make the system too cumbersome and, therefore, contrary to objectives that have been defined."
"I wish to explain my reasons for voting in favour of this report as amended."
"First of all, I feel that it adopts a balanced position, which will improve environmental protection and public health on the one hand and which maintains the competitiveness of the chemical industry on the other, in line with the strategy for sustainable development adopted in Göteborg."
"We must understand the fact that only a tiny minority of the more than 100 000 chemical substances in existence have to date been tested and that, furthermore, they are being produced in greater numbers each year."
"Consequently, only 14% of chemical substances produced in a quantity of more than one tonne are given a classification under the current system."
"The tragic events in Toulouse recently demonstrated the urgent need to close this gap in our knowledge."
"At the same time, we need to create a system of registration, assessment and authorisation that is 'manageable' for public authorities and that the industry can, in due course, supplement with the necessary data."
"The report' s approach seems to be equally balanced because, apart from purely environmental considerations, it takes account of various socio-economic aspects of prospective legislation, not least the fact that workers in the chemical industry are more exposed, and the specific constraints affecting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Similarly, the report favours transparency whilst respecting data protection and industrial secrecy, which I think is to be welcomed."
"Clear references to the precautionary principle and the substitution principle have, furthermore, been added to the Commission text."
"Lastly, one of the most important points, to my mind, is still the requirement for all substances to be registered, even if some of them are only registered in a simplified form."
"It is often the substances produced in smaller quantities that are the most dangerous for health or for the environment."
"I also feel that the timetables put forward in the report are appropriate because they are realistic."
"I am very pleased that the White Paper will be followed up with a range of legislative proposals by the Commission and I look forward with great interest to seeing them."
"The Committee on the Environment' s vote on this report sends a clear message to industry and to the national authorities to thoroughly monitor chemical substances, and this must be accompanied by the elimination of substances that are toxic and harmful to health and to the environment."
"We therefore fully support the approach of this report which improves, on a number of points, the already ambitious Commission proposal."
"Having said that, in order to be understood, our message must also be balanced."
"This is why we support a pragmatic approach and reject a raft of unrealistic demands that would heavily penalise the European chemical industry."
"I wish to point out that this industry directly or indirectly involves no less than 5 million jobs."
"I shall turn first of all to paragraph 16, which calls for the registration of all substances of less than one tonne in weight: this means that 100 000 products are involved instead of the 30 000 proposed by the Commission, tens of thousands of files, impossible bureaucracy, a nightmare for the numerous SMEs in the sector and all of this for products which, for the most part, never reach the market."
"Extending the scope of the authorisation procedure (paragraph 38) is also unfeasible: in order to avoid an unmanageable situation, we call, in Amendment No 68, for substances for which there is no proof of toxicity to be excluded."
"In conclusion, although we must send a message that is powerful, it must also be credible."
"Sending a declaration of war to industry, to the workers and to the national authorities seems neither appropriate nor productive."
"Given the risk that chemicals present to people' s health and to the environment, we Swedish Christian Democrats believe it to be obvious that, in accordance with the principle of 'no data, no marketing' , chemicals which have not undergone certain tests should not be allowed to be marketed, either."
"Furthermore, we support the substitution principle which has long been a well-established principle of Swedish chemicals policy."
"In the same way, we believe that a reversed burden of proof should apply to substances that give cause for concern, which means that it is the industry, not the authorities, which has to demonstrate that a subject can be used in an acceptable way."
"Because chemicals can involve significant risks in smaller quantities too, we believe that chemicals in quantities of less than a tonne which are imported to, or produced within, the EU should also be covered by the new system."
"In that way, we shall in quite a few respects be departing from the position adopted by the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats."
"Corbey report (A5-0323/2001)"
"These days, outrageous packaging is a form of advertising in order to entice buyers."
"A great deal of material is wasted on it."
"It sounds environmentally aware to blame the consumers who buy packaged food or packaged products."
"However, those consumers do not create waste themselves, but are left with it following their purchases."
"They become the victim of conditional sales, because these days, it is often impossible to buy anything without wrapping."
"That is why we need to tackle the production and sale of waste at source instead of focusing on the consumers."
"In the proposed resolution, Mrs Corbey is right to make manufactures and retailers responsible for the prevention of the production of packaging waste and notes that precious little has been achieved since the 1994 packaging directive."
"The European Commission remains disinclined to present fresh proposals, and the Member States implement earlier recycling agreements with a delay of years."
"The rapporteur' s proposal is still torn between two ideas."
"I wholeheartedly agree with her attempt to prevent waste."
"However, I differ with her on the proposal to get the consumer to pay more for all that waste."
"Re-use may be important, but is not the most important solution."
"Salafranca Sánchez Negra report (A5-0336/2001)"
"We are voting against the report in spite of the sound initiatives it contains concerning partnership between the EU and the Latin American countries on, for example, conflict prevention, development cooperation and combating poverty and the drugs trade."
"Our opposition is due to the fact that a number of the proposals in the report take supranational cooperation on, for example, defence, security and foreign policy, as well as on areas of institutional, legal and internal concern as something that goes without saying in the EU."
"We believe that cooperation in the aforesaid areas can be fully engaged in through intergovernmental cooperation."
"The few words the report contains on ""health, education and the fight against abject poverty"" , ""the fight against drugs"" and ""protection of the environment"" , some of the objectives that the European Union claims it is promoting in that part of the world, are nothing more than a smokescreen for considerably more disreputable intentions."
"By proposing that ""the aim of the new agreement should ultimately be the bilateral and preferential liberalisation, on a gradual and reciprocal basis, of the trade in all kinds of goods and services between the two regions, in accordance with WTO rules,"" the countries of the European Union are showing that they could not care less about the fate of the peoples of Latin America."
"They would like, first and foremost, to make up for their slowness in penetrating the Latin American markets, which are already in a parlous state due to the presence of even more powerful predators, such as the North American multinationals."
"Instead of the promised development, the opening up of the markets to huge companies and to the financial establishment has plunged Latin America into poverty."
"At least 224 million Latin Americans live in abject poverty, in other words, more than 40% of the population of that region!"
"And there is not even any discussion of cancelling the debts that are strangling these countries."
"We have consequently voted against this report."
"- (PT) The Rio summit of 28/29 June 1999 marked the beginning of a new phase in bi-regional relations with a view to creating a strategic partnership between the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean."
"The main objectives of the new Joint Strategy must, in line with the priorities adopted in Rio, be political, such as with the extension of the Bi-Regional Political Agenda; the update and revision of political dialogue at ministerial level and the creation of a EU-Latin American Transatlantic Assembly; economic, financial and commercial, such as the conclusion of various Association Agreements and the creation of a EU-Latin America Free Trade Area, which is planned for 2010, and social and cultural, such as the creation of a Bi-regional Solidarity Fund and a global plan to combat drugs, amongst others."
"I therefore give my total support to the rapporteur' s position reiterating the need to establish the bi-regional strategic partnership approved at the Rio summit and in the recommendation to the European Council with a view to approving the EU' s common strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean, on the basis of the objectives established in the Rio summit' s priorities."
"Lastly, the report highlights the need to improve cooperation on the basis of a sustained and integrated partnership, with a view to promoting human development and the development of civil society and the consequent benefits to all levels of society."
"Motion for a resolution on air transport (B5-0702/2001)"
"Claiming that the airlines are suffering as a result of the 11 September attacks on the United States is a barefaced lie."
"Although some carriers have had problems, these are not new and not all airlines are in that position. Far from it."
"Air France' s share dividends, for example, have increased by 22%, and this happened three days after the attacks on New York and Washington."
"It has just bought out Air Afrique and brought Alitalia under its wing as well as the Czech airline CSA."
"And, like other large European airlines, it is also doing very well out of the bankruptcies of AOM-Air Liberté, Sabena and Swissair."
"This is the result of giving free rein to the market, which national and European leaders claim should govern everything, the economy and the fate of workers."
"In recent years in Europe, this has led to hundreds of thousands of job losses in the air transport sector alone, which does not cause national and European leaders to bat an eyelid because huge profits are consequently pocketed by the companies' shareholders, such as the incredibly wealthy Baron Seillière, the French ""bosses' boss"" ."
"The attacks of 11 September have simply been an excuse for the capitalists in the air transport sector to receive new subsidies while pursuing their offensive against their employees."
"And they have been aided and protected in this endeavour by the various national governments."
"We have seen this again recently in France, in Belgium and in Switzerland with companies going bankrupt and sacking tens of thousands of employees, at no cost at all to the key players who are largely responsible for these bankruptcies, such as Baron Seillière."
"We have, therefore, voted against this motion for a resolution which is cynical enough to claim that it is for the sake of employment that it wants to give further subsidies to the companies and capitalists in the air transport sector, who are already responsible for making hundreds of thousands of people redundant."
"The reason why I am unable to vote for this resolution is that it is mainly founded on the idea of protecting the expansion of aviation which, until recently, was deemed self-evident."
"To date, this expansion has posed a major problem for the environment, leading to increasing levels of pollution, growing insecurity and increasing pressure on public space for airports."
"Furthermore, aviation firmly had the edge on railways in terms of taxes, because kerosene is still not taxed, while all forms of travel on the ground are."
"Even before 11 September, there was every reason to search for possibilities to stop and reverse this expansion."
"The fact that the number of passengers has now dropped dramatically should not be a reason for supporting airline companies by granting even more tax money, but rather a reason for investing in the improvement of other forms of intra-European passenger transport."
"A surcharge on the aircraft rates which have taken a nose dive over the last few years due to competition can cover the dramatic upsurge in insurance premiums."
"There is no reason for injecting more public funding into aviation."
"However, that money is needed desperately to protect the position of the workers of airline companies."
"They thought for years that they had a secure, government-protected job in a growth industry, but the industry is now shrinking or even going bankrupt."
"(The sitting was suspended at 2.00 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer"
"The next item is the report (A5-0348/2001) by Mr Bouwman, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Council Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer [COM(2000) 832 - C5-0017/2001 - 2001/0008(COD)]."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before we start the debate on my report - and I hope you are also keeping an eye on the time - I should like to raise a matter in connection with the way in which we will be dealing with this report further."
"It was scheduled to be debated before twelve noon."
"It has overrun."
"There is nothing that can be done about this, for that is how it is in this House."
"It is a report in the framework of the codecision procedure on employees' rights and insolvency."
"I, as rapporteur, have nothing against the fact that we are debating it now, but I do disagree with the fact that we would subsequently vote on it during a very vague gathering of votes later on this afternoon."
"I should therefore like to request - and I have already discussed this with the larger groups - to decide beforehand that we will debate the report now but that we will postpone the vote to the brief part-session in Brussels and possibly to a later date, although I am very much opposed to this."
"That also gives us the opportunity of tabling a number of amendments and changes as a whole."
"It seemed a totally uncontroversial report, but nevertheless, there are a number of elements which require further discussion."
"That is why I would ask to postpone the vote until the next part-session."
"I do not know whether you can respond to this now."
"Thank you, Mr Bouwman, I have taken note of your request."
"We can have one speaker in favour of your request and one speaker against."
"Who would like to speak out in favour? That is Mrs Van den Burg."
"You have the floor for one minute."
"I should like to support the request because in my view, it is indeed inappropriate to be voting on a report in the framework of the codecision procedure in a very small gathering of this Parliament."
"Furthermore, it will probably give us some more time to consider other compromises for issues which are currently controversial, because it is also a complex report which contains a number of ambiguities about the different amendments."
"I would therefore like to support the request."
"Thank you, Mrs Van den Burg."
"Mr Gollnisch would like to speak against the request."
"You have one minute."
"I do not really need a minute, Madam President. I requested the floor on a point of order, but, in fact, my point fully echoes the concerns of the rapporteur."
"I would like to know whether the Commission might be able to give us any indication of its reasons for withdrawing its communication initially scheduled on the agenda on the World Trade Organisation and, possibly, when this important communication might be given."
"Thank you, Mr Gollnisch, I shall deal with that request in a moment, but let us first finish the point that is on the agenda, namely the request by Mr Bouwman."
"(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee) I would now like to give the floor to Mrs Diamantopoulou and give her the opportunity to state briefly why the WTO debate has been taken off the agenda."
"Madam President, I just wish to say that it was impossible for Mr Lamy to be here because the WTO meeting lasted longer than expected."
"So the Commission will certainly make a statement to Parliament on the WTO, but I cannot say when that will be."
"Mr Lamy will come here as soon as he can."
"Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou, I can only endorse what you have just said."
"I myself have only just returned from Doha, and it was a tough negotiating round."
"Mr Lamy only landed in Brussels at 6 a.m. this morning, so I trust we can all be accommodating in this matter."
"Mr Bouwman, I am giving you, as rapporteur, the floor for five minutes to present your report."
"I should like to express my thanks once again, for the broad support for the proposals."
"This might well be a Pyrrhic victory, but we shall have to wait and see."
"I wanted to raise the following matter."
"We have here a document on employees' rights in the event of insolvency, that is to say when a business is no longer able to meet its financial obligations."
"It is a revision of Council Directive 80/987EEC with a number of improvements on what was in there before."
"A directive such as this aims to give a minimum level of protection in the event of insolvency."
"Almost at the same time that I was appointed rapporteur for this dossier, a group of people turned up from the Sintel company in Spain - a company that was split off from Telefonica, sold by them, in fact. They had been campaigning in Madrid for months because they had not been paid for months."
"In other words, in addition to what I already knew at the time, this realistic description was sufficient to show me at first-hand how significant this report, concealed behind a mass of insolvency terminology, is."
"The old document, of course, dates back to 1980."
"A great deal has changed since then, especially within the labour markets, in terms of types of employees and descriptions of the same, the economy has become more globalised and internationalised, there are more businesses that operate both within a certain country and outside it."
"In addition, there are still cases where it is unclear which country ought to pay out social security benefits."
"Of course, there have been a number of procedures for the Court of Justice to deal with, and all these aspects combined have led to the Commission presenting a proposal to change the existing directive."
"The three main problems at the time were: the concept of insolvency, the placing of a time-limit on the guarantee and, particularly, insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension."
"I have great admiration for those who have submitted the Commission proposals and who have tabled a few amendments following detailed discussions."
"These mainly pertain to the new legal basis following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the clarification of the scope and the possible scrapping of the annexes in which quite a few groups are mentioned which can be excluded or not, as the case may be, the new definition of the term 'intervention' and especially the new provisions establishing the guarantee fund that covers cross-border cases."
"In my view, it is important to revisit what I describe as the scope as a whole, for the question as to which categories could still be exempt is still subject to possible debate, especially in the field of domestic staff and the so-called share fishermen."
"If I had my way, I would scrap this as a whole, as I have also said during the debate."
"I think that the Commission would also be in favour of this, but a number of countries provide for exemption provisions, and we do not want to make life too difficult for them."
"What we do consider important is that the Commission has meanwhile included a number of elements which were already being developed within this labour market, where, for example, part-time workers, workers with a temporary agency employment relationship, or workers with fixed-term contracts, are concerned via existing directives in these intervention directives."
"Since we are as yet unsure about the implications of this, we have to point out - as have many, as will be clear in a moment - that these days, there are an ever increasing number of categories of self-employed, including the quasi self-employed as they are referred to by some, without staff, with staff who would or would not qualify, and then especially those without staff."
"Those with staff are, in fact, employers."
"In addition, we still have categories of home workers - mind the translation in this case - because it literally means those working from home, and this could well be the topic of a number of discussions."
"In fact, it would also be very useful if some progress were made in the legislative work in line with the discussion in the framework of the social dialogue on modernising labour relations, and that is why we made a number of proposals that are now before you."
"In this connection, I would therefore ask my fellow MEPs to back amendments which pertain to the self-employed without staff, so as to open the debate with the Council in any case."
"I should like to point out that what is at issue is a codecision procedure and that we will be entering into negotiations after second reading in order to be able to take a step forward in the field of social security and social policy in Europe."
"Madam President, it is a little odd that I should have to take the floor on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, but that is because Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, who has written the opinion for Mr Bouwman' s report - on which I should like to congratulate him warmly - is unable to attend due to a change in schedule."
"I can, in fact, be relatively brief about the opinion."
"Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has particularly attempted to underline the legal aspects of this directive."
"A number of elements have been adopted, while a number of other elements have not been adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"In any case, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market deems it extremely important for the opinion to be thought-out well."
"That is why it is also important to return it to the committee, so that it can re-examined very carefully."
"That also - and perhaps mainly - applies to the position of the self-employed."
"Indeed, I welcome the fact that the self-employed fall within its scope, at least the self-employed who can be compared to employees."
"However, there is, of course, the risk that we give people who we actually do not want to fall within the scope of this definition at all, a tremendous opportunity, turning them into a kind of preferred creditor in a bankruptcy."
"I am not certain whether in the texts as they are worded now, sufficient distinction is being drawn between the two situations, in fact."
"That is a problem that will require further examination, also in terms of the position of the self-employed."
"Madam President, Commissioner, before I start my speech I would like to inform Mr Bouwman that the company he was referring to is the Sintel company, which went bankrupt, forcing unemployment on a large number of its employees."
"However, several months ago the Spanish Government took on the responsibility of making backdated wage payments to Sintel' s employees, relocating or finding other such solutions for all those affected."
"I say this so that you may be fully informed, Mr Bouwman."
"Now I will move on to my speech on this report."
"The document we are debating refers to the proposal for amending Directive 80/987/EEC on the approximation of national laws relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer."
"Mr Bouwman has, in fact, given a very clear example of this situation."
"The amendment aims to take into account changes to insolvency law in Member States and the need for consistency with other Community directives on labour law already adopted."
"All of this should be based on a political will to provide employees with a minimum degree of protection under Community law in the event of their employer becoming insolvent."
"The difficulties involved in achieving the intended objective of the Directive are, in my opinion, threefold: firstly, the concept of insolvency; secondly, the complexity of the arrangement introduced to allow a time and quantity limits to be placed on the guarantee; thirdly, insolvency cases with a cross-border dimension."
"With the aim of clarifying the situation, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has once again tabled two amendments: No 16, which includes cases of externalisation or similar, subcontracts, the 'fake self-employed' , etc., all of which could conceal a true employment contract."
"In our opinion, we need to reveal the truth before protective methods are implemented, to protect the salaried employee."
"To not do this would be to open the floodgates which would quickly exhaust the fund in question."
"Amendment No 17 clarifies the notion of protectable earnings from the corresponding national fund and prevents fraud."
"All of this is inherent to the protective nature of labour legislation and is inspired by the desire to clearly define the concepts needed for the fund to serve its purpose."
"This is a clarification of ideas which aids progress towards legal certainty and harmonisation."
"Regrettably, this is a case which, as we have recently witnessed with another Belgian company, is taking place in large companies, due to the restructuring of these companies and the relations which currently exist in the economic world."
"Madam President, I do not know whether this afternoon was the first time that you have been in the chair, presiding over Parliament. If it is, congratulations."
"I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his exceptionally good report and sound preparations for this dossier."
"I fear that in the current climate, the report is indeed very topical and that this will continue to be the case for the foreseeable future."
"All the more reason for ensuring that we protect those employees who are faced with bankruptcy and suspension of payment."
"That is the rationale underlying the preparations for this report."
"I am also pleased that we in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have reached overwhelming agreement."
"There are a few loose ends that need tying up, a few points on which we do not yet see eye to eye completely."
"A moment ago, I heard Mr Pronk say that it is indeed possible that there are still a number of misunderstandings concerning amendments."
"I am thinking in particular of the point he made, namely the fact that on the one hand, we also want a number of self-employed, notably self-employed who are very much like employees, to fall within the scope of the regulation, but on the other hand, this should not open the floodgates to mutual aid between employers and service providers who would be able to use those funds."
"We are agreed on the intention."
"We should use the time we now have until the actual vote to consider whether those misunderstandings can be removed and whether this joint intention can be expressed in a compromise amendment."
"In my view, the point about the self-employed is a very important one, particularly in this dossier."
"However, it also crops up in a number of other dossiers."
"That is why I should like to draw the Commissioner' s attention to this point and ask him whether the Commission could show some more initiative both on this matter and on the matter of defining which categories should in fact be comparable with employees."
"This is not only of paramount importance for the issue of insolvency, of course, but also for a lot of other aspects of employment protection and labour law."
"Those definitions in European law are still left for the Member States to deal with."
"We have noticed that there are rather considerable discrepancies between them."
"As cross-border employment increases, and this will become ever more popular in the European Union, it will mean that we will be increasingly faced with different definitions and different groups which will cause disruption to labour market relations."
"Enlargement in particular is a huge cause for concern, as we have already witnessed in the past and are witnessing at the moment in the EU' s border regions."
"I should therefore like to ask the Commissioner what initiatives she intends to take on this score and urge her to adopt a pro-active stance on this."
"Madam President, my congratulations to the rapporteur on a job well done, together with my thanks for his help in ensuring that the amendments needed to the overall endeavour were accepted."
"The amendments to this directive follow on from amendments to two other directives relating to mass redundancies and company transfers, the common objective of all of which is to protect workers' interests when companies are restructured and we must not forget this."
"They therefore ipso facto raise the question of coordinating the common concepts used and I think that we need to pay attention to this when the amendments are finalised."
"Secondly, this directive also fails to address the question of communitising the definition of salaries."
"Despite the difficulties inherent in this endeavour, the Fifteen need to adopt a minimum common definition of the concept of employee if the directive is to be applied uniformly."
"Otherwise, every country, depending on whether it has a broader or narrower understanding of the concept, will differentiate the scope of the directive as it sees fit."
"We need to tread carefully on this point."
"The proposed amendments, which I too support, include extending the scope of the directive to employees under what qualify as ""implied"" contracts in national legislation."
"If we are not mature enough to extend the directive to the self-employed, we could at least extend the scope of the directive to employees who are self-employed but who are treated as employees under special legislation."
"Secondly, this amendment is an inclusion in the sense of covered claims and severance pay, as provided for in International Labour Convention No. 173, and I fail to see why we cannot cover them in Europe."
"Thirdly, it is the clearest redefinition of the meaning of insolvency so as to include any collective insolvency proceedings and not just traditional bankruptcy proceedings."
"In any case it is also in the objectives of the directive and has not approximated any formulation."
"The House would be well advised to approve these three amendments."
"Madam President, I welcome the favourable reception that the Commission proposal has received and I would like to thank Parliament for its contributions aimed at further reinforcing the protection of workers affected by the insolvency of their employer."
"The Insolvency Directive has proved to be an invaluable instrument for protecting employees in cases of economic downturns and it will be a key legislative instrument to respond to the present climate of closures and redundancies."
"Although the basic structure of the directive should be retained, specific points of the directive need to be revised."
"I welcome Amendment No 2 which aims to prevent the introduction of new restrictions beyond those currently in place in the Member States, and also Amendment No 9 which proposes to prohibit threshold provisions in order to qualify for claims under the directive."
"I am also in favour of Amendment No 4 which proposes to extend the protection of workers of employers in other insolvency situations beyond those situations covered by the definition of insolvency proposed by the Commission."
"Firstly, the broadening of the definition is fully acceptable."
"However, on Amendment No 6, the extension to any other procedure or even to ""de facto"" situations of insolvency can only be accepted as an option for the Member States and not as an obligation."
"I can also accept Amendment No 11, which proposes to add severance pay on termination of the employment relationship, with the addition of the term ""where appropriate""."
"The term ""pay"" should continue to be defined in the national law of the Member States."
"Amendment No 14, which proposes the abolition of a ceiling, is not acceptable in its entirety but I share your concerns on this point and I could accept a provision which allows ceilings which are compatible with the social purpose of the directive in order to avoid a level which is unacceptable for workers."
"I am also ready to supplement this provision with a non-regression clause which impedes Member States from lowering the protection already provided when implementing the amended directive."
"Finally, I can accept the reintroduction of the old Article 5 of the directive - Amendment No 15 - but this only in the old unchanged version of this article in the 1980 directive."
"I am unable to accept the remaining amendments, in particular Amendment No 13 which aims to increase the minimum period for pay to six months."
"Such an increase would seriously reduce the chance of the directive being adopted and would place a further considerable financial burden on the public purse and employers which would in turn cast doubt on the system of pay guarantees as a whole."
"I cannot accept Amendment No 1, which aims to prevent employees from being ""converted"" to self-employed persons; Amendment No 7 which proposes the introduction of a Community definition of ""employee""; nor Amendments Nos 8 and 16 which propose to add categories of workers who may not be excluded from the scope of the directive."
"Efforts to combat illegal ""conversion"" must be made at national level."
"A Community definition of an employed person should not be included in a particular directive, and self-employed workers cannot be covered because they do not have an employer who could be insolvent."
"In line with your comments I agree that there are different types of self-employed people."
"There are some self-employed people who are economically dependent."
"This issue was raised in 2000 when we had consultation with the social partners."
"The responses of the social partners emphasised the need to clarify and analyse the situation in all Member States because there is a diversity of situations, there are many different kinds of self-employed people."
"This was the reason why we have already launched a study which will provide us with an overview of the nature of the phenomenon across the European Union."
"Once we have the results of the study, the Commission will analyse it and after a consultation with the social partners we will present the appropriate way to deal with this issue."
"The other categories - home-workers and those in similar categories - are covered to the extent that they are considered to be employees under national law."
"There is, therefore, no need to mention them specifically."
"Finally, some amendments should be rejected because they would not help to achieve the underlying objective of the proposal."
"To sum up, I can accept, subject to some minor redrafting, Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 9, and 11, and parts of Amendments Nos 14 and 15."
"I reject Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17 and 18."
"I would like to thank you for your contribution."
"I would particularly like to thank and congratulate Mr Bouwman for his contribution and for the report."
"The vote was postponed a moment ago, just before the debate started."
"You will hear in due course when this will take place."
"The debate is now closed."
"I thank you."
"Oh, I am sorry, Mr Bouwman."
"I should briefly like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Vice-President of this meeting at the end of the debate of her first report as Vice-President."
"Thank you very much."
"It was a pleasure to start off with a Dutch rapporteur."
"The next item is the report by Mr Nobilia on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on new European labour markets, open to all, with access for all."
"New European labour markets"
"Madam President, on behalf of my colleague, Mr Nobilia who is not present and on behalf of my Group, I wish to invoke Rule 146 and ask the House to postpone this debate until the December part-session."
"Mr Nobilia has tried various other means to have the debate postponed but, unfortunately, Parliament' s Rules of Procedure do not permit this."
"We therefore, have no option but to ask the House, pursuant to Rule 146, as I said, to grant a postponement until December - of both the debate and the vote."
"Mr Ribeiro, I have taken note of your request."
"I should now like to give the floor to a speaker who would like to speak in favour of this request."
"Mr Pronk, you have one minute."
"Madam President, allow me to add my congratulations on your first debate in which so many Dutch people have taken the floor."
"This sentiment is also shared by the Christian Democratic Appeal as the largest delegation in the largest group. The request is logical in my view."
"The matter has been reassigned, something which Mr Nobilia was not aware of."
"It is an important report and it seems that we are doing the right thing."
"I do not believe that this is the right time to conduct a proper debate, nor is this the right way. We have to postpone it."
"It is not necessary to reach a vote at all cost today. That is why we support this request."
"Mr Pronk is therefore in favour of postponement."
"I would now put the request to the vote."
"(Parliament decided to refer the report back to committee) I believe that we do this regretfully, for there are so many things that are being shelved and the year has not long to run."
"However, the debate has thus been held over until the next time."
"That means, ladies and gentlemen, that we will be adjourning the meeting until 4 p.m. because that is when the topical and urgent debate will commences."
"Thank you for your attendance."
"I declare the sitting adjourned until 4 p.m."
"(The sitting was adjourned at 3.35 p.m. and resumed at 4 p.m.)"
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Accident in the Gotthard Tunnel"
"We shall start with the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0710/2001 by Mrs Wallis, Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mr Caveri, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;"
"B5-0718/2001 by Mrs Isler Béguin and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;"
"B5-0724/2001, by Mr Simpson and Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;"
"B5-0725/2001 by Mrs Ainardi and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel;"
"B5-0734/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the accident in the Saint Gotthard tunnel."
"Mr President, the very recent and all too familiar disasters that have taken place in the Mont Blanc and Gotthard tunnels reveal the terrible truth about Europe' s current transport policy."
"And in this case, revealing the truth can only lead to condemnation."
"The world of road transport seems to have broken free from any legal framework, from any control standards."
"Freight companies exempt themselves from having operating permits, work permits are becoming optional for drivers who increasingly come from outside the Union, when their driving times verge on the limit and when they themselves verge on sleep."
"How many more Gotthards and Mont Blancs must go up in flames before they are covered by strict legislation, by an effective system of controls which is both harmonised and trans-European?"
"The residents of all sensitive or high-density areas and all professionals are calling for Europe to intervene and the matter is of the greatest urgency."
"The most sensible course of action would now be to set up safety escorts for convoys of lorries in every major tunnel."
"Until this first safety measure is put in place, lives will still be in danger when these two accident-stricken tunnels are reopened."
"We must no longer be asked to show patience over this harmonisation of safety standards for tunnels. Instead, the finger must be clearly pointed and this political nervousness, this lack of commitment on the part of public authorities to the costly but necessary restructuring of underground tunnels must be condemned."
"Although a review of practices in the road transport sector is required, an in-depth discussion of our transport policy is no less needed."
"The tragedies that have taken place in these tunnels demonstrate the physical and ideological shortcomings of the 'everything by road' approach, which clogs up transport links and chokes the environment."
"Let us open up our eyes, then, and cast off the blinkers that force us to see only roads, and we will finally see the entire European network of stations and railway lines that are almost completely overlooked in terms of providing piggyback transport."
"We will see that some ports, such as those in Italy, offer transit options that are likely to reduce traffic considerably on the road links of European trade."
"The memory of the victims of Gotthard and Mont Blanc must inspire us to adopt a new approach, one that is more forward looking and more respectful of our means of transport."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you will recall, in the last Strasbourg week we had actually planned to have a debate to celebrate the opening of the Mont Blanc Tunnel."
"In fact even then we were already discussing the tragic accident in the Gotthard Tunnel."
"If we continue just to talk about this and do not take any measures then we will have to be prepared for the fact that there will be more accidents in these delicate and sensitive areas, in particular in the Alps."
"However, in my opinion, and on the basis of my understanding of politics, this is unacceptable."
"That is why we must do all we can to actually implement the proposals which the Commission has already rightly made in its White Paper."
"I have no doubt that specific safety measures are also needed in the tunnels."
"I have no doubt that stricter monitoring of working time, above all, is also required."
"I hope that we will soon conclude the conciliation on this and that we will then move on to implementing and monitoring the measures on working time across Europe."
"However, the fundamental problem is surely that there is too much freight rumbling through the Alps by road in heavy goods vehicles."
"This is certainly not - as time and again it is wrongly assumed, appealing to popular sentiment - about standing in the way of economic links and cohesion; it is simply about this cohesion, these economic links and trade in general being created in a way which firstly is environmentally sustainable and secondly minimises the risk of accidents."
"We will never be able to avoid them altogether, but we can minimise them and in so doing we can also above all give the railways a golden opportunity."
"I - and I myself have also produced a report on opening up international freight routes - am in favour of the railways being stronger competitors here."
"At the same time, I am however, on behalf of my group, also in favour of the transport policy, as postulated and laid down in the White Paper - I will say this once more in conclusion - being implemented quickly, in fact very quickly indeed, so that steps can be taken as soon as possible to avoid there being more accidents like the one in the Gotthard Tunnel."
"Who could possibly be against the content of this motion for a resolution when, following the Mont Blanc tragedy, a tunnel has, once again, caused loss of life?"
"Parliament will, most likely, vote in favour of the resolution."
"We will move down the agenda and things will continue as before, because calling for an integrated transport policy for the whole of the Alpine region in one resolution is not enough to ensure that it is actually implemented."
"There must be a genuine rethink of transport policy at European level."
"There must be the political will to confront the road transport lobby and, above all, there must be investment to develop rail networks to meet the needs of everyone, not just to make profit."
"This would require a radical break with your policy of privatisation and of dismantling public services."
"Furthermore, the organisation of goods transport is inseparable from the global economic system."
"The development, for example, of the zero stock system, which is highly profitable for private interests, is an aberration from the social point of view, because it is responsible, to a large extent, for clogging up the roads."
"Giving priority to private interests, therefore, is bound to conflict with the general interest."
"This motion for a resolution, for which we will be voting, will just be added to the long wish list that the European Parliament is continually producing."
"Mr President, it seems to be fate. On the final day of the last part-session - 24 October 2001 - we were discussing the reopening of the Mont Blanc tunnel."
"There was a bit of an argument - some were in favour, such as yours truly, and some wanted to put back the date of this major event."
"Suddenly, into the middle of the debate came the news of the other incident in the St Gotthard tunnel, an unforeseen incident similar to that which had occurred in the Mont Blanc tunnel and which we had thought would now never be repeated."
"Those in favour of opening the Mont Blanc tunnel to traffic immediately were once again advocating this line of action on health grounds, basing their argument particularly on a document produced by the operating company, which, pompously - and maybe rightly - stated that the Mont Blanc tunnel, rebuilt after the accident, is now the safest in the world."
"I remember announcements, official pronouncements, so to speak, describing the St Gotthard tunnel as the most important tunnel certainly in Europe if not in the world."
"Now we know that a very run-of-the-mill accident was enough in the past, is enough now and will be enough in future to turn these megasafe tunnels into people traps, and the many victims always pay with their lives."
"It is difficult to apportion blame for these incidents; moreover, that is not for us to do."
"However, one statistic does need to be mentioned here, for it concerns something for which we and, in particular, the Commission are responsible."
"Indeed, considering that five times as many vehicles pass through the St Gotthard tunnel as usually run on all the other major routes through the Alps, we are faced with a transport policy error, and that is partly the fault of Europe, for most of the vehicles, particularly the heavy goods vehicles, are European."
"I would therefore put two questions to the Commission."
"What has happened to the directive on harmonising the minimum safety requirements for road and rail tunnels?"
"And I would ask the Commission, what has happened to the action plan for an integrated transport policy in the Alpine region?"
"When the answers have been given to these two questions, we can proceed to the usual road versus rail argument."
"Lastly, Mr President, I do not agree that heavy goods vehicles should be banned from using the tunnel."
"Road haulage contractors have a right of passage and a right to provide a service as well."
"Mr President, the dramatic repercussions of the accident in the St Gotthard tunnel, especially after the equally tragic repercussions in the Mont Blanc and Val Thorens tunnels, have put the issue of tunnel safety right at the top of the agenda."
"We need to push ahead on two fronts at European level."
"First, we need enhanced specifications and, secondly, we need to support motorrail services through the Alps."
"The Commission announced in the White Paper referred to by almost all the members that it intends to propose European regulations setting out minimum safety standards for tunnels."
"These standards will apply to technical equipment, traffic regulations, user information, training for staff operating the tunnels, for staff dealing with accidents when problems arise and for rescue services."
"It is a complicated endeavour which needs to take account of a plethora of different parameters, given the extent to which one tunnel differs from another in terms of geography, size and traffic density."
"At present, the Commission is carrying out pre-preparatory work with the help of first-class experts, with a view to submitting a proposal to Parliament at the beginning of 2002."
"In the meantime, it also intends to convene a meeting of political and economic agencies operating in the Alps and the Pyrenees."
"Of course, even the best legislative proposals are no good unless they are adopted and applied."
"And as regards the safety of tunnels in particular, I should like to remind the House of other proposals which have yet to be adopted."
"I should like to remind the House of the proposal to introduce digital tachographs which allow the time spent on the road by lorry drivers to be controlled accurately and which several Member States have opposed."
"Or the Commission proposal on working conditions for lorry drivers, which Mr Swoboda has already referred to."
"Then there is the question of certifying professional drivers and the question of small lorries which constantly exceed the 90 kilometre limit and have become accidents waiting to happen on the majority of roads in most Member States."
"The fire in this tunnel also illustrates the need for information for tunnel users."
"It is clear that, had users been informed, many could have escaped via the emergency exit or by getting out of their cars immediately."
"And, of course, this particular accident again raises the question of freight transport through the Alps."
"The absolute priority, in the medium term, is to provide rail links to alleviate freight transport with motorrail services as quickly as possible and this is one of the major priorities in the White Paper."
"In the period between 1994 and 2000, the European Commission funded studies into the implementation of the new Lyon-Turin rail link. So far 60 million has been spent, about 50% of the total cost."
"This project, in which the Community is, to date, indisputably the biggest provider of funds, is one of 14 projects approved by the European Union Council in Essen in 1994 which, unfortunately, it will not be possible to complete before 2010."
"The Brenner rail route also needs to be commissioned as quickly as possible, in accordance with the 1996 guidelines on the western European transport network."
"So what can be done in the short term following the problem created by the closure of the St Gotthard tunnel?"
"Immediate use should be made of motorrail facilities in the Alps."
"This accident, and its dramatic repercussions, are yet another reason to make every possible effort to shift freight from the roads to the railways, a mode of transport which only accounts for 8% of the market in Europe, compared with 40% in the United States."
"The European Commission has also taken new initiatives."
"In January 2001, it proposed that the Council sign the transport protocol annexed to the Alpine Convention on behalf of the European Commission, as a political message on restoring the balance of distribution between the various modes of transport."
"Because of difficulty in funding these projects, the White Paper proposes Community legislation laying down fairer pricing principles which take account of all the costs incurred for each mode of transport, together with safety costs."
"To conclude, the Commission has taken or intends to take various specific measures in order to resolve the particular problems besetting the Pyrenees, the Alps and other sensitive areas."
"And I can assure you that it will make every effort to guarantee users the highest possible safety standards."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"That concludes the joint debate."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Human rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"Massacre of 200 civilians in the Federal Republic of Nigeria"
"B5-0711/2001 by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne and Mr Van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;"
"B5-0712/2001 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;"
"B5-0713/2001 by Mr Bowis, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Deva, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the incidents of 22 October in the State of Benue, Central Nigeria;"
"B5-0720/2001 by Mr Swoboda and Mr Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the massacre of civilians in Nigeria;"
"B5-0726/2001 by Mrs Morgantini and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;"
"B5-0732/2001 by Mrs Maes, Mrs McKenna and Mr Rod, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human rights situation in Nigeria;"
"B5-0735/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the incidents in the State of Benue, Nigeria."
"In order to achieve world peace, it is essential for people of different creeds and races to respect each other and live together in peace."
"This is not the case in an increasing number of countries in the world, and that is an extremely worrying trend."
"Unfortunately, Nigeria is an alarming case in point."
"Precious little is left of the hopes which the democratically elected president had raised as successor of the corrupt military regime."
"Ethnic and religious feuds are now the order of the day across the country. Not a month goes by without blood being shed."
"The number of casualties is running into the hundreds and the situation is getting worse, not better."
"In that light, the balance sheet for October is shocking."
"There was fighting between Muslims and Christians in Jos and disturbances in Kano where, moreover, there has been a cholera outbreak. The government army carried out ethnic atrocities and massacres in the Middle Belt."
"The government itself was shrouded in silence."
"Only after two weeks did President Obasanjo announce that a special committee would investigate the murders."
"The billion-dollar question is whether the president is actually up to the task of running this country which is extremely difficult to govern."
"Apparently, his position is not strong enough in order to keep the country united and allow the different nations to live together peacefully."
"It is frightening."
"Just now when we are nearly free of the Taliban, we are lumbered with regions such as the north of Nigeria, where the shari' ah is introduced."
"Autonomy for those regions should not go as far as observing their own rules that are diametrically opposed to national legislation and that suppress the population and women, in particular."
"To sentence a pregnant woman to capital punishment for having intercourse before marriage is barbaric."
"My question to the Commission is: What can the European Union do?"
"In any event, the dialogue with Nigeria will need to be intensified."
"However, Europe' s hands are tied if the president and the government themselves lack the courage to act and to do everything in their power to allow the Nigerians to live together in peace."
"Mr President, two years ago, following fair elections in the multi-cultural and multi-ethnic state of Nigeria, the military dictatorship was replaced by a parliamentary democracy."
"However, veteran President Olusugun Obasanjo is increasingly facing the difficult challenge of keeping riots under control between northern Muslims and Christian southerners, not infrequently culminating in gruesome blood baths."
"For example, we were recently alarmed once again by a dubious military reprisal in the federal state of Benue."
"I notice with some discomposure that the army seems to be taking the law into its own hands in various cases."
"It is understandable that the Tivs, associated with the South, are very suspicious of the fact that the army was siding with the northern-oriented Jukuns, the population group to which the current Defence Minister belongs."
"It is of the utmost importance for the military forces to act within the constitutional mandate and ensure the safety of all citizens."
"Increasing tension in the Middle Belt has at the same time illustrated my growing concern for the ever-widening chasm between religions that is fanning out towards the middle and south of the country."
"In a personal meeting with his American opposite number, President Bush less than two weeks ago, President Obasanja reassured President Bush once again of his support for the International Coalition against terrorism. On that same fateful Friday, 2 November, however, as the representative of the thirteenth federal state incorporating Islamic penal law, he was also faced with implementing the decree in Kaduna to introduce Islamic penal law, the shari'ah."
"This will do nothing to promote the peaceful coexistence of Muslims and the large Christian minority in that state."
"Finally, I should like to express my emphatic support for the attempts by the Nigerian President and parliament to look into, and tackle, the causes of the continuing ethnic and religious conflicts, to which, inter alia, Paragraph 4 of the resolution refers."
"I would ask the Council and Commission to contribute according to their means."
"Mr President, those of us who were in Abuja and Kano last year for the ACP meeting welcomed President Obasanjo's move from military dictatorship to democracy."
"We were also aware of the simmering tension in the country, particularly in the north, with outbreaks of violence."
"Sharia law has been a potent symbol of the cause of that tension, demanded by some Muslims, feared by most Christians and other faiths; partly the result of northern Nigeria not benefiting from independence and oil as the south has done, and a resentment of corruption that they see as chronic in the country."
"Thousands have died as a result of violence, especially in Kaduna and many Christian homes, churches and businesses have been destroyed."
"The Zanfara state government has given local vigilante groups the power to implement Sharia law."
"In reply seventeen southern states have demanded the right to set up their own police forces."
"Northerners are leaving Lagos after riots that have led to deaths."
"In the north, journalists in Kano are threatened with Sharia law if they represent it in a negative way."
"Now we see in Benue and Taraba in east and central Nigeria tribal, not religious, wars."
"The Jukun and Tiv disputes are about land and ancient rivalries, not about religion."
"Nineteen soldiers who were trying to keep the peace were abducted and murdered."
"Then we saw the awful reprisals in which Zakibian, a town of 20 000 people, was destroyed and over 200 people killed."
"Of course we welcome President Obasanjo's announcement of an inquiry."
"Ethnic and religious violence must be stopped in Nigeria."
"There must be equality before the law and not fear and violence."
"Corruption from whatever source must be rooted out."
"The European Union must support this."
"It must also provide humanitarian support for Nigeria, where over 200 people have died of cholera in the last few weeks, and help the people who have been displaced as a result of this violence."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the events in and around Afghanistan have obscured our view of trouble spots in other parts of the world, for example in Nigeria."
"The European Union should not, however, be indifferent to what is happening in this the most populous country in Africa."
"At the beginning of this year, the President of Nigeria, President Obasanjo, declared that 2001 would be the year in which the Nigerian people would reap the rewards of the transition to democracy."
"We supported this statement when we met at that time in Abuja in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"The trust has, however, suddenly turned to deep concern."
"A split in the ruling party in Nigeria, the absence of economic improvements and the persistence of poor living conditions have made people increasingly willing to resort to violence, thus creating a breeding ground for political extremists."
"To keep them in check, President Obasanjo felt it necessary to deploy soldiers in seven Nigerian states."
"Since then more than 3 000 people are said to have been killed and there is renewed fear that the military might return to power."
"The introduction and application of Sharia law in an increasing number of states has heightened religious and ethnic tensions."
"Violent criminals often go unpunished."
"The President and all of the forces of democracy in Nigeria are called upon to take determined action against violent criminals using the legal means at their disposal, to secure respect for universal human rights and to hurry through economic reforms which will benefit all parts of the country, if there is to be an end to this misery."
"We expect the Commission to monitor this process actively and to do everything within its power to ensure that this trouble spot in Africa once again becomes a place of democracy."
"Mr President, I am sure that, like me, when you call for a debate on the Democratic Republic of Nigeria, you know we are actually talking about a corrupt military oligarchy in an African country to which we give our support."
"Nigeria is proof, Mr President, that the wealth and value of a nation are often measured according to the priority that it gives to human rights, and especially to women, children and workers."
"Nigeria is the most densely populated country in Africa, which means that it has vast human resources."
"It also has mineral resources and a high oil production that should protect its population from poverty."
"Furthermore, its huge diversity could provide real dynamism."
"And yet, for decades, a climate of violence towards democrats has been allowed to flourish there and Nigeria' s rulers have never truly sought to punish the extra-judicial murders and violence."
"By not taking any preventive action, the military powers have allowed a climate of latent ethnic conflict to evolve and one of these conflicts, in the East of the country, pitting the Tivs and the Jukuns against one another, has just led to the deaths of 200 civilians, who were massacred by soldiers."
"The most shocking aspect, Mr President, Commissioner, is that the State authorities are trying to play down this event by explaining that the soldiers involved in the massacre were reacting to the murder of some of their fellow militiamen."
"In my view, we must, as we confirmed at the ACP summit on 1 November, force countries that legitimately claim to be our partners in dialogue, that we choose as partners and that request financial support from us, to comply with commonly accepted rules and with international conventions."
"With regard to Nigeria, this would involve fighting the implementation of the Islamic sharia - a woman was allowed to be stoned in front of television cameras a few weeks ago and not a single country reacted."
"At the same time, a climate of Islamophobia is developing, with mosques being burned down, and this too is met with widespread indifference."
"Lastly, an independent inquiry must now be opened into the murders that took place in November 1999 and in October 2001."
"We should be aware that our colleagues in the Nigerian parliament have called these massacres examples of 'ethnic cleansing' ."
"I wish to end by saying that I have often called in this House for the debts of third world countries to be cancelled, but this debt cancellation must be conditional, Mr President, on these countries truly respecting human rights, workers' rights and the rights of children and women."
"We must no longer accept these countries calling themselves democratic and signing conventions, which they then fail to observe."
"Mr President, between 22 and 24 October last, Nigerian soldiers raged among the people of Benue state."
"Over 200 civilians were killed in this massacre and houses and market stalls were burned down."
"There must be a swift, impartial, effective inquiry into these massacres."
"The Nigerian Federal government must guarantee full respect for the Constitution and the rule of law without delay."
"It is not doing so, despite the hopes placed in it."
"The Nigerian army is incapable of restoring law and order; moreover, this is not its role."
"Only a police force which respects human rights would be able to rebuild trust between the different communities."
"It is the duty of the European Parliament to condemn these massacres, which come on top of religious intolerance and miscarriages of justice."
"The way the sharia is currently being wrongly applied in Nigeria is a violation of fundamental human rights, especially the rights of women."
"Neither European Union nor United Nations resolutions have acknowledged the escalation of the ethnic conflicts in Nigeria."
"There is an urgent need for a humanitarian aid system to be established for displaced persons and refugees."
"Lastly, the European Union should implement the procedure laid down by Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"Mr President, the murder of hundreds of members of the Benue community and the stoning of the pregnant woman in northern Nigeria highlight the desperate situation this country is in."
"The European Commission is monitoring the situation within the framework of its powers and capabilities."
"In May 2001, the Commission issued a common position making provision for political dialogue with Nigeria to be strengthened."
"This common position is based on human rights and missions headed by European Union diplomats have been in contact with the Nigerian government."
"One mission was concerned with the economic situation and the other with human rights and the problem of human rights and the need for the government to intervene and take action have been highlighted."
"The government has acknowledged the problems and stressed that it intends to continue its efforts along these lines but I believe that parliament has also set limits on the potential for this particular government to intervene."
"There are two points in the motions on which I should like to comment briefly."
"The first is the education of the security forces in the human rights sector."
"This is a new sector for the Community, which has come under military cooperation in the past."
"However, the Community is currently supporting this sort of programme in Algeria, Guatemala, the Ukraine and the Palestinian territories."
"The Commission is re-examining the potential for intervention in West Africa, Liberia and the Ivory Coast and, as far as Nigeria is concerned, the United Kingdom, France and the United States are involved in similar activities."
"The Commission is monitoring the problems within the specific framework of human rights, but it cannot intervene in the education of security forces for human rights unless the Nigerian government asks it to do so."
"As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, the European Commission is intervening wherever the national or local authorities are unable to deal with natural or man-made disasters, but only in countries which have asked for help from abroad."
"So far, Nigeria has not asked for any help."
"The local authorities are more or less coping with the problems arising mainly as the result of movements of the population within the country, but I must stress, as has already been said, that Nigeria's problems are of a seriously structural nature."
"Short-term development aid is not enough to cope with them."
"However, the Commission thinks it is important to monitor recent developments directly on the ground, which is why it is planning to despatch ECHO delegates to Nigeria to record the dangers already referred to."
"Thank you very much Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Íatural disasters"
"Mr President, before beginning my two minutes of speaking time, and as a point of order, I would like to point out to the Presidency that there is an error in the transcribed text."
"In paragraph four of the Resolution there is a phrase missing, literally 'which should be compatible with European Union doctrine on cooperation, respect for human rights and democracy' ."
"This was the text agreed by all of the groups according to a document given to the Presidency by the spokesperson for international relations from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"And now, Mr President, I would like to begin my allotted intervention by pointing out that this resolution aims to tackle the problem of the devastation caused by hurricane Michelle, which has particularly affected three countries: Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba."
"The effects of this disaster are exacerbated by the fact that the three countries in question have levels of poverty that I personally would call extreme."
"Given that a simple reference was made in the resolution to our recent visit to Nicaragua, in order to provide illustrative evidence of the situation in this country, I would like to point out that Nicaragua is currently the poorest country in Continental America."
"Fifty per cent of Nicaraguans live in conditions of poverty and 17% in conditions of extreme poverty - to be poor in Nicaragua means living on USD 1 per month."
"In macroeconomic terms, Nicaragua has foreign debt of USD 6 500 million, exports less than a third of what it imports and the country balances its payments and survives, ultimately, thanks to international aid and emigrants' remittances, particularly from the United States and Costa Rica."
"With regard to the situation in Cuba, on another delegation visit, I think we all will agree that the situation of that country is extremely gloomy."
"Cuba is currently surviving mostly thanks to emigrants' remittances and, secondly, tourism, which represent more than all other Cuban exports put together."
"This being the case, what the resolution is aiming to achieve is, first and foremost, to show solidarity with the communities affected and with the human victims of the consequences of this hurricane."
"Secondly, and I would like the Commissioner to take special note of this, I would like to express Parliament' s satisfaction with the actions of the Humanitarian Aid Office."
"Thirdly, I would ask that, in the case of Honduras and Nicaragua, estimated damages be considered within the framework of the Regional Programme for the Reconstruction of Central America."
"Given that we are talking about Nicaragua, there is an amendment tabled by the Socialist Group, and I would like to address the rapporteur here, which says that, as there have been misappropriations of funds - and we are referring to European funds here - certain action has to be taken."
"I personally took the trouble to call the Commission delegation in Nicaragua."
"I have a fax here in which they tell me that in no case has there been any proof, nor has there been any investigation into these funds, therefore it cannot be confirmed that there have been misappropriations."
"During the recent visit we discovered that these accusations had occurred at the same time as an election campaign, but there was no judicial decision in this respect."
"For this reason, it seems extremely reckless to me to make statements on this subject."
"Mr President, with regard to Cuba, the phrase we have added can be interpreted by the various political parties as they see fit."
"But when we say that we want a cooperation agreement to be reached in line with European doctrine, we mean to agree with what was stated in the Newens report and in the common position; that we will only reach a cooperation agreement when the Cuban regime makes significant progress in the improvement of respect for human rights and progresses towards a pluralist democracy."
"This is the doctrine of the European Union, which is implicitly expressed in this resolution."
"Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, we did not take into account the time taken up by your introduction so you have indeed spoken for three and a half minutes."
"However, what you were saying was interesting. There is no need to worry at all."
"I would just like to say that, three years after hurricane Mitch, Central America is once again being struck by the fresh tragedy of hurricane Michelle."
"We must not forget that, since then, it has suffered an earthquake, drought and famine."
"However, despite these disasters, democracy is slowly being established in these countries once again, and the European delegation, of which I am a member, which has just been to Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, is unanimously agreed on this point."
"The proper running of the elections which have just taken place in Nicaragua is also evidence of this."
"Therefore, I feel that we can be proud of the decisive role played by the European Union action in the development of democracy in these countries."
"That is why I call for two measures: firstly, to increase the funds appropriated to the Programme for the Reconstruction of Central America, which currently amounts to EUR 250 million for the 1999-2002 period, since the latest disasters were not taken into consideration; and secondly, to review the European Union' s outdated position on Cuba."
"Also totally devastated by the latest hurricane, the worst it has suffered for 50 years, Cuba is currently the only country in Central America which has not signed a cooperation agreement with the European Union, and its only hope in these times of trouble is humanitarian, emergency aid."
"I could smile and tell you, with regard to Cuba, not to be more Catholic than the Pope, in the knowledge that he had no difficulty in identifying the right choice, but the appalling situation of this countries prevents me from smiling."
"Rather, I will warn you not to focus on the wrong enemy."
"The enemy is no longer communism: it is terrorism and terrorism thrives on destitution; democracy cannot be built on famine."
"Cuba is an important, or rather essential part of the process of bringing integration and peace to Central America which is currently in progress."
"Therefore, I urge the Council to instruct the Commission to reopen democratic cooperation negotiations with Cuba, insisting on total respect for European democratic values, which will not accept two different sets of values."
"Mr President, it is quite sad that when we have these afternoons debating topical and urgent subjects of major importance, we almost always have to ask again for aid for catastrophes affecting the world' s poorest countries."
"Both the delegation which, as Mr García Margallo said, visited Cuba and El Salvador, and the previous delegation that went to Honduras and Nicaragua, were able to see first hand the situation in which these countries find themselves, which, it must be said, is gloomy."
"Nobody would say, however, that the situation in Cuba is gloomy; of course there are many problems that Cuba has to resolve, but these are nothing to be gloomy about, as anyone who has travelled to Cuba will tell you."
"In any case, Mr President, I think we have to congratulate the European Commission for their speedy reaction to this catastrophe."
"We also have to acknowledge the fact that in Cuba there have not been so many victims thanks to the very quick reaction and very good organisation of the public authorities serving both the general public and tourists."
"Several Spanish tourists said on TV that they had been looked after very well during this situation of emergency."
"I was very happy that the last phrase from paragraph 4 had been removed, which is a last minute amendment."
"For the fact that there should be a common position that prevents there being a normal relationship with Cuba, as there is with other countries, is regretted by non-governmental organisations, the church, representatives of the European Union, and even dissidents."
"It is quite a sad matter for the European Union that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which there is no cooperation agreement."
"We are aware that when a resolution such as this one is approved in this House, it has to be done by a majority."
"If it is true that there was agreement on that phrase being included, then it should be; but, naturally, it is regrettable that there is no cooperation agreement with Cuba, because what is required from this country should be the same as for all the others."
"Yesterday we debated this issue and we saw that neither Turkey nor Morocco nor a large number of countries in Latin America have been asked to implement measures before an agreement can be reached."
"We have only asked this of Cuba."
"This is the difference, and it was made clear in this House, Mr President."
"For this reason, if the phrase has to be included, then include it, but it is regrettable that it is only Cuba which is required to fulfil these conditions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I too would like to express our solidarity with the people of Honduras, Nicaragua and Cuba, whose countries have been tragically devastated by the effects of hurricane Michelle."
"Along with Iris, on 8 October, and Mitch, which we have not forgotten, this hurricane is one of a long list of natural disasters which regularly affect areas which are already suffering, adding tragedy to poverty."
"These disasters, termed natural disasters, are a further reminder that climate change and non-sustainable development exacerbate the already substantial devastation and will continue to do so in the future."
"Although the European Union is to be congratulated on the aid it is sending to Honduras and Nicaragua, it must be noted that Cuba is totally excluded from this demonstration of solidarity."
"Cuba, which has suffered its worst disaster in 50 years, is unable to receive our help, for it is the only country in Latin and Central America which does not have a cooperation agreement with the European Union."
"This situation is no longer appropriate: it is our duty to restate the need for a cooperation agreement focusing on environmentally sustainable development to be signed with Cuba without delay, and to review the European Union' s position."
"We advocate equal treatment for all countries, and Cuba is certainly not benefiting from the same treatment as other countries."
"Moreover, the American embargo on relations with the island is preventing it from buying the food and medical supplies so desperately needed by the people of Cuba."
"The pharmacies are empty and there is a shortage of everything in the hospitals."
"We cannot tolerate a situation which deprives an entire people of the aid received by neighbouring countries which have suffered the same disasters."
"In order to change this, we must also support the call for the embargo against Cuba to be lifted."
"Mr President, our initial reaction is to express our sincere condolences to the families of the victims and their countrymen, but we must also immediately re-state our commitment to show solidarity with the affected countries, taking care that this solidarity is shown through immediate, generous and effective action."
"The principal role was initially taken by our own European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and it appears that the Commission acted with the necessary speed by means of this office."
"But the action of the European Union should not stop at this point and we should make a significant contribution to the reconstruction of everything which has been destroyed or damaged by Hurricane Michelle."
"A large proportion of our efforts will be included within the Reconstruction Plan for Central America and within the framework of the Union' s agreements with Honduras and with Nicaragua."
"This is where we fall down, due to the pitiful lack of a similar agreement with the Republic of Cuba."
"This is something that we are continually denouncing here in this House."
"It makes no sense that Cuba, for whom, amongst other things, the Member States of the European Union include their main economic, commercial and tourism partners, should be the only country in Latin America with which the European Union has not signed a cooperation agreement. For this reason, at the present time, the European Union is restricted to acting almost exclusively within the field of humanitarian and emergency aid."
"We in this House would ask the Commission to show a high degree of flexibility when considering the suitability of projects which, in addition to this type of aid, also contribute to surmounting the damage and helping with the reconstruction of those sectors that have been most affected on the island by the effects of the hurricane."
"It is vital that we revise the European Union' s common position on Cuba, which today is obsolete and even counterproductive, with a view to achieving the objectives that should have been pursued in 1996 when it was established, that is to say, the progress and prosperity of the Cuban people."
"I would also have preferred that the paragraph added by the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats had requested the same from Cuba as is requested from other countries with which the European Union cooperates."
"In any case, I do not think that the situation in Cuba is as gloomy as those who are determined to criticise that country would have us believe."
"Mr President, we hope that the dialogue, without preconditions and without the exclusion of any particular subject from the agenda, that appears to have been re-initiated with the meeting this Monday in New York between the President of the Council and the Cuban Chancellor, will soon bear fruit and led to the signing of a cooperation treaty that will benefit Cuba and that will allow the European Union to act under normal conditions, with a greater degree of efficiency and with more influence in their relations with this country."
"Floods in Algeria"
"Mr President, Algeria has been a troubled country for many years."
"Its reputation and image abroad has been damaged by the violence, massacres and abuses of human rights there, but that is nothing compared with the pain and suffering of its people at home."
"One million people died in the fight for independence and another 100 000 have died in the current power struggles between Islamic militants and the military and among the minority Berber community seeking political and cultural recognition."
"Now in this country, four fifths of which - ironically - is Saharan desert, we have the catastrophe of flooding in Algiers with the death toll in flash floods rising towards 1 000 as the grim task of sifting through the mud and the rubble goes on."
"It is not the first such calamity."
"In 1994, 30 000 people were made homeless in the Tindouf area, but the difference is that on that occasion seven lives were lost, while this time 693 people have already died and over 300 people are missing, with some 20 000 people thought to be homeless."
"The urgency now is for the European Union to play its part in providing humanitarian aid."
"There is a clear need for shelter, for food, for medical supplies and I certainly welcome the EUR 750 000 which has been given for this purpose under the ECHO fund, and indeed the promised EUR 225 million from the European Investment Bank for drinking water supply lines."
"There is also a need for adequate heavy equipment to deal with situations like this and even picks and shovels seem to be in short supply."
"Certainly no sniffer dogs appear to be available."
"Given Algeria's position in an earthquake area it would certainly be prudent to have such things available for the future."
"I would like to hear from the Commission what proposals it has to deal with this."
"There is also the need to look at the policy of sealing the floodwater drains against terrorist activities, which in this case has clearly exacerbated the situation."
"Mr President, we are aghast at the large numbers who have fallen victim to these disastrous floods and I believe that it is the duty of the European Union, of the individual Member States and of the Commission to do all that we can now to give assistance to those affected and help them through this difficult time."
"Even though Algeria is further south than our homelands, we know that it can be cold and very wet in winter."
"That is why aid is absolutely essential and everything that can be done to reduce the suffering must be done, and it must be done unconditionally."
"This does not mean that we will not hope that something good will nevertheless come out of this terrible catastrophe and out of our provision of aid, namely that Algeria will find a way to really step up the necessary dialogue with those who want peace and freedom in that country."
"The sacrifices which have been made in Algeria, not only during the war against their colonial masters but also in recent years and months, are horrendous."
"The acts are horrendous, and it is high time that the government and the president of this country found a way out of the crisis."
"Expectations were high when Bouteflika was elected President, but there have also been many disappointments in recent months: disappointment that more is said than done; disappointment that the people are addressed ex cathedra and not consulted."
"The tragic events in Kabylia - a commission in Algeria itself investigated them and uncovered their causes, amongst other things - should be reason enough to change the dynamics of communication and political relations in Algeria."
"In the case of the unrest in Kabylia - which, of course, then spread to the whole country or to wide areas of it - it was simply not true that it was started by a handful of anarchists and others who were following foreign orders: the Algerian commission itself established that it was above all the inappropriate behaviour of the security forces which was responsible."
"That is why the tragic events of the last few days should also be seen as an opportunity in Algeria to try to pursue a different policy, a policy which consists of offering the people more opportunities and more chances, including economic and social ones."
"Mr President, as Mr Swoboda stated, Algeria has already seen a great deal of suffering with the continual deaths in the country, more often than not of innocent people, and also with the poverty that is devastating part of the population."
"Therefore, this catastrophe has only made this situation worse, with more than 600 victims, as has been stated, and with more than 20 000 people who have lost any standard of living they may have had."
"Also, in this case, the resolution congratulates the European Commission on its speedy reaction, but special emergency aid will probably be necessary."
"It is true that the European Parliament colegislates the budget with the Council, and, therefore, the result is what we achieve together, I know, but I am filled with sorrow - especially on these afternoons when we have to talk about so many catastrophes - that there is no sufficient budget heading that can be used in such cases, because we always find ourselves having to beg for, or to transfer some money from elsewhere to deal with these tragedies."
"In the specific case of the resolution, the European Commission has also been asked if it could send experts and technicians to help evaluate the damage and find a way to rebuild what has been destroyed."
"I know that we ask a great deal of the European Commission, but it is also true to say that the European Parliament is very sensitive to the situation in countries in Central America - as stated previously - as it is with countries in the Mediterranean."
"We have to ask - and ask ourselves - as was stated the other day in the Committee on Development and Cooperation when talking about the reconstruction of Afghanistan (after having first destroyed it), that that reconstruction should not be the cause of a reduction in the funds available for Mediterranean countries, countries in Latin America and Africa, who also really have great need of them."
"Mr President, I would like to start by expressing my full solidarity and the solidarity of my group with the people of Algeria, which has once again been struck by a huge disaster."
"We who support the Algerian people, particularly in their fight for independence, are shocked by the tragic consequences of the floods in that country."
"Material and, above all, human loss are jeopardising the country' s development and preserving its excessive structural and political shortcomings."
"This disaster reveals once again the incompetence of the Algerian government: the way it builds houses and roads in flood plains and decides to block drains allegedly for safety reasons is proof of the utter irresponsibility of its leaders, and this is on top of the corruption and misuse of funds."
"The government has failed in its primary mission of serving the general interests of the people."
"It has done nothing to meet the needs of the people or ensure their safety."
"Therefore, we must call upon the Algerian authorities to make good their past mistakes."
"This situation must on no account be allowed to occur again either in Algeria or elsewhere."
"We must no longer allow citizens' lives to be endangered by irresponsible, self-interested or reprehensible behaviour."
"Mr President, some people may wonder why we are devoting time to discussing flooding - even flooding on this scale - in Algeria."
"In fact a debate is currently raging about this idea of concern."
"Recently, at a large meeting in Nuremberg, a leading German Orientalist complained that in parts of the Islamic world people were not concerned enough about the atrocious events in New York."
"At the time I replied that we too have shown very little concern about Chechnya, where over 100 000 people have been murdered, or Iraq, where over 100 000 people, mainly children, have starved to death."
"In fact there is a kind of partial culture of concern which is divided along cultural and geographical lines."
"That is why we need to ensure that we also have compassion for our Muslim and Arab partners when they are hit by catastrophes of this kind, so that terrorists cannot - and after all this was the aim of 11 September - play off one civilisation against another and actually orchestrate the 'clash of civilisations'."
"The dead in Algeria are also our dead."
"The homeless in Algeria are also our homeless."
"If we speak of a global village in economic terms then we must also speak of a global village of compassion and solidarity."
"That is why, where our partners in the Mediterranean, in the Arab world, are concerned, who are on our doorstep and with whom we need to work more closely than ever, it is the European Union's duty to provide substantial humanitarian aid, and also to ensure that Algeria is put in a position where it is more capable than it has been in the past of helping itself."
"Helping people to help themselves must be our overriding aim, but of course our aim now must also be to provide the victims of this disaster with direct practical help, not only by giving them money, not only by writing them a big cheque, but also by making it clear to them that what happens to them is something which we Europeans are deeply concerned about, something which matters to us as much as what happens to ourselves."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Members of Parliament for their kind remarks concerning ECHO and I shall convey these congratulations to Mr Nielson, the Commissioner responsible."
"Firstly, as far as Hurricane Michelle is concerned, the Commission has been closely monitoring its effects in Central America in the Caribbean area since the beginning of the crisis, in cooperation with our experts and partners in this field."
"Michelle started on 29 October as a tropical storm off the northern coast of Nicaragua and Honduras, where it caused severe floods."
"The communication systems proved their efficiency as they were the only working systems that allowed for a quick evaluation in areas of difficult access such as Moskita."
"On 1 November, ECHO started discussions with the NGOs present in the field to establish emergency systems, particularly in the Moskita region in Honduras and Nicaragua - the areas worst hit."
"On 4 November, Michelle became a hurricane that crossed Cuba and touched Jamaica."
"Fortunately, the local authorities had undertaken timely evacuation measures."
"ECHO services decided on funding once an initial evaluation of the hurricane damage had been carried out in Cuba."
"This decision to allocate EUR 1 050 000, should be approved by the end of this week and will cover the Moskita region in Honduras and Nicaragua, Cuba and Jamaica."
"The decision will mainly involve the evacuation of people in danger, food aid for Honduras, the provision of temporary shelter in Jamaica and the distribution of water, sanitation and health packages in all countries."
"Members of this House have raised two main issues."
"One concerns Nicaragua."
"I should like to assure you that all the distributed funds are regularly monitored and no irregularities have been detected so far."
"That was the assessment of the Parliament delegation that visited Nicaragua."
"The second comment concerned Cuba."
"Some people wanted a revision of the EU Common Position on Cuba, announced on 25 June 2001."
"But it kept being said Cuba had not been given any humanitarian aid until now."
"In fact Cuba has benefited from around EUR 125 million in aid since 1993, largely in the humanitarian field, as well as the food security programme and some budget line assistance."
"But for the time being, the line followed by the Commission is as proposed in the latest European Union Common Position which I have already referred to."
"As far as Algeria is concerned, the situation in the country is very complex."
"There are many different kinds of problems, but I will only refer to the problem of the flooding last weekend."
"The European Commission has followed the situation with great attention and concern."
"President Prodi sent a message to President Bouteflika to express the solidarity of the European Union with the Algerian flood victims."
"Therefore the Commission, through its humanitarian aid office, has moved quickly in response to the floods."
"A decision to allocate EUR 758 800 of humanitarian aid has been taken under the primary emergency procedure to help meet the urgent needs of the victims."
"The funds are already being used for a range of support measures including temporary shelter, beds, clothing and blankets, water, sanitation and medical assistance."
"Humanitarian operations funded under this decision will be implemented by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and by two NGOs - Médicins du Monde and Médicins sans Frontières."
"With those decisions on Hurricane Michelle and the Algerian floods, the Commission underlines its determination to address the needs of victims of humanitarian disasters whenever they occur."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"Trade in small arms"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0723/2001, tabled by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the PSE Group, on small arms;"
"B5-0729/2001, tabled by Mrs Morgantini and Mr Brie, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on controlling international arms transfers and arms brokering;"
"B5-0730/2001, tabled by Mrs Maes, Mrs McKenna and Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on controlling international arms transfers and arms brokering."
"Commissioner, Mr President, just as certain small-scale conflicts receive poor media coverage, so certain categories of what are known as light weapons could be said to receive poor legislative and financial coverage. I mean that the legislation regulating them is insufficient and that they are cheap to buy."
"Why are we surprised, then, when it is this type of arms which keep these forgotten conflicts alive?"
"Yet the number of victims alone should concern us, if it were not concealed by the effects of poverty."
"However, evidence that the world does have a conscience has emerged in the shape of the United Nations Programme of Action aimed at containing and controlling the transfers, or rather the trafficking of these light weapons which are responsible for extensive loss of human life."
"In the light of the current international situation, with the armed alliance in Afghanistan and the international fight against terrorism, there is even greater need for the Union to join and support this resolute, pioneering UN measure."
"The European Union' s military policy must be more than just defence measures controlled by senior military staff."
"It must, in essence, be based on the prevention and control of the arms trade by an arsenal of binding laws covering all areas of this industry."
"Our legislation must target arms brokering and export and detention licences, as well as extradition and police cooperation procedures, and national legislation governing these issues must be harmonised."
"Instead of attempting to intervene in blazing conflicts, would it not be better to defuse them before they ignite?"
"The Union' s legislative structure would allow us to do this at the stage when we are still preparing for military action."
"Europe must seize the opportunity afforded here."
"Mr President, we are quite properly concerned about the spread of small arms and light weapons, particularly the illegal traffick in, and uncontrolled circulation of, these weapons."
"I am not sure why Parliament has decided to bring forward an urgent resolution at this time, unless it wants to contribute something useful in the context of the current international crisis, the continuing threat posed by weapons held by terrorists or the consequences of the large accumulation of weapons in Taliban hands in Afghanistan."
"There is some passing reference to these matters in the motion for a resolution which contains many useful elements."
"For many years I have worked to overcome the problem of anti-personnel landmines but I have always sought to focus attention on the real culprits who use such weapons indiscriminately and irresponsibly."
"Usually these were armed rebel groups in developing countries with no concern for human life and they had been supplied by non-western countries."
"It is important, therefore, that when considering the matter of small arms we should take care not to become over-obsessed with our own authorities or industry: these are the easy targets."
"Instead, we should focus on terrorist groups and other criminal elements that are sitting on stockpiles of weapons or continuing to obtain them from various sources."
"It is scandalous, for example, that there has been toleration for so long of large stockpiles of weapons held by terrorist organisations such as the IRA in one EU Member State, in order that it may threaten or carry out attacks in another."
"In relation to Afghanistan it is to be hoped that a legitimate government with democratic aspirations will be established there very soon, anxious to engage positively in the real world and begin the development of a sustainable economy and a better life for all its people."
"There must also be efforts to remove weapons in Taliban hands and integrate ex-combatants back into some sort of mainstream society."
"I am not referring to terrorists there."
"Much has been achieved."
"Our focus for the future in relation to small arms should be on identifying and destroying stocks of weapons held by insurgents, terrorists and criminals and cutting off their sources of supply."
"This is the area on which we should be concentrating our efforts over the coming months and years."
"Mr President, nearly ten years ago, in the early 1990s, I travelled through the Khyber Pass, a trip I can strongly recommend to all colleagues - though perhaps not at this moment."
"At the top there is a small village where you can buy food, water and ""souvenirs""."
"The ""souvenirs"" are drugs, home-made Kalashnikovs and home-made surface-to-air rocket launchers."
"With the money I had on me I calculated that I could buy ten Kalashnikovs or three rocket launchers."
"The only problem was how to get them home through customs, so I did not buy them!"
"Coming forward to 10 October this year, at the United Nations in New York there was a speech by the American Assistant Secretary for Arms Control."
"He used wonderful sounding sentences, such as ""we must redouble our non-proliferation and arms control efforts"", ""the entire globe faces a security challenge!"""
"But he had no proposals at all for controlling small arms."
"Why?"
"Because the extremely powerful and wealthy organisation called The National Rifle Association - the NRA - helped to elect the present administration, which will therefore not stand up to the Association."
"With the events of 11 September and the high murder rate inside the United States of America, I wonder just what it will take for America to cooperate with the rest of the world on this problem."
"My Group supports the motion because it is a small step in the right direction."
"- (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this problem - the trade and trafficking in small arms - is one of the most serious problems facing the world today."
"The first observation I wish to make is that this expression 'small arms' is misleading, because small arms include heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, grenade throwers and mortars of less than 100 millimetres."
"We are talking about devastating weaponry."
"To quote the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, speaking at the Conference held in July, we must be fully aware of the terrible effects of the current trade in these arms."
"It is estimated that there are some 500 million arms in circulation in the world today and that, every day, these arms kill on average more than one thousand people."
"This is, therefore, an issue to which States must pay serious attention."
"It is an area in which the fine line between seriousness and hypocrisy can be most clearly traced."
"For many years I have called for the issues of the arms industry and trade to be the business of States alone."
"Applying the market economy to this area can only have disastrous consequences, and instead of complaining about the trafficking and dealing in arms, we should be adopting stricter measures on the state control of the production and trade in these arms."
"Unfortunately, however, governments themselves are not always entirely blameless."
"Currently, in Portugal, a campaign is running, launched by Catholic missionary organisations and supported by the Portuguese section of Amnesty International, to draw attention to this scourge."
"And why missionaries, you might ask?"
"Because missionaries are, particularly in Africa, those who have most frequent contact with the appalling consequences of this situation."
"Unfortunately, my country - it is not only France, the United Kingdom and other often-mentioned European Union countries - is not entirely free of blame in this matter."
"According to figures that have been released, in 1998, the year in which the European Union code of conduct was signed, Portugal sold around EUR 9 million' s worth of arms to countries that it should feel unable to do so, such as Angola, Algeria, Colombia, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Sri Lanka and Turkey."
"Portugal also sold around EUR 5 million' s worth of arms to a further eleven countries that should, at the very least, be under strict observation."
"We support the resolution that has been tabled."
"This is a matter on which some progress has been made, but more energetic steps must be taken."
"Above all, the European Union must set an example in this area."
"We cannot shed crocodile tears on Thursdays over conflicts that are continually supplied by the legal or illegal trade in these arms."
"Mr President, the accumulations of small arms dotted all over the planet are a cause of destabilisation and crisis and the European Union has promised to do what it can to combat this phenomenon."
"The European Union has proposed, as part of its joint action on small arms and light weapons, to introduce a series of confidence-building measures, including measures to improve transparency."
"The Union has promised funding and technical assistance to countries, international organisations and non-governmental organisations asking for support for this purpose."
"The European Union welcomes the results of the United Nations conference on the illegal trade in small arms although, as the members have said, it does of course recognise that the results might have been clearer and more concrete."
"However, we believe that the very fact that this first conference was held at all is an important step."
"We particularly welcome the decision to organise another conference before 2006 so that the progress made can be examined and evaluated by then."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 6.30 p.m."
"As indicated on the display board, the next item is Mrs Lynne' s report."
"The debate is scheduled for 5.30 p.m."
"I am therefore going to suspend the sitting for a short while."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Announcement by the President"
"I wish to speak about a very special matter: today, for the first time, If am not mistaken and if I am not misleading the House, we will have the opportunity to have twelve booths, because out of respect for this report and as a result of the rapporteur' s invitation, we will today have sign language interpretation to my right, as you can see, which is a tribute to the communication between this Parliament and all of Europe' s citizens, whoever they may be."
"2003, European Year of People with Disabilities"
"The next item is the report (A5-0377/2001) by Mrs Lynne, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the European Year of People with disabilities 2003 [COM(2001) 271 - C5-0306/2001 - 2001/0116(CNS)]."
"Mr President, I welcome the sign language interpreter."
"I only wish that we could have sign language interpretation for all our debates to make sure that all people could access all the reports."
"The timing of this debate is very sad, when so few Members are present in the Chamber and, even more importantly, to vote later."
"It is very important to demonstrate our commitment to disabled people."
"Putting the report right at the end of a Strasbourg agenda does not demonstrate any commitment."
"Having said that, I thank the Commission for their cooperation on my report and all the other Members of the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I have managed to incorporate a number of their amendments."
"I believe that is one of the main reasons why we do not have any new amendments today."
"The European Year of Disabled People, 2003 must not just pay lip service to the problems that disabled people face."
"We need to have concrete outcomes."
"For a start, we must truly move away from the medical model of disability to the social and rights-based model of disability."
"We must make sure that we mainstream disabled people; that all legislation takes account of the specific needs of disabled people, whether they are wheelchair users, someone with a visual impairment, someone with a hearing impairment, someone with a learning difficulty, or someone with a mental health problem."
"All EU citizens should have equal rights."
"I hope that in 2003 - if not before - we make sure that all of Parliament's buildings are accessible to disabled people - they are not at the moment - and that all EU Member States are aware of the problems that disabled people face."
"I shall tell you a story about what happened to Jenny, one of my constituents, the coordinator of Access Charter."
"I invited her over to the Article 13 Anti-Discrimination hearings."
"She uses a wheelchair."
"For a start, she could not get into the Parliament's buildings in Brussels without going through revolving doors because they refused to open the double doors."
"I remonstrated with them."
"They unlocked them, took off the rope that was binding them and then 20 minutes later they were locked and bound again."
"We booked her a hotel room with disabled people's access."
"Somebody had put a bed across the bathroom door and so she could not get in."
"She had to change hotels."
"She then went out to try to get something to eat at night, with her colleagues - remember she was using a wheelchair."
"No taxi in Brussels would stop for her. She managed to get to a restaurant."
"The manager then came out and said ""You can't come in here. Your appearance will put off other diners."""
"When she got to the airport she was subjected to a full body search."
"She remonstrated with the security people."
"One of them said: ""Have a nice trip."
"That demonstrates the problems that disabled people face and the real need for a disability directive."
"I hope we will hear the announcement of that in 2003."
"We have to have funding for major research into the status of disabled people."
"We have to have a study into the situation disabled people face in institutions in particular."
"It is essential that regional and local government are involved in this year but, more importantly, that organisations of disabled people and representing disabled people are involved in this year."
"I have called specifically for a funding increase from EUR 12 million to EUR 15 million over the two years."
"Particularly for sign language interpretation, for personal assistance, for accessible meeting rooms, for hotels etc., there are added costs; in addition, funding for impairment-specific NGOs is only for 2002, not for the year itself."
"Furthermore, in line with the Article 13 Action Programme on Anti-Discrimination, I have called for subsidies for the expenses for special events at European level to go up from ""not exceeding 80%"" to ""not exceeding 90%""."
"We must also have a proper evaluation of the year in clear and simple language, and in accessible formats."
"I made my report available in all accessible formats at my own expense."
"But I would like the Commission, in future, to make available on request any report at whatever stage in accessible format."
"Finally, the year must be the step in the right direction to combat discrimination."
"But more importantly, it has to be a celebration of disabled people's contribution to society."
"Mr President, I would just like to say that I am standing in for my colleague, Mr Andrews, and I am very honoured to do so because of the important issues in this excellent report by Mrs Lynne."
"The purpose of the year is to provide for a coordinated effort to change attitudes and to promote the removal of social and environmental barriers to equality and to assist in legal and policy developments."
"This means putting a value on diversity and celebrating diversity."
"It also includes making us aware of issues relating to multiple discrimination."
"I want to stress our full support for the designation of 2003 as European Year of People with Disabilities."
"I know that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs also supports the objectives of the year, as members unanimously backed my colleague's opinion."
"There are approximately 38 million people in the European Union who have a disability."
"They face a wide range of barriers, including different forms of discrimination."
"People with physical and sensory disabilities are just as much a part of our society as able-bodied people."
"Very often, however, they are hindered from taking part in our society."
"What makes it worse, as Mr Andrews states in his opinion, is that they are not hindered by their disabilities, but by their environment and the attitudes towards them."
"They suffer multi-discrimination."
"This must change."
"Some of the problems include public transport and access to buildings, stairways and doors which are not wide enough to allow wheelchair access."
"Surveys show that the intellectual capacity of people with physical disabilities is very often under-estimated."
"They can be discriminated against when applying for jobs."
"The exclusion of people with disabilities from society not only denies their fundamental rights, but also deprives society of diversity and inclusivity."
"People with disabilities can make a positive contribution to society."
"Their experiences can encourage more tolerance, understanding and awareness of the needs of others besides their own capacities and abilities."
"Our own goal must be to end discrimination and safeguard their rights."
"It is important that discrimination against people with disabilities is tackled as a mainstream issue."
"The four amendments presented by my colleague, Mr Andrews, were fully supported by the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, and endorsed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"They are now Amendments Nos 20, 45, 47 and 48."
"I have nothing else to add, only to congratulate Mrs Lynne on her excellent report and on the very touching speech she gave to us in the presentation of the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, sign language interpreter, I would like to express a few thoughts on the World Year of People with Disabilities. I am also speaking on behalf of Mr Mantovani, who is particularly interested in this subject and cannot be here with us today."
"This a truly vast subject, as can be seen from the statistics: today there are approximately 30 million people suffering from disabilities in the European Union."
"This means that one European in ten encounters barriers not just in the field of work but also in access to public transport, buildings, private services, education and training - in other words, in all areas of daily life."
"However, there are other barriers as well, maybe less obvious but just as insurmountable, which restrict the freedom of European citizens with disabilities, such as the barriers to movement within the Union and to going to live in another Member State."
"All these barriers too often prevent people with disabilities from playing the active role they would like in society, work, school and daily activities."
"We need a multifaceted strategy to ensure that these people are guaranteed equal opportunities in full respect for the European citizens' Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"However, there is one right which stands out above the others: the right to full citizenship."
"That is why our group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will vote with conviction for the proposal for a Council decision on the Year of People with Disabilities - or, as we used to say in Italy in the olden days - people with different abilities - 2003."
"I therefore thank the rapporteur, Mrs Lynne, for her good work and for accepting the 17 amendments tabled in committee."
"Three of those were tabled by us, and we feel they are particularly important because they uphold three concepts: firstly, recognition of the importance of the role played by the family at all stages in the lives of people with disabilities; secondly, promotion of a culture of solidarity within society, meaning an understanding that a person' s value is not expressed solely in terms of what he does or is able to do, but primarily in what he represents, namely a human being in all respects; thirdly and lastly, reflection on the concept of the quality of life of a person with disabilities, understood not just to be access to employment or training but also all the other aspects of daily life, in the family and in and as part of society, a quality of life which is genuinely high and equal for people with disabilities too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Lynne, ladies and gentlemen, it is a happy coincidence that this week, just a few metres away from the Chamber, we can see an exhibition organised by Bernd Posselt entitled, 'chain of understanding'."
"It shows hands, helping hands, joining hands, hands expending energy, and this exhibition is devoted to disabled people and includes work done by disabled people."
"At this point I should therefore like to thank all of those who give time, patience, energy and love and make sacrifices for those who need their help."
"This includes the families of disabled people, but many more besides."
"We should not leave them out in the Year of Disabled People."
"My second point is that I am glad that 2003 is to be the Year of Disabled People, particularly now, because for me it also shows that the Stability and Growth Pact and an aggressive disability policy are not only not contradictory, but also not mutually exclusive, if we are serious about the European social model, defending the dignity of all human beings and ensuring respect for human rights, which are principles to which we feel committed."
"We still have much to do, however."
"We need more equality in everyday life."
"This involves firstly actually implementing all of the constitutional provisions."
"We need to move from principle to practice."
"Secondly, we need more comprehensive integration."
"Integration must not end at the school gates, but must also encompass working life and social life."
"Thirdly, we need disabled people to have the right to receive support to live the life of their own choosing."
"Disabled people must be able to decide for themselves how they wish to live their lives."
"Fourthly, we have to change the images we have, such as the image of a disabled person doing handicrafts."
"Here, PCs, the Internet and integration using the new media could be very helpful."
"With this in mind, we are looking forward to the Year of Disabled People, because we hope that it will sharpen the focus of our work and that we will be able to take further initiatives to eliminate the injustices and barriers which exist in our society."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Lynne not just on this particular report, but for her constant faith in and fight for policies for the disabled."
"I should also like to make a point of thanking Parliament for the support and enthusiasm with which it accepted the proposal for 2003."
"We need to make 2003 the year in which we send out a clear message that policies for the disabled are not just solidarity policies."
"They are not just humane or charitable policies."
"They are policies based on fundamental human and civil rights."
"The second important point is that 2003 should not just galvanise governments into action."
"It should also galvanise social and business circles and the scientific community into action."
"Governments themselves should start up action plans for a package of policies."
"Transport, urban planning, special policies for the job market, education."
"Society should do everything it can, especially through the civil society and non-governmental organisations, to foster collaboration and take innovative initiatives which can be used as a basis for new proposals for the European Union."
"Business circles can also play an important part."
"Support for research and new product technology can bring about exceptional new products for people with disabilities and new technological products can be adapted to the specific requirements of different types of disability."
"As Mrs Lynne referred to the Commission reports, may I inform you that only yesterday I started up my new web page, which can be read by Braille."
"2003 should be seen as a year in which we push ahead with European priorities, such as those set out in the Commission communication on a ""Europe without frontiers"", while the individual Member States promote their national objectives, which differ from one country to another, given that policies for people with disabilities are at various stages of development."
"I must say that I accept most of your amendments, in both spirit and letter."
"I should like to highlight the following points: first, I totally agree that we need to concentrate more on awareness-raising about various types of disabilities and the fact that some people with very serious disabilities are victims of multiple discrimination and, of course, the plight of those kept in institutions."
"The second important factor are the special policies on education and employment."
"Access to the job market depends on education and we need to focus on this."
"The third important point is the need for all the agencies involved to work together."
"We cannot propose and implement policies for the disabled."
"We need to work with their organisations so that we can present policies in which they themselves are involved."
"We believe that 2003 will be the start of a new form of collaboration, a new type of innovative policy at European level for people with disabilities."
"The budget, which is EUR 12 million, is small but we should point out that it is not for implementing policies but to back specific events of local or national importance, the main function of which will be to kick start societies and organisations."
"I should also say that we believe that it makes sense to leave the funding ratio at 50% of activities at national level because this will allow for more events while, at the same time, allowing governments to take additional action in a range of policies."
"May I again congratulate Mrs Lynne on her personal stand. I should also like to inform you that the Council will take its final decision on 3 December 2001, the same date as the European Day of Disabled People."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.55 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I have just one question: on Tuesday morning we approved requests for urgent procedure for the items on financial aid for a series of Balkan countries, and I regret that these are obviously not going to be taken until the mini-session, because we would have had sufficient time to deal with this issue in this afternoon's sitting, which has been suspended twice."
"In the past, of course, anything which we added to the agenda on Tuesday morning was always taken on the Friday."
"I hope that it will soon be possible to revert to this practice when Friday sittings are reinstated, but I wanted to take this opportunity to ask when these items will be taken in the Brussels sitting because you did not announce this just now."
"Mr Posselt, according to my information, these will be adopted on Thursday 28; in other words, they will appear on the agenda for Thursday 28."
"As for the rest of your comments, Mr Posselt, you are entirely within your rights to make them, but I hope that the Conference of Presidents considers the basis of your comments, for which there is some justification, I must admit."
"Vote"
"Mr President, I voted for the report on the European Year of People with Disabilities, but Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are also some States whose laws include rules which discriminate against people with disabilities."
"I am sad to say that there is even an Italian law which discriminates against them on age grounds, thus violating Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Indeed, it stipulates that people with disabilities who are over 65 years old are not entitled to the EUR 350 allowance granted to people with disabilities who fall ill before they reach the age of 65."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to present a proposal implementing Article 13 outside the workplace as well, and, at last, to force the States which are not yet applying it to do so."
"I refer, in particular, to Italy, and I hope that the Berlusconi government will listen to what I am saying and abolish the laws currently in place in Italy - as in other parts of Europe - which discriminate against people with disabilities."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity of an explanation of vote to thank Mrs Lynne for her outstanding report, but also to thank Mr Karas for mentioning my exhibition and Mrs Petter who was responsible for putting it together."
"This is a splendid initiative for disabled and traumatised children who are cared for by a children's centre in Munich."
"This initiative will now be continued in Italy and France by a series of colleagues."
"Mrs Lynne has spontaneously offered to take it to England too."
"I am very grateful."
"This is a good start to our preparatory work for the Year of Disabled People."
"That is why I should like to thank all of those colleagues who are supporting this magnificent initiative from Bavaria."
"The good intentions of our rapporteur notwithstanding, we are worried that the European Year of People with Disabilities (2003) will be a year in which a great deal of money is spent and numerous events are staged, but which does nothing to change the situation of disabled people, especially those from the poor sections of society."
"We are worried by the hypocrisy of all this interest being expressed in people with disabilities by the various institutions of the European Union because it is the very policy of the European Union, with its capitalist restructuring, privatisation of health, welfare and education and undermining of workers' rights and social insurance, which is to blame."
"The first dramatic victims of this policy are the handicapped and people with disabilities."
"They hypocritically maintain that their aim is to ""promote equal opportunities"" and ""combat discrimination""."
"But does a young person or a child from a poor, working class family living at risk of disease and accident have the same opportunities, first and foremost in preventing disability, as a young person or child of the bourgeoisie?"
"Does a child whose father is an executive of a multinational company have the same opportunities in finding work as a child whose father is unemployed?"
"It is impossible to combat the various types of discrimination which arise in a capitalist society as long as the main type of discrimination between the exploiters and the exploited continues to reign supreme."
"What sort of a fight against discrimination is their policy, which spreads poverty, unemployment and illiteracy?"
"Of the 38 million disabled in the ÅU, 7.5 million are of school age."
"How many of these children have special schools or special classes and the special equipment needed for them to acquire an education?"
"In Greece, only 7% of disabled children attend special schools, while 185 000 disabled children are not even in the education system."
"And yet not one ÅU text, including the one under debate, so much as mentions free national health, welfare and special education, even for these people."
"Nowhere does it suggest that the technical assistance needed for education, vocational rehabilitation or daily life should be provided free of charge."
"This situation will change when the people, the workers and the disabled fight to obstruct the policy of ""free competition and market laws"" until it has been overturned."
"This fight has the vote of the Communist Party of Greece."
"Although, as we know, the main purpose of this kind of venture, modelled on International Women' s Day or World Aids Day, is to assuage the consciences of the most sincere of those who support the initiative and to conceal the desire not to do anything of the more cynical among them, we voted for the report on the proposal for a Council Decision on the European Year of People with Disabilities, for that was what the organisations of people with disabilities wanted us to do. They hope that the action taken as part of this initiative will help them to attract public attention and, at the same time, to make their just demands known."
"That said, we condemn the hypocrisy of decision-makers within the European Parliament, other European Union institutions and national bodies who broadcast their concern for human rights, non-discrimination and equality loud and clear, but who ultimately refuse to take action or adopt binding measures forcing companies to employ people with disabilities, for example, or to adapt modes of transport for access by people with disabilities simply because they see profit-making as more important than meeting basic human needs, even though society does have the necessary resources to address these needs."
"That is the end of voting time."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The session was adjourned at 6.50 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 15 November 2001."
"Announcement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Spain has once again been cruelly struck by terrorism."
"On 23 November, Ana Isabel Arostegui and Javier Mijangos, both officers of the Ertzaintza, the Basque regional police, were killed in a cowardly attack whilst carrying out their duties in Beasaín, in the Basque region of Spain."
"Two days prior to that incident, terrorists set off a bomb in Bilbao, injuring two other officers of the same police force."
"On my own behalf and on behalf of the European Parliament as a whole, I immediately sent a message expressing my most sincere condolences to the families of the victims of these despicable attacks, as well as our wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured."
"Once again, terrorist groups in Spain have acted with fatal disregard, showing that they deny the right to life and totally reject the concept of democracy."
"Having made an assault on justice, by killing Judge José María Lidon Corbi, they have, this time, attacked the Basque regional police force."
"In doing so, they are showing their determination to attack the main pillars of democracy."
"With our heartfelt thoughts for the victims, their families and all those who fight for democracy, I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, since our last session, five journalists have unfortunately been killed in Afghanistan."
"Maria Grazia Cutulli, Julio Fuentes, Harry Burton and Azizullah Haidari were killed in an ambush between Jalalabad and Kabul."
"Ulf Stroemberg was found dead following a burglary in Taloqan."
"As you know, we are also extremely concerned about Ken Hechtman, who is missing."
"The eight journalists who have died in Afghanistan since the beginning of the conflict were carrying out their duties in a courageous, passionate and tenacious manner."
"They believed that it was their overriding duty to inform others."
"I would like to pay a warm and sincere tribute to them for the work they did, because they enabled us to keep constantly abreast of developments in Afghanistan."
"Freedom of information is one of the most fragile freedoms. The death of these journalists illustrates this."
"I admire the way in which they fulfilled their duties."
"At this time, our thoughts go out to their families and their colleagues, who are devastated by their loss."
"I would like to ask you to observe a minute' s silence in order to display our deepest sympathy."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"Order of business"
"With regard to the agenda, I have two changes to propose."
"First of all, the Committee on Budgets adopted Mr Ferber' s report on the supplementary estimates of revenue and expenditure of the European Parliament, and has asked for this report to be put on Thursday' s agenda, pursuant to Rule 114 of the Rules of Procedure."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"The second proposal is from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, regarding the vote on Mr Bouwman' s report on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer, requesting that the vote be brought forward to tomorrow' s voting time."
"This is because the Council intends to take its decision on this on 3 December."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"The order of business is thus established."
"Speeches on points of order"
"Madam President, I would just like to draw the attention of the House to what happened yesterday in Rome."
"A disaster occurred in which many firemen died and others were wounded; some of them are in an extremely serious condition."
"They rushed to save human lives with the same courage displayed by the firemen in New York."
"I feel that it is right for us, as European citizens and the European Parliament, to pay tribute to these brave men who have laid down their lives in an attempt to save the lives of others."
"A block of flats collapsed, and if these men had not sacrificed themselves, others might have died."
"I feel that Parliament should also pay tribute to these brave, remarkable firemen."
"Mr Tajani, I have already sent a message of condolences to the Italian government."
"Madam President, I, too, would like to express my grief at the deaths which occurred in the incident in Rome yesterday, and to express my heartfelt thanks and full support for the work of the police force and the municipal police, in particular, who are always ready and willing to act in the front line, not just to combat crime but also to come to the aid of European citizens at difficult times such as these, and who are always prepared to lose their lives doing deeds of great bravery, as, sadly, happened in Rome as well as New York."
"Madam President, in this week dedicated to employment, I wish to draw your attention to the several thousand Portuguese workers who live in the worrying situation of great instability, with companies going bankrupt with impunity and no one being held responsible, even when it is known that they were viable and had healthy order books, which is what has happened at Molin, Confelis and Norporte."
"Despite Portuguese workers having the lowest wages in the European Union, there have recently been countless cases of companies not paying salaries on time, already involving more than PTE 20 billion and many thousands of workers."
"I would, in particular, highlight the situation at the Mandata e Mortensen glassworks in Marinha Grande, at the Sotima timber plant in Proença-a-Nova, at Cuftexteis, in Ansião, and the threats being levelled at hundreds of workers at the Eres textiles company in Fundão, because of their local and regional importance and because of the consequences for the development of the areas that are affected."
"Apart from showing some solidarity with these workers, Madam President, I should like you to inform the Commission and the Council of this serious situation that is affecting thousands of Portuguese workers."
"Madam President, speaking as a Basque and, therefore, as a Spaniard, I would like to thank you for the sensitivity you always show with regard to the problem of terrorism in the Basque country."
"On the other hand, and I am sorry to have to say this, I must point out that from time to time on these occasions when, in theory, we are supposed to be observing a minutes silence, there are people in this House who continue to talk, even on the telephone, which seems to me to show, amongst other things, a total lack of consideration."
"Under Rule 19(4), may I ask you to personally intervene with the Greek authorities on behalf of my constituents Paul and Lesley Coppin of Mildenhall, and Anna Skinner of Epping, in relation to her brother Anthony Adamiak, and on behalf of the other Europeans who are currently in jail in Greece for plane spotting."
"We respect the independence of the judiciary in Greece and the cooperation we have thus far been given from the Greek authorities, but when these people have already been in prison for three weeks without charge and now have a further two weeks before charges are brought, I hope you will agree that there is an urgent humanitarian need for an appeal on their behalf and also a need to remind the Greek authorities of their absolute duty under the Convention on Human Rights to bring charges before defendants."
"Twelve people went on holiday and have ended up in jail."
"I ask for your intervention on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Mr Howitt, you are aware that Mr Van Orden already brought up this issue at our previous part-session in Strasbourg."
"Of course, I acted upon Mr Van Orden' s comments and my Cabinet contacted the Greek permanent representation."
"We were given some further details."
"There was, in fact, due to be a court hearing this Monday."
"We are unable to confirm whether or not this hearing took place."
"I am perfectly willing to intervene myself, depending, of course, on how events unfold, and on the situation, which, I can assure you, we are monitoring extremely closely."
"Madam President, I should like to thank the honourable Members, whose acute interest in human rights and compliance with the rule of law in the Member States of the European Union is most gratifying."
"At the same time, I am glad for this opportunity to point out that all substantive and adjectival rules, human rights and the rule of law are complied with to the highest degree in Greece, as I believe they are in the United Kingdom."
"Having said which, I believe that the judiciary in my country will be scrupulous in complying with the requirements of both Greek domestic legislation and international conventions."
"However, I should like to take this opportunity, merely for information purposes, to apprise the House of certain facts, so that we know where we stand."
"We live in an age in which terrorism operates on an international scale."
"The people arrested in Greece had been arrested on a previous day at another airport and cautioned against taking photographs of military installations, especially during operations or exercises and, according to the newspapers, transcripts of communications between air force aeroplanes and between aeroplanes and the base were found among their effects."
"They were then found at another airport and it was at this other airport that they were arrested, having been warned what would happen beforehand."
"So, as you can see, in these times of heightened awareness of the threat of terrorism, in these times when everyone knows that this sort of ban applies to every military base in Europe, and given that they had been warned, there was no more room for flexibility or turning a blind eye."
"Nonetheless, I am sure that the proper procedure will be followed to the letter because Greece is at the vanguard of the 15 in providing the necessary guarantees for all citizens brought before its courts, irrespective of where they are from."
"I trust that these few words have given the House the information it needed."
"Thank you, Mr Souladakis."
"Ladies and gentlemen, given that I have a further ten or so points of order, most of which relate to this issue, and that this matter is almost turning into a debate in itself, I propose that we leave the points of order and proceed to the debate on the preparation for the Laeken European Council, as these comments could be made after the debate."
"Future of the European Union"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the Laeken European Council on 14 and 15 December 2001;"
"the report (A5-0368/2001) by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Laeken European Council and the future of the Union (2001/2180(INI));"
"the report (A5-0399/2001) by Mrs Kaufmann, on the Commission White Paper on European Governance (COM(2001) 428 - C5-0454/2001 - 2001/2181(COS));"
"the oral questions (B5-0529/2001) to the Council and (B5-0530/2001) to the Commission, by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the European strategy to promote quality in employment and in social policy."
"At the end of the joint debate, I have six motions for resolution concerning the European Council, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"I would like to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Louis Michel."
"We are pleased to have you here and I shall now give you the floor."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the areas to be discussed at the European Council in Brussels-Laeken on 14 and 15 December will include the future of the European Union, European security and defence policy, enlargement, the fight against terrorism, the area of freedom, security and justice, the general situation of the EU and its prospects, employment and social cohesion, headquarters and various bodies and agencies, and lastly, external relations."
"With regard to the future of the European Union, the European Council will adopt the text of a declaration that will launch the debate on the future of Europe."
"The first chapter of the text will analyse the strengths and weaknesses of European integration, the second will bring together the issues that the Convention might tackle, and the third will set out how the debate will be organised."
"The General Affairs Council of 19 November has already confirmed that the Member States agree on the procedures."
"The principle of calling a preparatory Convention is an important step towards building a Union that is stronger, more readily understood by the people, and more focused on meeting its essential objectives."
"Representatives from governments, the Commission, the national parliaments and the European Parliament will take part in the Convention."
"With regard to the candidate countries, the Presidency' s proposal is based on the following principles: they will be fully involved in the work of the Convention with the right to express their views; they will be represented in the same way as Member States, in other words, by one representative for each government and two parliamentary representatives."
"The representatives from candidate countries who have not yet signed their accession treaty will not take part in the consensus when the Convention draws up its final report."
"The Chair of the Convention will be appointed by the Laeken European Council."
"The Chair will be assisted by a Presidium made up of representatives of the various component groups of the Convention."
"The Presidency-in-Office of the Council will take part, but the precise involvement of representatives of the following two presidencies is yet to be decided upon."
"Lastly, the Secretariat of the Convention will be fulfilled by the Council' s General Secretariat, which will be able to enlist the help of the Commission, as well as the secretariats of the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"We have reached unanimous agreement on consulting civil society through representative organisations at European and national level."
"We dispensed with the idea of a Forum made up of a separate assembly."
"These organisations could be interviewed or consulted in line with methods that are yet to be defined."
"The contributions from these organisations will be included in the official documentation sent to members of the Convention."
"The Convention will begin its work as soon as possible under the Spanish Presidency and will complete its proceedings by the European Council in June 2003."
"We are still considering the length of time that will pass between the end of the Convention' s work and the beginning of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"With regard to the themes, the Presidency' s approach was to work on the basis of the content of the Declaration of Nice to draw up a sufficiently broad and coherent mandate, which the Presidency could use for its work."
"The Presidency supports the recommendations made by the rapporteurs, Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez De Vigo, on this point."
"These themes are placed in five groups of open and impartial questions: the goals and the content of the Union' s policies, the division of competences between the Union and its Member States, the democratic legitimacy of the system, the ability of the Union to decide on and to pursue policies."
"When the Prime Minister visits each capital city, he will present an outline of the Laeken Declaration."
"The subjects that the Convention may tackle will be presented in this outline in the form of questions and choices, so as to enable the delegations to issue an opinion with full background knowledge."
"To sum up what I have said on this important matter, I would like to make the following comments. Whatever the content of the Laeken Declaration, the Convention will remain in charge of its own agenda."
"I think that there would be no point into trying to shackle it with a predefined mandate."
"The Presidency has attempted to set out and clarify the themes dealt with at Nice, where the declaration was willingly drafted in a relatively open manner."
"Nothing that the Presidency proposes should be interpreted as a mandate for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"The mandate of this conference will be decided in accordance with the procedures laid down under the Treaties."
"Lastly, the goal of the Laeken Declaration is to ensure that the Convention method is fruitful and that its results are taken up by the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference."
"The debate on the future of Europe must also aim to make the European Union more transparent, more effective, and bring it closer to its citizens."
"In this regard, the Council took great interest in Mrs Kaufmann' s report on the White Paper on European Governance."
"The report contains some valuable guidance."
"I particularly support the concern to ensure that the greater involvement of civil society in the way the Union works does not adversely affect the key role played by the representatives that have political responsibility."
"I shall now turn to the European security and defence policy."
"The Presidency will submit a report to the European Council that sets out the progress that has been made."
"Work is well underway on improving military capabilities and strengthening civil capabilities, as shown at the capabilities conferences held on 19 and 20 November 2001."
"With regard to declaring the European security and defence policy operational, the Union is faced with the following dilemma: either it cannot issue the declaration because of a veto imposed by one of the NATO members, who is not a member of the EU, or the Union declares it operational without the declaration having any real capabilities, as it is unable to use NATO assets."
"In both cases, I want to draw your attention to the fact that it is, of course, the Union' s credibility that is at stake."
"The third approach recommended by the Presidency is to declare that the Union will decide how to respond to each situation, depending on the military and civil resources and capabilities at its disposal."
"These are my comments on the European security and defence policy."
"(NL) I should now like to turn to another topic, namely enlargement."
"The Commission' s report was debated extensively at the General Affairs Council of 19 November."
"Remarkable progress was made in the accession negotiations."
"Consequently, we should be able to finalise the accession negotiations involving the countries that are ready from 2002 onwards, thus enabling these countries to take part in the 2004 elections."
"The Belgian Presidency is proceeding with the same robust and regular rhythm as its Swedish forerunner."
"At the same time, attention was focused on the implementation of the acquis communautaire by the candidate countries."
"At the European Council of Laeken, the Heads of State and Government will be given the opportunity of sending out a few messages to the candidate countries."
"The timeframe that was established in Nice and clarified in Gothenburg will be fully complied with."
"Enlargement is irreversible, and ten new Members could be included by 2004."
"In 2002, the Commission will make proposals to the Council concerning agriculture, cohesion policy and the budget of the Union."
"The Commission will sketch a roadmap for the countries that are not involved in the first enlargement round."
"Additionally, it will carry out a plan to strengthen the institutions of the candidate countries and will set aside EUR 250 million for that purpose."
"I should now like to say a few words about terrorism."
"The Presidency will be presenting a summary report at the European Council of Laeken, outlining the Union' s measures to combat terrorism."
"That report will also look to the future."
"These days, in my view, it is safe to state that the Union has responded promptly and effectively to terrorism."
"Its response was comprehensive, and that is the added value which European action brings: the Union has asserted itself as an effective and credible, in fact, vital partner, on which the United States and third countries can rely in the fight against terrorism."
"The Union has established its diplomatic and humanitarian role."
"The Union and the euro zone have contributed to the stabilisation of the economy in a turbulent period."
"Finally, despite major efforts which the fight against terrorism has required, the Belgian Presidency has not lost sight of the EU' s other priorities, including enlargement, the follow-up of Tampere and Lisbon, etc."
"(FR) I shall now turn to establishing the area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Laeken European Council must reiterate the importance of establishing the common area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Union' s response to the challenge posed by the tragic events of 11 September has shown the political will of Member States to make progress in this area."
"The introduction of a common asylum and immigration policy was one of the priorities of the Belgian Presidency' s work programme."
"The progress we expected has not been made."
"The Laeken Summit should be the opportunity to reinvigorate the asylum and immigration policy by implementing Tampere, to supplement and strengthen the coordination of instruments for police and judicial cooperation, by finally establishing Eurojust, to reiterate the principle of mutual recognition, thus demonstrating the trust that each Member State places in its partners' legal system."
"On a practical level, the Presidency hopes to reach an agreement in Laeken on the following issues: a framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States; a framework decision on the fight against terrorism; a framework decision on the execution of orders freezing assets or evidence in the European Union and an agreement on the common list of terrorist organisations."
"To move on to the next point, which is the economic situation and prospects for the European Union."
"This issue will be discussed on the first day of the European Council."
"The Finance Ministers will present their 'eurokits' and will announce the outcome of their negotiations on cross-border payments."
"The message from Laeken must be to increase the Union' s credibility by emphasising the progress we have made, particularly in the area of international trade after the Doha meeting, in stressing the benefits of the single market and in respecting the economic Stability Pact."
"The summit will stress the need to reiterate our determination to pursue the process launched at Lisbon and at Gothenburg."
"With regard to the preparation of the Barcelona European Council, specific action needs to be taken before the end of the year - we must establish the Food Safety Agency, make progress on Community patents, reach agreement on cross-border payments in euro and on public contracts, as well as implement the Galileo project."
"As far as employment is concerned, the European Council will discuss the 'employment package' ."
"It will support the aspects of this package as well the guidelines for 2002."
"In these guidelines, the European Council will include a new horizontal objective on the quality of employment and will also adopt a first list of agreed indicators for the quality of employment."
"Regarding the headquarters and the various bodies and agencies, the Heads of State and Government will try to reach an agreement on where to locate the headquarters of various bodies and agencies of the EU and the European Community."
"As for external relations, the European Council will examine international issues in the light of current events."
"If necessary, it will issue an opinion on the situation in Afghanistan, the Balkans and the Middle East."
"As you will have noted, the Belgian Presidency has worked hard to show that the European Union has an important role to play on the international stage."
"To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, I have outlined for you the work programme of the Laeken European Council."
"This Council will be where the European Union takes decisions on some fundamental issues that will map out its long term future, such as the physical introduction of the euro, the confirmation that enlargement is irreversible and the operational aspects of the European security and defence policy."
"The Laeken Council will also be the starting point for considering the future of European integration."
"The citizens of Europe will be broadly consulted on this issue."
"This is the meaning of the so-called Laeken Declaration."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the summit at Laeken can be an historic one."
"Our group has every faith in the Belgian Presidency, because Belgium has always been faithful to the ideal of European unification and, above all, because Belgium has always stood for the European Community approach."
"We, in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats do not want Europe to be governed by a few great nations, but, rather, we want Europeans to work together, we want the European Community approach, and so we wish you, Mr President-in-Office, great success."
"Both you and the President of the Commission have spoken about the enlargement, and the memory is still fresh in my mind of a conference with the leaders of our related parties from the acceding countries, that is to say, from the countries desirous of joining the European Union."
"Following on the French foreign minister's highly misleading statements, we declare loud and clear that we must not give the impression that those who will be ready to sign the Treaties in the coming year will have to wait for the stragglers also to comply with the criteria."
"Each country must be judged on its own merits; it is on this basis that we must proceed with the enlargement of the European Union."
"At Laeken, you will no doubt be considering Afghanistan, which is indeed necessary, and we repeat that it is necessary to destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist networks."
"Now, though, we must also create the basis on which the international community, comprising the European Union, the USA, and the Arab and Muslim world, will now help Afghanistan to rebuild itself, making it possible for a humane society to come into being there, with a government in Kabul that respects human rights, including the rights of women."
"It is that task that is before us in the days and weeks ahead."
"I would like to comment on the Middle East."
"We urge all the parties involved to return to the negotiating table."
"I am being very restrained in my use of language when I say that we greatly regret the way that the Prime Minister of Israel behaved towards the visitors from the European Union."
"These were Mr Verhofstadt, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, Mr Michel, the Foreign Minister and Council President and also Mr Solana, the High Representative."
"We have no patience with the way that the Israeli Prime Minister treated our delegation to Israel - and I can remember some of Israel's great Prime Ministers, such as Ben Gurion, Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin."
"(Applause)"
"We encourage the Commission and the Council to keep to the course they have set."
"We will always defend Israel's security, as we have always done in the past, but the people in Palestine are as much entitled to human dignity and a life lived in security, as are the Israelis, who rightly lay claim to that for themselves."
"(Applause)"
"Let me make another comment on the Convention."
"We have high hopes for what you will be deciding at Laeken."
"The composition of the Convention is, numerically at least, well-known."
"I beg you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to use all your influence to ensure that the fifteen government representatives are the sort of people who will work together in the Convention and will feel themselves bound by whatever proposal for a decision results from it, so that the governments, too, will be made to discharge their duties with regard to what the Convention brings into existence."
"For the Convention is not some kind of seminar, so - if, at the end of it, we are to be able to say more than just Yes or No, and I know perfectly well that the governments want that to be the case - the Convention must come up with something so convincing that it will be binding on the governments."
"Our group will, in any case, be sending its best and most experienced people to the Convention, so that we can achieve a real result."
"We also echo President Prodi's demand and beg you to make your influence felt in order to make it possible for the Convention to start as early as possible in 2002 - in February or early March under the Spanish Presidency - and then be concluded under the Italian Presidency at the end of 2003, giving us, by then, a new Treaty ready for signature, on which we can then have very comprehensive and repeated discussions here in Parliament."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what I am saying reflects my profound conviction that Laeken is such an important summit precisely because it will be about the future direction of our European Union, about whether we carry on the way we did at the mini-summit in London, with seven countries taking part, eight countries not taking part, and the European Commission not even present, that is not how we envisage Europe. On the contrary, Europe is for us the European Community."
"It is our wish that you, the Council Presidency and the Commission make Laeken an expression of this Community, and if you do that, you will have our entire support."
"(Applause)"
"Our debate today is on the future of Europe and I might take that as a point of departure."
"President Prodi has talked about the indispensable necessity of the institutional triangle: the Commission, Parliament and Council."
"It is indispensable and each part of it has a core, indispensable role and responsibility and benefits by the very fact of the three parts working well together."
"Personally, I am getting increasingly fed up with so-called analyses in newspapers and commentaries on issues of personality which miss the points of substance."
"The point of substance about the role of the Commission is that it is at the heart and core of the European project - and it is indispensably so - and that is the structure of truth which we must promote, defend and constantly revisit."
"With regard to a sense of Europe as Hans-Gert Poettering mentioned earlier, I believe it has been diminished at the highest level through Members of the European Council."
"Every State has a right to bilaterals and multilaterals but there is a time and a place for every one of those initiatives."
"It is not the time and place to conduct such an initiative immediately preceding and in the same place as a Council meeting that is meant to discuss the same issues, as at Ghent."
"When we reduce the European Security and Defence Policy to the somewhat farcical theatre of presence or absence at the dining policy at Downing Street, we diminish the idea of Europe itself and we need, from the top down, at the level of the European Council, a commitment to an internally consistent and coherent sense of Europe."
"The Commission President and Enrique Barón Crespo have both referred to this question of the interinstitutional dialogue and balance and President Prodi has talked about the very sensitive issue of call-back procedure."
"The one plea I would make, and we have already asked Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee to deal with this question with some urgency, is that before us now is the responsibility, among other things, to begin to implement one major part of the structural economic reform programme of Lisbon, namely to create a single European market for financial services."
"If we cannot work out the levels of commitment and lay down rules with proper conditions between Parliament, Commission and Council, we run the risk of failing to meet the target and the necessity for reform."
"There is therefore a general urgency and, in some parts, even a specific one."
"I hope all candidate countries will participate in the Convention, under the principles of Helsinki, namely equal treatment."
"That is all and there are 13 candidate countries."
"Secondly, I hope there will be a minimum period between the Convention and the IGC."
"I agree with all those who said that this business of reform must be finished before the next European election because then there will be a new Parliament, a new Europe after enlargement and a new Commission."
"Madam President, in the short time available to me, I do not wish to repeat what has been said by our excellent rapporteurs, nor do I wish to concern myself with the strategy of the Council and the Member States, who have, for months, been setting this Convention up to be as feeble and unsuccessful as possible."
"In this historic context, with one of the most important summits, preparing for an historic Intergovernmental Conference, in the offing, I wish to address the Commission."
"Mr President of the Commission, I would very much like to remind you that all the great projects of European integration began with the Commission's visions and outlines and that the Commission was the spiritus rector and visionary behind almost every great step forward."
"Let me remind you of the Single European Act, of the first Delors package, of Maastricht with its second Delors package and the Report on Economic and Monetary Union, of the White Paper on the completion of the internal market, of the White Paper on growth, competition and employment with its visions of the social dialogue and of a social chapter in the Treaty, of the White Papers on environmental policy and on the role of Parliament and of all the great concepts produced by the Commission, which went ahead of the Intergovernmental Conferences to prepare their way."
"You speak today of the institutional triangle, which will indeed become a struggle for power between Council and Parliament, but where the Commission should be, I see nothing but a black hole."
"Mr President of the Commission, where is the Commission's White Paper on European democracy?"
"Where is your draft European constitution?"
"Where is your White Paper on a system of checks and balances in this supranational space, on the Convention's methodology and on fundamental citizens' and human rights in Europe?"
"None of these have you produced, and today's marginal comments by you are insufficient."
"Just to single out one point: if you do not even give this Convention the right to elect its own president from among its own members, you are disowning it before the eyes of the European public as a whole."
"That is only one of the many errors you have been propagating instead of a vision."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I would like to say something about the Laeken Declaration and, in particular, about the Convention."
"Especially since the failure of the Nice Summit, this Parliament has agitated for a new method for Intergovernmental Conferences."
"Across party boundaries, it has worked jointly with our colleagues in the national parliaments and together with various representatives of civic society, to consign to the past, once and for all, the politics of secret diplomacy behind closed doors, of opaque decision-making and of horse-trading in marathon sittings through the long nights."
"I believe this new approach, with the calling of a Convention, to be crucial to the European Union's future viability, for the primary issue here is the reinforcement of democracy in Europe."
"It is, above all, about our citizens, about a comprehensive and broad debate on what shape should be taken by our common European home, which we hope we will, from 2004, share with ten more European countries."
"Mr President-in-Office, today you have put before us the salient points of the Laeken Declaration, which is to be ambitious in its scope."
"Let me return to a number of issues."
"My group sees the composition of the Convention as being of extraordinary importance, and we take the view that two things, in particular, need to be taken into consideration here."
"One is the principle of political pluralism."
"There is an absolute need to guarantee that the various political forces are represented in the Convention and that the delegations of this Parliament or of the national parliaments should include not only representatives of the major political parties but also, because we need them, representatives of smaller political parties in the various European Union Member States."
"Above all, we need a productive bilateral political debate, without which discussions will be lacking in interest."
"Both sexes also need to be appropriately represented."
"I see that amendments to the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen have been tabled on this subject. I hope that many Members will support these amendments so that, above all, the national parliaments and the Council will also then consider how they may comply with this criterion."
"I believe there is an urgent need for purposeful and structured dialogue with civic society, something which you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have mentioned."
"We could, I think, also consider whether the Economic and Social Affairs Committee, which is an important mouthpiece for civic society, might play an intermediary role in this area."
"I am very pleased with the announcement that the Convention is to draw up its own agenda, as not only questions about the institutions will have to be dealt with, but also a broad spectrum of the most diverse political issues, as well as the issue of how a wide variety of European policies are to be formulated in the future."
"A report by the Commission tells us that 60 million people in the European Union are affected by poverty, at present, and I find myself thinking that this appalling figure alone tells us what a great need there is for political action, and that this Convention must be about a change of direction and a new kind of politics in Europe."
"Mr President, the scope of European Union foreign policy needs to be extended in the light of the recent international developments, but the Member States' governments have to realise that we cannot have a common foreign policy without joint intelligence."
"The geopolitical situation, poverty - an increasingly serious problem - and the growth of terrorism - there are now cells in all the countries of the globe - must prompt us to start work at Laeken on a project to introduce genuine joint intelligence, new intelligence which is not created or developed along the same lines as Europol but which is capable of being used transparently with political, economic and cultural analysts who will be able to focus our foreign policy on that cooperation and timely intervention without which the European Union, with or without institutional reforms, will not be able to get off the ground."
"With a view to achieving peace in Afghanistan and the subsequent reconstruction of the country, the Union' s role both as mediator and a proactive force must be defined now so that Afghanistan' s future is characterised not just by economic recovery and the establishment of a democratic political system, but also by the reestablishment of a role for women in politics and social life."
"The Union cannot ignore the fact that, to bring about genuine peace in the Middle East, we must work actively to oppose those who encourage, or, at any rate, do not offer resistance to local terrorism which, it is now quite clear, is supported at international level, and the Union has the economic and political tools to intervene along these lines."
"In conclusion, the success or failure of the Convention depends on the will, the genuine European convictions motivating us, our will as individual parties and governments not just to produce documents on reforms but to focus on practical action that, as well as improving the situation of our own countries, can improve the situations of countries that look to us for help too."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, the EU' s Heads of State and Government have decided to hold a Convention on 14 and 15 December with a view to designing a constitution for a federation of national states."
"Now, let us clear up any confusion. A federation of national states is a federal state."
"A federal state is a state and not a federation, in the same way as a fruit knife is a knife and not a fruit."
"States have constitutions, while federations of states are based on agreements in international law between independent nations."
"I call upon the Heads of State and Government to give the Convention a clear mandate."
"Is a draft constitution for a federal state to be devised, yes or no?"
"Or is a draft agreement between independent nations, not designed to establish a state, to be devised?"
"Why not let the Convention devise two different, clear and unambiguous proposals, one for a federal state - model 1, as envisaged by the federalists - and the other for a federation of states - model 2, as envisaged by the Euro-realists and focusing upon the cross-border problems we cannot solve ourselves in our own parliaments?"
"Submit the proposals for public debate, followed by a referendum in which all EU citizens are asked if they want a constitution for an EU state or an agreement between nations acting together."
"When we have their answer, an Intergovernmental Conference can be held with a view to proposing changes to the existing treaties."
"The great majority of people in all EU countries want a referendum."
"Why, then, not ask for their views before we do anything in their name?"
"Let us have a peaceful and competitive debate concerning Europe' s future, and let the people give their answer."
"I believe that people will prefer our version of a Europe of democracies, as set out in the minority opinion of the members of SOS Democracy. I would happily defer to the majority in a referendum, but never to officials and ministers operating behind closed doors."
"Mr President, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, the report drafted by my colleague Mr Méndez de Vigo and myself enjoys the support of a very large majority in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, with only Mr Bonde, Mr Berthu and Mr Sacrédeus being opposed to it."
"So a substantial majority shares the position we have taken and I am pleased to learn today that the Belgian Presidency agrees with many parts of it and that even the Commission can go along with many of the points Parliament has made."
"A powerful current of opinion sees Laeken as an important opportunity that we must seize in order to make our European Union more democratic and more capable of taking action. If that is so, Laeken is perhaps the last chance to do this before enlargement, when the EU is enlarged from fifteen States to between twenty-five and thirty."
"I am very grateful to all those who have helped to prepare the way for the new method."
"I find myself thinking back to the beginning of the year, and back in January or February all this seemed a long way in the distance."
"I thank all those who have contributed to a new method really becoming possible - a convention in which the representatives of the parliaments will enjoy equal rights with the representatives of the governments in giving shape to this project for the future of this European Union of ours."
"The Convention, though, must not be a merely cosmetic exercise, and I believe it would be very unsatisfactory if we were to simply list the options that are already present in Europe."
"That these options are there, we know from the speeches of our Heads of State."
"They are well known, and they are nothing new."
"This Convention must be a political forum for grappling with solutions, one in which real effort is made to reach a consensus as to how we, in Europe, are to go forward."
"That is the real task."
"That we are to produce various proposals, be they federalist or, on the other hand, intergovernmental in nature, sounds very appealing, but, President Prodi, if we produce a hotchpotch of proposals, can we then expect strong responses from the Intergovernmental Conference?"
"I very much doubt it."
"The governments have the same problem."
"They can come up with whatever they will, but the Intergovernmental Conference's unanimity principle results in the same sort of blockade that we had in Amsterdam and Nice."
"No, I believe that the Convention represents the great opportunity to use the consensus method to arrive at the overwhelming majority."
"What emerges is not unanimity, but the overwhelming tendency, the overwhelming majority."
"If we go to the IGC with such a coherent proposal, we maximise the likelihood of it being accepted, because governments naturally find it hard to deny themselves consensus."
"Issues still remain to be negotiated, and all this will have to be put into the form of a legal text."
"All this work will have to be done by the IGC, but I would warn against restricting the Convention's role to that of drawing up options using different terminology."
"That is not the task for a political forum such as a Convention."
"We note that, at Laeken, the Council proposed someone to preside over the Convention; that is all well and good, but I do think that the Convention should be able to confirm him in office, and should be able to elect him."
"A Convention elects its own President, and that is the procedure that should take place."
"President Prodi, you spoke in terms of a small Bureau."
"Such a Bureau would have a great deal to do, being the organ that would have to direct this great Convention, and it would be advantageous if the opposition parties, both from the national parliaments and from the European Parliament, could have as much a sense of being represented in it as did the majority."
"Turning to the timetable, I am glad that the governments themselves state that more or less one year is needed, which would mean that the Convention would complete its work in June 2003."
"There would then be a break, but just for the summer recess."
"I am in favour of us all resting from our labours in July and August, so that the IGC can begin in September under the Italian Presidency and we can complete the constitutional treaty by the end of 2003, in good time for the European elections and also for enlargement."
"With such a document we could stand before the peoples of Europe; it is my belief that, if the Treaty is successful to the extent that children can read it at school and understand it, then we will also be reducing the citizens' alienation from Europe, which is the task before us."
"Mr President, I think that the European Council that is about to take place, this time in Laeken, is of fundamental importance."
"We are at one of those pivotal moments, as Karl Jaspers would say."
"We will find that the introduction into circulation of euro notes and coins will increase the sense of belonging to Europe."
"Negotiations on enlargement will mean that a longstanding dream of many Europeans becomes reality."
"I think that the terrorist attacks against Washington and New York on 11 September have awoken the consciousness of European citizens, who are now asking for more Europe and better Europe."
"Therefore, your responsibility, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is great indeed."
"But let me tell you that I think you are doing a very good job, and I would like to say that this Belgian Presidency has maintained an excellent attitude towards the European Parliament, one that has been based upon collaboration, participation, listening and, in short, the desire to work together."
"Support for the Convention is something that this Parliament chose to adopt a long time ago, even before Nice."
"In the Resolution of 17 November 1997, which I had the honour to present together with Dimitri Tsatsos, with regard to the Treaty of Amsterdam, we were already saying that the intergovernmental method for the revision of the Treaties had run its course and that we would have to look for another method."
"This method is the Convention."
"Do not think that the European Parliament gave its support to the Convention because of some kind of obsession. This is not true."
"We did this because the Convention brings Europe closer to its citizens, because it is more open, more public, more transparent, more participatory; it allows, as the Convention that drafted the Charter proves, that our citizens want to be involved in the construction of Europe."
"For this reason we have put our faith in the Convention, and I am happy to say that the Convention will be brought to life in the Laeken declaration."
"Make no mistake about the Convention, however."
"It is an instrument."
"With regard to another famous Convention in history, the Philadelphia Convention, George Washington said that you could talk about everything, propose everything yet decide upon nothing."
"This is also true."
"What we want is to help the decision making process, bringing Europe closer to its citizens, its people and bringing together the various legitimacies of the European Union."
"Therefore, Members of the Council, there is no need to be afraid of the Convention."
"There is no need to take a successful instrument and empty it of content."
"There is no need to constrict the Convention."
"You must give the Convention all it needs to be a success."
"The previous speakers - above all Mr Leinen, with whom I have had the great pleasure of collaborating in the drafting of this report - have spoken about many different subjects."
"Let me highlight some of these."
"Firstly, the European Parliament is asking that, if we take our model to be the Convention that drafted the Charter on Fundamental Rights, the four parts of which it is comprised be balanced."
"In that particular Convention, there were 16 MEPs and 62 members of the Convention."
"In the proposal that you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, have sent to the capitals there are still 16 MEPs, but there are 120 members of the Convention."
"And I do not accept that some of these extra people are observers, because observers have exactly the same rights as everybody else, and so they should, except during participation in the final consensus."
"I would also like to say, despite the words of a previous speaker, that the Commission has participated fully, and I would like to praise Commissioner Barnier' s observations, which have been very important."
"However, there is still an ambiguity with regard to the word 'consensus' : consensus does not mean unanimity."
"This was not the case in the Convention that drafted the Charter."
"There were members of the Convention that voted against - and there is one very notable opponent amongst us today - but there was a sufficient majority, a sufficient consensus."
"Therefore, let it not be said, yet again, that consensus means unanimity."
"This is not true. It means final support for the resulting text."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, there is one issue that you, yourself, said is still not resolved, which is to the issue known as 'cooling' ."
"And as for myself, when I have to explain that after this work carried out by the one hundred and twelve people on reaching a final result, governments want to 'cool down' , things become extremely complicated."
"What is this 'cooling' process?"
"If the result is a good one, let us adopt it immediately, then we can move on to other things."
"We have enlargement to prepare for."
"To conclude, Mr President, I think that we have to get rid of this fear of the Convention."
"We have to remember that Europe is asking us to give a positive indication."
"But what indication?"
"This can only be the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I also hope that, at the end of this process, the indication will be a Constitution for the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the future of the European Union is, as a subject for debate, no doubt closely related to, and in part inseparable from, the reform of governance, which forms the subject of my report."
"You will see, on reading it, that it is not exactly sparing with its criticisms."
"It takes up a very definite stance on numerous subjects addressed by the Commission in its White Paper, and, to use a phrase currently popular in Germany, a good thing too!"
"It is precisely for this reason, President Prodi, that it is important to me that I thank you and your colleagues for your initiative in producing this White Paper, above all for the Commission's willingness, expressed in the White Paper, to unreservedly and even self-critically examine and change all the rules, procedures and ways the EU has of exercising its authority, in short, everything summed up in the word 'governance'."
"This merits every respect, being, in fact, about nothing more or less than the reduction of the prevailing gulf between the EU and its citizens."
"In this, the Commission finds in Parliament a close comrade-in-arms."
"We are, as is well known, only at the beginning of the debate on the reform of governance."
"Many of the Commission's proposals need to be considered in depth."
"The White Paper announces several initiatives, and when they are definitely on the table, we will express our opinion of them."
"I assume that certain proposals can become reality quite soon and not only at the end of next year at the earliest."
"I would put under this heading the committees and working parties listed in Commissioner Kinnock's White Paper on reform of the Commission, and which are participating in the consultation procedure."
"I will take this opportunity to point out that I think that every future legislative proposal could have an appendix listing all the experts, associations and organisations that played a part in drafting it."
"Parliament does indeed support the improved participation and consultation that the White Paper calls for, but we take the view that this requires an interinstitutional agreement on democratic consultation, and I am pleased, President Prodi, that you have mentioned this today and given it your clear support."
"President Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, my report takes at length a very definite position on the issue of better lawmaking, and this is not by chance, for the fundamental issue is the role of Parliament as joint legislator."
"Parliament has repeatedly emphasised that it puts its trust in the Community method, and that it sees the maintenance of the balance between the institutions as the best way to make progress towards integration."
"It is not, then, some concept that we are defending, but rather its content and political essence, so I want to make it very clear today that, to put it mildly, there has been great disquiet in Parliament about the Council' s and the Commission's long-standing efforts to draft an action plan for better lawmaking, about the working parties that have already and secretly been drafting papers with the objective of putting this programme of action on the Laeken agenda - all of which has been done without involving or even informing Parliament, the joint legislator."
"As item 30 of this report quite clearly states, we see this as a grave breach of the Community method."
"The report therefore also demands that the action programme for better lawmaking should not be on the agenda for the Laeken Summit."
"This is certainly not about this House being unwilling to take part in any consideration of how lawmaking could be simplified or even improved."
"President Prodi announced today that the Commission will be producing a consultative document aimed at starting a dialogue with this House on this issue, and I can tell you that this Parliament is ready for it."
"Let me say, though, and say quite emphatically, something to which we attach the highest importance: that if Parliament's legislative authority, given to it alone directly by the citizens who elected it, is restricted, Parliament will not take it lying down."
"It is, especially, co-regulation that is at issue here."
"The use of so-called framework directives is something we view with a highly critical eye."
"There must be appropriate mechanisms of democratic control, and on this point, Mr Prodi, there are evidently differences of opinion."
"We want a time-limited 'call-back mechanism'."
"So I was very surprised that the Council representative made no comments on this of all issues. Better lawmaking is indeed a matter for all three institutions, and I would be interested to know what the Council Presidency has to say on this issue or on that of the proposed interinstitutional working party."
"Mr President, despite all the fine words, I cannot shake off the impression that the Laeken Summit is actually intended to clean up the very soiled image of the Belgian Presidency, an attempt to brush successive howlers by the Verhofstadt-Michel government team under the carpet."
"These days, one only has to read the foreign quality press, such as The Spectator and The Wall Street Journal, to realise how much damage this Belgian government is currently causing by its incompetent behaviour and, for example, by the insults which Minister Michel, present at the moment, has addressed to Austria and Italy."
"That is unfortunate, for the Belgian Presidency could have easily played a significant role in this time of debate about Europe' s core tasks, about Europe' s borders and about the democratic deficit."
"After all, we know from experience that the Single Belgian Federal State does not work along democratic lines and that consequently, a Single European Federal State cannot work democratically either."
"We know from experience that, for example, matters of social security, are best decided at the level of the individual nations and that the principle of subsidiarity has to be followed to the letter."
"We know from experience that a high level of respect is needed for linguistic and cultural differences if we are to co-exist in a proper, democratic way."
"We know from experience that problems arise when people, citizens, and voters cannot identify with the political structure which decides on their fates."
"In my country, Flanders, 70% of those questioned cannot name even one European institution and nearly 40% do not realise that they elect the MEPs."
"Anyway, this should all be steamrollered by the Laeken propaganda machine, and in that way, the Belgian Presidency will finish as it started: insignificant and at the service of the inflated egos of a few ministers."
"Mr President, the Lisbon European Council and the socio-political agenda adopted by the European Council at Nice bring us into a new phase of policy on social affairs and employment in the European Union."
"As we have heard from the President-in-Office of the Council and from the President of the Commission, interest is now focussed on the quality of work and of social affairs policy."
"We in this Parliament want to be fully involved in this development."
"We - by which I mean the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, whose Chairman, Michel Rocard, I represent - are therefore putting an oral question to the Council and Commission, coupled with a motion for a resolution."
"It is our conviction that secure jobs, favourable working conditions and appropriate workers' rights do not diminish productivity and economic growth and hence the creation of jobs, but, on the contrary, promote them."
"Work for all is the objective."
"We want a strategy for more and better jobs."
"Quality of work involves job satisfaction, which improves employees' motivation, and health and safety at work improve as well."
"We are looking to the Commission to produce a proposal on the status of temporary workers."
"Moreover, quality of work involves equal treatment of both sexes, the reconciliation of work and family life, and measures to keep older people in the job market."
"For this we need the most modern forms of vocational education."
"There is a need for further education, in-service training and lifelong learning."
"The adaptability of enterprises and their capacity to deal with structural change will be particularly important in creating new and better jobs, and minimum standards across Europe are needed to ensure that employees are involved in this, informed and consulted in due time, and thereby enabled to adjust to change."
"In comparison with our economic counterparts, for example, the United States, Europe suffers from a low employment rate."
"The Lisbon European Council recognised that this was a problem and proposed an ambitious objective for progressively increasing this rate."
"It is absolutely vital that we achieve this objective."
"The Commission has presented a communication in preparation for the Laeken Summit, in which it sets down the outlines of a strategy for promoting quality of work and social affairs policy."
"The drawing-up of appropriate indicators and criteria, as Mr Prodi informed us, is not the least important of these, but is primary."
"As I said at the outset, Parliament expects to be fully involved in discussions."
"It is our ever more frequent experience that European social affairs policy is carried on by dialogue between sub-committees of the Council - for example the Employment Committee or the Social Protection Committee - and the Commission."
"Parliament is often left out in the cold."
"We protest against this."
"Parliament must be able to play its rightful part in formulating proposals on subjects such as employment and social protection which, after all, are of immediate concern to all citizens."
"If we are to do this, the relevant specialised fora and the Commission have to keep us up to date with the work they are doing, and Parliament has to be consulted in good time before every European Council."
"We expect a clear pledge on this from the Laeken summit."
"We are, at the end of the day, the representatives of the people and therefore, in essence, the primary organ of the European Union."
"President Prodi just used a very fine expression in describing Parliament as the most important expression of democratic Europe."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President, it is for these reasons that we look forward to your answers to our oral questions."
"Mr President, after Mr Barón Crespo' s speech, there remains very little for me to say on this matter."
"I am going to refer to the Commission White Paper, and also to the mysterious Council document, the Mandelkern report, to which reference has been made, but of which we have no knowledge."
"The two documents deal with the legislative powers of Parliament."
"Mr Prodi has made a commitment not to put forward any proposal to the Laeken European Council, and it seems right, in fact, that these issues will not be discussed at Laeken, because, in short, these are issues that affect the very essence of the process of drafting a new European Constitution and which should, therefore, be in the Convention itself, and, possibly, at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"What we have to do here is to establish the legislative competences of the European Institutions, and make it clear that, of all the European Institutions, it is the organ of popular representation, the European Parliament, that holds the mandate for this popular representation."
"The wording of the White Paper, relating to the powers of enforcement, to self-regulation and coregulation procedures, and to the Lisbon strategy, are all aimed at cutting back Parliament' s limited legislative powers."
"Mr President, I have one minute indeed, and it is outrageous, in my view, for draftsmen of the opinion to be apportioned a meagre one minute of speaking time on such a weighty matter."
"Overall, Nice has failed to come up with the goods, but as for the areas of competence of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, of whose opinion I have the honour of being the draftsman, the situation is not actually that bad."
"I would particularly refer to the improvements made at our initiative to the workings of the European legal system."
"The major concern which the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market wishes to express, therefore, is that whatever the fate of the Treaty of Nice may be, the positive changes which I alluded to a moment ago should enter into effect independently of the overall ratification of Nice."
"With regard to the Laeken Declaration itself, to put it succinctly, the European Union must show itself prepared to meet the challenges that lie ahead."
"It must focus on its core tasks and carry out its tasks properly."
"In this connection, the European citizen expects Laeken to send out a clear signal that a great deal of work is being put into a European security policy, both internal and external."
"I have been as generous as I can, Mr De Clercq, but one has to recognise the time that is allocated to your Committee."
"Mr President, I am pleased that Mr Prodi is here to listen to this."
"The Environment Committee is very unhappy with the idea of voluntary agreements, as a way of proceeding."
"We want to see a legal framework for them because we believe that this is far too much like secret law-making."
"We are not at all happy about the co-regulatory approach - whatever that may be - because we see that as a way of moving away from binding legal instruments, which can sideline democratic control."
"Mr Prodi will know that we are very happy with the idea of publishing expert advice."
"We are grateful for what crumbs we receive and would like to see sometimes the authorship of the legislation which we then tear apart."
"On the question of implementation, we are very worried about the application of the law and I quote ""in a way that takes account of regional and local conditions""."
"We feel it would be better to draw up the law in a more flexible way in the first place."
"If you are going to take account of regional and local conditions, it probably means that you are going to upset the conditions of fair and equal competition."
"We see a great need for the Commission to devote more energy to the issue of implementation and we see no real need to establish criteria to focus its work in investigating possible breaches of the law."
"What they need is more staff."
"Finally, I recommend to Mr Prodi to read the occasional paper produced by the European Policy Centre on regulatory impact analysis."
"It provides the idea of having a regulatory impact analysis on all new legislation to assess the need for it, to examine alternatives and to examine its overall impact."
"It would include, and this may not recommend itself to Mr Prodi or his staff, the idea of a specific regulatory assessment office in the office of the Commission Secretary-General."
"I think that would be a very good idea."
"Mr President, five principles form the basis of the Commission' s reform of the EU' s forms of governance: openness, participation, efficiency, consistency and a clear division of responsibilities."
"The work on these areas cannot be regarded as being complete if one half of humanity is ignored."
"No one can say they are working for participation if they do not guarantee that it is both women and men who are participating."
"Our Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities called for a council on equality to be set up to, for example, gather information and analyse trends; for women' s rights groups and non-governmental organisations to be part of the database on civil society that the Commission intends to set up; and for considerations of equality to be integrated into information gathering at both national and local level, because women' s and men' s priorities, circumstances and needs often differ."
"It is unfortunate that none of our demands has been incorporated into the report."
"Mr President, the debate on the future of Europe must be conducted in a very responsible manner if it is not to end in failure, as happened with the intergovernmental method at Nice."
"We must recognise the legitimacy of the European citizenship of the citizens of the Member States, for this, too, will help to bring the European institutions closer to the citizens once again."
"Today, we have to take into account the way the interinstitutional organisations' systems have developed, and the more sophisticated this development becomes the more it widens the gap between the citizens and the institutions."
"When the institutions work properly, problems do not arise, but when they do not work properly - and the number of petitions we receive is evidence of the considerable gap between the institutions and the citizens - the citizens are wronged by the institutions."
"Our positive response must be to strengthen the institutions which safeguard the rights of the Union' s citizens."
"The Committee on Petitions has been forced to issue an extremely critical opinion on the Commission' s proposals on good governance, for it has found no reference in them either to the European Ombudsman or to the Committee on Petitions' role as the institutional body which safeguards the rights of the citizens, who indeed petition it to uphold their rights."
"The proposals for good governance do not appear to contain any significant element that might succeed in bringing the citizens closer to Europe."
"This endeavour could be said to be effective in theory but, in actual fact, to have no genuine impact."
"Lastly, we hope that it will be possible to make the obscure role of the Council clearer, at least by advertising the institution' s sittings when it is legislating, to avoid the impression of it being a huge black hole."
"I recommend the points made in these reports to the other European institutions, for I am sure that Parliament is the only body with democratic legitimacy."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, there are only two observations I wish to make, and they overlap with each other."
"I believe that the European Union's practical policy after 11 September has made it clear, through the behaviour of a number of Member States which indulged in bilateralism or appeared enraptured by their own managerial airs and graces, that the European Union is strong wherever it works in accordance with the Community method, and weak wherever it does not."
"That is the lesson to be learned from the past two or three months; it shows us how necessary general reform of the European Union is if this approach, which weakens us, is not to recur in future."
"The conclusion to be drawn from this is that it is important that we find the right mechanism at Laeken, where the European Council will not yet, essentially, be deciding on content, but where success will depend on the methods by which the content is worked out."
"One thing, I believe, must be clear. If there is to be a Convention which owes its existence to the help given by the Presidency, a number of Member States and the Commission, and in which Members of this Parliament and of the national parliaments take part, then it must not be a Convention whose procedures are conceived in such a way that it does not have the room to manoeuvre needed if the right decisions are to be reached."
"Nor must it lack a procedure that can serve as the basis for the final negotiations by the Heads of State and of Government."
"It is, above all else, unacceptable that so much time is allowed to elapse between the Convention and the summit that the old method of the diplomatic governmental conference destroys all the political momentum built up by parliamentarians."
"I believe that this will be the decisive test by which Laeken will stand or fall."
"I wish you a great deal of success, knowing as I do that you, in the Council and in the Commission, share this view that these positions must be made to prevail so that we can work together with a view to a result acceptable to all."
"The Convention marks the start of a new European Constitution, a bold vision of Europe' s future, a euro which is not suffering from monetary isolation but which is being embedded in socio-economic policy, a European Commission which is transformed into a European government, European elections with European lists of candidates and with people heading the lists of candidates who, via the European Parliament, can produce a president for the European Commission."
"We would like more qualified majority votes in the Council and more codecision in the European Parliament."
"The Council meetings must become public, allowing national parliaments to adequately monitor the Council Ministers."
"We look forward to close cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments."
"This is a vision and the possible shape of things to come."
"The Convention should look to reach consensus rather than draft a catalogue with no strings attached."
"The Convention must enter into an open dialogue with civil society, for part of Europe' s future lies in more European cooperation in those fields where citizens expect to see cross-border results, including food safety, immigration, environmental pollution, international crime and terrorism."
"However, an equal share of the areas of policy could be apportioned to the regions and civil society."
"I am thus in favour of more positive subsidiarity."
"We must avoid a situation of Europe-autism and therefore focus on innovative institutional restructuring which goes hand in hand with cooperation in the various fields of policy."
"Bringing about new types of European administration means adopting a more open working method and result-focused approach."
"We will achieve this by introducing new instruments, such as co- and self-regulation and open coordination, but, in the event of failure, we must have the assurance that we can fall back on call-back mechanisms."
"I am pleased with the resolutions before us."
"As the European Parliament, let us today choose in favour of a new, transparent form of European administration and let us vote in favour of the Convention, thus ensuring a democratic future for Europe."
"Mr President, in February 1787, a previous convention met in Philadelphia."
"Several of the American States were opposed to calling the thing in the first place and several others were determined to restrict its mandate and to dilute its effect."
"The convention's formal brief was extremely restrictive and it was not itself to decide but only propose."
"Yet from that experiment flowered the American Constitution and the post-colonial parliamentary democracy that we still recognise today."
"Such a similar result will only come out of this European Convention, if we as a Parliament are bold, well-organised and persuasive."
"Beneath the Presidency of our European George Washington, we must draft a clear set of proposals and, while accepting the questions set for us by Laeken, we must retain the capacity to ask ourselves some questions."
"Let us be truly creative for Europe."
"Mr President, the Union already has implicitly in the Treaties the bones of a Constitution."
"We all look to the Convention to make it explicit and clear and to create the proper legal framework for a thoroughly democratic Europe."
"That, of course, will involve, as has been said in parts of this debate, fully recognising the prerogatives and powers of this great all-European Parliamentary Assembly."
"But democracy at this level will not be effective unless it is also fully effective at the level of the little battalions: at the level of the local authorities, at the level of the constitutional regions, the self-governing internal nations of the Member States."
"Now that means that the Convention must look to that question as well, and improving governance in Europe must, as the Commission has said, look closely at the proper involvement of regional and local authorities."
"I thought that the Commission was somewhat timid in what they said about that, but alas, Parliament argues yet further timidity and talks down all the references in the White Paper to regional involvement with the Commission."
"Recital M and Paragraph 26 are to be deeply regretted as currently phrased in Mrs Kaufmann's otherwise admirable report."
"We want to see these amended."
"We want to see a strengthening of the reference to the necessary involvement of the Commission and Parliament with the regional and local authorities, as well as with national parliaments."
"We do not want to subvert the constitutional framework of Europe. We want to improve it."
"Mr President, the Laeken Summit is to form the basis of a new EU treaty."
"The European Parliament' s resolution demands that this change to the treaties results in a constitution for the EU, that is to say, a decisive step of sorts on the way to a federal state."
"I believe that something essential has been forgotten, namely that the Irish people have made use of their right to reject the Treaty of Nice."
"This right, and this rejection of the treaty by the Irish people, should be respected at the Laeken Summit and a statement made to the effect that the Treaty should be rewritten."
"The message from Ireland is clear: less centralism and supranationalism and more respect for national democracy."
"What we need are treaty changes along the following lines: openness in the Council of Ministers, with the opportunity to monitor decisions by the national parliaments, at the same time as the national parliaments are given the opportunity to propose laws instead of this right' s being located in the Commission bureaucracy."
"This is an important debate and I would like to compliment the Commission on its publication of the White Paper on European Governance."
"In light of recent developments, it is obvious that it is a time for stocktaking but there can be no doubt about the relevance of the European Union to Member States and its citizens."
"In most respects the European Union has lived up to the ideals and aspirations of Europe's founding fathers."
"The achievement of peace alone justifies our existence but we have achieved much more, not least the fact that the ideals enshrined in the Treaty of Rome - of assisting economic and social development of small and under-developed countries - have by and large also been achieved."
"Ireland bears witness to this fact and, despite the outcome of the Nice Treaty, Irish people readily acknowledge the benefits of our membership and also support proposals on enlargement."
"So what has gone wrong?"
"We have failed, in my view, to communicate Europe."
"Citizens do not feel part of the European family."
"Their perceived isolation from the decision-making process has left them frustrated and cold."
"That sense of abandonment has led to the apathy and indifference as demonstrated by the lower turnout in recent European elections and, in Ireland's case, rejection of the Nice Treaty."
"The Commission and Parliament are right about one thing, the EU lacks democratic legitimacy."
"Furthermore, no layman, nor many MEPs, really understand how the whole thing works."
"The White Paper and this report are all part of a hard sell, the idea being to sell the EU concept to our citizens more aggressively so that the people will learn to love it."
"Beneath all of this is the interinstitutional battle and both Mr Prodi and Parliament are desperate to preserve the Community method, fearing there is too much intergovernmentalism about."
"Whoever wins this battle between the institutions will make no difference to ordinary people."
"It is time to put the true intentions of the EU project to the electorate in each Member State."
"Only then will we know whether they want to be a part of it and whether the project can ever work."
"But perhaps after Ireland, Denmark and Switzerland, that may be taking democracy a stage too far for all of you."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen have, once again, presented us with a truly sophisticated report, but I feel that they have dwelled a little too much on methodology."
"It is, of course, better to have a speedboat rather than a rowing boat, as you can go faster in the speedboat, but if you do not know where you are going, you are not at so great an advantage."
"I welcomed the comments made by Mr Poettering, Mr Cox and Mr Voggenhuber, who, for the first time in a long while, focused on the issue of the Commission in their speeches."
"In my view, we are now facing a very serious problem."
"We have a fight on our hands."
"There is a tug of war going on between the Council and Parliament."
"We are increasing our powers of co-decision, but, at the same time, we are in the process of destroying the Commission."
"In doing so, we are introducing further bureaucracy, and I do not think there is any point, Mrs Theorin, in discussing transparency, governance, co-decision and democratic legitimacy, when we cannot even talk about electing the Commission by direct universal suffrage."
"I believe that the balance of our institutions depends on this and that we cannot run our economy along the same lines as the great American model."
"It is the balance of our institutions, the check and balance, the division of powers, and not how to share the cake between the various institutions that our discussions, our debates and the Intergovernmental Conference, as well as the imminent Convention, should focus on."
"I think that this is the only way to fight against further bureaucracy, the only way to once again make our institutions meaningful, the only way to reinvigorate European integration."
"So, as Mr Salafranca said, there are no favourable winds for those who have no clue where they are going, and I think that, first and foremost, the problem that Parliament has is to know and understand in which direction it wants to travel."
"Mr President, President Prodi, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed, by our unanimous adoption of the Kaufmann report, our ability, in the very short time available to us, to act in concert and respond to important reform proposals from the Commission, on which we will be able to take up a position either today or tomorrow, just in time for the European Summit at Laeken."
"Let me just pick out a few points from the Kaufmann report and highlight the following: Mr Prodi, we are delighted to learn that you are sticking with the joint working party proposed in October."
"What matters now is that we get it moving quickly and start collaborating appropriately on the subject matter in hand."
"We, in the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats insist in any case on an early start being made on this work."
"We are glad that the Commission of the European Union has given up developing what would have been, in effect, its own administrative structures right down through the regions, towns and local communities, as we read about, for example, in preliminary drafts of its White Paper."
"It is also our opinion that it is fundamentally unacceptable that the Commission should adopt a method of open coordination, bypassing its co-legislator Parliament, with guidelines sanctioned only by the Council of Ministers and with the Commission using the financial reins of the programmes to set their general course."
"Here, too, the co-legislator needs to be involved."
"We urge you to undertake an in-depth reform of the comitological procedure."
"It is not acceptable that, with the help of the national bureaucracies, Parliament's legislative prerogative should be made null and void by means of implementing provisions whose content, purpose and extent are not laid down in advance."
"We also demand that European agencies be kept to a minimum."
"May we remind you that the Commission and the European Parliament are born allies when it comes to the promotion of European integration and action in the interests of Europe's citizens?"
"The transposition of European legislation requires at every level its own culture of public administration, which must also embrace the application of European rules through the authorities in the Member States."
"There is an urgent need for appropriate instruction and training of civil servants at these levels."
"Thank you, Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, this debate is, in fact, far too early to be able to rate the chances of success of the Laeken Summit realistically, but, Mr President-in-Office, it is already a fact that the Belgian Presidency will be memorable, even if it was only because the attack on New York has put the fight against terrorism and Europe' s role in the world, at the top of the list of priorities."
"For my group, it is vital for the Laeken Summit to spell out once more that we have our own contribution to make, especially in the search for political and diplomatic solutions for international conflicts, with full backing from the UN institutions, and that we also want to reactivate the dialogue with the Arab States."
"The EU' s own role means, inter alia, that Europe refuses to ignore or suspend the principles of the rule of law and human rights in the name of the fight against terrorism, and that Europe insists on justice in the framework of an international court of justice and not in the framework of exceptional courts."
"Mr President-in-Office, I hope that Laeken will drive home this clear message to the United States, among others."
"Nevertheless, the risk remains that this priority could push aside the sixteen other priorities."
"That is why, on behalf of my group, I would like to convey a wish to the Council Presidency."
"We expect the Council Presidency to make an extra effort at the Laeken Summit to clarify that the Lisbon objectives also apply at a time when we face economic decline, when companies are being restructured and unemployment continues to rise."
"It is important for the Laeken Summit to demonstrate to people that Europe is not just about the introduction of the euro. It is also about economic growth, employment, the future of pensions and the fight against social exclusion."
"Mr President-in-Office, Laeken' s pièce de résistance will undoubtedly be the declaration about the future of Europe."
"This declaration is still one of the Prime Minister' s personal projects with which he, in the capacity of President-in-Office of the Council, is doing the rounds of the capital cities."
"As the draft document is still a well kept secret for this Parliament too, we are having to make our contribution to the declaration without, in fact, any knowledge of the content of this document."
"I find this regrettable."
"That is why I should like to pass on a few suggestions which are extremely important to us in the framework of the declaration on the future of the European Union."
"First of all, we must avoid a situation where the Laeken Declaration sets up scenarios whereby the competences of the European Union are cast in stone, thus not allowing Europe any room for manoeuvre where this is not explicitly provided for in the Treaty, or a scenario in which use is made of lists of competences."
"Mr President-in-Office, such scenarios certainly do not meet the expectations of the citizens."
"Secondly, there is the risk, if I can believe the lobbies, that Europe' s voice will be somewhat drowned out by that of the delegations of the Member States."
"We trust that Laeken will launch a balanced Convention and that, furthermore, the participation of women will be guaranteed."
"Thirdly, Mr President-in-Office, I was taken by surprise a moment ago when I heard you say - and I hope I did not misunderstand you - that ""l'idée d'une assemblée parallèle au forum de la société civile a été écartée"" ."
"This is very bad news, for it is obvious to me that the debate on the future of Europe is already being compromised if the civil society is not accorded a clear status, if a structured platform for a dialogue with the civil organisations is not really being created and if all that remains is a virtual computer debate with no room for real participation."
"I hope that this can still be rectified in Laeken, but I would nevertheless wish the Council Presidency every success at this stage."
"Mr President, you said that openness, efficiency and bringing the EU closer to the people were to be important issues at Laeken."
"I could not agree with you more about that."
"Following the not entirely successful compromise in Nice, the Irish referendum and, according to many opinion polls, growing scepticism towards the EU project in quite a few Member States, there are high expectations of the Laeken Summit, with changes to the EU anticipated."
"The EU must become more intelligible and citizen-friendly."
"A clear constitution is needed, explaining how the EU is governed and who does what."
"The EU must cut back on the work it does and concentrate on the cross-border problems."
"I do not believe people want the EU to do more in all areas. Instead, they want it to deliver the goods in those areas it has made its own, taking decisions openly."
"It is completely unacceptable for it to legislate behind the closed doors of the Council of Ministers."
"If it is to be possible to simultaneously enlarge and deepen the EU, we must involve people and win back their trust."
"That is not something we can do through fine declarations and constitutional exercises of an academic nature, but through genuine reforms and political courage."
"I hope the rest of the European Council is as courageous as the Belgian Presidency."
"Mr President, I would just like to reiterate what the rapporteur, Mr Méndez de Vigo, said just now."
"There is no sense in setting up a Convention and then doing our level best to stop it succeeding."
"What do we mean by 'succeeding' ?"
"Success means achieving substantial progress towards a stronger, more integrated Union, which will inevitably involve reducing the role and powers of each State, that is the problem, Mr Michel, and increasing the role and powers of the common institutions."
"This is your responsibility now as European Council, and this is the decision you must make: to reduce your powers."
"At Nice, you failed precisely because the intergovernmental method is an obstacle in itself, in that it favours those who are lagging behind and forces everyone to conform to their slow pace."
"The President-in-Office, Mr Michel, and President Prodi have been through some really tough times in recent months, times when the lack of joint instruments was starkly and sometimes cruelly clear."
"I feel that the Convention, a genuine Convention, should be an embryonic constituent assembly, and that it is the only thing that can make the future of the European Union brighter than the confusion which reigns at present."
"Mr President, with regard to the European strategy to promote quality in employment and in social policy, announcing and adopting plans is not enough: quality employment with rights must be created and tangible objectives must be set to ensure that all social rights are respected."
"Creating jobs is not enough: they must not be precarious, employees must be able to live with dignity and must be paid on time, unlike the current situation in Portugal, which, despite the low official rate of unemployment, still has the lowest salaries in the European Union, and where job insecurity is growing worse, the number of companies that are behind in paying their employees is increasing and it is becoming more and more difficult to develop areas that are reaching crisis point."
"A policy seeking to achieve quality in social terms calls for priority to be given to employment with rights, with particular emphasis on women and young people, including their training, but also on pay and contracts, and special attention must also be given to the elderly and to pensions, especially minimum pensions, which means that the European Union cannot continue to insist on giving absolute priority to the monetary policies of the Stability Pact, as it is still doing."
"Mr President, in our view, the draft declaration that the Laeken Council is due to publish to shape the debate on the future of the Union seems to have been drafted under some very odd circumstances."
"According to press reports, the Belgian Presidency says that it deliberately did not release the document to its partners too early, so that they would not have the time to rewrite the text."
"This is not a very co-operative way of working and this is what leads us to warn the members of the Council: do not forget that you are representing countries and national democracies, which should have a free hand in these negotiations."
"The ideal scenario would be to initially establish an interparliamentary forum consisting of representatives of the national parliaments or which works on the basis of proposals from the national parliaments, as the latter are well placed to sum up the feelings of each nation."
"In any case, I would say to the Heads of State and Government, do not allow a mechanism to be imposed upon you that would lead to proposals being made that are out of touch with the interests and preferences of our people."
"This is a point that I will explain in greater depth in my explanation of vote on the resolution that will be tabled."
"Mr President, many Christian-Democrats have played a leading role at each stage of the development of the European Union, and even now we want to make a joint effort in order to turn Europe into a lasting success story."
"The Nice Summit, which was supposed to be the summit of truth, cannot really be described as a run-away success, certainly not in terms of its intention to properly prepare the Union' s institutions for enlargement."
"The Heads of State and Government will now hopefully realise that they can no longer afford any half-hearted or premature conclusions at Laeken."
"The report by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo indicates very clearly what decisions are crucial to secure a bright future for the Union."
"We back this report and I should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteurs warmly on their work."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, your work is not complete, and neither is the term of your Presidency."
"It would therefore be premature to draw up an assessment of your Presidency at this stage, but pending the Laeken Summit, I should still like to say the following. We have noted, and this is also evident from opinion polls, that European citizens have given up."
"They are not really turning against Europe, but they no longer feel involved."
"Therefore, more attention should be devoted to issues such as: more information, more public debate, more openness towards the NGOs, making it clear that the Union' s objectives do have a bearing on every single person and that the Union shows equal respect for every human being."
"In this connection, I would call on you as Head of Government of a small country not to allow yourself to be pushed into a corner again, as was the case in Ghent and in London, in fact."
"People cannot understand this and accept this even less."
"I would also urge you to continue to guarantee the same respect for all languages and their users."
"I would therefore urge you to discontinue your planned intentions concerning the use of language in the bureaus for the protection of industrial right of ownership."
"People do not understand this, neither do they want or accept this."
"They do not want a second-rate language, and neither do they want to be treated like second-class citizens."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will just mention five points in the short time available to me."
"Firstly, I welcome the Convention."
"It is not a constituent assembly but it is all we could realistically achieve."
"Secondly, we need to be careful not to undervalue or trivialise the term 'European Constitution' , and the members of the Convention need to be courageous and innovative in their role."
"Thirdly, federalism must not be a matter just for the States and the European Union, with the basic regional and local levels and linguistic and national minorities being excluded."
"Fourthly, with regard to the method, Commissioner Barnier is right to talk about 'maximum consensus' . We are not aiming at unanimity on the reforms."
"Fifthly and lastly: the timetable."
"We must beware of excessively long delays between the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference supposed to adopt the European Constitution, for it is an unfortunate fact that enthusiasm for reforms wanes fast."
"Mr President, Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo's model of a Convention sets out an accessible and also, I hope, successful way ahead into Europe's future."
"I also agree with your desire, in response to statement 23, for an enlarged agenda which, however, the Convention should set for itself."
"Even such an enlarged agenda, though, offers little hope of achieving the desired result, namely a single basis for decision-making."
"I am far more inclined to think that the possibility suggests itself of submitting to the Council various options which could also take account of the different positions."
"I know that on one point I stand quite alone, although I am in the right."
"I wish to reiterate my warning against setting an earlier date for the Intergovernmental Conference planned for Nice in 2004, because I am firmly convinced that the people would see it as an evasion of their vote."
"If, as all sides in the House maintain, we really are striving for an open debate which is accessible to the public, then nothing could be better suited to that than to include the themes in the next European elections."
"Mr President, the Belgian Presidency has played a major role in completing some of the groundwork for the Union' s enlargement."
"One is indeed struck by the optimism which is taking possession of those involved: the naming of the date 2004 suggests that the work is nearly finished."
"There is even talk of a big bang of ten countries acceding simultaneously."
"Commissioner Verheugen is sensible enough to state that it is possible that up to ten new countries will join in 2004."
"After all, it is not up to us to determine an accession date for the candidate countries."
"The year 2004 is an assumption and a hope, but holds no guarantees for any Member State whatsoever."
"We, and they, should therefore continue to make every effort to achieve a sound and credible result."
"A great deal needs to be done within the current Union in order to clarify the significance of enlargement."
"Naturally, many are right to be truly enthusiastic about this fantastic, historic process."
"But under the influence of those who believe they can secure political gain from xenophobic sentiments, a climate of uncertainty has emerged."
"False representations of the costs involved in the enlargement are doing the rounds."
"They are designed to instil fear and are based on worst-case scenarios: as if it has not been clear for a very long time that the cost of this whole enlargement process would be covered by the EU budget."
"Far more important is greater awareness of the need for anchoring more firmly the character of the Union as a union of democratic constitutional states."
"The events of 11 September have illustrated this more clearly than ever."
"The fight against serious crime and terrorism is a common cause, and reticence in this connection will jeopardise the safety of citizens."
"It is actually very strange that our union of constitutional states, as such, has not resulted in greater trust among the Member States and their legal systems."
"A great deal will need to be done about this in the coming years."
"May I offer my congratulations to the co-rapporteurs for an excellent report and also to the Belgian Presidency for having carried the idea, born in Parliament, of preparing the next Intergovernmental Conference by means of a Convention nearly to fruition, although we still have the Laeken Summit to come."
"This is a dramatic improvement on the preparations of previous Intergovernmental Conferences."
"Instead of the usual group of foreign ministry officials meeting together behind closed doors we will have a publicly representative body taking ideas from a wide public debate and coming up with a coherent set of proposals for reform."
"This is a tremendous opportunity but does not guarantee results and it is for us to make something of it."
"We will do so if we avoid divisions on the theology or vocabulary of European integration where we are sometimes divided on the word even though we are united on the substance."
"Let me give a couple of examples: in some political parties and countries the word ""federalism"" is mistakenly equated with centralism and they talk of creating a centralised super-state in the way that Mr Farage spoke earlier."
"That is not what anybody wants and if you define federalism as different levels of governance, as decentralised as possible but centralised where necessary with each level democratically structured, then we already have the beginnings of a federal-type system and I am happy, under that definition, to proclaim myself a federalist."
"In some countries the word ""constitution"" is an almost sacred text that has emerged after revolution or after national independence."
"In other countries such as the United Kingdom it is a more pragmatic concept."
"In that pragmatic sense we already have a European constitution, not a very good one, but we have it and we should improve it further."
"The constitution is the Treaties which lay down the field of competence of the EU, the powers of the institutions, the legislative and the budgetary procedures."
"Let us recognise that de facto they form our constitution."
"Let us improve our constitution by firstly codifying it to make it simple and clear in a single text so that citizens can see how this constitution operates, and secondly by clarifying it in several ways: clarifying the responsibilities, what the Union is and is not responsible for and clarifying the structures."
"Let me give one example of confusion that we have now."
"The functions of Mr Solana and Mr Patten should be merged into a single individual to represent the Union externally, perhaps with a special status as a specially appointed Vice-President of the Commission."
"Finally, as regards clarity and democratic accountability: it is essential that all legislation passes the two tests of acceptability to the Council representing the States and acceptability to Parliament representing the citizens, a double guarantee as to the quality and acceptability of European legislation."
"I said this is an opportunity, but it is not a guarantee."
"We must fight to make the necessary changes come about through the Convention."
"Mr President, in the opinion of the Liberal Group the Convention must suggest alternative prototypes for the development of the EU."
"One of these alternatives is the trend (currently underway) towards a federal state."
"The supranational Commission would be developed into a federal government, exercising executive power and directing the Union's legislation; this would operate subject to the confidence of the supranational European Parliament."
"The Council of Ministers would be developed as the Parliament's second chamber."
"Along with this federal model, we must consider a structure which will be built upon the principles of an association of states."
"Here, the leading body would be a reformed Council of Ministers made up of representatives of the Member States."
"Since the Council would hold the right of initiative, it would not be able to operate in its present manner as a legislative chamber representing the Member States."
"In this case, alongside the supranational Parliament there would be a second chamber formed in order to strengthen the position of the Member States, which would be composed of members of the national parliaments."
"This type of decentralised association of states is, in my opinion, better suited to an expanding European Union than a centralised federal model."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to start by congratulating the two rapporteurs, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mr Leinen, for their sterling work and the manner in which they have conducted themselves, for want of a better word, from start to finish in order to include as many ideas and views of the Members of the European Parliament in their reports as possible."
"Obviously, there are as many excellent and interesting ideas, visions and proposals for the future of Europe as there are responses to the challenges facing the European Union."
"However, not one idea, vision or proposal can be implemented or can bring in results unless the right method is used to put flesh on the bones of these visions and proposals."
"And the right method is none other than a convention, a body which needs to reflect accurately all the current political forces in Europe."
"The work of this convention, which we believe should be the subject of the fullest democratic dialogue, should result in a proposal which is a synthesis and product of all the views formulated at it."
"Only thus will the foundations on which the Europe of the future is built be more representative, more democratic and, hence, more efficient, not to mention permanent and equitable."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, I know that you are in a hurry and must go, but I would like to thank you very much for keeping the promise you made to Members of this House, to bring nothing to Laeken on which a decision had already been made, and for being so determined that there should be an interinstitutional working party."
"Such cooperation with Parliament is quite exemplary, and I wish to thank you most warmly for it."
"I would, though, also like to extend my warm thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Leinen, Mr Méndez de Vigo and Mrs Kaufmann for having focussed their excellent reports so well on the vital importance to us of making Europe's decision-making structures more democratic and more efficient and for pointing out that there must be no contradiction in this, much as that might have appeared to be the case here and there, with elements of democracy having to be sacrificed for efficiency's sake."
"Both as regards the Convention and legislation, what matters to us is that we, as the people's directly elected Members of Parliament, are convinced, not that we can do everything, which would be quite false, but that we should have control of the decision-making process."
"Mr President of the Commission, some small differences may well still be there."
"We want this 'call back position' only in the event of a delegated decision-making structure being incapable or coming to the wrong decisions - wrong, that is, in the sense of being contrary to what the legislature intended."
"It would be better, and is always good, for others to reach decisions along the lines that we have indicated in our fundamental decisions and political approach."
"I hope, firstly, that the Council is now willing to set up this interinstitutional working party soon, and, secondly, that we will be able, taking the Mandelkern and Kaufmann reports and the Commission's Final Conclusions as our basis, to conclude the Agreement as early as June next year, or, at least, that the Council will be able, next June, to agree that the three institutions have found a way to take Europe into a future which will be more highly developed and marked both by democracy and efficiency."
"Mr President, the issue of European governance is such a complex problem, and one that our fellow citizens have difficulty in understanding, which is, in itself, a paradox."
"We all know that Europe is suffering from a serious democratic deficit, and that is why there is obviously a need to radically reform the way in which powers are exercised at European level."
"We must do so and bear in mind three objectives, namely to clarify the decision-making process, to improve the efficiency and transparency of this process, and to encourage the involvement of citizens."
"That is why I support the guidelines contained in the White Paper and the Kaufmann report."
"We must, of course, ensure there is greater transparency in the Council' s work, we must encourage the European Parliament and the national parliaments to play a greater role in the legislative process. We must simplify Community legislation and make it possible to undertake genuine consultation with civil society."
"Furthermore, I think it is worthwhile, as the Committee on Constitutional Affairs stressed, to draw up an inter-institutional agreement on co-legislation, to guarantee that the European Parliament plays an effective role and fulfils its political responsibility."
"The reform of governance is therefore a step in the right direction."
"However, it will obviously not be a substitute for the radical reform that our institutions need so badly."
"We must provide ourselves, as soon as possible, with a simple and understandable constitution, clearly defining the division of competences, clarifying everyone' s role so that citizens finally understand who does what, and so that they can know who is responsible."
"Lastly, as everyone in this House knows, we cannot have democratic power without democratic legitimacy."
"That is why the President of the European executive must one day, and one day soon, I hope, be elected by universal suffrage."
"Mr President, the Laeken Summit will be a major but difficult summit, particularly because of the importance of the subjects that will be debated."
"In this brief speech, I would just like to focus on the institutional elements of the summit."
"The Convention must concentrate on instigating a new phase which will produce a Constitution leading to the creation of a federation of nation States, but it must also establish the competences of the various institutions: the Commission, the Council, the Member States, the regions and the major cities."
"These are decisions which will have to be made under the banner of solidarity and subsidiarity, two values which must inspire our new Constitution."
"The Laeken Council will also have to discuss the timetable for this progression towards the new institutions."
"Indeed, we must ensure that decisions which are fundamental for the future of the Union are not taken at the time of the electoral campaign."
"That is why we feel it would be appropriate to initiate the Intergovernmental Conference earlier than planned, during the Italian Presidency in the second half of 2003."
"Clearly, the people must be involved in the process of creating a Constitution through the votes of the parliaments - for example, we would have preferred Parliament to have been given the opportunity to debate and amend the Nice Charter for there are parts of it, particularly those regarding the individual, which are wholly unconvincing - especially regarding the European Parliament, for without the involvement of the citizens and their representatives we will not be able to transform the Europe of the euro into a political Europe which can enlarge its borders in the future, maybe even as far as the Yurals: in other words, a great Europe which will bring a long, lasting period of peace."
"Mr President, I am going to concentrate on the legal issues, which are what is most worrying right now when it comes to the structural aspects of the EU."
"The Council is in danger of infringing Articles 8 and 10 of the European Council Convention, together with Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, freedom of expression, respect for private life and the protection of personal data."
"That is something people cannot do much about."
"Because there is no balance of power in the legal area, the terrorist legislation, which is entirely necessary, is in danger of undermining democracy in the long term."
"The intergovernmental model is out of date."
"The European Parliament must become a co-legislator and the EU' s Court of Justice be given full powers."
"The Council cannot be turned into a so-called state within a state."
"On 11 September, the EU' s structure in terms of pillars ceased to be at all effective."
"External and internal security issues became ever more closely connected."
"Vigorous measures to combat terrorism and serious crime are now required."
"These must nonetheless go hand in hand with increased public control and legal protection, especially when it comes to what are known as the principles of due process, such as, no punishment without law, proportionality, the presumption of innocence and the right to a defence and to be tried before an impartial court."
"These rights must become unconditional at EU level."
"The Laeken Summit must signal the start of openness and democracy, which are prerequisites for successful enlargement."
"They require a convention on a mainly parliamentary basis, obviously with a substantial number of members from the EU institution closest to the people."
"The Convention should be able to work towards producing a proposal, so that people in future know what it is they are to adopt a position on."
"Anyone who wants to develop the EU and make it better and larger should support the thinking that is being done in terms of devising a constitution which is characterised by an effective division of power and which, it is to be hoped, will develop out of today' s excellent reports."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is no democracy without a Parliament."
"Today again we find that the European Parliament is the principal integrating element in the European Union."
"Nowhere else do Council, Commission and Parliament engage in public discussion, not always achieving unanimity, but openly, and, I hope, constructively."
"Our three rapporteurs have presented excellent reports."
"This Parliament has, since Nice, been pressing forward with a Community process which must burst forth in Laeken."
"I share President Prodi's concern that the European Union is not yet adequately equipped to cope with enlargement, and so I ask the President-in-Office of the Council to check again, and check carefully, whether what was decided in Nice really does enhance the working capacity of the Council and of Parliament."
"I doubt it."
"The European Community and European Union have developed splendidly over the past nearly fifty years to date, and I hope that the next fifty years will be prepared for in such a way that we can work even better in the European Union over the next fifty years."
"Mr President, the forthcoming summit in Laeken will be an extremely important meeting."
"At this summit, the agenda will need to be drawn up for the Convention which has to submit the reform proposals for the European institutions. And everyone knows how important agendas are for the outcome of consultations."
"We are happy with the planned make-up of the Convention, except that I should like to add that it is important to strike a political balance."
"This will mainly be the responsibility of the national parliaments."
"Furthermore, I am also of the opinion that the chairman of the Convention should be elected by the Convention itself."
"With regard to the agenda for the IGC of 2003-2004, the Council has naturally included the four points of Declaration 23 appended to the Treaty of Nice."
"I should like to briefly comment on these four points."
"As far as the demarcation of powers is concerned, we are in favour of a more federal structure of the European Union, with a clear distribution of tasks among the Union, the Member States and regions."
"Concerning the structure of the future treaties, we endorse a basic treaty with a constitutional character which must also include the Charter."
"In respect of the role of the national parliaments, we believe that they must primarily encourage and monitor their own ministers in the supervision of the implementation of European policy."
"Are there any more topics for the Convention?"
"Yes, I should like to outline five."
"The common foreign and security policy must be included in the Community Pillar."
"The policy in the field of police, justice and criminal law must also fall within the remit of the Community, with a European public prosecution office, a public prosecutor and a Community Europol."
"The European Parliament must be granted full legislative and budgetary powers."
"The President of the European Commission must be elected by the European Parliament and the European Council of Ministers must meet in public when they discuss legal matters."
"I am pleased that Mr Prodi has said this now, and I am very interested to see if Mr Michel shares this view."
"These are the topics which mainly centre around transparency and the Union' s democratic content and which, as far as I am concerned, should be added to the Convention' s agenda, thus affording the Union a more stable foundation which meets the requirements of a modern constitutional state when the new Member States accede."
"Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my opinion, the most important aspect of the Laeken Summit is the following: that the Council is able to reverse the trend seen in Nice, that is to say, that we move away from this feeling of failure at the summit that marked the end of the French Presidency a year or so ago, towards a feeling of success at the Laeken summit at political level and for Europe' s citizens."
"I think that this is what the excellent Leinen and Méndez de Vigo report is calling for."
"In addition to the details, the concrete proposals, which are, of course, important, the essential thing is to develop a new perspective at Laeken, a constitutional perspective, and this means, without any doubt and as I said before, reversing the current trend."
"The method for the forthcoming reform is of fundamental importance."
"As is the Convention."
"But neither must we let the Convention develop into some kind of tedious rigmarole, and in order for this not to be the case, the Convention should be called in order to prepare reform with true content and a real agenda."
"If the agenda for the forthcoming reform remains restricted to Declaration 23 annexed to the Treaty of Nice, we will not be getting off to the right start, and the report that this House will, probably, approve tomorrow, calls for more than this."
"It calls for a more wide-ranging agenda."
"Above all, it calls for an agenda that, once again, includes the policies of the Union and the institutions that are intended to manage these policies."
"It also calls for the Union to have its own legal personality."
"It is for this agenda, and so as not to distract public opinion, that the Convention has to be called."
"The Convention needs an agenda, but it also needs a mandate, a membership, a working method and a timetable to make it worthwhile."
"I would like to highlight the words of Mr Méndez de Vigo: it would be incredible to keep the same number of representatives of the European Parliament as in the Convention that had the task of drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights, when the total number of participants in the next Convention will increase significantly."
"This imbalance would, of course, be unacceptable."
"Secondly, the Convention should work not on the basis of unanimity, but on the basis of majority consensus."
"I think that this is the exact definition."
"It should have the right to decide who to choose as President and the right to finish its work on time."
"This is important in order to ensure that the conclusions of the Convention are not put on ice, because although time, heals all, it also makes us forget."
"This is the commitment that we ask of Laeken: an ambitious reform with a different method of achieving more Europe and a better Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I initially wanted to respond to the points made by each speaker, but unfortunately, I do not think that I will have time to go into details."
"I shall, however, try to answer as accurately as I can."
"First of all, I would like to give my very sincere thanks to the European Parliament and to the majority of the speakers for the quality of their comments, and for the overwhelming European voluntarism that I have heard in this House."
"I must say that I do not always hear the same voluntarism in the other European institutions where I work."
"I have therefore found a great deal of optimism here, which I was not expecting."
"The ambitious goals that you are setting for European integration are very much in line with the ideas and the ambitions that I share, that we share."
"So, with only a few days to go before Laeken, it is most certainly a welcome commitment, one that I heard voiced by almost all Members."
"One of the speakers said that the Laeken Summit would be a difficult exercise."
"I am sure that it will be, because the EU candidate countries, particularly during the debate on the future of Europe, will be faced with a number of choices which are virtually breaking points, and which are so important for the future of Europe that some of us will just have to demonstrate a virtue that is extremely difficult in politics, in other words, that of the ability to make sacrifices."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to focus briefly on the Convention, and I would first of all like to explain to you what the Convention is not."
"I may thus be able to reassure those of you who already see a thousand and one reasons in the Convention for sacrificing some things that they have always believed in, and which are, in fact, crippling Europe."
"The Convention is not and no one has ever thought that it was the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Convention cannot, and I think that it was Mr Méndez de Vigo who said this, act as an alibi either."
"To my mind, it should, first and foremost, be a worthwhile sounding board."
"I could also put that another way."
"It can also be a challenge upon the political responsibility of the IGC members, who will have to take up this challenge, because the Convention will, at any rate, make all Council members face their political responsibility."
"Let us imagine, for example, that the Convention is proposing three or four options on a specific subject related to an issue that is fundamental for the future of Europe. One of these options receives unanimous support or consensus, another receives the support of 80% of Members, and the third is given 50-50."
"We are well aware that the Intergovernmental Conference is not going to be forced to choose between these options and that it could very well decide to choose another option, to come up with something else, to give these options a different response to the one that the Convention would have given."
"In this case, all IGC members, when shouldering their responsibilities, when adopting one option or another, or when selecting from the options which are presented by the Convention, will, at the same time, risk being at odds, not only with the Convention, but with civil society which must, at some point, make known its intentions, its expectations and its aspirations for this Convention."
"Therefore, do not underestimate the Convention due to the fact that it is not a decision-making body; do not underestimate its political weight or its political force."
"I make no secret of the fact that I have several reservations as to the composition, even though I do not believe that we should no longer consider the request to increase the number of MEPs."
"I think that this is quite a legitimate question, even if I must reiterate that, in our proposal, we took up the proportions that were used in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The difference compared to the Charter is that we agreed the candidate countries would take part."
"We must take this difference into account."
"I shall reiterate that, at the Ghent European Council, we received requests that ran counter to the requests made by the European Parliament."
"Several countries demanded an increase in the number of members from the national parliaments, perhaps so that the ruling coalition could have better representation, perhaps to take into account sub-national entities or perhaps because of the bi-cameral system."
"Essentially, it is quality, rather than quantity, that counts, and I think that the MEPs will always have an advantage because of the fact that they are in control of this dossier and of procedures."
"I would still like to add a brief comment regarding the composition, namely that it would be regrettable if latent rivalries between political groups or specific components rise to the surface."
"I think that the debate must be open; we must not consider ourselves according to the grouping to which we belong."
"I think we must consider ourselves on our intellectual strength, our intellectual objectivity, on our intellectual, philosophical, cultural and political freedom of thought."
"This must be done in an objective manner and I am sure that we are all capable of doing this."
"Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I am willing to see whether an increase in the European Parliament' s representation will cause too many difficulties, such as, for example, too many Members taking part in the Convention, and whether we will encounter similar requests."
"This could mean that the number of representatives might prevent the Convention from working smoothly."
"In my opening remarks, I gave my thoughts on the outcome of the Convention and how worthwhile it is. I think that our work is moving in the direction proposed by Parliament."
"We use the consensus method where possible, and have the possibility, where necessary, of presenting options in preferential order, for example."
"However, we must avoid imposing the consensus method from the outset, because I think that this would weaken the Convention, which would then only be adopted by the smallest common denominator."
"The possibility for the Convention to present various options must enable us to hold a debate with conflicting views."
"I would like to go over the various questions that were put to me concerning enlargement."
"I would like to respond to the speakers who are not sceptical, but who are obviously concerned."
"Everyone says that they are in favour of enlargement; everyone says that it is an important political and historical step."
"At the same time, however, a number of people seem to put forward arguments as if they have not heard what has been said, to express their reservations over enlargement."
"I would like to make something clear. We have always said that we would, first of all, try to keep up the pace of negotiations with the exceptionally rapid pace set by the Swedish Presidency, and that, secondly, we would do this by judging every country on its own merits."
"The fact that we can today give a particularly positive progress report on the negotiations does not mean, of course, as some speakers have suggested, that we are being almost politically negligent and would be willing to accept 10 countries before 2004 without any further verification, further judgment or criteria."
"Of course we would not, and therefore we continue to say, with regard to enlargement, that yes, it is irreversible, but also, yes, each country must be judged on its own merits."
"These are my comments on enlargement."
"I think that Mr Barón Crespo mentioned the presidium and wanted the forthcoming presidencies to be a part of that."
"I am not against this at all, but we must keep a sense of balance."
"A compromise might be for the next presidencies to take part as observers."
"The Convention can take up any issue, including European security and defence policy."
"As we know, these are the four themes from Nice relating to the Convention. However, as soon as you say that the Convention was not an Intergovernmental Conference, and was not going to take certain decisions, and I do not really understand why, some people appear to want to limit the scope of the Nice themes at all costs."
"If, having considered every aspect of the themes from Nice, other issues are tackled, it would be quite worrying for an exercise, which will widely involve civil society in the debate, to say 'you are going to be restricted to very specific topics and you can only discuss the issues that we want you to discuss."
"That is a bit mean."
"Instead, we are in favour of a more optimistic view, where the four themes from Nice are more widely interpreted."
"I hope that I can count on the European Parliament, at least the more optimistic of its Members, to help us to convince others of this point of view and of this direction."
"With regard to Mr Cox' s comments, I share the point of view that Mr Poettering also expressed, that the Commission must remain at the centre of the Community system."
"The question of timing is also important."
"There are a number of constraints and there are many elections."
"I believe that the time period between the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference must be six months."
"If it is any longer, I feel that we will be in danger of undoing all the good work of the Convention and the debates, and the worst scenario would be for everyone to arrive at the IGC having forgotten the options in the meantime, or for some to have had the time to pretend they have forgotten them, or having completely stripped the options of all substance. Thus, all the worthwhile work of the Convention will also have been for nothing."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is largely what I wanted to say."
"I have almost certainly forgotten to say something, but it is time now to answer the last speaker, who asked me if I was in favour of transparency in the Council' s work."
"Of course, I am in favour of transparency in the Council' s work."
"Unfortunately, I have many more reservations about carrying out a public relations exercise that would weaken the quality of debate within the Council."
"Mrs Maij-Weggen, I am a seasoned parliamentarian, having spent more than 20 years in Parliament."
"I was also head of opposition in my country for a long time, too long for my liking."
"Even in Parliament, if we really want to take the general interests of our citizens into account on specific subjects and specific dossiers, it is sometimes better to hold the debate behind closed doors, and not only when naming names or individuals."
"I think that it would be unwise to turn essential debates on extremely delicate issues into media fodder, debates where 15 Heads of State or Government are trying to reach agreement."
"I am not totally against holding public debates on a number of issues, but if all the Council formations had to be organised and carried out publicly, I am not sure that that would yield the results that you want, and that I want as well."
"Therefore, I say yes to transparency, but I have much greater reservations as to propaganda."
"There were two suggestions as to how to involve civil society in the work of this Convention."
"The first suggestion was to create a second forum, a second institution and a second assembly."
"The major difficulty in doing this is to determine how to select the members of this second assembly, which would bear the huge responsibility of representing European civil society as a whole."
"It is extremely difficult to select who is the best spokesperson for a specific subject."
"We would have therefore created a competing institution, existing beside the Convention, made up of representatives of the institutions."
"This was one choice, this was the first suggestion."
"The second suggestion that we considered was to work with what I will call a structured network whose origins are found in civil society."
"We must ensure that this structured network is not at all limiting, ensure that all those involved, all those representing one aspect of public opinion can submit their thoughts, their expectations, their criticisms, their proposals to the Convention, and that the Convention can, if necessary, call upon them to interview them. In other words, this approach is a dynamic exchange of views between the Convention and everyone in European society, be it the academic world, schools, NGOs, or associations."
"It is important to give everyone the channels through which they can express their views."
"We have chosen a structured network, on the understanding that everything produced will be included in the Convention' s official documentation, and that all those who contact the Convention will receive an answer, not just an acknowledgement."
"I think that the most representative forces of our society will emerge in time."
"I am clarifying this so that there are no misunderstandings."
"Thank you, Mr Michel."
"It is gratifying to hear that you are convinced of the good will of this Parliament, but you will understand that we, and hence the European citizens, also stand to win or lose the most from the success of this Convention."
"I will now give the floor to Commissioner Barnier."
"Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission I too would like to thank you for the weight and quality of the speeches you have made throughout this debate on the two major subjects on the agenda: governance and Laeken."
"Please excuse President Prodi, who had to leave us a few moments ago for an essential engagement with the Economic and Social Committee."
"With regard to governance, allow me to highlight the very first words of Mrs Kaufmann, who, like Mr Prodi, I would like to thank most sincerely for her availability and for the quality of the work that she has done on your behalf on this both important and difficult subject."
"You put it very well, Mrs Kaufmann: the debate on governance is part of the great debate on the future of the Union."
"It is not only our reason for being, our raison d' être, that is in question, and I will come back to that in a moment, it is also our way of being, our way of acting."
"The Commission, particularly in the White Paper on governance, is going to promote the co-legislation function of the European Parliament."
"Through this White Paper, we are offering Parliament the opportunity to be in a better situation to exert its prerogatives, including better checking of the quality of the choice of legislative instruments, better monitoring of the quality of the use of expertise - is it pluralist? - and the quality of the use of consultation - is it fair?"
"To be quite frank, there remains a point of debate between us which Mr Swoboda stressed in his speech just now, you pointed it out: we are not convinced of the benefits of a mechanism that would allow legislative acts to be suspended at any time, this famous call-back mechanism, when the Commission' s responsibility in the current comitological framework is not itself certain."
"We proposed looking, together with Parliament and the Council, at other mechanisms that will allow, the European Parliament to exert its responsibility for monitoring in a proportional, that is to say, a balanced manner in the matters currently covered by codecision."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, beyond that point of debate on which we need to do more work together, I would like to say that we consider the debate that you have just had on the whole subject of governance to be the means of forging ahead after today' s sitting."
"I would also like to say a few words about the Laeken Summit, on which we, like President Prodi, have worked very hard."
"We still have a great deal of work to do on Laeken and on the situation post-Laeken."
"But I, too, must praise the quality of the work of your two rapporteurs, Mrs Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo, as I have already done before the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"One of you, with their usual frankness, had very harsh words to say about the Commission, which is at the heart of the Community model and method, and which intends to remain at the heart with the threefold role of proposing, monitoring and implementing which was conferred on it by the Treaties."
"With the reunification of the European continent, as the disparities increase and the centrifugal forces become more numerous, that role of the Commission, at the heart of the Community model, is going to become even more necessary than it has been in the past 50 years."
"Mr Voggenhuber accused the Commission of having no vision."
"I do not think that he is here to listen to my reply, but I am nevertheless going to give it."
"Everyone is free to interpret the word 'vision' as they choose."
"Personally, I tend rather to practise the pessimism of reason and the optimism of will, and the reason I quote this fine phrase from Jean Monnet is just to echo what Mr Michel was saying just now, as he confessed that, in a way, he had come here to find some optimism therapy that was not forthcoming elsewhere."
"So I just wanted to refer you to that fine phrase from Jean Monnet."
"With regard to political will, which has been a common feature of many of your speeches, President Prodi announced four strategic objectives in this House."
"We want to pursue them, and he will have the opportunity in his State-of-the-Union speech to the plenary on 11 December to prove that he is serious about them."
"What would Parliament have said if, even before the start of the Convention for which we fought together, the Commission had produced its final vision of our Constitutional Treaty or of our Constitution, ignoring or pre-empting the democratic debate that is going to take place, for the first time, on such broad subjects."
"I am well aware of this, and I say so under the supervision of my colleague and friend, Mr Vitorino, who worked a great deal with you on the previous Convention on fundamental rights: here we are dealing with subjects that are more politically open and probably more problematic."
"The debate needs to take place."
"We are going to take part in it but there was no question of us pre-empting it or acting as though it did not count."
"Let us not underestimate the approach of governance and the White Paper."
"The intensity of your debate, today, proves that they are not trivial matters."
"Before concluding, as I promised to be brief on the issue of the Laeken Convention and especially on the situation post-Laeken, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Michel, in particular, for the political will and courage that they have shown and which they are going to have to show in the few remaining days before Laeken in order to convince the Member States that the draft declaration on which they have worked and which they are proposing to the Member States will be well respected and not diminished."
"I, too, heard Mr Michel using familiar words just now."
"I feel that, taking into account the Convention and the fact this is the first occasion on which an institutional debate has had to allow time to accommodate the work of a Convention, we do have enough time: two years, and we have an open method which, as it concerns a reform of the Treaty on the institutions themselves, consists of more than just dialogue between the government ministers in the secrecy and comfort of the intergovernmental method alone, of which we have all seen the limitations, both at Amsterdam and at Nice."
"Let us use this opportunity and make this Convention serve its purpose as a tool for projecting ideas upwards, to the institutions, to the governments who will ultimately have to decide, and to the people that you represent."
"This Convention, let us say it again so that it is clear, will not take any decision."
"And once that point has been made quite clear, we need to agree, and I was very pleased to hear Mr Michel' s words on this point, not to be overcautious or too closed in our reading of the four Nice points."
"On the contrary, we need to look at them openly and constructively, to take the four points together and deal with them ambitiously."
"It is clear that this leads to a Constitutional process."
"Let us not be afraid of words."
"And let us be ambitious as we look at these four points, particularly the point on the use of powers, good tools for exercising current powers and the clarification of competences, which, of course, leads us to ask questions about the European plan."
"What do we want to do together?"
"Do we want to stay where we are?"
"Do some want to go backwards and unravel the acquis communautaire?"
"Do we want to go further in integration, in the general interest of the citizens, on the third pillar, on foreign policy, on defence?"
"These are the demands and requests from the people."
"If we want to go further, do we want to go all together or do just a few of us want to go?"
"And how?"
"All these questions are both central to and pervade the matter, together with the four points, and the Convention, which will not take any decision but needs to make strong proposals, will have a lot of work to do."
"This is what I wanted to say and, finally, I, too, think that those of us who are going to take part in this convention need to be open and to listen to what is said outside the debating chamber during that time."
"Among the citizens, in each of our countries, in each of our regions, and I am very aware of the forum that the regional framework provides for public debate, for debate among the people, where many useful things can be said and passed on."
"We should be open to the debate that will take place during that time in civil society."
"The Commission will not be a spectator throughout that period."
"It will have its special place within this Convention, as it will subsequently take part in the Intergovernmental Conference and as the President of the Commission will ultimately take an active part in the European Council of the very last Intergovernmental Conference, scheduled to take place at the latest at the beginning of 2004, before the European elections."
"Next week, we are going to decide on a communication, on which I am working with President Prodi, on Laeken, on the situation before Laeken and on the likely scenario after the Laeken decisions have been implemented."
"Trust us, trust me; the Commission will make regular proposals and will put forward contributions and communications on each of the subjects."
"I have heard a group Chairman requesting this."
"I can assure you, Chairman Poettering, Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Cox, that, not only, Mr Barón Crespo, on the issues of simplification or competences but on all the other subjects as well, although first of all on the issue of competences, which directly concerns us, the Commission will put contributions and suggestions on the Convention table in order to express a vision."
"However, I must make it quite clear that that vision, and we will confirm this next week in our communication, will, in all probability, be the preservation of the model of the community method and also, once its preservation is assured, its reinvigoration and legitimisation."
"Thank you, Commissioner Barnier."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Procedural motions (continued)"
"On 15 November, I brought to your attention the plight of the plane spotters arrested in Greece, amongst them my constituents Lesley and Paul Coppin."
"That was two weeks ago and they are still in jail."
"Last week I visited Mrs Coppin and she is very distressed."
"It may be that some of those arrested have been over enthusiastic in their activities and, technically, may have appeared to have broken Greek law but others in the group, including Mrs Coppin, have done absolutely nothing wrong."
"There is no evidence against them and no foundation for holding them."
"These people have therefore been held in custody for almost three weeks on no justifiable basis."
"Neither they nor their lawyer were present when evidence was originally presented to the investigating judge who took his arbitrary decisions in camera."
"For much of the time Mrs Coppin and the other detainees had no idea of the nature of the charges against them or how long they were likely to be kept in prison before their case was dealt with."
"This is disgraceful by any standards and a flagrant abuse of their civil and human rights."
"Provisions under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, along with case-law, make clear that persons arrested within the European Union must be brought promptly - and that means within seven days - before a judge who must free them immediately if no foundation for their detention exists."
"It must have been clear to the judge, by 16 November at the latest, that there was no evidence against many of the individuals and they should therefore have been released immediately."
"What we are now seeing is a charade of justice."
"I ask you, Madam President, and the President of the Council and the Commission President, to take immediate action with the Greek authorities to secure the urgent release of all the detainees from custody, particularly Mrs Coppin."
"This cannot be allowed to go on for another day."
"Thank you."
"The President has already taken this matter up with the Permanent Representation of Greece via her Cabinet."
"She has also declared herself prepared to take steps personally if this situation persists."
"I now give the floor to Baroness Ludford."
"Early this afternoon the President felt she needed to cut short and postpone the opportunity for Members to raise this matter."
"She felt she had to prioritise the debate on the future of Europe."
"But the future of Europe will be nothing if our people do not support us."
"This case is a perfect example of the impact on individuals of the quality or otherwise of European integration."
"Parliament had a chance to show its relevance to people and missed it in prime time."
"Our motion now clashes with the Presidential debate where most of our colleagues are."
"I find it difficult to believe that after nearly three weeks it has been impossible to clarify, let alone hear, the charges against the 12 Britons."
"I am also puzzled about the role the Greek air force has reportedly had in reviewing the charges as opposed to an independent prosecutor."
"The defendants have not had an opportunity to challenge the evidence in open court and now the higher tribunal to which the case has been referred is to be held in secret."
"Mr Souladakis said earlier that the Greek criminal justice authorities had respected all relevant rights."
"I am surprised that the European Convention on Human Rights is so weak."
"We might need a Europe-wide review with a view to reinforcing those standards and we certainly need that in parallel with the European arrest warrant."
"I call on the Greek authorities to clarify the charges, release the defendants on bail and hold a trial in open court by Friday of this week."
"I would just like to underline that this is an issue that has the support of all parties in my own country."
"It concerns not just British citizens but also Dutch citizens."
"It has massive public interest and raises questions at a time when we are proceeding in the field of Justice and Home Affairs at European level on the basis of mutual recognition."
"That implies that we need to be confident that every country's legal system is up to scratch and meets the minimum standards set down in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is important and I am glad you have announced that the President will take this up."
"Thank you, Mr Corbett."
"The points made by all speakers are absolutely clear."
"I have already told Mr Van Orden that the issue is being monitored by the President' s Cabinet, that action has already been undertaken and that, if necessary, the President will personally see to this matter if the situation persists."
"Following on from the points of order made earlier today, I am grateful the President is going to raise the issue yet again with the Greek authorities."
"I am speaking particularly about my constituent Wayne Groves from Tamworth."
"He did not even possess a camera so I still do not know why he is being held in detention."
"He is sleeping on a floor with a thin mattress, as I understand are the other prisoners."
"He has been there for three weeks."
"Why, when the magistrate said yesterday that there was no real evidence against them, are they still being held?"
"I believe along with everybody else that this is in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"If applicant countries have to say that will adhere to it before membership, surely current members should adhere to it now."
"I should like to raise the same issue without, however, repeating what has already been said on the matter."
"Two lads from my constituency are also still in captivity in Greece on account of the same crime: this is evidently the seriousness with which this matter is being dealt with in Greece."
"I would point out that the next item on the agenda is the European arrest warrant."
"In relation to what is currently happening in Greece, that is a topic which we, as well as the Council, will have to treat with extreme caution to prevent the situation from causing European distortion in the field of criminal law policy."
"Thank you, I have already responded to this point."
"Madam President, as we are talking about human rights, I would like to speak on an issue of method, which applies to all the association agreements."
"Today, a joint debate is going to take place on the association agreements with Egypt, and it will include oral questions and motions for resolutions."
"For the sake of a democratic debate and a more coherent vote on all the association agreements, it is important for it to be split into separate parts."
"We suggest that the debate should deal, first of all, with oral questions and resolutions and then, secondly, with the vote on the association agreements."
"It is neither logical nor coherent to take a position on these issues at the same time."
"The oral questions and resolutions are intended to question the political powers of these countries and to give them time to debate and respond to those questions."
"This two-part method allows us to confirm the fundamental importance that we attach to the whole agreement, particularly Article 2 on human rights."
"The example of Egypt is telling in that it shows that we do not silently accept a decision that constitutes a violation of human rights, the recent condemnation of homosexuals, and flouts the values that we defend in Article 2 of our agreements."
"Our group would therefore like to keep the debate and vote on oral questions and motions for resolutions in one part-session, and put the association agreements back to another part-session."
"We have already made a request to that effect by letter to the President."
"This point will be dealt with in this evening' s debate."
"Mr President, you may not, but Mrs Fontaine certainly will be aware of the following matter which we have raised in the European Parliament, time and again, over the last ten years."
"It concerns three Greek seamen from the lower ranks of the crew of a Greek ship who were arrested in Egypt, found responsible for the 7.5 tonnes of drugs on board the ship and handed down very heavy sentences."
"To give the Egyptian courts their due, it was not the owners per se or the master of the ship who were responsible, it was the three unfortunate lower-ranking members of the crew."
"Mrs Fontaine and all her predecessors have already expressed their support and asked for them to be released and sent to Greece."
"Two and a half years ago, one of the three prisoners died as a result of their appalling conditions of detention."
"A few days ago, a second man died of tonsillitis of all things."
"The third man is still alive but his health is shot to pieces."
"The Bureau should call for his release before he, too, gives up the ghost."
"Combating terrorism/EUROJUST"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"Report by Mr Watson (A5-0397/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism (COM(2001) 521 - C5-0452/2001 - 2001/0217(CNS)) and the Commission proposal for a Council framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States (COM(2001) 522 - C5-0453/2001 - 2001/0215(CNS)), and the;"
"report by Mrs Gebhardt (A5-0398/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against major organised crime."
"Madam President, it is a matter of regret and perhaps even of shame that it took the events of 11 September to push European governments into tackling effectively a problem which has plagued our continent for over a generation."
"In 1997 in Amsterdam, and again in 1999 in Tampere in Finland, the Heads of State and Government committed themselves to tackling terrorism."
"Our review of progress early this year showed that they had done nothing about it, which was why we as a Parliament brought forward a report calling on them to take action."
"The events of 11 September have fortunately brought such action and I look forward to travelling to Washington shortly to talk about common action between the European Union and the United States of America."
"I would like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in drawing up this report, particularly the Members from Spain."
"In my report, I broadly welcome the Commission proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and for a European arrest warrant."
"The amendments which I put forward seek to restrict the list of crimes defined as terrorist crimes and covered by the European arrest warrant to the most serious cross-border criminal offences, and if I may quote Amendment No 16, it specifies those crimes ""which aim to destroy the fundamental freedoms, democracy, respect for human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law on which our societies are based""."
"We seek too to insert safeguards for civil liberties by basing action clearly on international human rights documents, by reinforcing the principle of ne bis in idem, by taking account of time spent in detention awaiting trial and by allowing Member States refusal to extradite when there are manifestly sound reasons for doing so, including in those cases where a person found guilty could face a penalty of death."
"Moreover, we seek to provide aids to victims of terrorism and their families."
"I shall ask the House to accept one amendment, which was submitted after the deadline and which takes account of the most recent developments in Council."
"One Member State is threatening to block progress towards a European arrest warrant."
"There is a method - not one which I recommend - but one which may be needed in extremis, in order to press ahead, and that is to invoke Article 40 of the Treaty allowing reinforced cooperation between a certain number of Member States."
"Terrorism is a supranational challenge and calls for a supranational response."
"We cannot allow the blockage of one Member State to prevent common action in fighting it."
"When we met in this Chamber, on 12 September, we had a debate in which I remember Mr Poettering and many others said that we were all Americans."
"Since then, we have discovered that we must first be Europeans."
"We acknowledge that recognition of judicial judgements and judicial standards requires trust in each other's systems, but not blind trust, and for that reason I have put forward an amendment calling for urgent measures to improve judicial systems in our Member States, to encourage benchmarking, to encourage exchange of best practice."
"The process of creating an area of freedom, security and justice is similar to that of creating the single market, but it is more urgent and, moreover, we are dealing not with the freedom of movement of goods, services or capital, but with the freedom of people."
"The Greens and other political groups are saying, don't go ahead until you are sure that everybody's judicial standards are perfect."
"Majority opinion, however, on the Committee recognises that the scope of the challenge we face and the historical imperative are such that we must press ahead with these measures with prudence, and with vigilance, but also with determination."
"We must ensure effective action against terrorists and yet we must not deny legitimate political expression of grievances."
"I was surprised to read in El País this morning an interpretation of one amendment, which I support, that it would outlaw Herri Batasuna."
"I do not interpret the amendment in this way, nor would such an amendment be necessary to target those involved in supporting terrorist acts."
"Other provisions in what we are proposing do that."
"I would say to colleagues, and particularly to our Spanish colleagues, that in our determination to tackle terrorism, we must acknowledge that terrorists sometimes express political grievances, and that these require a political response."
"Council is discussing the proposals put forward by the Commission;"
"Parliament, which desperately needs powers of codecision, may be reconsulted on this matter."
"We are determined to assist governments in their work and yet maintain the delicate balance between the security needs of our citizens and preservation of their democratic freedoms."
"In this, cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs has received quite a boost."
"Whatever it was that we planned at Amsterdam, the paradox is that events are what drives Europe forward: just as Mr Haider's election led us to adopt effective legislation against racism and xenophobia, so it may be that Mr bin Laden has done much for European Union integration."
"May I say, finally, what a pleasure it is to see you as a fellow Liberal Democrat in the Chair in this session."
"I wish you a successful debate."
", rapporteur. (DE) Madam President, Madam Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the improvement of judicial cooperation between the European Union's Member States is an important key to the European area of freedom, security and justice."
"The establishment, at long last, of Eurojust puts this key in our hands, so that we can combat serious crime, such as terrorism, trafficking in human beings and drug-smuggling flexibly and successfully, without regard to the Community's internal borders."
"When Parliament approved the establishment of Eurojust, as long ago as early 2001, it envisaged 1 January 2002 as its starting date."
"The Council has made substantial changes to the initiatives underlying Eurojust, which made it necessary to consult Parliament again, but, despite this, I do not see Eurojust's starting date early next year as having been jeopardised."
"The Council has, since 11 September, demonstrated its capacity for rapid reaction when circumstances require it, as the safety of people in Europe most certainly does."
"The document under consideration today already incorporates significant amendments by the Council at Parliament's suggestion in the first consultation."
"Eurojust's areas of competence were therefore defined in such a way as to include borderline cases and new forms of serious crime."
"Eurojust can also, moreover, at the request of a competent national authority, support investigations and prosecutions outside the areas described."
"This ensures maximum flexibility and efficiency in our shared struggle against crime, which knows no boundaries."
"Parliament's proposals for smooth cooperation between Eurojust and the national authorities are also welcomed in the Council's new document, something for which I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude."
"Despite this, we still have to make a few changes in order to make Eurojust the best possible instrument against cross-frontier crime."
"If I rightly understand the indications from the Member States' governments and from the Council, these will meet with wide-ranging agreement between Parliament and the Council."
"Last weekend, the German and French governments, at their summit in Nantes, underlined Parliament's view that Eurojust should become the basic unit of a European State Prosecution Service."
"This would strengthen the European Union's judicial aspect, give effect to conventions that have been drawn up but not yet ratified, and continue existing initiatives in this area."
"I also consider it important that Eurojust's involvement in investigations and prosecutions should not be hampered by unnecessary bureaucracy."
"It makes no sense for Eurojust to set up national branch offices."
"Investigators and prosecutors, in Eurojust and in the Member States, must be able to communicate with each other directly."
"We know from our experience of organised crime that short routes and procedures alone can offer hope of speedy and sure success in investigations."
"Let me conclude with data protection, a point which is of especial importance to me."
"The processing of data by Eurojust must include an appropriately high level of protection for the individual citizen."
"This can only be taken for granted if the storing of personal data is kept to the minimum required and if data is not stored for longer than is absolutely necessary."
"It goes without saying that special requirements must apply to the handling of data on victims and witnesses."
"There is also a clear need to safeguard the individual's right to information, which he must be in a position to demand."
"It is most encouraging to receive favourable indications from the Council, including in data protection matters."
"I hope, though, that they will go much further yet."
"Only one wish will no doubt not be granted me: Eurojust will not be based in Luxembourg, which would have symbolised so well this institution's independence and its closeness to European Community law."
"Madam President, I have indeed the honour of representing the Presidency here, because, unfortunately, the Minister of Justice is unable to attend today."
"I have been asked to discuss this topic on his behalf, which I naturally do with great pleasure."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would, first of all, like to start by thanking you for the speed and flexibility with which you have worked over recent weeks."
"The Council meeting of 20 September, and then the European Council that met the following day, decided, as you know, on rapid implementation of the Action Plan against terrorism, with a December deadline for each of the three decisions that we are discussing today, which are key elements of this action plan."
"European citizens would not understand if the European Union did not work as fast as possible to adopt the measures in question."
"The speed with which the rapporteurs have worked and with which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has examined the reports, and you are to discuss them today, are exemplary."
"Respecting the deadlines set for adopting these decisions depended on all of that, and the Presidency is very grateful to you for that support for its work."
"Madam President, first of all, I will deal with the decision creating Eurojust, then the framework decision on the European arrest warrant, and I will finish with the framework decision on combating terrorism."
"I will not go back over the objectives of each of the instruments, or not much."
"You know them well enough."
"I would like to confine myself to the reason why you invited the Presidency here today, and I will therefore go through the preparatory work for each of the decisions."
"(NL) With regard to Eurojust, the setting up of a permanent unit was one of our absolute priorities in the field of justice."
"The terrorist threat has only reinforced this intention."
"We are doing everything we can to ensure that this instrument is adopted in December so that we can meet the objectives of Tampere."
"I am delighted to be able to inform you that everything seems to suggest that the Council will be able meet this deadline."
"Admittedly, a political agreement had already been struck during the Council meeting of 27 and 28 September on Articles 1 to 8 of this Decision."
"You are aware of the fact that these articles constitute the actual core of this Decree establishing Eurojust."
"Under the Belgian Presidency, the working party has spent 13 meeting days on this instrument."
"The entire text has already been the subject of overall reading in the working party. It has also been examined by the Article 36 Committee and is now before the COREPER."
"(FR) An initial opinion from Parliament was adopted on 17 May this year but, given the many changes that had been made to the text, it became necessary to have a fresh consultation."
"The Presidency has taken particular care to ensure that the opinions given by Parliament were taken into account throughout the negotiations."
"Eurojust should bring real added value compared with the existing instruments."
"Bringing together magistrates from the Member States in a single body will surely enable good coordination and close cooperation between the authorities responsible for prosecution."
"Eurojust will thus provide an effective instrument with a view to creating the area of freedom, security and justice which has been our aim since the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"To this end, we therefore needed to ensure genuine, effective cooperation between Eurojust and the other bodies created as part of our Union."
"We therefore needed to be careful to avoid overlaps of responsibility and redundancies."
"All these issues are covered by provisions in the draft decision."
"Cooperation between Eurojust and Europol and the relationship that those two bodies will have to maintain will be the subject of a separate agreement."
"This draft agreement is being drawn up by the members of the pro-Eurojust provisional unit and the representatives of Europol."
"It was most desirable to include those primarily affected in the discussion and to better integrate the further developments in Europol that are currently under negotiation within the European Union."
"(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in line with your wishes, Eurojust' s areas of competence have been set up in such a way as to afford Eurojust the scope needed to deal with borderline cases and new forms of crime."
"Eurojust will take part in the coordination of the competent authorities of the Member States and could ask these to set up joint research teams."
"The authorities of Member States which fail to meet Eurojust' s request will need to justify their actions."
"A whole host of provisions in the draft Decree concern the introduction of rules to protect personal data."
"After all, it was, and is, vital, on the one hand, to provide Eurojust with the possibility of dealing with such data, but, on the other hand, to offer every guarantee that privacy is protected."
"The expertise gathered by the interim unit which was set up on 1 March of this year was taken into consideration."
"Representatives of this unit took part in the working party and were given the opportunity of sharing their findings during those activities."
"I should like to underline the fact that the activities carried out by the interim unit have more than adequately attested to the significance and value of a unit such as Eurojust, particularly over the past few weeks."
"Hopefully, you will be pleased to hear that, according to the latest state of activities, it will very much be the task of your Parliament to grant Eurojust discharge for the implementation of the budget."
"Despite this, a few important questions remain unanswered, although they are limited in number."
"They mainly concern the modalities with regard to the right to perusal of personal data, the entry into force of the Decree and the statute of Eurojust staff."
"(FR) Finally, the issue of the headquarters remains open."
"It should be possible to make a decision on this at the Laeken Summit."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I will finish this part of my statement by drawing your attention to the fact that, on 16 November, the Presidency insisted that the Member States prepare from now on to implement the framework decision creating Eurojust, so that it can be wholly operational as soon as possible."
"Allow me to move on to the work regarding the European arrest warrant."
"As you know, the Commission' s proposal is based on the principle of mutual recognition of final decisions."
"That means that each national authority must recognise ipso facto, with minimal checks, a request to hand over a person made by the judicial authority of another Member State."
"The European arrest warrant is meant to replace the current extradition mechanism for the crimes that it covers."
"(NL) The framework decision on this arrest warrant is technically a very complex instrument, because it deals with important issues within criminal law procedure, but also with issues which, for example, pertain to the description of people which facilitates the tracing of them."
"Given the extent of the tasks and the deadlines to be met, the Presidency has speeded up the Council activities considerably."
"The dossier was immediately dealt with by the Article 36 Committee, thus allowing the most delicate issues to be discussed there straight away."
"This has necessitated the convening of various extraordinary meetings."
"Furthermore, a group of experts has also met several times in order to prepare the groundwork for the most technical aspects."
"At the Article 36 Committee, the debates to date have mainly focused on the scope of the instrument that addresses the problems involved in the dual criminality requirement and on the modalities of judicial inspection within the implementing Member State."
"The Member States are agreed that the scope must be determined on the basis of a positive list of infringements."
"It was impossible to retain the principle of a negative list because it has appeared impossible to reach agreement about the withdrawal of the dual criminality requirement with such a broadly defined scope."
"During the Justice and Internal Affairs Council of 16 November, there was broad consensus about the Presidency' s compromise proposal for a positive list and also a mock agreement to apply dual criminality to the infringements which feature on the list."
"(FR) These offences are those covered by the Treaty on European Union, the Tampere conclusions, the Annex to the Europol Convention and the four offences proposed by the Commission, which are sabotage, arson, crimes against humanity according to the statute of the International Criminal Court, hijacking of aircraft and hijacking of ships."
"It includes, among other things, terrorism and in the trafficking of human beings. In order to reach a unanimous agreement, it will undoubtedly be necessary to alter the list."
"The Council agreed to work on the basis of two proposals."
"One envisaged that, for the offences on the list that have not yet been harmonised, the double jeopardy rule should only be withdrawn if the offence is considered to be serious in the issuing State."
"That would imply a sentence threshold greater than the twelve months currently established for offences which have not been harmonised among the fifteen Member States."
"Under the other proposal, removing dual criminality would be limited to offences committed wholly or partially on the territory of the issuing State, the idea being that a handover could not be refused for acts committed on the territory of the State issuing the warrant."
"(NL) During the Justice and Internal Affairs Council of 16 November, the ministers managed to reach agreement on the conditions under which an appeal may be made to the rights enjoyed in the implementing State, as well as on the deadline for handing over a suspect."
"The basic principles are as follows: the law of the implementing State determines the modalities under which the rights can be called upon."
"In the event of the wanted person consenting to their surrender, a period of ten days is stipulated."
"In the event of an arrest, a period of sixty days is stipulated and in special cases, these periods can be extended by thirty days."
"The other provisions of the Commission proposal were discussed in the Article 36 Committee on 22 and 23 November."
"The discussions centred around the reasons for refusing to implement the warrant and the conditions for applying the principle of territoriality and the principle of speciality."
"It is too premature at this stage to moot the idea of an agreement, but the activities are very constructive and all provisions have already been discussed in detail."
"(FR) Particular attention is paid, and I think, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a concern that you have expressed, to the rights of the requested person: rights to defence, rights regarding the use of languages, rights regarding transfer."
"In this respect, it will be stressed that the requested person' s interest in benefiting from a judicial procedure and appearing before the judge as soon as possible should not be neglected."
"Another area of obvious improvement on the current extradition procedure is deducting any detention enforced as part of the execution of the European arrest warrant in the executing State from the prison sentence that the person handed receives."
"This is the state of the negotiations concerning the framework decision on the European arrest warrant."
"As I have said before, there are still difficulties, but we are hopeful that they can be resolved before next week."
"(NL) The third instrument, I should like to mention today, is the framework decision on the fight against terrorism."
"For that decision, we can, of course, draw on the experience already gathered in connection with the two instruments I mentioned a moment ago, but that does not take away from the importance of the decision."
"First of all, because it is also essential to promote judicial cooperation by harmonising penalisations."
"It is crucial to develop a common strategy on terrorism and in that way to develop a truly European criminal policy in that area."
"It is also vital to grant European courts of justice broad judicial powers."
"But the significance of the framework decision also lies in the subtleties thereof, as some of you have rightly pointed out: all actions in connection with terrorism, including taking part in and supporting a terrorist group, must be considered."
"At the same time, great care must be taken not to go too far, and accordingly, a definition should be introduced which rules out any risk of abuse."
"The Council is acutely aware of this, and it is with those elements in mind that the activities are moving forwards."
"They are making steady progress and that is borne out by the outcome of the meetings of 16 November."
"Indeed, we can already ascertain that the changes that were made have brought the positions closer together."
"(FR) The definition of terrorist offences is almost finalised."
"The element of initial intention has been clarified."
"Added to this are two elements that can also be characteristics of terrorist intent, namely severely intimidating the population or unduly forcing a State to carry out an act."
"At the same time, the types of conduct affected have been redefined so that only extremely serious offences are covered, in response to the concerns and criticisms that the initial definition was too broad."
"Two additional elements have been adopted by the Council in order to confirm the guarantees of respect for fundamental rights."
"First of all, the preamble will state that the framework decision is without prejudice to the exercising of human rights, in particular, the right of association, expression and demonstration."
"Also, a political declaration will add to these precautions, specifying that the decision does not cover people who are acting to preserve or restore democratic values, or people who are exercising the right to express their opinions, even if, while exercising that right, they commit offences."
"Finally, the preamble will exclude from the framework decision' s scope, the activities of the armed forces in a period of armed conflict when they are performing their official duties, as governed by international law."
"This is the situation with regard to the crime of terrorism itself."
"(NL) With regard to judicial powers, the Council continues to attach importance to the wide scope of these judicial powers on account of the seriousness of terrorist acts."
"A coordination mechanism will be brought about in the event of any conflict of judicial powers among the Member States, which is not inconceivable, given the wide judicial powers of the same States."
"Progress continues to be made in the activities in the field of punishment."
"The current text provides for the obligation on all Member States to increase penalties for punishable acts of terrorism compared to the same acts without any terrorist intent."
"The debates which were held on this topic last Friday in the COREPER were about the very same punishment for punishable acts which are associated with terrorist groups."
"Consensus appears to be growing about a maximum penalty of fifteen years for leading a terrorist group and of eight years for taking part in such a group."
"If the group has not yet carried out any acts of terrorism, the leading of such a group also incurs an eight year sentence."
"However, the debates on this issue have not yet been completed."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that brings to an end the account that I wished to give of the three Council framework decisions that are on your agenda today."
"As I have already said, the Presidency expects to see the discussions on these three instruments completed between now and December."
"That would certainly be an amazing feat, given the Council' s loaded schedule, but it will, above all, show, on the eve of the Laeken Summit, that the European Union has now achieved a certain maturity in the development of European criminal justice and that it is capable of realising the objectives that it set itself."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on her report on the creation of the Eurojust unit."
"The ideas that the Commission expressed on this matter in its communication of November 2000 and the recommendations adopted by the European Parliament in May of this year, following the report by Mrs Gebhardt, are, to a large extent, echoed in the text that is now being studied by the Council."
"I shall, therefore, limit myself to emphasising two or three aspects in greater detail."
"Firstly, as Mrs Gebhardt stated, in the version currently under examination, the rules on the protection of personal data have been extended and improved."
"The draft document adopts a balanced approach that respects both the legitimate interests and fundamental rights of Europe' s citizens and the need for the effective coordination of investigations and prosecutions."
"There will be an independent joint supervisory body for data protection and, if necessary, legal solutions will be provided for appeals to be lodged in national courts."
"Secondly, the role of the Union' s institutions has been strengthened and the Commission is fully involved in the work of Eurojust in its various areas of responsibility."
"Parliament will be kept fully informed of the budgetary issues and I hope that it will also be given the task of discharging the budget."
"Mrs Gebhardt' s excellent report also includes a list of supplementary amendments, most of which meet with the Commission' s approval."
"I shall only mention the examples of the amendments concerning membership of the joint supervisory body for personal data, cooperation with OLAF, the Commission' s anti-fraud body, and Eurojust, Parliament' s discharge of the budget, the time limits for the storage of data and the law applicable in the event of damage resulting from incorrect data processing."
"I hope that the Council will also bear these suggestions in mind."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the other two initiatives under consideration, the events of 11 September 2001 have, I am sad to say, confirmed the validity of the recommendations adopted by the European Parliament on 5 September 2001, following an own-initiative report drawn up by Graham Watson."
"As Commissioner responsible for Justice and Home Affairs, I wish to congratulate and pay public tribute to Mr Watson, the Chairman of Parliament' s Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, whose efforts and name will always be associated with this initiative of enormous political scope; the fight against terrorism and against crime in the European Union."
"The recommendations in the Watson report, published in September, were, to a large extent, taken into account in the proposals presented by the Commission on 19 September which are now being studied by the Council."
"I wish firstly to discuss the proposal for a framework decision on combating terrorism."
"The Council debate on this proposal has focused on the three most important and, at the same time, most problematic issues: defining terrorist crime, clarifying the rules of jurisdiction for the prosecution of terrorist acts and the framework of penalties and sanctions applicable to terrorist acts."
"With regard to definition, there has been concern to ensure that the framework decision cannot, under any circumstances, apply to legitimate action, for example in the context of the activities of unions or anti-globalisation movements."
"The Commission has subscribed to this interpretation from the outset and considers that the solution we are working towards respects the basic structure of the Commission' s initial proposal, which is to, ""define a terrorist offence on the basis of the identification of an objective factor: the terrorist act, accompanied by the identification of a subjective element: a terrorist motivation under the terms of the proposal"" ."
"At the same time, the solution also provides more detail on allowing the requirements that must be met for the offence included in the positive list to be considered a terrorist offence, to be identified in legislation itself. We are, therefore, in favour of improving the definition contained in the text currently being studied by the Council."
"This aspect, in fact, provides a further guarantee: no common crime, not even acts of violence committed incidentally in the context of certain demonstrations, will be covered by the instrument to eliminate terrorism."
"The Council is currently considering the possibility of issuing a statement explaining that anyone acting in the interest of preserving or restoring democratic values, instances of which occurred in some Member States during the Second World War, cannot be considered to be a terrorist."
"This aspect is in line with some of the amendments tabled by Parliament to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms on which our countries are founded cannot, under any circumstances, be endangered by the present framework decision."
"With regard to jurisdiction, the debate in the Council is close to reaching a solution that is very similar to the one recommended in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament."
"There is consensus in Council on a balanced formula that combines the Commission' s initial proposal and the more ambitious project suggested by some Member States and by Parliament on national jurisdictions being extended to cover the entire territory of the Union."
"Consequently, Member States can, if they so desire, extend their jurisdiction if the offence has been committed in any part of the Union' s territory."
"With regard to the third issue, that of penalties and sanctions, I would say that this is still the main problem with the framework decision, given the lack of consensus on a common level of penalties and sanctions for individual terrorist offences."
"The Commission is not yet satisfied with the approach that is currently applied for individual offences, under which the penalties and sanctions applicable to terrorist offences committed by individuals would not be harmonised. Instead, weightier penalties and sanctions than those provided for under national legislation for the same offences committed without the special intention required for classification as terrorist acts would apply."
"If we limit our ambitions in this way, we will not be fulfilling the mandate laid down in the Article 31(e) of the Treaty, nor will we be following the recommendation contained in the Watson report."
"Furthermore, we would be acting inconsistently since, in previous instruments, we have managed to adopt common penalties and sanctions for the counterfeiting of the euro, for assisting illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings, and it would be inexplicable not to be equally ambitious when it comes to punishing terrorist acts."
"I hope that it is possible to find a solution on the basis of the proposal that the Commission presented on creating a range of penalties and sanctions for the individual offences listed in Articles 1 and 2 of the Commission proposal, with greater flexibility to adapt them to the scale of penalties in force in the national legislation of each Member State."
"Lastly, this framework decision stipulates that the Member States must adopt all possible measures to guarantee appropriate assistance to the families of victims, implementing, where possible, Article 4 of the Framework Decision on the Status of Victims in Connection with Criminal Proceedings."
"This approach is entirely consistent with Parliament' s point of view."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the second framework decision, on the European arrest warrant, must be based on the principle of the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, in line with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, and with the recommendation made to us by the Heads of State and Government at the Ghent European Council of October this year."
"The text we are now discussing, submitted by the Presidency, includes a positive list of offences for which a double jeopardy verification does not have to be carried out."
"As you know, the Commission proposal that is being discussed today seeks to make the abolition of the double jeopardy rule universal, with the exception of a negative list identified by the Commission."
"Since the Ghent European Council, it has become clear that this approach by the Commission would not have majority support in Council."
"Hence the Presidency has moved ahead with a compromise proposal, which assumes that the execution of an arrest warrant for offences included in the positive list does not require double jeopardy verification."
"The Commission is prepared to support this compromise proposal by the Presidency provided that the definition of offences included on this positive list is substantial and that it sends a clear, unequivocal message that we are strengthening the mechanisms of judicial cooperation to fight against the various forms of transnational organised crime."
"In order to ensure that the mechanism of the positive list works and is effective, the definition of the offences on this list must respect the definition of these offences in force in the legislation of the Member States issuing a search and arrest warrant."
"This is an essential component."
"Unless this component is complied with, the double jeopardy condition would also be reintroduced for these offences, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid."
"I think that we are approaching an agreement on the content of the positive list. However, at the moment, this agreement is not yet completely signed and sealed."
"I hope that, by the Council of 6 and 7 December, it will be possible to conclude a unanimous agreement on a substantial positive list that fulfils the objective of a mechanism for an effective European arrest warrant that can be implemented in a straightforward way."
"Regarding the last aspect that I wish to focus on, the Commission has included in its proposal a set of rules that are intended to reconcile effectiveness in the fight against crime, on the one hand, and the protection of citizens' rights and fundamental freedoms on the other."
"I hope that the Council resists the temptation to remove provisions that offer protection on the grounds that they are not necessary, since the Member States are, in any event, bound to respect legal safeguards."
"It is true that one of the essential elements for the creation of this mechanism is the principle of mutual trust that has resulted from the Member States signing up to the Council of Europe' s European Convention of Human Rights of 1950 and from having jointly proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in December of 2000. I would say, however, that it is, nevertheless, important to emphasise some specific mechanisms that should be included in this framework decision in order to guarantee and safeguard the fundamental rights of our citizens."
"Other amendments along the same lines consist of bringing the wording of the Ne bis in idem rule, laid down in Article 29 of the Commission' s proposal, into line with the wording of Article 50 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights so as to obviate the requirement for the arrest warrant to be accompanied by proof that the individual has been duly informed of the procedure in time to prepare a defence in the event that he or she is sentenced in absentia."
"Another good example of these rules is the deduction of the period of deprivation of liberty from the punishment laid down in Article 24 of the Commission proposal, which states that the period of detention in the Member State executing the warrant must be taken into account for the purposes of calculating compensation in the event that the individual surrendered is not convicted."
"There must be a balance between the need for speed and effective cooperation between judicial authorities and the interests of individuals, who must not be subjected to additional or excessive constraints or have their ability to mount a defence hampered."
"The Commission feels that it would be desirable, where the identification of the laws and principles that safeguard fundamental rights in a European judicial area is concerned, to extend these rules. The Commission realises, therefore, that it would be desirable to pursue the task of approximating legislation on criminal proceedings in the Member States."
"We must, simultaneously, guarantee the effectiveness of prosecutions and the safeguarding of the rights of individuals."
"It may, therefore, prove necessary at Union level to address, in a more concerted way, the right to language assistance, the proper treatment of evidence and the issue of the courts' bail system."
"The Commission is considering the possibility of issuing a communication on these aspects that could cover a huge range of factors. These issues require a horizontal approach and, therefore, we propose finalising them at a later date in a specific mechanism."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude by referring to Mr Watson' s proposal for an oral amendment that was tabled here today."
"Now that we are debating the Commission' s position, we must step up negotiations to conclude an agreement supported by all fifteen Member States."
"Not an agreement at any price, but an agreement that responds to the challenge of the fight against terrorism and organised crime before us."
"We also welcome the Belgian Presidency' s commitment to obtaining this agreement. I also wish to make it clear, however, that, where the European arrest warrant is concerned, an agreement can certainly be concluded on the list of thirty-four offences to which Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has just referred."
"I must also clearly state that the list does not include minor offences because this is a list annexed to the Europol Convention."
"I would also say that, if these offences are considered to be offences that warrant police cooperation under the terms of Europol, they must also be considered to be unquestionably serious for the purposes of judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"Regardless of national legal cultures and regardless of the moral censure that a particular offence might generate at national level, I am convinced that the option we should pursue at the moment is to conclude an agreement with all fifteen Member States, a substantial agreement on the list of offences to which the European arrest warrant should apply."
"If this agreement cannot be concluded with all fifteen countries, we will then have to consider what to do next."
"Madam President, I think that today our thoughts should focus on the basics, which are the good fortune and responsibility of living in democratic States governed by the rule of law."
"In a democratic State governed by the rule of law, any political demand is acceptable and to be respected and the democratic confrontation of ideas is always to be welcomed; these are our standards, our very essence, our identifying mark, on which the whole idea of European integration is founded."
"By the same token, however, the democratic State governed by the rule of law rejects those who express their ideas through bloodshed."
"When faced with those who sow the seeds of terror, death and destruction in our societies, there is only one dialogue possible, the dialogue that arises from the implementation of the law."
"This is our guiding thought on this matter."
"I said that we are constructing, on the bases and principles of our legal systems in democratic States governed by the rule of law, a democratic Europe governed by the rule of law."
"We had a situation that was completely lacking in balance between progress in the field of security and progress in the field of freedom and justice."
"The three proposals debated respond, and it was about time, to a request from Europe' s citizens and to the clear political will, at the highest level, of the Heads of State and Government, which, as Mr Watson has clearly pointed out, runs from Vienna to Tampere, and has been strengthened since 11 September at the Extraordinary European Council in Brussels and in Ghent."
"These three methods also respond to the principles upon which Europe has been constructed."
"Firstly, cooperation and coordination, as seen in Eurojust, where we cooperate and coordinate in order to be more effective in the field of justice."
"Secondly, the mutual recognition on which the internal market is based, and this, as the Commissioner has said, a corollary of the confidence between States, which is the fundamental element of the European search and arrest warrant."
"Finally, harmonisation wherever this may be necessary and the need for harmonisation with regard to terrorism is obvious, because only six Member States had any legislation covering this area."
"Madam President, I trust, no, I am sure, that by voting for these reports with an overwhelming majority tomorrow, Parliament will be giving, as it always has, the political signal that, as responsible representatives of the citizens, we have the obligation to work on the construction of democratic States governed by the rule of law, in those countries in which we are fortunate enough to live."
"Madam President, since 11 September, there have been many opportunities to think about and debate upon the consequences of the events of that fateful day and today is no exception."
"Without a doubt, the attacks in New York have made us realise that nobody can feel entirely safe from terrorism. When a man and a woman are murdered in Beasaín, as happened last week, for example, each and every one of us is affected, and it is not reasonable to ask the elected representatives of a democracy, Mr Watson, to have to debate under the threat of death."
"These events have also reminded us that we were a long way behind in meeting the commitments that the Heads of State and Government had given in Tampere in order to develop the third pillar of the European Union."
"The report that we approved by a large majority in committee contains contributions which, in my opinion, are very valid, to the otherwise excellent Commission proposal."
"For example, to define street violence as clearly being one form of terrorist expression, or to incorporate a reference to victims and their families and to offer political support and legal protection with the aim of identifying terrorism and bringing terrorists and their supporters to justice through the courts."
"This is precisely the purpose of the amendment we tabled in plenary and should be interpreted in this way."
"I hope that these and other contributions will be added to the text that the Council is debating, and, in particular, this latter amendment, which I hope the rapporteur will also vote for and will be taken into consideration when the European list of terrorist organisations that Parliament requested is drawn up."
"The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs should fulfil their duty on the 6 and 7 December, and if they do not do so, the Presidency will have to honour its commitment to Parliament to take this issue at Laeken, and if any Member State there is tempted to block a proposal that has the widespread support of our citizens, it seems appropriate to me that closer cooperation should be implemented according to provisions of Article 40 of the Treaty."
"The Council' s requests do not date from 11 September."
"In September 2000, one year ago, the vast majority of MEPs signed a written declaration requesting the methods that today have been submitted for our consideration."
"These are the same methods that we are asking the Commission for in the own-initiative report on the role of the European Union in the fight against terrorism that we approved, also by a very large majority, on 5 September."
"Therefore, it needs to be made very clear that none of these measures makes the slightest reduction in the civil liberties of European citizens."
"The opposite is the case, we are giving the judicial system instruments to enable it to better protect everyone' s freedom because, faced with the free movement of crime, we must open the doors to the free movement of justice."
"Madam President, the two provisions we are debating today respond to both a conviction and an objective: the conviction that we can defeat terrorism and our objective to strengthen the Rule of Law, providing all the instruments necessary to achieve this."
"In a democracy, political ideas are put to the test in the voting booth, and not put forward by terrorists."
"I am sure that all my fellow Members are of this opinion."
"I would like to clearly point out what will be changed by these two initiatives when they are adopted by the Laeken European Council : firstly, Europe will cease to 'show solidarity with' and instead be 'responsible for' ."
"The solidarity of Europeans with Spanish democrats in their fight against ETA will give way to the responsibility of all European democrats to defeat terrorism."
"Secondly, and with regard to the European search and arrest warrant, agreements between governments will be replaced with recognition and cooperation between their various judicial systems."
"An injunction will have to be able to be executed without delay, whether it has been issued by a Spanish judge or a French judge, against an individual who is sought in one or other of the countries."
"To make my position clear, I feel there should be no more disgraceful spectacles such as the one that took place at Olano."
"As well as thinking about the future, however, I cannot help but think with a certain degree of bitterness that these two provisions have come far too late, for the victims."
"How different their lives would have been if we had done this earlier!"
"If only this had been done ten years ago, I am sure that ETA would, by now, have been defeated, and that many of my close friends who have been murdered by ETA would still be here with us, still taking their children to school, giving lectures, writing articles for the press, administering justice, representing their voters."
"I would, therefore, ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to reflect upon this tomorrow before you vote."
"I would like you to consider that the consequences of this will not only be political, but will, more than anything, be of a human nature, and I would ask the Council to rise, in political terms, to this occasion, and not to miss this opportunity."
"There are those that think that politics is the art of the possible."
"My opinion is that the purpose of politics is to make what is necessary possible."
"I trust that the Fifteen will share this opinion."
"I assure you that the defeat of terrorism is possible, and, ladies and gentlemen, you do not realise just how necessary this is."
"Madam President, the argument that the anti-terrorism measures and the European arrest warrant do not skimp on fundamental rights, is only sustainable if the protection system of the European Convention on Human Rights for defendants is adhered to in practice."
"But that is dependant on the ability of every single judge in the European Union to understand and apply ECHR provisions."
"We have no coherent EU programme to ensure they do."
"Lest I be thought chauvinist in raising the problem of Britons in Greece, let me criticise my own government in the UK."
"They are trying to put through an anti-terrorism bill with a derogation from the ECHR in order to detain suspects without a proper trial, with no legal representation, no judicial review and without being able to hear the evidence given by the intelligence services."
"This certainly leaves the UK lacking credibility in a campaign for mutual raising of standards in the EU."
"Another worrying development in the UK is the intention to let police and security cooperation measures slip through the Westminster Parliament without proper democratic scrutiny."
"Here we debate, but we have no equality with Ministers in deciding the legislation."
"Coupled with Council secrecy, this means a very unsatisfactory position in terms of democracy, justice and human rights."
"Finally, may I make a direct appeal to Commissioner Vitorino to ensure that organisations acting in the field of raising justice standards, such as the admirable Fair Trials Abroad, can be assisted under the Community budget."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against terrorism is an absolute necessity, the legitimacy of which should not be questioned or we could see our democracies collapse."
"However, under no circumstances should it serve as a pretext for gagging our fundamental rights and democratic freedoms."
"How can we justify a European proposal to combat terrorism if no added value can be gained from it?"
"Under the current legislation of the Member States, perpetrators of attacks could not go unpunished."
"As the public enemy number one is terrorism, why not limit the European arrest warrant to terrorist offences?"
"If the illegal capture of State or government facilities, public modes of transport, infrastructures or public places constitutes a terrorist offence or if the legitimate expression of our freedoms of expression and association, our trade union rights, could, in the future, be criminalised or described as terrorism, if those elements are retained, by voting in favour of these reports we will be renouncing all of our democratic rights."
"An explicit guarantee of these rights and freedoms must be included in this proposal for a framework directive."
"Our fears also extend to certain offences that could fall under the warrant, as the criterion used is that of the sentence, while the accused persons may deserve protection, for example if they are migrants or asylum seekers."
"Even those giving support to those people would, in the future, become guilty of terrorism."
"A minimum degree of harmonisation of Member States' criminal procedures is necessary in order to safeguard the principle of equality before the law and guarantee the protection of rights in the principle of collegiality."
"Furthermore, as minors cannot be the subjects of an arrest warrant, their description for criminal purposes also needs to be harmonised."
"If we are to establish an area of security, freedom and justice, these three dimensions need to be fully effective."
"Unfortunately, we observe that the security aspect is dominating the policies of the Union and the Member States."
"The fight against terrorism needs to be reflected in security for all residents, without exception and in total respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"Finally, if a new text has to be adopted by the Council in the future, we hope that this House will be consulted once again."
"Madam President, there is an ongoing relationship between the constraints on individual and collective freedoms in the United States and those in Europe, just as there is an ongoing connection in the matter of such freedoms that has been maintained by the United Kingdom government, first with the Reagan/Thatcher partnership and now with the Bush/Blair partnership."
"Many European governments are using the criminal terrorist action of 11 September against the United States as an excuse to issue further legislation curbing freedoms which has nothing to do with combating terrorism."
"Leaving aside the special military tribunals set up by President Bush, it is enough to reflect upon the recent laws issued or proposed in Italy or in the United Kingdom in order to understand that their objective is to curb and control growing political opposition to a world social and economic order which is unfair and inhuman: the wealth, well-being, growth and development of a fifth of the human race are mirrored by the starvation, lack of resources, ongoing economic decline and underdevelopment of the other four fifths."
"It is strange that we can never manage to find a legal formula to define this major social massacre as an act of terrorism, while we had no hesitation in labelling as terrorist acts all those demonstrations of social opposition which have taken place recently in Seattle, Genoa and so forth."
"Article 3 of the proposal for a framework decision on terrorism sends a clear message to all those who, in the future, attempt to show their opposition to the neo-liberal monopoly on thinking and the resulting social system."
"Women, men, workers, students, the unemployed, pacifists and ecologists will no longer be opposing the system but will be terrorists because - as Hegel, then an old man, wrongly said - 'the real is rational and the rational real' , and for our legislators nothing is more real than the present social and economic disorder and nothing is more irrational, and therefore terrorist, than the need to overthrow and eliminate it."
"Lastly, I would like to make it clear that I do support the European arrest warrant and that, as an Italian, I condemn the fact that my country' s government should be the one to oppose a unanimous decision."
"It is shameful because the intention of the Berlusconi government in adopting this position is to prevent corruption being listed among the offences on the 'positive' list."
"Madam President, after the events of 11 September, Europe and the European institutions must also assume their responsibility and find the courage to achieve a joint agreement between the Member States on combating terrorism and, in general, combating organised crime, without delay."
"The legal instruments which will make this fight genuinely effective include the European arrest warrant, which will, at last, replace the complex and excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures which have now become insufficient and inadequate for fighting crime, particularly international crime."
"That said, we need to move one step at a time."
"The emotion of the tragic terrorist attacks of recent months must certainly prompt us to strengthen judicial cooperation between the Member States without delay, but in speeding up this process we must take things one step at a time and act responsibly."
"Indeed, good laws are not compatible with haste or with lack of precision or emotional reactions, particularly when it comes to identifying the offences in respect of which the European arrest warrant is to be applied."
"We would therefore express our concern at the Belgian Presidency' s proposal to apply the European arrest warrant to a list of around 30 categories of offences immediately."
"In our opinion, terrorism or the trafficking of human beings, to give just two examples, cannot be placed on the same level as counterfeiting or forgery."
"It would therefore be more in the general interest to propose and adopt, first of all, with the unanimous consent of all the Member States, an initial, limited list and then, subsequently, to extend this list gradually, thus focusing initially on terrorist crimes, organised crime, the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings and the exploitation of minors."
"Mr President, naturally, measures must be taken to combat terrorism. That much is clear."
"Upon reflection, however, it is interesting to note in this context that most countries have adequate rules."
"That being said, an extension to the mutual obligation to hand over wanted criminals might be contemplated, but it should be far more restricted than provided for here."
"Having said that, I want to say that I have difficulty finding words strong enough to express my rejection of the proposals before us."
"That rejection is something I express not only as a politician but, first and foremost, as a lawyer."
"I want to say that it is difficult to find even one lawyers' organisation of any kind in the Member States that wishes to endorse these proposals."
"They all have major or minor reservations, and many are forthright in their rejection of them because it is a case of the end justifying the means, and the means to be used amount to a violation of what are fundamental ideals in terms of legal rights, something which, for example, Denmark' s General Council of the Bar has come out very strongly against."
"In my view, this panic reaction has meant that these proposals have been treated with a quite scandalous disregard for any basic demand that they be properly examined."
"These fundamental legal reforms, which are among the most complicated of legislative matter and require an extensive consultation procedure, are to be implemented without any substantial debate on the issues involved and on the basis of, if I may say so, Commissioner, what is, to put it mildly, inadequate preparation."
"It is unpleasantly reminiscent of political 'body-snatching' , and that is a violation of fundamental legal rights."
"Madam President, there is a pressing need to harmonise judicial standards but I would like to draw the attention of the President and the Members to the need to harmonise the roles of the intelligence and anti-terrorist bodies as well, for otherwise harmonising judicial standards will serve no purpose."
"Current events show just how necessary this is, irrespective of the many considerations put forward by Members from the left side of the House which have the effect of shifting our attention away from the numerous dangers presented by the way terrorist groups work and are interconnected."
"In fact, by way of example, the revelations published today in the Italian daily newspaper La Repubblica on the change of hands of important nuclear material which is already part of the stock owned by the Mobutu regime, offer a very serious perspective on this trafficking which has taken place and may still be taking place at this very moment in the States of the European Union."
"The story of this transaction, the protagonist of which was a former governmental ambassador who was moving freely throughout Europe by virtue of his status as a political refugee, is incredible."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually tragic that it took an event like the dramatic terrorist attacks in New York and in Washington to rouse Europe, and the European Council in particular, from slumber, but I am glad that we have managed in such a very short time to put together a package - a counter-terrorism package."
"It extends from money laundering, by way of the freezing of accounts, to the measures we are discussing today."
"I am glad that, at last, terrorism is defined as an offence in all fifteen Member States and not just in six, as was formerly the case, and can therefore be proceeded against."
"I am glad that there is the hope of a European arrest warrant."
"I hope that national animosities do not again lead to the postponement of this European arrest warrant, which we so urgently need."
"Just go back to Parliament's proposal, when, I believe, the position we took up was a good one."
"I am glad that we will make Eurojust a reality and that the enlarged powers to combat terrorism take us another step forward in the right direction."
"I am glad that Europol will have joint investigative teams."
"All this is very positive in that we are showing the public just what added value the European Union can have."
"I demand, though, that currently unresolved points in certain areas be dealt with."
"The Member States must finally be required, and with consequences in the event of their non-compliance, to supply Europol with information and to ensure optimum coordination between Eurojust and Europol and appropriate parliamentary management and monitoring."
"Parliament has made some excellent proposals on this point, and I congratulate the rapporteur and the whole team of shadow rapporteurs."
"I hope that the excellent work they have done will meet with complete support tomorrow."
"Following the attacks of 11 September, policy against terrorism had to be tightened in Europe too."
"The Commission proposal on the definition and penalty standards for acts of terrorism therefore deserves our support."
"However, the Commission proposal on a European arrest warrant with a general scope, and which abolishes the dual criminality requirement across the board is met with less enthusiasm."
"This is a bridge too far for a variety of reasons: it pushes countries with a milder climate in terms of criminal law into the defensive and calls into question the fairness of the course of justice."
"The proposed general scope is no longer related to combating terrorism."
"As such, it constitutes no ground for the enormous political pressure and the break-neck speed of the decision-making process."
"Such a proposal revolutionises the application of national and European criminal law and therefore deserves a well considered and transparent decision-making process, preceded by a proper public debate."
"Moreover, Parliament is forced to pronounce judgment on the Commission proposal while the Council has, in fact, already turned it on its head: a positive list instead of a negative one, and behind closed doors."
"One can hope and expect that the discussion in the Council will eventually culminate in an acceptable compromise, but we do not know this yet and neither are we voting on this tomorrow."
"This is why this plenary debate and the vote in this form and at this time are a little absurd and premature, in fact."
"For that reason, the delegations of the Dutch Labour Party will abstain from tomorrow' s vote on the Commission proposal for a European arrest warrant."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I will adopt a slightly different position from that of the previous speaker. The Members of the European Free Alliance will approve the measures to combat terrorism."
"We want to strengthen the criminal law measures to combat terrorism."
"However, we do want to underline that the term terrorism is to be defined as proposed by the European Parliament, for I am a little wary in that respect."
"A moment ago, we discussed the procedural motions on train and plane spotting in Greece and on the people who are imprisoned in this connection."
"You may well say that this is a completely unrelated matter, but the sense of justice is very different in the different countries."
"Similarly, the keenness with which some label anything and everything as terrorism, makes me a little suspicious."
"But the measures should not be exploited by the authorities and neither should it be possible to exploit them."
"Some of our representatives of the European Free Alliance struggle more with the European arrest warrant."
"The approval we grant in this connection is clearly conditional."
"The guarantees we want to give are contained in the EP amendments which will hopefully be adopted and which we really consider to be minimum requirements."
"If the Council refuses to accept these, we will review our position and convince our colleagues in the national parliaments of the fact that better protection of citizens' freedoms is necessary for a fair course of justice."
"In other words, this is about minimum conditions, but further to the speeches of both the acting President-in-Office and Commissioner Vitorino, we are quite optimistic about the right direction which this could be heading."
"It is, of course, clear that we must be able to make further progress in the harmonisation of legislation, and in the European judicial procedures involving a European public prosecutor, etc. A number of people put the federalisation of the Third Pillar first and foremost, and maybe we need to be more pro-active in this direction."
"We will not tolerate normal, democratic opposition being muzzled or suppressed, or the actions of trade unions and of movements and associations being thwarted in the name of combating terrorism."
"But more than anything, we also want progress to be made in the fight against internationally organised crime."
"I have first-hand experience of hopeless situations in the fight to surrender people of whom it had been clearly proven that they had committed crimes."
"I therefore want to give you my unqualified support in this matter, but subject to the conditions I have announced."
"Madam President, I too would like to join others in welcoming the opportunity to have this debate."
"The time is so short that it will not allow us to get fully into all the intricacies and details."
"However, I can say at the outset that every one of us is in common cause in opposing terrorism and violence of any kind to further political or other aims To that end, we would support coordination and cooperation between the Member States in protecting the rights and interests of each of the Member States and of the European Union as a whole, as well as its 370 million citizens."
"At the Tampere summit we took the first step towards that process."
"However, what is before us here today with regard to the European arrest warrant represents a major interference in and alteration of the national criminal justice systems and the civil rights and protections afforded to each individual within each of the Member States."
"It is a mistake to move this far, this quickly, without properly understanding or fully recognising the differences between the criminal systems within the European Union."
"Therefore, I would urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by myself and my colleagues, in particular, Amendments Nos 92 to 101, which put in place firstly, the requirement for a judicial review or a right to appeal against the warrant at both the executing and issuing stage, secondly, a common list of positive offences, which must be drawn up and not used as a stumbling block, thirdly, no interference with the double jeopardy rule, fourthly, that there must be prima facie evidence presented before the warrant can be enforced, and finally, to ensure that there is a quick trial process where a warrant is issued."
"I have represented constituents in other Member States in the European Union where they have been held without trial for two years, without getting any opportunity for habeas corpus or any opportunity to present their case."
"Finally, on the overall package on combating terrorism, we have to ensure respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms."
"It is no good for the Commissioner to say that we have the Charter of Fundamental Rights: That is only a non-legally binding political decision."
"Each Member State has signed up to the European Convention of Human Rights which puts in place specific provisions for each individual."
"I note that one Member State, just in the last week, has ridden roughshod over the rights and liberties of individuals."
"We as a European Parliament, representatives of a transnational organisation, should not allow this to continue."
"I would like to use the brief speaking time I have to highlight the plight of the too-soon forgotten victims of terrorism."
"I sat in the home of one of my constituents the other day, a woman who lost her husband because he was a member of the army and had been killed by IRA terrorists."
"When she came to get compensation for her three sons - just young boys - they offered her a paltry few hundred pounds for each son."
"I could go on and list a sad litany of how terrorist victims have been treated."
"This Parliament should realise that these people need special treatment."
"The governments responsible should ensure that treatment is provided to bring some alleviation of the awful hurt and sorrow they bear."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is very difficult to talk about such sensitive issues when there is so little time available but I would like to confirm that, contrary to what many speakers have said, we have increased protection following 11 September and drawn up a raft of measures which include those we are debating this evening."
"However, last year, we instituted Eurojust and we have already delivered one major opinion, as has been mentioned, to the effect that Eurojust should harmonise judicial cooperation within Europe."
"Today, we are taking a large step forward. We are taking a quantum leap towards laying the foundations for the institution of a European public prosecutor in the future, and I therefore feel that the area of justice in which all this is taking place is gaining in significance, and it is not an area of repression, Mr Vitorino, but an area of freedom."
"I am sure you have drawn inspiration from these principles. I believe that this is an issue of primary importance on which we are about to deliver an opinion and which we feel will certainly open up a whole world of cooperation and solidarity in this area."
"There are clearly specific problems and they clearly concern the arrest warrant, which merits close reflection."
"Only Mr Di Lello could be so superficial and irresponsible as to cast such hasty aspersions on the Italian government."
"I do not feel this is fair."
"The legal institutions have their own procedures, and we are fine-tuning this European procedural law, this European area, but it is clear that we must proceed with great caution and not draw up a list of offences, for we would never finish adding to it, and any list of offences will clearly never be comprehensive."
"We must realise that transnational crimes do exist, that the crime of international terrorism does exist, Madam President, and that it is a sensitive, significant and tragic issue in today' s society."
"All we have to do, and it must be our priority, to combat it is, of course, to coordinate the activities."
"Italian procedural law, for example, has its own peculiarities, and we hope that there will be reasoned, active unanimity within the Council."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"I certainly welcome the fact that, today, we are finally debating these two reports: the Watson report and the Gebhardt report, although it is unfortunate that this should be a consequence of the tragic events of 11 September in the United States."
"However, I think that there is an opportunity here."
"We can make an advance of fundamental importance, a giant step forward in complying with the Tampere agreements and in creating a European area of freedom, security and justice, that everybody wants, respecting the balance between freedom and security, the importance of which no one doubts."
"And, most importantly, we shall be able to provide our own small contribution to the solution of this difficult, complex and painful problem that weighs heavy upon us and knows no borders, which is terrorism."
"Parliament carried out its work before 11 September and it continues to do so now: I am referring to the Resolution we approved on 5 September."
"The Commission has proved its fast reflexes in proposing the framework decisions that we are debating today."
"We hope that the European Council is also able to rise to the occasion and makes the right decisions as along the lines of those made by the Commission and that Parliament is making today, and that, at the Laeken Summit, it responds to the demands of Europe' s citizens to close the net ever tighter on terrorists and terrorism in general, despite the technical difficulties, and to appropriately punish the guilty parties who have spilt the blood of so many innocent people and who have cruelly and pointlessly ended so many lives."
"Madam President, when we were discussing the Schengen Agreement, one of the most frequent objections raised was that the borders would stop policemen and judges but not criminals."
"That was a logical objection, although the Schengen Agreement did represent a step forward."
"Well then, the instruments that the Council is about to adopt now, particularly the European arrest warrant, are the answer to these objections."
"At last, borders will no longer stop judges and police."
"I therefore see the European arrest warrant as a huge step forward in European integration too, and that is why I find the position of the Italian government, which is showing concern at the inclusion of offences, particularly financial offences, in this list, frankly incomprehensible."
"I hope that the government will review its position in the coming days and I call upon the Commission and the Council of Ministers to pursue this path, which I feel is quite appropriate given that investigations of any kind include inquiries of this nature."
"I would, moreover, point out that, last July, Parliament - including Mr Gargani and the Forza Italia group too - almost unanimously adopted the other Watson motion, which called precisely upon the Council to adopt a decision providing for a European search and arrest warrant in the area, and I would stress this, of corruption and fraud as well."
"There is, therefore, already a precedent but, in any case, I feel that this is the right path to take to achieve security and justice in Italy and Europe."
"Madam President, I come from a country that has been stunned by the most atrocious totalitarian horror, which seeks to spread terror by indiscriminate and relentless killings."
"I can say, with pride, looking at my colleague Bárbara Dührkop, and at so many victims, and almost with emotion, that in my country, nobody has given into the temptation of implementing or asking for emergency measures."
"Something that has never been understood and which no one has ever been able to tolerate in Spain is that once murderers have crossed a border that, theoretically, no longer exists, they are not pursued with the same vigour with which they are pursued in Spain."
"There is no technical reason, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that can justify this, and no European citizen will accept the explanation that, for technical reasons, we are unable to make progress on tracking down terror and crime."
"A common definition of the crime of terrorism and common sanctions are needed, as we have heard the Commission say so many times, to prevent there being safe havens in Europe where criminals can escape prosecution."
"These measures would also send out a clear political message of the European Unions' commitment to this issue."
"We can say the same of the proposal for the mutual recognition of final decisions that we have agreed to call the European search and arrest warrant."
"We support the Commission' s proposals for improvements on extradition between Member States and the elimination of the double jeopardy rule."
"I also hope that the Council will take Parliament' s wishes into consideration."
"I think, Madam President, that extending judicial cooperation in the fight against terrorism and crime is the way to become more effective whilst not reducing, by any means, the very freedom that terrorists and criminals are seeking to destroy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would first of all like to rectify an omission during my presentation."
"I forgot to thank and congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work and I therefore do so now."
"I feel that today' s debate is a very good illustration of the difficulty of the exercise, if I may use that word, of the task that we have before us, which consists of accepting both what Mrs Terrón i Cusí has just said, namely that terrorists should not have the freedom to repeat the atrocious crimes that they have committed, but, at the same time, we need to ensure that the fundamental freedoms which we all hold dear are also respected."
"That, in a nutshell, is what is making our task so difficult."
"I have tried to explain to you the approach that we are taking to this matter and that we have the twofold concern to work quickly but not negligently, to ensure respect for our fundamental freedoms as well, which should be constant, including the right to defence for those who are accused and including victim' s rights, as the victims should also receive all the necessary attention and care."
"We are trying to combine all of that, and it is clearly not an easy task, especially because, as you well know and has also been pointed out in this debate, what is more, the different Member States do not have the same legal or judicial traditions."
"All of that needs to be reconciled too."
"What I can tell you, and this is my final point, is that we will continue to keep this twofold concern in mind, and it is with this in mind that we will try, with the support and guidance of the Commission, of course, to complete our task successfully."
"Finally, just to be on the safe side, I want to confirm once again, as I did during my introductory speech, that we will, of course, ensure that action taken in the context of the exercising of political or trade union rights can under no circumstances be defined as a terrorist act or, therefore, engender the application of the new mechanisms that we are working."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to say to Mr Krarup that no, we have not acted hastily, we have been working for over a year in consultation with national experts and university lecturers."
"We have always listened to experts."
"It cannot be said that our proposal has not been thought out. I categorically refute this."
"Secondly, I would like to say that there is no need to worry, ladies and gentlemen."
"As the Minister has just said, the definition of terrorism has been improved during the Council' s work."
"It is entirely in line with the 1977 Council of Europe Convention."
"It is entirely consistent with the Indian proposal which is now under discussion at the United Nations in New York, and I can assure you that it is completely clear in the recitals that we do not include anti-globalisation demonstrations or trade union action in the scope of terrorist activities."
"It is so clear that I would describe it as Cartesian."
"You will see this from the texts."
"Finally, I would like to say that the Commission' s conscience is quite clear."
"We understand the political difficulty and, even, the political drama, constituted by this enormous step forwards that we are taking in order to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice, and we know that, ultimately, what we need to do is to be true to the values, as I am sure we will be, of respect for the rule of law and the fundamental freedoms of the citizens, but, at the same time, we know that with freedom comes the responsibility to resolutely combat crime and terrorism, and we will therefore combat crime and terrorism resolutely."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.25 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Aviation safety"
"The next item on the agenda is the debate on the report (A5-0415/2001), by Mrs Foster, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security. [COM(2001) 575 - C5-0481/2001 - 2001/0234(COD)]"
"Mr President, the tragic events of 11 September in the United States have given new impetus to the reinforcement of arrangements for aviation security."
"The European Council meeting the day after the terrorist attacks on the USA instructed the Transport Council to evaluate the measures to be taken to improve aviation security and complete its consideration of those already proposed."
"The draft regulation itself was fairly straightforward and has been amended."
"However, the attached technical annex, Document 30, based on the European Civil Aviation Conference - or ECAC - was found to be out of date."
"Whilst Parliament has responded speedily to the challenge, we believe that this should not lead to a lower level of parliamentary scrutiny and we reserve the right to amend in second reading the revised annex to this regulation adopted by the Council in its common position."
"I have met with representatives from the Council and Commission and have consulted widely with the industry."
"Due to the difficulty with the annex, as mentioned earlier, I chose to proceed with the report along the following lines: to work with the draft regulation and annex without amending the original annex as given to Parliament but to reserve the right to a second reading after the Council's common position has been adopted."
"This option accords with established procedures and ensures proper scrutiny."
"The draft regulation concerns, principally, access control and passenger luggage and freight screening on the ground at airports and is outlined fully in my explanatory statement."
"The scope does not extend to on-board security which may need to be addressed at some future date."
"The technical standards themselves are those adopted by ECAC in 1992 in Document 30, part 2, relating to security issues revised in January 2001 and, as mentioned, currently being updated."
"ECAC membership extends to 38 European States including all EU Member States."
"It is worth pointing out to Parliament that this agreement reached by the 38 countries will set a precedent in so far as for the first time the agreement will have binding force upon its contracting parties."
"Document 30 had previously been used for general guidance only."
"Following on from the joint resolution which Parliament adopted at the last plenary session on the subject of aviation, the key areas for amendment to this text are as follows: first, Member States assume responsibility for additional security costs in the light of the terrorist attacks; second, inspections of airports should be unannounced if airports are to be inspected under real operating conditions; third, Member States take responsibility in assisting employers in the screening of employees engaged in all security tasks, not least because employers are not always entitled to access personal data due to strict privacy laws; fourth, where there is a requirement for structural modifications at airports a six month time-limit will be implemented; and fifth, that a procedure be formulated, as is currently the case in ECAC, that would allow industry access to the Comitology Committee without running into problems of existing legal structures."
"In addition, on a general point, we are calling for more effective international cooperation in the area of exchange of information for security purposes."
"To conclude, we are all aware of the catastrophic effects on the aviation industry and tourist sector as a result of 11 September."
"Around 200 000 directly-related jobs have already been lost worldwide, 30 000 in the EU alone, and this is just the tip of the iceberg."
"It is not only big businesses which have been affected but also thousands of small businesses, such as small aviation clubs who produce the pilots of tomorrow."
"Airlines, airports, manufacturers, hotels, the transport sector are all reliant on finding a solution to this problem."
"This report is not the sole solution but it is a step in the right direction provided that the Member States recognise their moral duty to protect their citizens and accept their responsibility to assist in the financing of these additional security measures."
"It is quite clear that urgent action must be taken to restore public confidence which, in turn, would assist the aviation industry, the tourism sector and the European Union as a whole."
"Mr President, my group would naturally like to help in the rapid creation of common security rules for civil aviation."
"This is self-evident after the events of 11 September."
"In our opinion, there are four points at issue which we included in our amendments. In this respect, we want to take account of the interests of the industry, in which security and a fair distribution of the burden and expenses involved, must be the overriding factor."
"First of all, we must aim to achieve the highest possible level of security when it comes to the protection of airports and their users."
"This is also the least citizens can expect from us."
"Secondly, additional measures which will probably be taken at a later date, must be verified against the implementation of present legislation."
"This means that we will need to consider very carefully whether what is being proposed will also be viable in practice."
"The third point is that the Commission, in tandem with the ECAC and the ICAO, must determine whether airports in third countries, in other words, airports outside the scope of the Regulation, meet essential security conditions, for any loopholes in the new system will surface particularly at those airports."
"I know from my own experience how to board a plane in Albania without passing through bomb control."
"The fourth and last point is that we would like uniform rules to finance the proposed measures in order to prevent unfair competition."
"This could be government aid, provided that that is directly linked to the extra expenditure in connection with the present Regulation."
"It should also be demonstrated, of course, that the aid is really needed."
"The industry itself, operators and users, must also bear a proportion of the costs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament, the Council and the Commission are united in agreeing that efforts must be made to increase the safety of air travel."
"The discussions that have just begun show, too, that we are fundamentally in complete agreement with this."
"The events of 11 September have, of course, revealed additional deficiencies, which we have to consider in isolation from the structural problems already suffered by many airlines."
"The two must not be confused."
"We are of the opinion that there is room for improvement in all the areas relevant to security - the airports, the aprons, the registration and clearing of luggage, even on board the aircraft itself."
"My group and I also take the view that, since safety is in the public interest and must be guaranteed for every citizen who uses airlines, public funds must also bear their share of the costs that an increase in safety entails."
"This, of course, demands standardised European procedures, without which we will not solve the problem, and because competition would be distorted if the burden were to revert to the airports or the airlines."
"We are, of course, aware that we have a problem."
"There is, generally in Parliament, constant discussion of liberalisation, meaning that we now want to use public funds to improve safety in this liberalised sector."
"This, of course, means that we have to talk in general terms about what standards can and must be applied in order to use public money to intervene in liberalised markets."
"Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me firstly to express my gratitude to this House, to this Parliament, for including the theme of security in civil aviation on the agenda for this part-session."
"I would also like to thank you for your promptness and speed in dealing with this subject, given the urgent nature of the current situation."
"I would like to congratulate the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on having concluded its first reading of the Commission proposal in such a short time, because although this has been achieved very quickly, it must be added that this has not been done to the detriment of the quality of work carried out, and with regard to this I would particularly like to thank Mrs Foster, the rapporteur for this initiative, for the excellent work she has carried out despite the urgency of the situation, the lack of time and also for having carefully listened to all the sectors involved, which is the best way of undertaking such work."
"Taking the gravity of the situation into account and the need to give an immediate response, and considering the mandate of the European Council of 21 September, our objective was to conclude an agreement before the end of the year."
"In her report, Mrs Foster fully recognises the need to strengthen, in a standardised way, the security requirements applicable to civil aviation since 11 September."
"I am pleased to be able to tell you that the Commission is, generally speaking, in agreement with the report, given that it supports our intention of introducing common security standards for civil aviation in the European Union, of establishing a Community inspection system aimed at checking the effectiveness and uniformity of these standards, and, therefore, and on this point I insist, at improving the security measures that, as Mr Wiersma or Mr Markov pointed out, are absolutely necessary and urgent."
"With regard to the proposed amendments, we can, in principle, accept the first part of Amendment 14, which refers to the gradual introduction of specific security measures, although the measures involved and the timetable will have to be slightly adjusted."
"A series of amendments is dedicated to ensuring that part of the implementation costs of the security measures are covered by the Member States of the European Union, on a permanent or temporary basis."
"With regard to these amendments, the Commission fully agrees with the spirit of Nos 1, 6, 10, 11, 15, 19, 21 and 22, and can accept them in principle, even though they raise important issues relating to the method of financing the security measures."
"We will have to take a look at the exact wording they will need in order for the Commission to adopt them."
"Today, the situation can vary between one county and another, even between one airport and another; however, the Commission does not think that this factor could improve the effectiveness of the security measures."
"The Commission communication of 10 October, on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks, suggested that the financing, with public funds, of additional security measures could be considered a positive move."
"However, I am sorry to have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that this measure was not received with any great enthusiasm by the Council, to put it mildly."
"To tell the truth, it was not supported by the majority of States in the European Union."
"This is how I know that making such a reference in the current regulation will cause serious problems in the Council, although, I repeat, we agree with Parliament' s position, because we are aware of the tremendous crisis the European Aviation Sector is experiencing at the moment."
"This is a sector that is also having to face competition, often unfair competition, from American companies that are benefiting from significant direct aid, provided by the Administration of that country."
"It is also possible that the financing of provisions that are not directly related to the improvement of security will not be included in this regulation."
"However, with the aim of finding a solution to the significant problem of financing additional measures, I repeat that I am ready to undertake an analysis of the need to harmonise the organisation and financing of security controls in Member States, given what is happening in the United States, and to make the proposals necessary to take the result of this analysis into account."
"With this action, the Commission would be taking account of the opinion demonstrated by this Parliament through the various amendments that will surely be approved tomorrow."
"With regard to Amendment No 7, which proposes the removal of a Community control mechanism aimed at checking the proportionality and justification of stricter security measures in civil aviation adopted by Member States, the Commission must reject this amendment, even though Parliament and Council are of the same opinion."
"We think that it is legitimate to grant the Commission the power to prevent artificial restrictions that are justified for economic reasons."
"Amendment No 9 suggests that the results of the Community inspection reports should be sent to each airline."
"These reports, ladies and gentlemen, contain general information on the implementation of the regulation by European Union Member States, and on the functioning of their own quality control systems and their ability to detect faults."
"However, they do not include details such as the indication of the level of risk and its changes from airline to airline, and therefore, passing on these reports will not contribute to improving individual security, and with this in mind, the Commission cannot accept the content of this amendment."
"Other amendments have been rejected because they cause legal problems, as is the case with the last paragraph of Amendment No 14, for example, Amendment No 5, which changes the reference standards produced by an external organisation, the ECAC, Amendment No 12, which goes against comitology procedures, Amendment No 17, which would delay the entry into force of the regulation, making it subject to an impact study, without there being any indication of the final decision."
"The remaining amendments improve or clarify the text and the Commission can accept them with slight changes to their wording."
"The Commission could also accept Amendment No 20, but would point out that implementing its extraterritorial effects on the basis of bilateral or multilateral controls would be a complicated matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has spared no effort to try to achieve, or to facilitate, an agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading, on a subject that is so important and, above all, urgent."
"I fear that this may not be possible given the absence of prior agreement on tomorrow' s vote."
"I think, however, that in the near future, in March, we could be in a position where we have a text, slightly late, it must be said, but if this results in a better quality text and better proposals, this is not such a serious issue, since some of the methods we have discussed here are already being directly implemented by Member States."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Foster once again."
"And I would also like to thank Parliament for the urgency and effort it has afforded this measure, which is of fundamental importance, and I hope that in March we will finally reach full agreement between all the institutions."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Communities' financial interests"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0390/2001 by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the criminal-law protection of the Community' s financial interests. [COM(2001) 272 - C5-0225/2001 - 2001/0115(COD)];"
"A5- 0393/2001 by Mr Bösch, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the Commission annual report 2000 on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud [COM(2001) 255 - C5-0469/2001 - 2001/2186(COS)] and on the Commission communication on protecting the Communities' financial interests and the fight against fraud - Action plan for 2001-2003 [COM(2001) 254 - C5-0470/2001 - 2001/2186(COS)]"
"Mr President, protection of the Community's financial interests is a concept that the citizen out there finds difficult to understand."
"But it is of deep concern to him, as someone who pays his taxes, that his money should be used for the development and extension of a united Europe and that it should not be misused or employed for the purposes of fraud or other kinds of criminal activity."
"He has every right to demand that the European institutions to which he entrusts his money will handle it carefully and that, should frauds be committed, these will be detected and punished."
"The message we must get across is that we are using every available means to justify the citizen's trust."
"The means to hand have, though, been blunt weapons to date, and there has been increased leakage from the Community budget due to criminal practices - figures show it as having doubled to over EUR 2 billion in the past year."
"The percentage of undetected crime, may well, by the way, be even higher."
"Despite better detection of fraud, judicial cooperation across frontiers is limping along, far behind multinational organised crime."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament have been lamenting this situation for years, but little or nothing has as yet been done about it."
"The agreement on protection of the Community's financial interests, signed in Cannes all of six years ago, and the protocols appended to it, have still not been ratified by all the Member States and are therefore not in force."
"Despite all the appeals and resolutions by Parliament, and several summit declarations by the Council, there is still no common European legal area to protect the Community budget, indeed, not even an unambiguous definition of the concept of fraud against Community funds. Still less are any investigations carried out or punitive sentences handed down, which must be in equal measure effective, proportionate and deterrent."
"This blockade situation has now seen the Commission produce a proposal for a directive which recalls elements of the 1995 agreement and incorporates parts of them in the protocols, a proposal which, incidentally, Parliament had already made before the 1995 Summit."
"The Commission, rightly, bases its proposal upon Article 280(4) of the Treaty of Amsterdam under which the Community is obliged to play an active part in protecting its funds."
"This should circumvent the sterile debate about allocation to the first or third pillar of the Treaty, particularly as the Treaty of Nice affirms that the protection of the Community's finances belongs in the first pillar."
"So we should not lose ourselves in legal analyses, but send a clear signal."
"For us, the criminal-law protection of European funds against criminal misuse is a serious matter."
"We therefore welcome the Commission's proposal for the harmonisation of national legislation."
"It can, though, only be a first step towards the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office to protect Community financial interests, something that was called for at the IGC for the Treaty of Nice but was not, unfortunately, actually discussed."
"Mrs Schreyer, we are waiting impatiently for the Green Paper from the Commission on this subject."
"It would have been a good thing if we had already had this Green Paper together with the proposal for a directive."
"In order to make good this deficiency, the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control call for the next revision of the Treaties to include the establishment of a European State Prosecutor's Office, on the corpus juris model and appertaining to the first pillar."
"The course must be set for this as early as the Laeken Summit."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control proposes, as an intermediate step without amending the Treaty, the establishment of an internal financial prosecutor in accordance with the three-phase model in the second report of the Committee of Wise Men."
"As has already been said, we welcome the Commission's proposal, but call for an effective instrument, that is to say, a regulation rather than a directive."
"Why?"
"Directives commit the Member States to objectives, whilst regulations prescribe the instruments they are to use to achieve those objectives."
"The proposal for a directive is meant to insert into the criminal law of all the Member States a standard definition of offences such as fraud, corruption, money-laundering etc. to the detriment of the Community Budget."
"There is no doubt that a regulation is the legal instrument to be preferred in order to avoid new confusion of the sort that there has been in the past."
"I strongly invite Parliament, the Commission and the Council to now go down this necessary political road together."
"I ask you to adopt my report, on which no amendments have been tabled."
"Mr President, if you take a look at the figures for fraud and the irregularities affecting the European Budget in the year 2000, you see, above all, a massive increase in the irregularities that have come to light."
"Just so we can put this beyond dispute for once: for the taxpayer, it is essentially irrelevant whether it is a question of fraud or irregularity; the money has been improperly spent."
"Now, one can, of course, argue about whether more fraud is actually being committed or whether it is being cleared up more effectively, or whether there are more irregularities."
"I tend to think it is probably a combination of these."
"The Commissioner may well think differently, but we cannot go so far as to say that having discovered 100% irregularities means that we have had the best way of combating fraud, because then we will not have any budget left."
"In my position - and perhaps the Commissioner responsible was herself once a Member of this House in a past life - and in this situation, one asks oneself what would happen in a business if the management presented figures like these one year."
"Here, we are always coming up against the fact that people say we are among the best administrations."
"We are striving to be that."
"I think that what would happen would be something quite different from what the Commission expects from us as an action plan."
"The actual point of my report is that I believe we should just consider where this road might take us."
"Mrs Theato has already mentioned one possibility, and an important one at that, which we will not be able to avoid if we want to make changes."
"We must address the issue of a European State Prosecutor, and do it without excuses about amendments to the Treaty."
"The possibilities are already there in the Treaties."
"Your opposition to it, Mrs Schreyer, is your own business, but we will not carry on standing idly before our taxpayers and tell them that we just cannot do anything."
"That is not what we have a Commission for."
"The Commission is there to act, and of that I would remind you, Mrs Schreyer."
"In exactly the same way, we must give greater priority to the protection of the EU's financial interests in the applicant countries."
"There were, and are, proposals on this which amount to saying that we will, at some point, have to let our anti-fraud unit be active in an advisory capacity, which we know already."
"As the example of Slovakia has shown, the point at issue is not the acceding countries, but the continuing inability of this Commission to get a proper grip on the problematic aspects of enlargement, so that our fellow citizens might get the idea that enlargement has been prepared for in such a way, including financially, that they can happily say yes to it."
"The Commission bears great responsibility in this respect."
"Madam Commissioner, I am inclined to think that, when one has to submit those sorts of figures and turn them into something tangible, one has to seize every available opportunity to improve matters."
"My final point is on an issue on which it would be good if we could seize the opportunity for common action."
"It has to do with a question that I will raise now. Mrs Schreyer, the plan is to appoint Mr Alberto Perduca as Director of the operational department of OLAF, the anti-fraud office."
"His qualifications as a public prosecutor, his experience in combating the mafia, and also his experience at an international level make him the ideal man for the job."
"Unfortunately, his appointment has been blocked for months now by the new Italian government."
"Perhaps, Mrs Schreyer, you might tell us what the Commission has done about this to date."
"Would personal intervention by the President of the Commission not be necessary in this case?"
"Has this, as is to be hoped, already taken place?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1995 the Member States jointly signed a convention under which, in order to safeguard Community interests and finances, the Member States make fraud against Community finances a punishable offence."
"Subsequently, further protocols were signed also specifying corruption and the laundering of money derived from fraud against Community finances as criminal offences."
"There is actually nothing wrong with this convention and the protocols except that they have not all been ratified yet and therefore they are still not in force."
"I do not deny that in the year 2000 there was some movement in the direction of ratification."
"Whenever I have met with finance ministers I have constantly repeated my request that they be ratified, but the speed is determined by the slowest."
"The protocol that makes money laundering a crime has so far been ratified by only seven Member States."
"So you can see how long it would take if we were to wait for the process to be completed."
"We cannot accept that; that is why we have put forward the proposal for a directive that converts the main content of the protocol and the convention into a directive; this has already been discussed in Parliament on a number of occasions and has repeatedly been called for by the President himself."
"I would like to thank you, Mrs Theato, and, of course, the committee as a whole, for joining us in saying that things have gone far enough and we are now going to use Community law and not rely on the convention, the third pillar instrument."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control has tabled many amendments that were voted on in the Committee."
"The Commission shares the objective and concern expressed by many of these."
"But the Commission believes the present proposal for a directive is not in legal terms the right place for the vast majority of the amendments."
"I must therefore ask you not to take the proposal for a directive as some kind of tree on which to hang many wishes, concerns and suggestions, correct as these may be."
"That is especially the case with the European Public Prosecutor."
"Again a word on that, Mr Bösch. Of course, the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties."
"In our clear analysis Article 280 does not, as it appears in the Treaty, lend itself to that, not even the 'little' public prosecutor, to use that term again."
"In our estimation, and other people do share this view, there is no basis in law for the OLAF Supervisory Committee."
"Neither would it be possible to choose the instrument of the regulation, because the proposal as you now have it provides, for example, for the European Court of Justice to have an investigating judge."
"But the duties of the Court of Justice and its judicial functions are laid down in detail in the Treaty."
"It is, therefore, not possible to use a regulation to institutionalise a new investigating judge."
"That, too, requires an amendment to the Treaty."
"But we shall be presenting the Green Paper in a few weeks' time, as Mrs Theato has mentioned."
"The Green Paper will, of course, initiate a wide-ranging discussion."
"I am sure that, as protagonists of this proposal, you will take this discussion to the experts and to the Member States, so that we do not have a repeat of the situation we had in Nice, where there were only reservations and no agreement."
"In our opinion, there is no legal basis for some of the other amendments, either."
"Provisions concerning cooperation between the national criminal prosecution authorities would be incompatible with Article 280 of the Treaty since they are concerned with the application of the Member States' criminal law and their administration of criminal justice."
"Neither can the Commission go along with the suggestion of converting the directive into a regulation, since the Community cannot, at present, create law that is directly applicable in the Member States."
"I understand your concern and in view of the present situation I, of course, also support the call for your wish to be met swiftly, but we are a long way from a situation where the European Community can create directly applicable law."
"I am sure that this would really not meet with the agreement of the national parliaments either."
"The Commission is able to agree without reservation to Amendment No 2 and No 11."
"They underline, once again, how important the introduction of the new Article 280 is for protecting the Community' s financial interests."
"Amendment No 27, which provides for custodial sentences, possibly leading to extradition, is essential for effectively fighting economic crime, and the Commission would also like to agree to the first sentences of Amendment No 3 and No 7 if these should be voted on separately tomorrow."
"I also want to explicitly say that the proposals for extending the list of offences for the protection of financial interests are very worthy of note and, in my opinion, very much worthy of consideration, namely that market-rigging and abuse of office should be included."
"It is really more a question here of the strategy to be adopted."
"The Commission' s proposed strategy is to adopt the wording of the convention, more or less, as it stands and to present the Member States with a situation where they have already agreed to this very text and there is, therefore, now no reason to convert it into another instrument that sets a clear time for its transposition."
"That is one of the legislative measures the Commission is putting forward to protect the Community' s financial interests."
"The Commission has listed the proposals we put forward in the year 2000 in the fraud prevention report, for example the proposal to amend the money laundering directive, the proposal to prevent counterfeiting of the euro or measures to combat product piracy."
"That is all part of preventing fraud, after all."
"The Commission' s report also contains 50 pages listing the measures taken by the Member States to protect Community finances in the years 1999 and 2000."
"It starts with Belgium extending its customs administration' s powers to a twelve mile zone outside coastal waters and includes, for example, the creation of a central control information system by Denmark' s customs and tax administration and an increase in staff at Spain' s general inspectorates for agricultural expenditure in the regions."
"The United Kingdom has, for example, set up a coordination point for general investigations involving the Structural Funds."
"For the Structural Funds, the rapporteur, you, Mr Bösch, has included the Court of Auditors' highly critical report, which highlights the differences between the Member States in the application of the regulation that irregularities in the implementation of the Structural Funds must be reported."
"I can assure you that I share your criticism and that of the Court of Auditors."
"We are, therefore, working very hard with the Member States to get a more uniform and above all a more thorough implementation of this reporting regulation."
"And this is beginning to bear fruit."
"I really must reiterate: even if we will probably continue to differ on the interpretation, in earlier years, transposition was extremely hesitant."
"We have found that it took ages for an irregularity to be reported."
"It is now de facto better, but that, of course, also means that more irregularities are being reported."
"It is like police statistics. Is it a good thing or a bad thing when the number of cases the police detect rises or falls?"
"I really must therefore ask you not to discredit those Member States that take their reporting of irregularities seriously and make frequent reports as required by the Regulation by saying they are the 'strongholds' , because it is a difficult instrument."
"There is, as it were, a negative incentive: the more irregularities are reported, the more information we naturally have on the basis of which to make financial corrections."
"We cannot do without this mechanism."
"I also agree with the rapporteur, I agree with you, Mr Bösch, that we must make the statistics more meaningful so we can see which are the new reports and which were already in the statistics before."
"Above all, we must look at what has been the result of the reports, what measures have been taken."
"OLAF is working on it, the Directorate-General for the Budget is working on it, the Directorate-General for the Regions is working on it, but it is a laborious business."
"I am sure we will not have the success we are actually looking for next year either, but we will see that they are becoming more meaningful, as it were, sector by sector."
"It also depends on cooperation with the Member States, and OLAF is working closely with the so-called COCOLAF."
"I can inform you, however, that every suspected case of fraud, especially in the Structural Funds, is passed on to OLAF."
"The most common irregularities with the Structural Funds are concerned with cases where, for example, the Member States approve projects after the period for support has actually finished."
"Irregularities also appear, in particular, because other Community policies are not followed."
"One quite frequent irregularity is that projects have been approved without an environmental impact assessment being made first."
"A lot of money is spent on infrastructures, and that is a very common error, as I said."
"If you now ask what damage results, that is, of course, difficult to say."
"There is no financial damage, but there may be environmental damage because the environmental impact assessment was not carried out."
"Regarding the financial corrections, another important point, we shall have tighter rules for the new support period."
"In the report, you have now called for all irregularities affecting financial corrections and the Structural Funds reported in the period from 1995 to 2000 to be listed individually by 15 December."
"We do not have that information available and will not have it available so quickly."
"The Commission can promise that we will now try to get this information direct for the new irregularity reports in a way that makes the reports meaningful so that we can see which irregularities result in financial loss."
"How is the protection of financial interests directive likely to be treated in the Council?"
"Unfortunately, some Member States have already taken quite a clear stance against this directive on grounds of legal dogma."
"You have mentioned this."
"All the Member States say in the Council, yes, of course, we must do something about this, but then they argue no, that is something that belongs in the third pillar, not in the first pillar."
"I would like to see the justice ministers who argue in this way, doing so in a public debate."
"Nobody would understand it."
"And the population will not accept them saying they can do nothing because one thing is the first pillar but another is the third pillar and the Community can only take action in the third pillar."
"It is quite clear that the protection of Community interests requires Community instruments, and I am very pleased and very grateful to you that the European Parliament and the Commission are pulling in the same direction here."
"Mr President, those involved in the construction of Europe have always been prepared to take risks. This has certainly been the case as far as the protection of the Community' s financial interests is concerned."
"Parliament, notably its Committee on Budgetary Control, has indeed taken risks. We should pay tribute to the determination shown by Mrs Theato who chairs that Committee and is one of the rapporteurs."
"Having said that, I must admit that along with many other Members I share the Commission' s concern."
"We need to work towards creating an area of justice, but we must do so in a responsible manner. Throughout the whole process of the construction of Europe, the forces attempting to hinder it have consistently taken advantage of the mistakes made by more enthusiastic individuals when they lose sight of the Treaty."
"I do not wish to argue against the concept of a European Public Prosecutor, but I am concerned about laying down the details of the necessary statute. It is indeed a transitional statute but a statute nonetheless."
"The House needs to give due consideration to this office. Not only should the Committee on Budgetary Control give it due consideration, but so should the House itself."
"Such consideration should also involve dialogue with other institutions, notably the Commission. Not until that has taken place will we be in a position to move forward together and present a proposal consistent with the Treaty."
"The same applies, in my view, to the Commissioner' s comments on the rapporteur' s idea of resorting to a regulation in place of a directive."
"That is not within Parliament' s competence."
"It falls within the competence of our societies and of states governed by the rule of law."
"Only in very specific circumstances may direct obligations be imposed on citizens from a Community level."
"This is why I have ventured to voice some criticism here today, Mr President. I am, however, full of admiration for the work completed."
"I should like, first of all, to thank the two Members for all their work in writing these reports."
"They have been tireless workers on fighting fraud in the European Union since they were appointed."
"However, there is a problem."
"According to the Commission report, there has been a doubling of fraud, in particular, of the revenue collected over the year 2000."
"That is of great concern but we must put it into context and remember that much of this is due to Member States not taking fraud seriously."
"They are not collecting the money that is due to the European Union, for example, from cigarette smuggling and the money that we could get through taxes."
"Member States are also not taking fraud seriously because we still have four Member States who have not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests which means that nobody can move on in terms of fighting fraud."
"As regards the Structural Funds, 40% of the money is spent in the Member States and the data we have, in terms of following up where that money is spent, is unreliable."
"This situation is quite pathetic."
"What do we do when we find fraud?"
"We pass a file onto OLAF who do the investigation and then it sits on a shelf because nobody prosecutes."
"This is a real problem."
"Who is going to take responsibility for prosecution?"
"Only two people have ever been prosecuted by OLAF and this is a green light to fraudsters in the EU."
"We must ask if people are against the European Public Prosecutor, then what alternative do they want to see?"
"We are asking a little bit too much in this report by asking for a regulation."
"But we also know that about half the Member States are against this and there is a possibility of losing an opportunity to have a European fraud prosecutor for the EU financial interests."
"We may be asking for too much too fast and I am concerned about that, but I respect the Members for really trying to push the boat out on this fraud issue."
"Mr President, I too should like to start with a word of thanks to the two rapporteurs."
"I know that they have both worked hard on this topic from the outset."
"I should first of all like to turn my attention to the Bösch report."
"As the Liberal Group, we have tabled a few amendments to this report, to the effect that we consider mid-2002 somewhat premature as a firm deadline for a public prosecutor."
"In order to avoid any misunderstandings, we are clearly in favour of a public prosecutor, but mid-2002 is slightly too early."
"In our opinion, more attention should be devoted to the future Member States in Central and Eastern Europe and we would therefore ask the Court of Auditors to issue a report on this as soon as possible, thus enabling us to assess whether these countries are also capable of managing their financial affairs effectively before they accede."
"Furthermore, OLAF must obviously work closely together with similar organisations in the new Member States."
"We would also like to make our position clear on the Theato report: we are in support of a public prosecutor, but the lion' s share of the amendments that have been adopted in committee, in most cases by one majority vote, go too far in our view."
"At this stage, we prefer a directive to a regulation."
"We want to avoid a confrontation course with the Council: the line of the Commission is preferable to the abundance of detail in the various amendments."
"If these amendments were to be adopted at this stage, we ought to revisit them in the Committee on Budgetary Control, for we believe that, at this stage, matters of this kind should attract the greatest possible consensus and that the decision should not be made by a narrow majority."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, the Prodi Commission' s existing policy on fighting fraud can really only be described as hesitant and dilatory when it comes to the really crucial questions."
"And I have very little hope that this will change, especially in the matter of the European Financial Public Prosecutor."
"A Green Paper is all the Commission has planned for the remaining years of its term of office."
"Your much-vaunted Commission reform programme lacks the crucial safety net."
"Those who abuse their freedoms must be capable of being brought to account."
"Your first duty ought to have been to clear up the old cases and call those responsible to account."
"Instead, you are hiding behind a hesitant judiciary in Belgium and Luxembourg."
"To prevent this sad truth from becoming so evident, you are following a policy of concealing information from Parliament, which you now want to get expressly embodied in the Financial Regulation."
"You are claiming for yourself the right to decide whether informing Parliament about a procedure is in the European Union' s interest or not."
"I would like to have seen you when you were a member of the State Parliament in Berlin, Mrs Schreyer, if the Governing Mayor had told you it was not in the city' s interest to inform you about certain things."
"That is precisely how you are presuming to treat the European Parliament today and you clearly fail to appreciate that in so doing you weaken not only this Parliament but, ultimately, also the Commission of which you are part."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Stauner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Quality of petrol and diesel fuels"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0389/2001) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of petrol and diesel fuels (COM(2001) 241 - C5-0197/2001 - 2001/0107(COD))."
"Mr President, I am here, this evening, to present a report which relates to the improvement of the quality of fuels."
"The European Parliament was involved in drafting this legislation, which was originally approved in 1998, in other words, over three years ago; and Parliament was quite successful in using the co-decision procedure to push through cleaner fuels, which significantly facilitate a reduction in traffic emissions."
"Even at that stage, the European Parliament noticed that one crucial factor in improving the quality of a fuel is a reduction in its sulphur content."
"In the course of the co-decision procedure and conciliation, we accomplished a significant lowering in the sulphur content of both petrol and diesel, despite the way in which the oil industry stridently emphasised the costs of this programme."
"On the other hand, we can state that the motor industry and catalyst industry considered it absolutely essential that these low-sulphur, cleaner fuels would be introduced to the market, since, otherwise, it would not have been possible for them to bring about cleaner, better and more advanced engines which feature lower emissions."
"We are now at the directive revision stage, at which the Commission, quite rightly, has noted that sulphur is an even more strategic ingredient in the quality of fuels than we then understood."
"The Commission proposes that by 2011 both petrol and diesel fuel should, for all practical purposes, be sulphur-free."
"We are talking about very low contents."
"This is of essential importance, since it has been observed that the consumption of fuels also falls when the sulphur content is reduced, and, in the meantime, climate policy has become a central objective in the European Union."
"We must find all possible means by which we can reduce car fuel consumption."
"This is, indeed, one of the most important aims of this proposal."
"Hopefully, then, the European Parliament will come to the decision tomorrow that we will attain one hundred percent of the target of getting these sulphur-free fuels on the market as early as 2008, rather than by 2011 as the Commission is proposing."
"In our judgment, this is entirely possible, and it will be a positive influence on the development of cars."
"The motor industry will be able to develop better and more advanced engines, which will use less fuel."
"We are also proceeding from the assumption, which the Commission also proposes, that this introduction to the market shall start in 2005."
"It is important that Parliament decides that sulphur-free fuels should be available (by stages) throughout the area of the Union, with the first steps being made in 2005."
"We are also demanding that this availability be geographically comprehensive."
"Previously, the situation has been that the various Member States have proceeded at slightly different rates with regard to this improvement in the quality of fuels."
"The Environment Committee proposes that the Member States be offered the possibility of certain transitional periods or derogations when this directive is next revised."
"Parliament is proposing that this revision take place a year earlier than was decided by the Commission: we would like the revision to take place during 2005."
"Despite the demands of certain parties, the Environment Committee has decided that in this connection no topics other than sulphur should be involved."
"We can then return to the question of fuel quality parameters other than sulphur during the course of the revision in 2005."
"In my opinion, this is a well-justified policy, since the Commission will have time to study this topic in the meantime."
"I would also like to stress that a transition must be made to using cleaner fuels also in work machinery, or non-road machines of this type."
"This is entirely possible: in eight Member States diesel fuels are already being used in work machinery."
"Hopefully, Parliament will decide, tomorrow, that these work machines must begin to use cleaner fuels to the same extent as vehicles on the roads."
"The Industry Committee accepts the desirability of moving to zero sulphur in petrol and diesel."
"The hotter burn of modern vehicle engines delivers higher efficiency and thereby cuts CO2 emissions."
"However, the resulting increase in nitrogen oxide has to be dealt with by catalysts and the virtual elimination of sulphur renders the catalysts effective in dealing with these."
"A further benefit is a reduction in the emission of particulates, so the Industry Committee is in favour of the Commission proposal."
"A majority vote in the committee demanded a rather faster implementation than the Commission proposed even if some of us were concerned at the Commission's assertion that this will, in fact, produce a net increase in CO2 emissions."
"So please tell us, Commissioner, if you stand by your warning or whether you can accept the quicker implementation requested by both the Environment and the Industry Committees."
"We would also point out that the EU standard of 10 parts per million of sulphur contrasts with an American standard of 15 ppm of sulphur."
"This will make it difficult for us to import fuels from the USA in an emergency."
"We would also suggest that the Commission instigate research into the implications of ultra-fine particle emissions from gasoline diesel injection engines."
"The question of fuel quality for non-road and off-road machinery is still outstanding."
"We understand that proposals on this matter will be forthcoming in 2002."
"This is surely urgently needed but we urge the Commission to give full consideration to the interests of those in industry and agriculture who operate such machinery."
"We give this proposal a fair wind."
"Indeed, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy would suggest that the Commission hoists a spinnaker and speeds up its implementation."
"Is the Commissioner prepared to accede to this demand?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission undertook a good deal of preliminary work in preparation for this directive. I refer to the Auto-Oil I and Auto-Oil II programmes."
"This work resulted in a balanced proposal which is well-documented from a technical point of view. Congratulations are due to the Commission."
"I agree with her that it is important to make low-sulphur fuels available as soon as possible. This is because technological advances in the automotive industry permit fuel saving, and, more especially, a reduction in polluting emissions."
"It is, nonetheless, true that refineries need to consume more energy and emit more polluting gases in order to produce these fuels. Also, the environmental advantages of low-sulphur fuels will not be felt until vehicles currently on the roads are replaced."
"It is a matter of balancing out the emissions. We must therefore be pragmatic as regards schedules and adjust the pace of the introduction of the new fuels to the rate of renewal of the existing vehicle population."
"Otherwise, we would be forcing users to change their vehicles, but that is not an option."
"I do agree that it would be appropriate to reduce the transitional period during which the various fuels could coexist. For the reasons I adduced earlier, however, a degree of flexibility should be afforded to certain countries."
"My group therefore proposes that, whilst bringing the date forward, we should retain the option of granting temporary derogations to those Member States who can demonstrate that the balance of air quality will prove negative."
"The new fuel ought to be brought in for non-road mobile machinery as well. It should, however, be introduced more gradually in this case, for the same reasons as I outlined in relation to cars."
"This is the reasoning behind our Amendment No 40. I invite you to support it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all cars can take zero-sulphur fuel, whether they are new or old."
"They do not have to be converted, there are no parts to be fitted or retrofitted."
"That is a big difference from the debate about leaded and unleaded petrol that we had a few years ago."
"So any car can take low-sulphur fuel and it has a positive effect, especially with older types of diesel engines."
"Zero-sulphur fuel reduces particle emissions from these older vehicles too."
"Most of all, however, we need zero-sulphur fuel because we want new technologies to come on to the market, not in order to reduce conventional emissions but to consume less."
"We need direct injection diesel engines and direct injection petrol engines that have a wide range of lean burn."
"With lean burn, where little fuel is used, the proportion of nitrogen oxide is greater and we therefore need particular technologies to collect nitrogen oxides in the exhaust system."
"Look at it which way you will, sulphur prevents that."
"To save fuel and reduce CO2 in the transport sector we simply need zero-sulphur fuel as quickly as possible."
"I cannot see, either, why a diesel vehicle with an almost negative particulate value - the air behind is cleaner that that drawn in at the front - is allowed on our streets while on the same street there are tractors and excavators giving off particles en masse because of the poor quality fuel."
"I believe these vehicles must be required to use clean fuel, too, if we want to cut particle emissions."
"Mr President, I want to say a big thank-you to the rapporteur who has produced one of the best reports we have seen for a long time in the fuel and vehicles field."
"I agree with most of what the rapporteur has written."
"Above all, I want to emphasise the importance of bringing this proposal forward from 2011 to 2008."
"It is very good indeed that we should include fuels for non-road mobile machinery and treat the latter in the same way as all other vehicles."
"There is no reason at all to accord special treatment to machinery we do not normally see on the roads, but the Commission' s proposal would, if anything, postpone the day when anything advanced could be done in this area."
"The fact that the rapporteur proposes a thorough review of alternative fuels and also suggests that we can mix in more ethanol than the five per cent permitted under the present ceiling is also very much to be welcomed."
"I have a problem."
"This concerns the financial incentives."
"I understand the rapporteur' s train of thought, but I think the proposal is wrong in the way we have written it because, according to the Treaty, we can have financial incentives right now."
"If we insert this into every directive we now adopt, there is a risk of our creating a horizontal approach whereby we instead restrict the opportunities, as interpreted by the Council, of obtaining financial incentives."
"Through what we have written today, we are therefore doing ourselves a disservice."
"That is something I want the rapporteur to think about."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased to be able to address the European Parliament in this debate on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Wallström."
"I am pleased in one sense, because it enables me to return to a former stamping ground."
"I used to be an environment minister in the country I know best."
"But I am also unhappy I have to be here because the reason is that Commissioner Wallström is not well."
"I wish her a speedy recovery, so that she can perform for me on the Balkans on some future occasion, or even on Egypt."
"Can I say as a non-official admirer, as it were, that I recognise that the report by Mrs Hautala contributes significantly to a Commission proposal which will, I would judge bring a combination of environmental and economic benefits to our citizens."
"The availability of fuels with a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million will remove any remaining technical barriers to the introduction of the most fuel efficient vehicles, which will in turn provide a basis for further reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide."
"When used in older vehicles, there would also be substantial reductions in emissions of conventional pollutants leading to better air quality."
"Let me turn to the key issues which are raised in the proposed amendments and first of all deal with the timetable in terms which I suspect the honourable lady will find fairly familiar."
"Several of the amendments propose that the final date after which all petrol and diesel sold would be subject to a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million, should be advanced by three years to the 1 January 2008 with the possibility of derogation for those Member States where that seems to be justified."
"The Commission chose the date of 1 January 20ll, with the date for diesel subject to confirmation by 31 December, five years before in 2006, so that all Member States would enjoy a mix of air quality benefits and some reductions in CO2 emissions resulting from 10 parts per million fuel."
"Although the Commission is willing to consider some advancement in the final date from 1 January 2011, the Commission does not favour Parliament's approach linked to possible prolongation."
"The Commission therefore, cannot accept Amendments Nos 5,11, 15, 18, 23, 31, 32, 38 and 39."
"However, the Commission can accept Amendment No 30 related to advancing the date for the review."
"The Commission can also accept Amendments Nos 22 and 46 and in part, Amendments Nos 8, 17, 42, 43 and 45, relating to defining in greater detail the availability of petrol and diesel with a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per million fuel, during the introductory period."
"Then there is the question of the quality of fuel used in non-road mobile machinery."
"A number of other amendments refer to the need to improve and harmonise the quality of fuel used in this machinery across the Community."
"The Commission acknowledges that the relative importance of emissions in this sector continues to grow as the environmental performance of engines used in on-road applications improves."
"Indeed, it is already clear that the fuel used in this sector in some Member States will have to be improved in the future."
"However, as the work on the next stage of emission standards for compression ignition engines used in non-road applications is not finalised, nor is the required fuel quality for such standards yet identified, the Commission cannot at this point accept Amendments Nos 3, 12, 26, 37 and 40."
"Let me turn to some other amendments."
"The Commission does not accept Amendments Nos 10, 19 and 27 on fiscal incentives in view of the legal basis of this proposal, nor given the possibilities available to Member States under other Community legislation to fiscally promote cleaner fuels through tax incentives."
"On the question of alternative fuels, and bio-fuels in particular, the Commission is pleased to consider this subject in more depth, as work on this subject evolves."
"The Commission can therefore accept Amendments Nos 33 and 48 and in principle, Amendments Nos 14 and 44."
"The Commission can also accept Amendment No 47 in part, relating to other issues to be taken into account in the review and Amendment No 28, in principle and Amendment No 29, relating to reporting."
"Concerning the remaining amendments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 20, 21, 24, 25, 36 and 41."
"We can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 16 and 34."
"We can also accept Amendments Nos 4, 13 and 47, in part and Amendment No 35, in principle."
"Finally, I would like to say that the Parliament has significantly contributed to improving this proposal."
"There is humility for you!"
"I therefore would like to thank the rapporteur once again, for her efforts, her professionalism and her dedication and I would like to thank the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy for its input, as well."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Egypt"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"recommendation (A5-0387/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision on the signature of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and the Arab Republic of Egypt [8220/2001 - COM(2001) 184 - C5-0381/2001 - 2001/0092(AVC)] (Rapporteur: Mr Hughes Martin)"
"and on oral questions:"
"B5-0531/01 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council, on the conclusion of an association agreement with Egypt;"
"B5-0532/01 by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to the Council on the conclusion of an association agreement with Egypt."
"Pursuant to rule 146 of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion from 39 individual Members and from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calling for Mr Hughes Martin' s recommendation on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy concerning the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States and the Arab Republic of Egypt to be deferred until the January 2002 part-session whilst retaining oral questions to the Council and to the Commission on this matter on the order of business for today."
"Mr President, we realise that the situation in Egypt is one of the best, or least bad in that area."
"We are not opposing the association agreement; we are just calling for its adoption to be deferred because association agreements, in particular, contain a very tough human rights clause."
"Thus far, the Commission and the Council have never, and I repeat, never, attempted to use cooperation or association agreements to secure respect for human rights."
"Ironically, we are being called upon to vote at the precise moment when Egypt is showing a particularly worrying tendency to persecute homosexuals - with a trial in which 26 people were condemned to up to 5 years of solitary confinement - and Catholics."
"Well then, at this specific time, I do not feel that taking a few extra weeks to endorse, to ratify these association agreements in order to obtain sufficient guarantees from the Council and the Commission, as well as from the Egyptian authorities, would constitute an act of hostility towards Egypt."
"Quite the contrary, I feel that it would be an act of confidence in their, and our, ability to make human rights an essential, key factor in foreign and cooperation policy."
"Mr President, often in this House, we adopt many resolutions and we say many fine words."
"Now is a unique opportunity to influence the rights of those in Egypt whose human rights are diminished."
"We need to influence and improve the way Egypt operates in this field."
"We need to defer to give Egypt, a friend of the EU, time for reflection."
"Resolutions and words, albeit well-intentioned, seem to achieve little."
"Here is an opportunity for action."
"September 11 should have taught us that we must apply the same principles to our friends, as to our enemies."
"Egypt is a friend."
"We must give Egypt the time to reflect, because if we diminish the rights of individuals living in those countries, ultimately, we diminish our own human rights."
"I urge the House to support the motion."
"Mr President, the demand for an adjournment of this debate and vote on the draft association agreement with Egypt is completely unrealistic, not to say bizarre. It shows a complete lack of understanding of the agreement and of Egypt, a great country and a friend of Europe."
"The draft agreement contains 92 articles concerning not only economic and social issues, but also the political dialogue which is important for achieving progress and peace."
"Negotiations leading up to the agreement have taken over seven years and have been conducted in difficult circumstances."
"Those who are calling for an adjournment have clearly not thought about the consequences, especially given the current state of world affairs."
"Need I remind you that, unlike certain other Arab countries, Egypt has never been a breeding ground for terrorists?"
"On the contrary, Egypt has paid dearly for terrorism."
"It would be irresponsible not to adopt this agreement."
"It is unrealistic to expect Egypt to copy our models exactly."
"It is unrealistic to expect to be able to impose our law."
"It is unrealistic not to take account of the culture, identity and sovereignty of Egypt."
"The Member States and we, ourselves, must ratify this agreement."
"We owe it to the European Union because this agreement will be an essential factor in the necessary relaunch of the Barcelona process."
"We owe it also to Egypt, a great country and a friend of Europe, acknowledged for its role in working for peace in the Middle East."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the request to defer the debate."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased and honoured to have been appointed rapporteur for the association agreement between the European Union, the Member States and the Arab Republic of Egypt, given the importance of this agreement for both the European Union and Egypt."
"I believe it is a balanced agreement which treats both parties in an equitable way."
"The Arab Republic of Egypt is the largest Arab country in terms of population: it has over 66 million inhabitants."
"It occupies a pivotal position in terms of geopolitical affairs and plays a leading role."
"Egypt was the first Arab country to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. Since that time, it has continued to have a moderating influence in the region."
"Relations between the European Union and Egypt go back a long way. The first cooperation agreement was signed in 1972."
"We must remember that the European Union is Egypt' s most important trading partner."
"Egypt also receives significant funds from cooperation with the European Union: it received EUR 686 million through the MEDA I programme between 1996 and 1999."
"The report we are discussing today has been called a new generation report. Its fundamental objective is to help achieve peace and security in the region."
"It also aims to provide an impetus for the development of commercial and economic relations between Egypt and the European Union, and between Egypt and its Mediterranean partners. The draft agreement is based on respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights."
"The main objectives of the agreement are as follows. Firstly, the establishment of an area of free trade between Egypt and the European Union."
"This will entail the abolition of customs tariffs on industrial products within a period of 12 to 15 years after the agreement enters into force. Secondly, regional cooperation, including the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area of free trade."
"Thirdly, it establishes the basis for economic and financial cooperation in many areas, including the fight against terrorism. Lastly, an in-depth dialogue on social issues and cooperation as regards the prevention and control of illegal immigration."
"I am delighted that this proposal has received the unanimous support of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"This shows the interest the report has generated. It has also allowed people to express their concerns and fears; some of these are well founded, others less so."
"I would like to outline two of the concerns put forward."
"Firstly, there is the problem of the Coptic minority."
"Coptic Christians represent more than 10% of the population."
"It appears that, while they are not systematically persecuted, they do not have the same rights and responsibilities as their fellow Muslim citizens."
"It is also clear that extremists are to blame for some of the problems as they do everything they can to exacerbate tension between the two religious groups."
"However, some progress has been made, as confirmed by the Coptic religious leaders."
"One example is the recent construction of new monasteries and churches, despite the red tape involved."
"Secondly, certain individuals and groups have been brought before the courts. This has been highly publicised in Egypt and elsewhere."
"We need to look beyond the initial verdicts."
"The local court judges are sometimes influenced by fundamentalist teaching and hand down harsh sentences."
"But, in some instances, higher courts overturn these initial verdicts and act more leniently, in accordance with democratic principles."
"I am aware that a lot of work still remains to be done on the issues of fairness and justice, but clearly some progress has been made."
"The leaders from the opposition and from NGOs, who I have met with in the country, confirm this."
"The report has raised a number of more general concerns."
"I share some of these, but I must caution those who very willingly step forward to preach to us and to give eulogies on human rights. They should be aware of the need to put their own house in order."
"It is all too easy for the Egyptians to remind us of our own deficiencies, and they are right to do this. We are open to criticism for having been so lax on a number of issues, particularly as regards the fight against terrorism."
"We have been reminded that our Member States provide terrorists and murderers, including some Egyptians, with a safe haven where they can live and act with impunity."
"We must be on our guard."
"Many Egyptians, including some in important positions, do not wish this agreement to be ratified."
"They insist that the agreement strongly favours the European Union, especially as regards economic issues, and that it will allow random intrusions into the internal affairs of the State."
"The recent letter from the People' s Assembly on this matter is inopportune but significant."
"Given these circumstances, I hope that the great majority of Parliament will vote in favour of ratifying this agreement."
"It is to be hoped that the agreement will strengthen the role of the European Union in this region and will contribute towards achieving peace."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 14 July this year, along with some of my colleagues from the Group of the Europe People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I met the Egyptian Foreign Minister and representatives of the People' s Assembly of the Arab Republic of Egypt in Cairo. This meeting was arranged following the completion of our fact-finding mission, which took us from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and Ramallah."
"Our mission enabled us to gain a much better understanding of the gravity of the situation. It also made us more aware of the way in which the European Union is acting as a mediator in the region, thanks to the unstinting efforts of Ambassador Moratinos and his team."
"We decided to hold this meeting because we appreciate the importance of the role Egypt has played in this part of the Middle East. We recall the courageous decisions taken by President Sadat and how he paid for them with his life."
"Sadly, the latter is, today, at a standstill. We were struck by the pertinence of how our Egyptian friends assessed the situation; and this came home to me at the time of the dreadful events of 11 September."
"Three weeks ago, I was given the honour of chairing the committee drafting the final declaration of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum. This was an extraordinary session convened by the President of the European Parliament in order to tackle the new crisis and to reinvigorate the Barcelona process."
"It was thanks to the contribution of the Egyptian representative, amongst others, that this forum was able to adopt a statement. One of the things this document calls for is for the relaunch of the dialogue between the peoples living on both shores of the Mediterranean on our different cultures and religions."
"This is why I particularly welcome the excellent report by Mr Hughes Martin."
"It is indeed in the interest of both the European Union and of Egypt to formalise their association by signing the agreement the Council has put to us. It would be completely irresponsible for the European Parliament to delay the signing in any way."
"I would like those Members who are overzealous in defending human rights to consider the impression the West, in general, and the European Union, in particular, give when they preach, sometimes opportunely and sometimes inopportunely, to their partner Arab and African countries."
"They should realise that they sometimes have just as much to learn about the issue as they have to teach."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe the rapporteur has done a very good piece of work with this report and we can be pleased that after so many years of negotiations Egypt has at last agreed with us to sign this report."
"A short time ago we voted for a deferral of this report and I think anyone who really wants to address the question of human rights in Egypt must vote in favour of this report."
"This report gives us, the European Union, the ability to take up this matter because we have this human rights clause in Article 2."
"Anyone who is really interested in peace in the Middle East must support this report in any case because it strengthens a country that has been fighting for peace in the Middle East for years."
"I cannot understand why honourable Members who voted unanimously in favour of this report a week ago in committee now have reservations."
"Nothing in Egypt has changed, I do not know where anything has changed that would make anybody take a different stance now than the one we took in committee."
"I would like to raise one final point, that is the letter that the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament has written to us."
"I would like to say that it is unusual to try to influence a decision in this way, an absolutely independent decision of a parliament, and for this reason I shall tomorrow be tabling an oral amendment on behalf of my group, as already arranged with the rapporteur."
"This is particularly so if the agreement is being signed with Egypt, which is such an important country. We know and believe it can play a leading role in North-South and South-South dialogue, and be in the forefront of economic and commercial development."
"As General Morillon stated, we also believe that Egypt is ready to take the lead in all issues relating to cultural dialogue and civil society, not just in economic and financial matters, and that it is in a position to do so."
"Furthermore, Egypt' s key role as a mediator in the Arab-Israeli conflict is patently obvious."
"For all these reasons, substantiated cases of infringement of fundamental human rights and freedoms, such as those referred to today, give cause for particular concern."
"Article 2 cannot therefore be simply a political clause. It has to have tangible value."
"It is important for those countries to progress along the road to democracy. We believe the Egyptian government should take this fully into account."
"I should like to make one point clear to Mr Sakellariou. Nobody has raised the possibility of voting against this report."
"The previous vote was not for or against this report."
"As I see it, sounding a note of caution simply amounts to giving Egypt the importance due to it as a country. It does not mean penalising it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the proposed signing of an association agreement between the European Union and Egypt, which will help to strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"The European Union attaches great importance to the chapter on fundamental rights and freedoms."
"We should only sign this agreement on condition that these rights will be respected strictly."
"Since 1981, Egypt has been subject to an emergency law granting wide powers to the authorities, to the detriment of human rights and democratic freedoms."
"Today, these so-called freedoms are regulated and are subject to strict control by the authorities."
"The valuable work undertaken by NGOs has alerted us to this matter."
"We call upon the government of Egypt to repeal this emergency law, so men and women can enjoy all their rights. This would mean that people would not be criminalised on the grounds of their sexual orientation, their religion or their opinion."
"We will not remain silent on the decision to take legal action against homosexuals, which constitutes a violation of human rights which goes completely against the values we hold dear."
"We must not interfere, we must not claim that our values are superior, we must not preach but we must denounce and condemn."
"Human rights are universal and transcend all borders."
"Mr President, the fact that the European Community and its Member States are entering into an association agreement with Egypt evokes very mixed feelings in me."
"My reservations mainly revolve around the unequal and unsafe social position which Egyptian Christians find themselves in."
"The oral question to the Commission underlines this anxiety."
"How does it intend to persuade the Egyptian authorities to improve the situation of the Coptic community?"
"Bear in mind that at least six million Egyptian citizens are involved."
"It is therefore extremely regrettable that precisely the violation of their fundamental constitutional rights is not explicitly mentioned in the motion for a resolution."
"By way of illustration, I should like to quote three serious instances of abuse with which Egyptian Christians are weighed down: not only do the Egyptian authorities veto the construction of new churches, they also take part in the criminal persecution of Muslims who want to convert to Christianity."
"The latter is done under the veiled indictment of subversive activities."
"Thirdly, there is legal uncertainty among the Christian community in Upper Egypt: it is exposed to downright religious persecution by Muslim extremists."
"Such a vacuum in authority is not acceptable and cannot be solved by combining the arrest of Islamists with the random rounding up of a number of indigenous Christians."
"I would therefore urge the Commission, the Council and the Member State governments to put these abuses on the agenda during the consultation with the Egyptian authorities."
"They are duty-bound to do this on account of the content of this association agreement."
"The positive element, namely that since 11 September, the Coptic churches have been having talks with the Egyptian authority, reinforces this essential provision."
"Mr President, I, too, want to make it clear to the rapporteur that, here, nobody has proposed rejecting the association agreement with Egypt."
"We are not trying to play the high-handed human rights idealists who are against realpolitik and interests."
"Quite the opposite, rapporteur: I feel that we are just a little more realistic in our approach."
"Given that seven years have already passed, as you have said, deciding to wait maybe another month or two to give ourselves the time to find a response to specific issues before implementing an agreement which, I am glad to say, is irreversible on many points, is, I feel, being realistic."
"Attempting to pursue the issue of human rights with empty, worthless declarations of which we have made thousands in the past and will make thousands more in the future, depriving ourselves of a practical pressure lever at precisely the moment when we could be getting down to the nitty-gritty is, I feel, being unrealistic."
"What we requested is that, for once, the European Commission and the European Union should view the issue of human rights as something which needs to be given practical expression in relationships where we have bargaining power with other countries too."
"We know that there is a human rights clause, we know that this clause could, theoretically, encourage respect for human rights in Egypt and maybe even increase comprehension of a country such as Egypt in Europe."
"The problem is that the upholding of human rights, the possibility of making a direct impact, of putting tangible pressure on the human rights situation, is a policy which is not part of the European Commission' s strategy. It is a policy which has no practical expression whatsoever."
"We have endeavoured, in our proposal, to be just that little bit more realistic than you. You do not have time to wait?"
"No problem. I am all for the association agreements, I am all for free trade and I am all for Egypt!"
"However, it will not be easy to further the cause of human rights."
"Mr President, first of all, should we hurry to forge closer bonds with Egypt, assuming that unanswered questions and miscarriages of justice will fade away and resolve themselves, before we have stopped and thoroughly examined what exactly is at the heart of the State i.e. the way it treats its citizens: the cases of fundamental human rights abuse, the 52 men put on trial for their homosexuality, for Egypt wanting ""to protect order and its national values"", the conviction of 23 of these men, the repression of Christians by Islamic extremists which is allowed to go unpunished, the case of Dr Saad El-din Ibrahim and other intellectuals imprisoned for having used funds that we, the European Union, gave them."
"Moreover, correspondence with the President of the People's Assembly of Egypt and the Ambassador in Brussels only seemed to underline Egypt's complacency on this matter and eagerness to fudge and gloss over the issues."
"Does Parliament condone violations of the right to a fair trial, freedom of expression, and freedom of association whether it be social, political, religious or sexual?"
"For that is what we are saying if we gloss over the human rights issue."
"We must send out an unequivocal message that such blatant abuses of fundamental human rights cannot, must not, and will not be tolerated by the European Community."
"As this is a joint debate I propose to deal with both the report and the oral question together and I should like to say, at the outset, that we very much appreciate Egypt's position as a key regional power."
"Egypt, as a number of speakers have said, plays a significant role in supporting the Middle East peace process and the point that the honourable and gallant gentleman General Morillon made about the sacrifices that some have made in supporting that peace process is entirely correct."
"We are also delighted that Egypt supports a more substantial involvement by the European Union in the Middle East peace process."
"It is also very active in other regional issues, notably in promoting a resolution of the civil war in the Sudan, in promoting regional free trade through initiatives like the Agadir process which also involves, of course, Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and COMESA."
"We are also grateful for what Egypt does in helping to consolidate the support of the Arab world for the campaign against international terrorism."
"I can only say I am relieved at the way the vote turned out a few moments ago given that we pressed Egypt so hard to conclude the negotiations on the association agreement."
"I can remember standing in this Chamber and being asked what I was doing to press the Egyptians to come to an early agreement for the negotiations."
"So it has been a rather unusual experience for me today to find a deferral being urged."
"The association agreement was a long time in negotiation but its signature marked an important new stage in Europe's relations with Egypt."
"The 1978 Cooperation Agreement served its purpose very well but the European Union and Egypt have changed beyond recognition and a new agreement was necessary to underpin what has become an altogether more mature relationship."
"The Agreement responds to the enormous interests, both economic and political, both bilateral and regional, that the European Union and Egypt have in common and the result of the negotiations is good for both sides."
"It is good for Egypt because it will help the Egyptian economy to face the challenge of globalisation more successfully and more competitively and to carry through reforms within the context of a privileged economic and political relationship with us."
"It is good for the European Union because it will give a new depth and quality to our relationship with this key political and economic partner and, in addition, the agreement is good for the Barcelona process."
"With this agreement the infrastructure of association agreements which underpins it is now largely in place and I hope that we will make good progress shortly with Algeria, the Lebanon and Syria."
"There is now a critical mass of agreements to allow other Barcelona initiatives to flourish."
"Let me just refer again to the free trade area which is proposed between the countries which signed that agreement in Agadir."
"We must now look beyond the negotiation of the agreement into the need for prompt ratification and adequate implementation and I want to underline the point about ratification."
"It is more than a shame that the agreement with Jordan, for example, has still not been ratified by all the Member States and we need to encourage people to get on with the ratification of these agreements rather more rapidly."
"We obviously welcome the excellent report which has been drafted by the honourable gentleman Mr Martin."
"It is a very professional piece of work and we are grateful for that and the support for the rapid ratification of the agreement by Parliament."
"It is in everyone's interest that all the provisions of the agreement enter into force very quickly and I hope that the ratification process in this case proceeds expeditiously."
"This will be an important procedural step but also a very positive and encouraging signal to the Egyptian and Member State parliaments."
"Certainly, the procedural delays in the ratification process by some Member States are often incomprehensible to our Mediterranean partners."
"I have noted the concern of certain parliamentarians that our agreements with Mediterranean partners give insufficient stress to interparliamentary relations."
"Existing practice indicates that Parliament will not hesitate to develop increasing close contacts with its Egyptian counterpart but, in addition, let me stress that interparliamentary relations are well covered in the relevant texts."
"I have also noticed the European Parliament's concern, which I understand, at the state of civil, religious and political rights in Egypt."
"I can assure Members that I have not hesitated to discuss these matters regularly with my Egyptian counterparts."
"All aspects of the European Union's relationship with Egypt, including the respect for human rights, are continuously monitored by the Commission which is vigilant on human rights issues irrespective of the agreement."
"The provisions of the new agreement provide both sides with important safeguards and a valuable additional forum."
"When the agreement comes into force we will be able to raise, and hopefully resolve, any major issue at the appropriate association council or committee."
"I just make the point - very gently to honourable ladies and gentlemen who might not agree with this point and who came in a flurry of enthusiasm earlier to vote against going ahead with the ratification of this agreement - that this agreement gives us a much better forum for discussing with the Egyptians exactly the issues which they raised."
"Individual cases including alleged restrictions on the Coptic community are taken up from time to time by the Commission."
"We collaborate closely with Member States in taking positions on these issues and I hope that Parliament will have noted that we never hesitate to make our views known to the Egyptian authorities."
"I note that, as far as the inordinately light sentences on those accused of instigating murderous riots against Christians in Upper Egypt were concerned, the Court of Appeal in Egypt has ordered a retrial."
"Most recently, the Commission delegation has explained the contractual basis of grants to non-governmental organisations in the context of the Saad Ibrahim appeal which I have discussed in the past with my Egyptian counterparts."
"We have joined with Member States in expressing our concern to the Egyptian authorities at the outcome of the recent trial of homosexuals and I understand the concerns that have been expressed by honourable Members about their case."
"But we should also note encouraging developments, the new social legislation on the rights of women, the supervision of elections by the courts and the important rulings by courts on the constitutionality of contentious legislation."
"The need for good and fluid European relations with Egypt can seldom have been more important."
"In the last few weeks everybody has been talking about the vital importance of trying to demonstrate to the Arab and Islamic world that the campaign against terrorism is not the West setting Europe and the United States against the world of Islam."
"Everybody sensible has made the point that it is, at the least, unwise for us to lecture the Islamic world as though we had a monopoly of virtue."
"Everybody has talked about the importance of deepening the dialogue with the Islamic world."
"We have an agreement which gives us the chance of putting in place a foundation stone for our relations with the countries around the Mediterranean."
"The idea that you could have a serious policy on the Mediterranean without having an agreement with Egypt is ""for the birds"", as the Americans say."
"We obviously have to take up human rights..."
"(Interruption by Mr Cashman)"
"I respect the honourable Member but think he will do me the credit of knowing that I do not have to take lectures on human rights from anybody."
"We want to pursue our dialogue on human rights with Egypt and other countries in the Barcelona process but it would be bizarre to argue that Europe should have a serious constructive policy in the Mediterranean and that it should have a deep and profound dialogue with Islamic countries and at the same time reject an association agreement with Egypt."
"So I hope that Parliament will continue to take its cue from the excellent report widely commended by all Members prepared by Mr Martin."
"I hope that Parliament will continue to be vigilant about civil, political and social rights in Egypt but will also continue to work hard for a stronger relationship between the European Union and the people in government in Egypt."
"Mr President, I would just like to point out to Commissioner Patten that we already have an association agreement with an Arab country. We have had one with Tunisia for two years now and things are going from bad to worse!"
"Need I say more?"
"That was not on a point of order!"
"I would like to inform Commissioner Patten that it was not the intention of the House this evening to reject the association agreement but to defer it."
"As to lectures in human rights, we all - regardless of our record - need to be lectured on human rights."
"The debate is closed."
"In accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion for a resolution."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Aid for reconstruction"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following four reports:"
"A5-0386/2001 by Mr Lagendijk on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2666/2000 on assistance for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1628/96 and amending Regulations (EEC) No 3906/89 and (EEC) No 1360/90 and Decisions 97/256/EEC and 1999/311/EC, and Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction [COM(2001) 551 - C5-0477/2001 - 2001/0223(CNS)];"
"A5-0385/2001 by Mr Färm on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal and on the amended proposal for a Council decision amending Council Decision 1999/733/EC providing supplementary macro-financial assistance to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [COM(2001) 519 - C5-0486/2001 + COM(2001) 613 - 2001/0213(CNS)];"
"A5-0411/2001 by Mr Färm on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a Council decision on amending Council Decision 1999/325/EC providing macro-financial assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina [COM(2001) 610 - C5-0558/2001 - 2001/0250(CNS)];"
"A5-0410/2001 by Mr Färm on behalf of the Committee on Budgets on the proposal for a Council decision on amending Decision 2001/549/EC of 16 July 2001 providing macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2001) 618 - C5-0559/2001 - 2001/0258(CNS)]."
"Mr President, the answer to the question of whether we can support the Commission proposal to extend the activities of the European Agency for Reconstruction to include Macedonia is, in fact, quite simple."
"When one or two months ago the Commission presented its proposal for the first time, there was some doubt."
"This doubt had nothing to do with the appreciation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"Indeed, this Agency has had very positive feedback right from the outset."
"This positive assessment was confirmed recently by a very complimentary remark by the Court of Auditors about the prompt and effective way in which the Agency has carried out its work to date."
"Our initial doubts were, therefore, quite unrelated to the Agency, but stemmed from the fact that the Commission itself appeared unsure as to which direction to take with regard to assistance in the Balkans."
"Should it run its entire operation via the Agency for Reconstruction, first in Yugoslavia, subsequently in Macedonia and soon, perhaps, in Albania and Croatia, or should the Commission adhere to its original policy to devolve its powers to the delegations in the various countries?"
"We have, meanwhile, had the opportunity of talking to the Commissioner about this."
"He promised that the Commission will soon, early next year, come up with an opinion about the strategy to be pursued with regard to assistance in the Balkans and that it will specify more clearly the role of the Agency for Reconstruction and the role which the devolved delegations must play."
"We await this report with interest."
"At the moment, and this removes the last lingering doubt, there is no alternative but to accord the Agency an important role if we want to grant assistance in Macedonia promptly and efficiently."
"I believe that, as far as this aspect is concerned, we are in complete agreement with the Commission."
"Why is it so important to grant aid in Macedonia so quickly now and to do this, therefore, via the Agency?"
"I have pointed out the great significance of the developments in Macedonia for the European Union many times, both earlier in this debate and at other occasions, notably after 11 September."
"Macedonia' s importance is many times greater than that of a relatively small country in the Balkans."
"Indeed, it is the first time that the European Union has managed, in talking with one voice, to do a reasonable job in the Balkans, in Macedonia, something which we would have liked to have seen a long time ago."
"It is the greatest success story of European foreign policy so far."
"Talk with one voice and do what you do best: that is, after all, what the Commission and the European Union have been doing to date in Macedonia."
"There have been talks and consultations, compromises have been reached, financial aid pledged and limited military aid promised."
"In my view, that is the best that the European Union has to offer at the moment, and it is important for this effort, namely having prevented a civil war from breaking out a few months ago, to be followed up by sufficient financial aid and sufficient reconstruction equipment."
"Hence, a positive opinion, from Parliament too, about involving the Agency."
"If the situation changes for the worse in Macedonia, then I fear that that will rub off in the Balkans as a whole."
"Hence, once again, my urgent plea for involving the Agency, but also for mapping out a sound strategy."
"It is a well-known fact - fellow MEPs, Swoboda and Pack, and the Commissioner, himself, have visited the region many times - that tension in Macedonia is currently very high."
"Under pressure from the European Parliament, the European Union and many international bodies, the Macedonian Parliament has, at long last, ratified the constitution."
"That has led, and is still leading, to major tension."
"Europe can do a great deal to clear that tension, and one of the ways is to translate words into deeds swiftly."
"That is where the Agency comes in."
"In short, prompt aid in Macedonia is needed, both materially and politically."
"At the moment, we need the Agency there for reconstruction."
"I would urge the Commission to clarify its strategy in the Balkans soon, and also to specify the role which the Agency has to play and the role which other sections of the Commission will need to play in future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, I have probably set some kind of record here today, for I have been given a whole 15 minutes in which to speak, because I am rapporteur for three different, but quite similar, matters."
"Perhaps I shall not need all this time."
"It now finally looks as if developments in the Balkans are heading in the right direction and in a more stable way."
"We finally have something resembling peace, albeit under armed supervision, with continued violence between ethnic groups and still a long way to go before there is peaceful co-existence."
"It has been possible to successfully implement the disarmament of the armed groups in Macedonia, especially following important efforts by the EU."
"We can therefore feel a certain optimism, even though history has all too often shown us that peace is fragile, especially in the Western Balkans."
"Democracy, too, is making progress."
"Last autumn, the Milosevic dictatorship collapsed through the Yugoslav people' s decisive action."
"In Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, albeit with a number of problems in the last case, the democratic powers have made progress."
"Last week' s election in Kosovo was conducted impeccably."
"It felt like a privilege to be present at this historic event as an observer from the European Parliament."
"A lot remains to be done, however."
"There is a great need for purely physical reconstruction, but also for the development of the economy and infrastructure that were allowed to fall into decay during the nineties."
"The most important thing of all is, perhaps, to bring about a genuine process of reconciliation through which the ethnic cleansing that has taken place in large parts of these countries can be got to grips with and solutions found to the serious outstanding problems involving refugees and displaced persons."
"It is against this background that those of us in the Committee on Budgets have adopted three reports on temporarily extended, and also, in certain cases, increased, macro-financial assistance to Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Yugoslavia."
"First of all, a word about Macedonia."
"In November 1999, the Council decided to give Macedonia macro-financial assistance to the tune of EUR 80 million, part of it in the form of a loan, together with a contribution of up to EUR 30 million."
"The decision was taken against the background of the war in Kosovo because this crisis gave rise to large costs in Macedonia, to which hundreds of thousands of people fled."
"The aim has been to facilitate the implementation of structural reforms and to offset the consequences of the economic disruption caused by the Kosovo conflict."
"The aid, of course, has conditions attached to it, mainly to the effect that the programme of economic and public administration reforms continue and that the agreements reached in Ohrid earlier this autumn be implemented."
"As is well known, Macedonia has suffered as a result of this internal armed conflict."
"The conflict has, of course, also given rise to further problems and caused delays in making the assistance available."
"It has only been possible to pay out a portion of it within the relevant time-frame."
"That is why we now want to extend the legal basis for these forms of assistance."
"That is something we have no problems with at all."
"However, the Commission also proposes an increased financial contribution because there are beginning to be problems with Macedonia, where developments have otherwise been positive."
"The problems have been exacerbated by the conflict."
"That is why the Commission is now proposing increasing the contribution by EUR 18 million."
"Against this political background, the Committee on Budgets believes the Commission' s proposal to be well considered."
"Nonetheless, we have tabled a number of amendments in order to emphasise that this aid must be administered by the Commission, but in close consultation with both the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The background to this is that we see it as important to monitor not only the purely financial management of the assistance but also more political aspects with a view, for example, to making sure that no part of the assistance is used to equip the Macedonian army."
"We would also emphasise that this type of aid, that is to say, contributions in combination with a long-term 'soft' loan, must be seen as exceptional and not allowed to constitute the norm for the future."
"We then have the matter of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"In May 1999, we decided to provide the assistance in question, comprising a loan of EUR 20 million and contributions of up to EUR 40 million."
"This was, of course, also done to ease the economic situation and to support reconstruction in Bosnia and was obviously conditional upon the economy and the institutions of democracy continuing to be reformed."
"We have had a number of problems with implementation, as a result of which assistance amounting to EUR 15 million remains to be paid out."
"If we are to be able to make this available, we need, then, to extend the legal basis."
"In this assessment, we must also take account of the fact that the elections held in Bosnia in November 2000 led to everything' s having taken an extremely long time, what with negotiations and the High Representative' s having had to intervene etc."
"All this has delayed both the reforms and the legislative work and, thus, also delayed our making the aid available."
"Economic growth has not been particularly good."
"These forms of assistance are, therefore, genuinely needed, which is why those of us in the Committee on Budgets support the Commission' s proposal to modify this Council regulation so that we can extend the period up to the end of 2002."
"When it comes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, the same conditions must, nonetheless, apply in this case, as apply in the case of Macedonia."
"Finally, something about the third matter, Yugoslavia."
"We decided, as late as this year, to provide this macro-financial assistance of up to EUR 300 million in the form, in this case too, both of loans and of contributions."
"The primary aim is, of course, to provide financial, social and political support for a stable Yugoslavia, but it is also, and this is something I want to emphasise, to promote Yugoslavia' s role as a stabilising factor throughout the region."
"This year, it has emerged that the economic situation has, perhaps, been a little more strained than we had previously believed."
"In particular, the privatisation process has taken longer, which has also led to the State budget' s losing income from the privatisation."
"We also know it has been a tough process finding a solution to the problem of Yugoslavia' s relationship with the World Bank, the IMF etc."
"If no money is provided, there is obviously a great risk of the economic situation' s deteriorating further."
"We should, therefore, bear in mind that Yugoslavia now already has major debts amounting to more than 140 per cent of GDP."
"That is why the Commission wants these new amounts, constituting an increase of EUR 45 million, to be in the form of contributions."
"The Committee on Budgets says OK, but emphasises that these must, nonetheless, be seen as part of the EU' s multiannual programme and that they constitute exceptional assistance."
"We have also arranged for the assistance to be paid out, provided that Yugoslavia continues to develop into a constitutional state and that the country continues to cooperate closely with the International Court of Justice in The Hague."
"In all these three cases, we also believe that, in order to produce new resources during the current budget year, ordinary budget procedure must be followed."
"This can only be done by means of a parallel process involving a transfer of funds from other budget items, something which requires a decision on the part of the budgetary authority."
"Mr President, even before the last part-session in Strasbourg, the Commission wanted these matters to be dealt with as a matter of urgency."
"I said at that time that, in my view, there were nonetheless two matters that needed to be cleared up first."
"So that we, too, could see where the funds were to be taken from, we wanted, first of all, to see the Commission' s practical proposals for transferring funds in such a way as to produce the necessary EUR 45 or 18 million."
"These proposals for transferring funds are now on the table and have been discussed in the Committee on Budgets."
"Secondly, we wanted to sort out the conciliation with the Council concerning next year' s budget so as to be able to guarantee that this aid can be combined with a continued high level of other aid for the Western Balkans and for reconstruction etc. We have now reached an agreement with the Council whereby this increased macro-financial assistance is to be seen as front loading for next year' s budget appropriation."
"At the same time, we jointly accept the Commission' s preliminary draft budget for the Balkans, something which I also hope will be the result of the second budget reading during the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"Against that background, we therefore support these three proposals."
"Allow me, finally, just to say a few words about my and the Committee on Budgets' opinion on Mr Lagendijk' s report on the European Agency for Reconstruction."
"I have, myself, on quite a few occasions had the opportunity to see the Agency' s work at first hand, and I view it as a model of efficiency, as does Mr Lagendijk too. Moreover, this view is also confirmed by the Court of Auditors' report."
"I believe there are a number of specific reasons for this success. Among these are the fact that, in accordance with Parliament' s demands, a more decentralised model for decision-making and the employment of EU aid has been implemented and that it has been possible to avoid the unwieldy and duplicated decision-making that we formerly had under the traditional committee system."
"In spite of these excellent results from the Agency, the Committee on Budgets nonetheless wishes, in its amendments, to emphasise the importance of correct budget principles for distinguishing between administrative and operational expenditure with a view, for example, to our being able to make a proper, skilled assessment of the Agency' s activities."
"Moreover, we wish to introduce a reference to Article 274 of the Treaty, in order to emphasise clearly that this is aid which the Commission and not, in the first place, the Member States have the responsibility for implementing."
"Mr President, Mr Lagendijk has produced a very good report."
"I would also like to thank Mr Färm sincerely and on behalf of my group, of which I seem to be the only representative here today, thank them both and in general terms agree with everything they have said."
"I would also like to highlight a couple of things."
"I think this rapid reaction facility, this way of getting money to crisis regions quickly, efficiently and without bureaucracy, really is a good instrument."
"In Yugoslavia in particular, as the Commissioner has seen, they were grateful for this really quick and efficient assistance that was only possible because we had this instrument and did not have to use the usual longwinded procedure."
"I also believe it really must be extended to Macedonia, because something simply must be done to help the difficult political processes."
"The process is far from being completed."
"Laws need to be implemented so that the Albanian citizens can see that they really have gained something from these constitutional changes."
"The region' s Macedonian inhabitants must see that if they behave as is expected in democracies, they will also be rewarded with an improvement in their everyday lives."
"We agree to everything, we also agree to the reservations Mr Färm has mentioned."
"But I think the Commission knows all this very well and I am sure it respects it."
"This brings me back again to the establishment of the agency in Macedonia."
"In view of the pathetic results of implementation and of spending the money earmarked for this country since 1996, I am of the opinion that it is high time we sought to remedy the situation."
"Of course, the Macedonian government lacked the will, and we who were down there know they were simply not in a position to do anything."
"Whether they were unable or unwilling I would not like to say now, but there was a lack of will on the part of the government, and, in the end, the delegation on the spot was unable to give the government the help it needed."
"The necessary technical assistance that the Commission should have given to this government was lacking."
"I think it is therefore good that the Commissioner has now thought about measures that can be taken to speed things up."
"It will be good for the agency, which is doing excellent work in Kosovo - I expect we shall see that in Belgrade next weekend."
"We want it to be possible for them finally to do what the Macedonians are all waiting for and I have nothing against it being used."
"However, Commissioner, my problem is that there is so much tinkering around going on now."
"Now it is being done in Macedonia."
"I do not know when you will be so effective again next time."
"I would very much like to see a structure for this work in the region, and I would like to hear from you this evening whether you are willing or able to produce a scheme that will either, deconcentrate the delegations and enable them to do this work, or that you intend to deploy such agencies in the whole region."
"I believe you owe us an answer on that this evening and I hope that this evening you will tell us how soon you, in the Commission, believe you can lay such a scheme before us."
"On this condition, I am prepared to give you my unreserved best wishes for setting up this agency because we have all had excellent experience."
"I do not want to criticise the delegation on the ground here."
"The delegation on the ground was not able to do what we expected of it because it was not deconcentrated, whatever that means, and it could not give the technical assistance."
"In that regard, I really am looking for a longer term scheme from you so that all the countries down there can feel they are being treated, more or less, equally and I think that is also important if we are to avoid creating rivalries between them."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteurs sincerely for their work."
"Mr Lagendijk has already indicated that the situation in the Balkans today is quite different from that six months or a year ago, especially if we think of the elections in Kosovo and the settlement in Macedonia."
"But that must not mislead us into saying everything has been done, the matter has been dealt with, we can just hang around and everything will turn out well."
"I also think the step the Commission proposes is correct and justified."
"But, Commissioner, we have already said, if it is really so and I believe it is, that there are serious differences between the work of the agency and the work of the delegations, and somewhere in between them, as a sort of happy medium, the decentralised delegations, then we must draw general conclusions from that, not because, in the one case, they are good people and, in the other, bad people."
"It must surely also have something to do with the structure of the decision-making processes."
"In this respect I am sure you will not be able to give us an answer today."
"I want to ask you, however, one more thing, namely that, when restructuring the Commission' s work and policy in the Balkans; you will really use, to the full, the imagination that I am sure you, Commissioner, and many of your colleagues possess."
"For my part, I believe that the agency, which is not only a reconstruction agency but already a development agency, ought to play a greater part over all."
"I admit it can also be done jointly with delegations that are given additional tasks to do with decentralisation."
"But I do think that early next year, at the start of next year, we ought to suggest what the Commission' s assistance, support and development structure for the Balkans should look like for the next ten years, for it will take, at least, ten years to achieve the take off we all want for the Balkans and that we need for peace and stability in Europe."
"Mr President, I guess it would be a slight exaggeration to say that the Chamber was packed with knowledgeable friends of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, but those who are here are eminently qualified to address this subject because I think that the honourable Members who certainly know most about Macedonia and who are, in some respects, most knowledgeable about Southeast Europe as a whole are in this Chamber."
"I am extremely grateful for the contribution which honourable Members have made to what has been a pretty successful development of Europe's strategy in the Balkans and I am particularly grateful to the rapporteur, Mr Lagendijk, for his report."
"Perhaps I can just re-establish the context in which we are having this debate."
"Honourable Members know that Macedonia was the first country with which we negotiated a stabilisation and association agreement."
"While we were negotiating that agreement, during each of my visits to FYROM - and I have visited Skopje probably more than any other capital city in the world in the last couple of years - we were regularly on the receiving end of grumbles about the lack of speed of our delivery of development assistance."
"When the crisis came this year, we worked very hard and I pay a particular vote of gratitude to the work of my colleague, Javier Solana."
"We worked extremely hard to try to get FYROM back on the rails."
"We were delighted by the Lake Ohrid Agreement and said straightaway that we would do everything we could to help the implementation of the framework agreement in Lake Ohrid."
"My concern, as I have explained to honourable Members, was that unless we made a special effort, we would not deliver that assistance quickly enough."
"I would have very much liked to have gone through the process of deconcentration rather more rapidly to FYROM and delivered our assistance in a conventional way, but that was to run a risk."
"The most certain way in which we could deliver the assistance was by extending the work of the Reconstruction Agency and that is why we are all here this evening."
"I know that some honourable Members were understandably a little confused about our management strategy."
"With the benefit of hindsight, with which we are all much wiser, it would perhaps have been sensible if I had consulted honourable Members earlier."
"But I hope that we have managed to convince honourable Members that there was no intention on our part to downgrade our relationship with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"I saw President Trikovsky earlier this week."
"He was en route to a prayer breakfast - I am afraid I was not - and I think that we have managed to convince him and the authorities in Skopje now that we are just trying to deliver assistance as rapidly as possible and we have already been delivering assistance in the sectors electricity and housing, etc."
"It is understandable that honourable Members should think that there is some confusion in our management strategy for the whole region, But I do not feel that I am being inconsistent in arguing, on the one hand, that we have to work through Europe Aid, through deconcentration, which has now begun and which we must now push as rapidly as possible, while on the other hand, saying there may be odd occasions, particularly crises, which require different sort of arrangements."
"We are considering for example, at the moment how to deal with the situation in Afghanistan - whether we should put a task force into Afghanistan in order to get quick-acting projects going as soon as possible."
"So I do not think that it is inconsistent to press ahead with the reform of Europe Aid, while at the same time thinking that from time to time other arrangements are necessary."
"Perhaps I can just remind honourable Members that we pledged EUR 30 million to the implementation of the framework agreement and that we have also been disbursing EUR 12.5 million under the rapid reaction mechanism."
"We have committed about EUR 5 million through ECHO to humanitarian relief and we have got a regular CARDS programme of EUR 42 million for this year for FYROM."
"All that work, except the ECHO dimension, will be put through the Agency over the next couple of months."
"As far as we are concerned, the next event on the horizon will be the donors conference, which we will try to organise with the World Bank."
"There are a number of conditions, as honourable Members will know."
"We were first of all insisting on the implementation of the framework agreement on the passage of amendments to the Constitution through the Parliament in Skopje."
"We also wanted a law on local government passed, because frankly if it is not, the United States is unlikely to come to a donors conference."
"It is absolutely crucial, as my colleague Commissioner Solbes would assure you, if we are to provide macro-financial assistance at a donors conference, that there must be an agreement with the International Monetary Fund."
"Macro-financial assistance is never given unless there is such an agreement."
"President Trikovsky assured me this week that an agreement with the IMF is now on the cards and I think the relevant meeting in Washington is at the beginning of December."
"I hope therefore that on the back of the passage of the legislation, which I have referred to, the constitutional amendments and the recommendation of an agreement to the board of the IMF, we can hold a successful donors conference."
"If it is agreeable to all the parties, and to FYROM, we will do it before Christmas, but at the moment when it looks as though it is likely to be most successful."
"What I do not want to do is to set a date for a second time and have to postpone it, because that would be calamitous."
"I am very grateful to honourable Members for the fast delivery of their opinion on what we are proposing."
"I am sorry that I cannot express my gratitude by accepting all the amendments which have been put down."
"Characteristically, I am not able to do that."
"Some of the amendments, for example the references to the provisional nature of what we are doing, are of no real legal value."
"Others, I am advised, are not really suitable for inclusion in a legal decision."
"I want however to respond slightly differently to two of the arguments which have been put and which you will understand."
"First of all, I want to assure the Parliament that it would of course be consulted if there were any question of extending the Agency to other countries."
"If we were to propose that, we would of course consult the Parliament."
"Secondly, honourable Members, and this is a point that Mr Swoboda has made very eloquently, are concerned about the integrity of the management of what we are doing in Southeast Europe."
"They are concerned about the coherence of what we are doing in Southeast Europe and understandably press us to set out our strategy for the management of community assistance for the Balkans."
"I am happy to do that."
"I just beg Parliament not to press me to do it by 31 January. I will tell the Parliament why."
"We have a good team of people working on the Balkans in the Commission."
"They spend three-quarters of their time in meetings in the Council, in consultative task forces and in drafting reports; we are in the middle of drafting a report for the Council, which of course the Parliament will see, on the overall progress of the stabilisation and association process."
"I do not want to make unreasonable demands on them, but I can assure Parliament that, as early next year as I can manage it, I will come to Parliament to try to set out the sort of strategy which I think honourable Members are entitled to ask for and which we should be pleased to give."
"It is very important that Parliament should make sure from time to time that we actually know what we are doing."
"I have been in this job for just over two years and what I am going to say does not suggest that all that has happened is because there has been a new Commission - I am not suggesting that at all."
"But we have seen, first of all, a transformation in the region with the latest admirable events, as the honourable gentleman said: the elections in Kosovo and the developments in FYROM."
"We know that every time we take a couple of steps forward, something will happen which pushes us back again, but I think that from Croatia to Serbia, to Macedonia and Albania, we are heading in the right direction."
"We have a coherent strategy and we have made a remarkable amount of progress."
"We have made that progress because we have worked together in a way which has extended stability to the region and underpinned those who are prepared bravely to argue and work for economic and political reform."
"At the end of the stabilising and association process is the prospect of potential membership of the European Union."
"That has been the most formidable element in bringing greater peace and stability to Southeast Europe."
"We must make sure that the huge amount of political and financial investment that we have made in the last couple of years continues to pay off in steady progress and development."
"That will of course be more likely if we are able to continue to work with Members of the Parliament."
"Does the Commissioner agree that early next year is before the end of March?"
"Commissioner, I can also confirm that President Trikovsky was at the prayer breakfast, you were not."
"But I also note that if things go on as they are, we will soon have more Commissioners than Members in Parliament."
"That is also good to hear."
"I suggested, President that he should pray for me."
"Mr President, as I take over from Commissioner Patten who spoke on various aspects of the political situation in the Balkans, I shall focus on the three programmes for macro-financial assistance."
"As far as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is concerned, Mr Farm has made it quite clear that we are dealing with two distinct issues."
"These are firstly, increasing the amount of aid, and secondly, extending the period in which it is granted."
"To date, we have disbursed EUR 30 million. This is partly due to delays in reaching agreement with the International Monetary Fund on the economic programme."
"It is, indeed, the case that the conditions laid down pertaining to the constitutional changes now under way, and the much-needed support we are giving to economic stabilisation and the reform process mean that the International Monetary Fund' s cooperation is required. According to our information, the authorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will soon have in place an economic framework with associated follow-up."
"The economic situation remains extremely precarious."
"The International Monetary Fund has therefore informed us of the short-term financial requirements, and of the need for increased contributions by the various donors to cover the foreign financing deficit for the years 2001 and 2002."
"This is the main reason for our decision to increase our additional contribution to Macedonia by EUR 18 million."
"With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are currently implementing aid."
"EUR 60 million is committed, of which 40 million is grants and 20 million is loans."
"The first two tranches have already been disbursed, one at the end of 1999 and the other at the end of 2000. Progress is being achieved in the areas of stabilisation and economic reform."
"We have yet to disburse the final tranche of EUR 15 million. The conditions of disbursement are close to being met."
"A Commission mission charged with assessing progress achieved is in Sarajevo this week. Speaking more generally, it is fair to say that the new government formed after the elections does, on occasion, take some time to carry through reform processes."
"It is currently negotiating a new programme with the International Monetary Fund. Mr Farm also mentioned the need to extend the period agreed on, since that initially planned for implementation of contributions has expired."
"From another perspective, the rapporteur also referred to the need to adjust financial or macro-financial aid to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"The current EUR 300 million, of which 225 is loans and 75 is grants is proving insufficient."
"EUR 260 million has already been disbursed and the Commission is currently preparing to meet with the Yugoslav authorities again in the near future. We hope it will then be possible for the second tranche to be disbursed, providing the conditions are met."
"According to information received from the International Monetary Fund, however, it is clear that additional external financing will be required to eliminate the further financing deficit of EUR 150 million. This is why we are proposing to increase the grant element by EUR 45 million to a maximum grant level of EUR 120 million."
"I must commend Mr Farm on his devotion to this issue and on the speed and urgency with which he has dealt with it."
"Thanks are also due to Mr Wynn, Chairman of the Committee on Budgets and to Mr Brok, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for their support."
"I should like to classify the amendments tabled into groups."
"The amendments concerning political conditionality, the financial Regulation and the multiannual financial framework are acceptable, in principle. In some specific cases, however, they do present certain difficulties with regard to presentation or consistency."
"To take the reference CARDS in connection with multiannual assistance as an example of consistency, we have stated quite clearly on a number of occasions in plenary that CARDS has nothing to do with macro-financial assistance."
"The two elements are quite separate and I think the processes for using them correctly, in cases that might arise, should remain distinct."
"We are not favourably inclined, either, to the comment that this assistance is exceptional and will not set a precedent for the future."
"That is certainly the case."
"Nonetheless, the same is true of all macro-financial assistance."
"We do not, therefore, feel that it makes much sense to debate that today."
"Neither do we believe that it makes much sense to include elements involving additional delays in the whole process of making this assistance available."
"In this connection, whilst keeping Parliament duly informed, it would be wise to give more thought to the role of the Assistance Committee, which is quite a different body."
"More detailed information on all these issues can be made available later. I simply wished to give some indication as to our initial position."
"Thank you, Commissioner Solbes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria"
"The next item is the proposal for a European Parliament and Council resolution on the contribution to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria [COM(2001) 612 - C5-0520/2001 - 2001/0251(COD)]."
"Thank you, Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"I take the floor to defend the European Community' s contribution to the fight against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a bittersweet task."
"I am pleased that we have contrived to approve a significant financial contribution by the Union to the creation of a Global Fund as suggested by the United Nations' Secretary-General. The aim is to fight against the three most common contagious diseases in the world."
"They affect the least developed countries who find themselves trapped in a vicious circle of poverty and disease."
"The higher the level of poverty, the greater the risk of contagious diseases. In turn, a higher level of disease aggravates the degree of poverty."
"It is pleasing, too, that we have achieved this in record time, through the codecision procedure, with urgency and at first reading. A number of amendments were tabled and negotiated with the Council."
"On the other hand, I have to say how much we regret that the Council and, especially, the Commission, have put us in such a difficult position. They have presented us with a text which, as originally drafted, bypassed Parliament and denied us the right to exercise our responsibilities as a budgetary authority."
"No account was taken of Parliament' s repeated statements on the need for much more energetic action in the context of a global strategy to fight against poverty, and, in particular, against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. I refer, in particular, to the report by Bashir Khanbhai, who is with us today."
"In their common declaration last May, the Council and the Commission welcomed the United Nations Secretary-General' s proposal to set up this Global Fund."
"Back in July, the Commission announced its intention to commit EUR 120 million to finance it."
"It was only last month, however, that Parliament received the documentation enabling it to begin its work. Furthermore, the documentation was incomplete and did not allow us to work properly."
"It is only fair to note that, in the last fortnight, Parliament and the Council have demonstrated more of the willingness and flexibility required to reach agreement on the amendments we wished to introduce. I trust the latter will be adopted tomorrow morning."
"In our view, the additional nature of the contribution to the Fund is a key issue."
"As stated in our Amendment No 2, the first EUR 60 million from the 2001 budget should be added to existing resources and not withdrawn from other budget lines already earmarked for development programmes. As stated in Amendment No 3, the EUR 60 million in question should not pre-empt or impose conditions on future annual contributions."
"This is clearly stated in our Amendment No 4. I shall probably be tabling an oral amendment on this tomorrow, Commissioner, prior to the vote."
"In our view too, given the very nature of these diseases it is crucial to maintain the Union' s contribution to the fund over a period of time."
"The fight against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria must continue to be pursued energetically in the years to come."
"If it is not, it will be unsuccessful and the EUR 60 million we are contributing will be to no avail."
"As stated in Amendment No 7, the last of our amendments, we shall then be in a position to guarantee the suitability, transparency, sound management and working practices of the Global Fund. A report will duly be prepared, and should be included in future annual reports on contributions to external aid that the Community will be required to present."
"At the G8 Summit held in July 2000 in Okinawa, the rich industrialised G8 countries pledged substantial funds to fight communicable diseases and help the sick in poor countries."
"In September last year the Commission held a conference on the subject in Brussels but no action followed."
"Four million of the poorest people died in one year."
"In July 2001 another meeting took place in Genoa and Mr Prodi announced to the world's media a donation of EUR 120 million."
"My report, unanimously approved on 4 October this year has been sitting on the shelf collecting dust."
"The Council adopted a proposal for a legal basis for the fund to be implemented but so far not one euro has been given, and a further 2 million people have died."
"When terrorist bombs cause death the victims attract money very fast but the 3-4 million people who die from diseases are not in our minds."
"Why does it take the Commission so long to present a plan for implementation when they know that every day 10 000 people are dying?"
"We promise with pride but we fail to deliver."
"Do these people not matter to us?"
"The Commissioners have gone."
"There is no interest."
"Look at the audience in this Chamber, hardly anyone is here."
"That shows what priority the European Union gives to such an important project."
"This is not FYROM or Macedonia."
"This is AIDS affecting the poorest people in the world and it is about time that the EU contribution is not just EUR 20 per person dying, not just 1% of what is required, but that it is EUR 6 billion per annum."
"We have often debated these problems in the past, but quite rightly do so again tonight: 36.1 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in this world, tuberculosis is making a tragic comeback, 300 million people suffer the debilitating and painful effects of malaria."
"If anything needed a visionary, innovative and international response, it is the prevalence of these communicable diseases."
"We want to support, in principle, this global fund to fight communicable diseases."
"We want to see it concentrate on prevention as well as treatment of all three diseases."
"We want an innovative and workable governance framework."
"We want a true international partnership so it is not just seen as donor business as usual."
"We want funding mechanisms that fast-track funds so that we can maintain the political commitment and mobilise further resources."
"These are difficult issues and I sympathise with the Commission for the delays that have been forced on it in bringing forward this request for a legal base."
"But it should reflect also on why the second reading proposals on our own support through the poverty diseases line were cut back from Parliament's demands, and why President Prodi announced EUR 60 million of support from the global health fund from the ACP countries, which it was not his right to do and, as we heard in this Chamber from their President-in-Office they oppose."
"We must be concerned that this money actually adds to the global efforts and does not simply go into the pockets of the pharmaceutical companies."
"The amendments that we have constructively negotiated with the Commission and Council improve this proposal: the recognition that we need additional money, the fact that this is simply a first payment and the request to the Commission both to bring forward a legal base for future contributions and to provide a report so that some of these information issues can be dealt with."
"I ask Commissioner Nielson if he can give us a time-scale as to when that might be brought forward during the course of next year so we can deal with it properly in the budget process."
"Mr President, we have long been calling for an increase in funds for AIDS given the appalling situation."
"The European Parliament has made its stance on this issue clear in voting for the Khanbhai report."
"We were naturally very encouraged by the decision to release a further EUR 120 million."
"However, the proposal put before us today, after some prevarication, only amounts to EUR 60 million."
"Furthermore, this will come from the existing budget. This is not extra money."
"These funds are not ongoing. We also wish to question the allocation of this money to a single international fund."
"What is the aim of this fund?"
"Is it only for prevention?"
"Or will it also provide access to treatment for people living in the countries of the South?"
"Will it provide health care infrastructures and medicines?"
"These are the questions we must ask."
"How will this fund be managed?"
"How will those that need this money, namely the countries of the South, be involved in these decisions? It is not simply up to the donor countries."
"I think that we must ask ourselves all these questions because people are dying everyday, but we have money and it is up to us to help them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are faced with an unprecedented human catastrophe."
"According to the WHO report published today, 40 million people have so far become HIV positive and 3 million will die before the end of this year. It is clear that the majority of the people affected by this disease live in Sub-Saharan Africa."
"AIDS is not just a crisis in terms of human health; it also constitutes an ecological and economic disaster."
"The WHO predicts that the least developed countries will lose a fifth of their GNP between now and 2010 because of the disease."
"In countries like Zambia, one million children will die. The funds announced may appear to be substantial, but as my fellow Member said a moment ago, some questions remain to be answered."
"Who will manage these funds? Will the money really reach the people in the greatest need, for whom it was intended?"
"As we are all aware, work to combat these diseases must involve the provision of infrastructures such as dispensaries, social support structures and doctors. This cannot be done when we have diktats from the IMF and the World Bank which do not allow us to employ civil servants and doctors."
"Once again Mr President, I would like to call for the cancellation of Third World debt and for this money to be allocated to education, prevention and health. This is the right way to combat AIDS in the long term."
"I would like to finish by saying that we can no longer tolerate the arrogant attitude the pharmaceutical industry adopted last year in relation to certain countries."
"This is totally unacceptable."
"We know that pregnant women who are given AZT give birth to healthy babies."
"I hope this arrogance will cease once and for all."
"Let me first of all thank you for the kind reaction from Parliament."
"The Commission requested the urgency procedure to establish a legal base for a financial commitment to the fund under this year's budget amending the legal base of budget line B7-6211 Aid for Poverty Related Diseases in Developing Countries."
"We proposed to transfer EUR 60 million to this line."
"This proposal is of high political importance as the fund has attracted wide interest and these are high hopes for its success."
"I agree with the content of comments by Mr Sylla and Mr Rod reflecting the fact that there are indeed many questions to be asked."
"We still have many unanswered questions. This is the real reason why it has not been easy or possible for the Commission to move this dossier forward in a very nice, elegant and timely manner."
"It has not yet been negotiated at international level, but we still need the budget operation that we are discussing tonight."
"I regret that the proposal was transmitted so late in the year to the budget authority but this reflects the fact that we did not have anything good or clear enough before that."
"I appreciate your determination in Parliament to make this process a success, despite these procedural hurdles."
"I welcome the outcome of the discussions last week between the three institutions."
"I note that Parliament has made further efforts to take account of Council's wish for further changes in the recitals."
"The Commission can accept the oral amendment proposed by the honourable MEPs here today and for which you will vote tomorrow, in order to obtain a timely agreement by Council."
"As regards accounting, auditing and reporting, we want this to be totally transparent vis-à-vis Parliament."
"I would however, for the sake of transparency, like to express some sort of warning because if the idea is to pool resources in a global fund, we must avoid becoming such a difficult partner in this work by insisting on our systems of reporting, our auditing and our accounting procedures."
"This is the problem we have already with other international organisations and where the Commission is an inadequate partner in many cases."
"Some adaptability is also needed if we are to be a well-functioning partner in this endeavour."
"The Commission has no reservations as to the actual amendments presented here but we need to keep in mind that this is a collective effort and that is the whole core of the idea."
"In reply to Mr Khanbhai's remarks that not one euro has been given here, let me say that every day we are pumping money into the fight against AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis."
"It would be a big mistake to think - and even worse to express - that the only thing we are doing is in relation to this fund."
"Everybody knows that this is not the case but we hope this fund will add something to the other ways in which we are working."
"That is what we are essentially trying to ensure in the negotiations taking place right now, to see if we can straighten out these contentious issues."
"We are preparing a revised regulation for the B7-6211 budget line."
"This longer-term legal basis will serve as the base for implementation of the Programme for Action on Communicable Diseases in the years 2003-2006."
"It is proposed that future support to global initiatives such as the global fund would be financed from this budget line."
"We still have to discuss the level of funding."
"In the first reading of the Budget for 2002, Parliament proposed a new specific budget line for the fund from next year onwards but we have now agreed to regroup this specific budget line with the one for poverty diseases and use one integrated legal basis."
"As I indicated before, the Commission wishes to continue exchanges with Parliament on the modalities and working methods of the fund over the coming period."
"The fund is expected to be up and running from January 2002 and all members of the fund's transitional working group are in discussion, trying to achieve consensus on a large number of outstanding and difficult issues."
"The Commission is trying to play a constructive and active role in these discussions and I look forward to reporting to Parliament on this process."
"I also look forward to working together with Parliament to make this new fund something which will actually increase the efficiency of our response to the struggle against these diseases."
"Finally, let me reconfirm our proposal to allocate an addition EUR 60 million from the 9th EDF funds once the Cotonou Agreement is ratified and discussions have been finalised with the ACP Group."
"These funds will be earmarked for activities in ACP countries."
"I agree, this complicates, to some extent, the administrative function of a global fund, but I do not think we have any choice here."
"This is a fact of life and it is not the biggest problem we are facing."
"Thank you once again for the cooperative manner in which Parliament has handled this matter in spite of the difficulties that we have had."
"Thank you, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 00.05 a.m.)"
"I want to draw attention to the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe."
"We have seen President Mugabe's wanton non-compliance with the undertakings given at the Abuja summit on September and only last weekend the snub he delivered to the visiting EU Troika."
"It seems time now to introduce smart sanctions against Mugabe and his henchmen."
"This is what we called for in Parliament's resolution and I would ask you to use your best offices now to bring that about."
"As you know, Mr Van Orden, the comment made at the end of the troika' s visit was precisely that, if the undertakings were not complied with, the European Union would have no option but to take steps, including sanctions."
"I believe we shall be obliged to be consistent if things do not go well, as seems likely."
"Human genetics"
"The next item is the report (A5-0391/2001) by Mr Fiori, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies in Modern Medicine, on the ethical, legal, economic and social implications of human genetics [2001/2097(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in June last year, President Bill Clinton in the United States and Prime Minister Tony Blair in the United Kingdom presented to the world the map of the human genome, which had been arrived at simultaneously by their respective research groups."
"A month later, Nature brought the discoveries to the attention of the world scientific community in more detail."
"In the last few days, we have had news of the first experiment on the road towards human cloning in the United States."
"As often happens with day-after prophecies, voices are now being raised in alarm, unanimously expressing the most indignant condemnation and concern."
"The researchers themselves recognise that they have shown the way to those who might want to commit the folly of cloning a human being."
"These are two historic moments: little more than a year has passed between one and the other but it almost seems as if we are talking about two different periods in history."
"Beyond the concerns for the future, however, I think it is true to say that between these two historic moments a new approach to medicine emerged: curative medicine is giving way to a regenerative form of medicine oriented towards prediction."
"In the not too distant future, we shall probably be in a position to predict the diseases we are likely to suffer from and, more importantly, we shall be able to find ways of preventing these diseases from actually developing."
"Two opposing paths thus open up, as often happens in the history of human discoveries: on the one hand, there opens the wonderful road of therapeutic hope; on the other, there lies the grim borderline with the ethical horror of human cloning."
"We, therefore, have the paradoxical task of setting limits in the vast reaches of the unknown that lies before us."
"This is the greatest project of the new century and involves the whole of human kind."
"As people became aware of this, a need was felt to set up discussion groups to keep an eye on the ethical, social and legal implications of the new research programmes."
"The extraordinary possibilities of scientific and medical progress, seen in the light of its inherent potential, have indeed suddenly made alarm bells ring."
"It is this fear that drove Unesco to set up a bioethics committee to study the social implications of our knowledge of the genome, and that led, in 1997, to the approval of the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights."
"Then the broad consensus reached by the Declaration led the United Nations General Assembly to commemorate the 50th anniversary of another vitally important document, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, by adopting the Unesco Declaration on the genome."
"I have the feeling, however, that, when we get down to the details of the regulation, some of the principles that we have upheld so strongly dissolve away inexplicably."
"Although I am aware that this is a vast subject, I shall try to sum up the effects of the project on human rights and the dignity of human beings, which, of course, underlie our report."
"I shall summarise in four objectives the attempts and commitment to reconcile the longed-for progress of science with absolute respect for the sanctity of human life."
"The first thing that stands out is the progress made in experimental genetics for the purpose of gaining therapeutic benefits."
"Using our knowledge of the genome as a starting point, clinical experiments are then required."
"Medicine itself shows that a moment always comes when such experiments have to be carried out on human beings, and so it is clearly necessary to take every step to ensure the safety of the patients experimented on, so that there is no risk to their health or, indeed, their life, and free and informed consent must always be obtained."
"Secondly, from the little information we now have, it is true to say that our knowledge of the genome might enable us to mutate our genes."
"It is therefore absolutely essential to indicate, as from now, which doors we must never open."
"Here, I return to the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights, which bans interventions on the genome that affect the germ line."
"The events of recent days seem to me not to have taken this direction."
"Furthermore, knowledge is in a continuous state of flux and requires constant monitoring."
"From the information we have, the only certainty we can hang on to is the fact that embryos are human, whatever their fate may be."
"Thirdly, the doors opened by our knowledge of the genome lay us open to a serious risk that our privacy will be violated as a result of this very knowledge."
"We must be able to ensure that information derived from the knowledge of our genetic make-up cannot reach operators other than those who will use it for our own good."
"It is clear, indeed, that if it were possible to access information on the propensity of a particular person to a particular disease, we would be leaving ourselves open to a new source of discrimination, in the field of work, for instance, and elsewhere."
"We must be aware of this risk and of the need to take steps to prevent it."
"Lastly, another objective that comes into play for the future of human kind is the globalisation of research."
"It is clear that research requires substantial investment and that financial incentives are indispensable for progress."
"It is also true, however, that we cannot allow the need for the results of progress to become the undisputed heritage of all human kind, to be sidelined."
"If we cannot globalise the benefits of our knowledge of the human genome, we can say, right now, we have failed."
"Science, instead of being a means to create a fairer world, will have helped to widen the gap between rich and poor and will have become yet one more instrument of social division."
"In this respect, we must not forget the importance, not to mention the difficulty, of establishing proper, well thought-out patent regulations, the aim being the fair distribution of the benefits among all human beings: here again we see the balance between encouraging initiative and safeguarding human dignity and the instrument for achieving it."
"Concerned to safeguard human rights in the Member States, the Council of Europe gave precise indications at Oviedo: a ban on any form of discrimination based on genetic inheritance; a ban on interventions on the human genome that go beyond therapeutic purposes; an absolute ban on changing the hereditary genome; and a ban on choosing a baby' s sex."
"I believe we should uphold these points."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there is a series of challenges facing scientists, legal experts, students of ethics, sociologists and those like us in the institutions who have to mark out the new path."
"I approached the report - a daunting task, and I do not know if I have been up to the job you asked me to do - guided by a principle which, to me, is absolutely fundamental: I did not consider going beyond the point where progress came up against the sanctity of human life, where it started to conflict with respect for human dignity."
"At this point, I considered it should be progress that should alter its course."
"One of these alternative courses is now well known: it is a non-destructive alternative, as promising as embryo cell research but using adult cells."
"I believe we should favour this option since, as well as being promising, it does not involve any kind of ethical or social conflict."
"Respect for human dignity, in the context of biomedical research, implies that science should serve the people and not the other way round."
"All human beings must be protected at all stages of their lives, from conception until natural death, particularly if they are vulnerable or disabled."
"I am in favour of progress in scientific research, not least because it is a source of economic development, but I believe we have to ensure that it does not become a kind of death trap for human beings because due attention was not paid to the ethical principles that should underlie it."
"Finally, I would like to thank all those who have collaborated on my report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Fiori, for his excellent work."
"I believe he has presented an outstanding report, and the political message is clear: we are saying yes to research, yes to the treatment of serious diseases, but human dignity is the overriding principle and can set limits even to research."
"This means, for example, that we reject the cloning of human beings at all stages of their development."
"The news from the USA that ACT has cloned a human embryo has probably shocked us all."
"People are right to be concerned."
"I think being against the cloning of human embryos is neither right wing nor conservative."
"Let me quote from a document produced by the French Communist Party."
"It says that allowing therapeutic cloning by nuclear transfer gives rise to many ethical problems."
"The first problem concerns the embryo."
"The second concerns the woman as egg cell donor and the risk of actually creating a market."
"The third problem concerns the precautions that must be taken with reproductive cloning."
"Even if the two objectives of cloning are different, there is clearly a great danger of opening the door to a kind of automatism when we do not at present have the means to control this area."
"There is nothing more to be said."
"So-called therapeutic cloning of embryos leads to reproductive cloning and that is why it must be banned."
"That is what the Fiori report says."
"I am shocked at the amendments tabled by the social democrats and others who want to delete this passage from the Fiori report."
"Neither are the arguments of those who want the deletion logical."
"In the Caudron report we decided that we did not want to encourage the cloning of embryos."
"I want to thank Commissioner Busquin because earlier this week the Commission again made quite clear that the Commission will not support this technology."
"But if we then fail to prohibit it, that is an invitation to firms like ACT to come to Europe if it is banned in the USA."
"I cannot imagine that the majority of Parliament wants that."
"I therefore ask you to support the Fiori report and reject the deletions."
"Mr President, the work of the temporary committee on human genetics has been complex and interesting."
"The detailed and thorough report by Mr Fiori which accompanies the motion for a resolution is testimony to that."
"The motion for a resolution, presented by the rapporteur in committee, was, in its turn, a balanced synthesis of the conclusions that could be drawn from our inquiries."
"These dealt with the many ethical and political problems raised by the major scientific breakthroughs of recent years: the development of genetic tests which open up prospects of early identification and possible remedies for serious degenerative diseases, but also pose risks for the protection of personal data."
"Therefore, alongside the right to know, everybody' s right to know the likelihood of being predisposed to diseases in the future, a new right now emerges: the right not to know, to deliberately face up to the fate that life holds in store for us, trusting in the future."
"The committee addressed problems raised regarding the application of the patent system, the traditional instrument of industrial policy which favours the private funding of research, to those biotechnological and biomedical innovations that have to do with living organisms and therefore pose delicate questions of the limits between invention as a product of human activity and the discovery of living material, which cannot be appropriated."
"Finally, the committee addressed the most far-reaching dilemmas of the new frontiers of research into stem cells, which offer extraordinary potential for possible applications."
"They may be able to root out diseases that have hitherto been intractable, but they also pose radical questions of ethical principles which must be considered insurmountable."
"We are not starting from scratch, thanks, partly, to the useful work of the European Ethics Group and the large number of instruments drawn up at Community and international levels, to the extent that, two weeks ago, Parliament was able to adopt by a large majority, cautious, common criteria on this subject on the occasion of the launch of the sixth research framework programme."
"This programme prioritises the research needed in this field, funding especially those projects dealing with adult stem cells and embryonic cells from abortions or so-called supernumerary embryos, produced for the purposes of in-vitro fertilisation and no longer usable for those purposes, to the extent that the laws of the Member States permit."
"Unfortunately, the original project became distorted in committee and an attitude prevailed that was inspired by fear rather than hope."
"The spectre of monster-generating cloning was brandished, leading to the absurd conclusion that it is better to let supernumerary embryos die or be destroyed rather than to use them for the benefit of medical research that can save human kind, our children and future generations from the scourges that have afflicted us in the past and still threaten us."
"We do not want women' s bodies to be used to produce embryos for research, but it is immoral to prevent the use of those that already exist for the benefit of human kind."
"Human dignity was invoked not in support of saving people from humiliating suffering but just to safeguard the first clusters of cells in the early stages of the embryo."
"Never, but never in the history of human kind, has the human embryo had the kind of protection it has today."
"Lawful, regulated and controlled research is being branded as about to open the door to dreadful speculation, almost as if we should ban organ transplants, which save lives, just because there may be a black market in organs."
"Let us combat the black market, but do not let us sacrifice hopes of recovery!"
"Some invoke religious laws in order to get out of the responsibility, which strict secular ethics place on those who are democratically elected, of making choices for the common good."
"What we need to do, instead, is to weigh up the values that are at stake and - proceeding with all due caution and prudence, keeping within all reasonable bounds and opposing all commercial arguments - still allow freedom of conscience, freedom of research and hope for new breakthroughs in the treatment of terrible diseases."
"That is why my group hopes that the European Parliament will not go back on what it wisely decided only a fortnight ago."
"Mr President, Commissioner, do we wish Europe to become a museum?"
"This was the question put by one of my colleagues in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, having studied the report on human genetics."
"This debate raises many ethical issues and possesses many ethical dimensions."
"On the one hand, we have the important ethical dimension of respect for human dignity and for the individual and, on the other, an ethically motivated desire to relieve suffering."
"It is the first of these dimensions, that of respect for the individual, which has dominated the committee' s report."
"Although we are not now debating legislation, we are sending important signals to those concerned with these issues, that is, the research community and people with illnesses."
"Are we signalling to the research community that it is hardly worth trying to carry out promising stem cell research in Europe?"
"Are we signalling to patients suffering illnesses that currently cannot be cured or treated that we do not wish to explore avenues of research which might lead to relief for them?"
"As Liberals, we have the greatest respect for knowledge and research, including stem cell research."
"At this stage, we do not know the exact implications for humans, but animal experiments have produced promising results."
"We must not, therefore, rule out embryonic stem cell research."
"Rather, it must be able to proceed in parallel with research into other stem cells, as parallel research will enable us to increase our knowledge base."
"Each needs the other."
"We believe that public support for research is vital in order to ensure that the results benefit as broad a range of people as possible and, indeed, the whole world."
"We should have liked to have seen the sixth framework programme for research support therapeutic cloning."
"A total ban on certain forms of research leads to greater risks of abuse and risk-taking."
"There are certainly elements of the research which ought to be monitored by public bodies, and I believe that public support also increases the opportunities for such monitoring."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party thinks it is vital for discussions to continue and, above all, to be conducted in greater depth."
"However, no one should have a monopoly on ethical issues."
"Personally, I am highly sceptical of the way in which the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, which advises the Commission, has been operating."
"Its work has certainly not been conducted openly."
"Nor do I believe that critical debate has been permitted within the group."
"In Parliament too, we must consider the matter in much greater depth than we were able to do in the temporary committee, particularly in terms of issues such as insurance, genetics and working conditions."
"However, the genetics debate should be conducted in all the committees in order to achieve a greater balance of views than is currently the case."
"Finally, I should like, on behalf of the Group of the Europe Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to state that we are unable to vote in favour of the report in its current form."
"Only if certain amendments are adopted in the final report shall we be able to offer our support."
"Mr President, the first human cloning experiments in the USA must be a warning to us to call a clear halt to all human cloning today."
"The distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning is a semantic ploy."
"In both cases, an embryo is produced, declared surplus, destroyed and used as a raw material."
"We must therefore come out quite clearly against cloning because the deliberate creation of life for research purposes is a violation of human dignity."
"Human beings must never be a means to an end."
"Human life is not a consumable commodity."
"It must not be reduced to a commodity and the production of human embryos for spare parts is incompatible with human dignity; for us, and we must make that clear today, human dignity clearly takes precedence over research."
"Therapeutic cloning paves the way for reproductive cloning and has a bandwagon effect."
"We must impose a clear ban on therapeutic cloning, otherwise there will be no way of stopping the risk of escalation in the worldwide consumption of embryos."
"Embryonic stem cell research also involves the destruction of embryos."
"Here, too, the main purpose is therapeutic cloning."
"We must, therefore, send a clear signal today that we do not want a society where women become suppliers of eggs and embryos become lucrative merchandise."
"Adult stem cell research provides us with a clear alternative to embryonic stem cell research, making therapeutic cloning unnecessary."
"When it comes to patenting, too, we must quite clearly expect the Commission to put a clear end to the current situation, where it is unclear what can be patented, and give the Member States clear guidance here, because we must not reinterpret the discovery of human life as an invention."
"Human life is not created by third parties."
"We, therefore, need a very clear signal."
"Europe must not be an ethical minefield."
"We need clear ethical boundaries."
"We cannot have loopholes in the law and human dignity must clearly be our guiding principle."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, encounters between politics and research are not always easy."
"Research itself is impossible to imagine without risks."
"At the present time, research on stem cells is just beginning, and we do not have time to wait for its results in ten or twelve years' time."
"That was the whole point of the committee that we created last year."
"Last week, when we voted on the Sixth Research Framework Programme, we voted in favour of a hierarchical classification of priorities and funding for genetics research."
"I agree with that restrained vote, which is in line with the opinion of the European Ethics Committee."
"The risk identified by today' s report is that medical research involves the desire to clone human beings."
"The report proposes that any attempt in that direction should be prohibited, and, above all, penalised."
"I welcome, in particular, the fact that we went further than simply declaring a prohibition, and I campaigned to make reproductive cloning criminal."
"However, must we infer from this that the therapeutic aspect of research into stem cells, whether adult or embryonic, should be condemned and rejected?"
"Who is attributing to today' s scientists and researchers these projects that are bound to be diabolical?"
"Is it the researchers themselves, or is it other people?"
"We must avoid lumping together the two types of cloning, and here I disagree with the previous speaker, and perhaps we should regard the human race as being capable of producing guarantees and controls."
"I would remind you of the story of Frankenstein' s monster, which is one of the founding myths of our modern world."
"The monster asked his creator to give him a female companion, if you remember."
"Professor Frankenstein started to create the female equivalent of the monster."
"He started, but then he refused to create a fiancée for him."
"In doing so, he refused to give the monster the possibility of producing descendants, thereby condemning him to solitude and death."
"So that was the end of the story of Frankenstein' s monster."
"In this myth, which is one of the founding myths of our era, the human race showed its capacity to exercise control over itself."
"Now, if we assume that there will be cloning for therapeutic purposes, and remember that this will involve stem cells, there are two human issues involved here, and I should like to conclude by reminding you of what they are, namely the status of the embryo and the use of women' s bodies."
"These are complicated issues, and there are some people who do not know the difference between cells and embryos, and who do not want to see any research carried out, not even on the supernumerary embryos resulting from medically assisted reproductive procedures, or on embryos resulting from abortions."
"Let us be quite clear about this, in expressing this view they are once again bringing up the question of whether abortion should be a criminal offence."
"That is politics, not research."
"Other people, including myself, point out that the production of stem cells requires the use of oocytes produced by women."
"We must be careful, and here I agree with other female speakers, not to exploit women for research purposes, and I very much regret the fact that, at a recent meeting of the coordinators, which unfortunately I did not attend, it was decided to do away with recital AJ, which was one of my amendments, without there having been any collective consultation."
"We have therefore re-tabled it."
"That leads me, finally, to emphasise that there is concern on two fronts, firstly, concern on the part of those who want to re-launch the campaign against a woman' s right to abortion, and, secondly, concern on the part of those who would be involved for the purpose of commercialising women' s bodies."
"It is complicated and it is difficult."
"Having said that, there are some things in this report that I have set my heart on: the need to ensure that no payment is involved, the need for consent, and the requirement that there should be no discrimination, as regards employment and insurance, based on genetic tests."
"Mr President, this is obviously an important debate and I share the concern of Members who are anxious to support research to enable the genuine and continual advance of medicine and the improvement of the quality of life for the individual and society, while at the same time, safeguarding the dignity of each individual from abuse, resulting from breaches of the ethical standards necessary for the implementation of these safeguards."
"Scientists who deliberately ignore these safeguards are doing a disservice to science and are acting contrary to the common good."
"Events of recent days clearly bring this possibility into focus and must surely alert Parliament to the need for quick and positive action."
"While not wishing to dispute assurances given by researchers that the breakthrough is not aimed at creating a human being, the reality is that such a fundamental issue cannot now be entrusted to individuals who are free to operate outside existing legislation."
"On behalf of my group, I fully support the provisions of paragraphs 54 and 55 of the motion for resolution which call for a ban on human cloning, regardless of the technique used, and on other activities which are intended to result in the modification of the human gene line."
"For citizens, and indeed parliamentarians, this is a sensitive and complex issue and I do not consider myself qualified to deal with the many scientific arguments in this debate."
"But of this I am certain: society will not tolerate, and must be protected from, any intrusion, deliberate or otherwise, that reduces the dignity and the sanctity of each human being to an object of scientific manipulation."
"We, who share in the wonderment of our creation, must act now in the interests of mankind."
"Mr President, it is disappointing that we are only now able to deal with the important report of the temporary committee on human genetics."
"The Fiori report provides an ethical framework for genetic research, but, unfortunately, this is partly shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, since the financing of this research is established in the sixth framework programme."
"I appeal to the Council, where this subject has still to be dealt with, to use a well-considered ethical framework."
"This would mean, at any rate, that research which is banned in one or more Member States, such as research with human embryos, would never be eligible for Community funding."
"The Fiori report gives a good overview of the ethical and other dilemmas that this research on human genetics entails."
"The temporary committee has put a year' s hard work into it and, in general, I am satisfied with the report before us."
"The report was radically modified by the rapporteur after revision."
"That was certainly necessary, but I still find something lacking."
"Not a particular topic, because all topics relating to human genetics are tackled in this report, but nevertheless ..."
"My Christian philosophy sees this world with all its plants, animals and human beings as God' s creation."
"A creation which God imbued with numerous possibilities."
"As a result, man is able to find solutions to problems."
"I believe that man must search for therapies and treatments for disease and that he is entitled to find them."
"I refuse, however, to believe that research into the curing of diseases must involve the use of human embryos."
"An embryo is a potential human being, contains all the ingredients necessary to become a person and is one of God' s creatures and as such deserving of protection from the very beginning."
"To repeat the words of the philosopher Immanuel Kant: ""Act in such a way that you use man partly as an end and never as simply a means"" ."
"And if human embryos are used for research and are destroyed in the process, that is precisely what is happening."
"This applies both to embryos left over from in-vitro fertilisation and to embryos produced specially for research purposes."
"We were astonished to hear reports that human embryos have been cloned in the United States."
"This instrumentalisation of incipient human life is morally completely unacceptable."
"Fortunately, Commissioner Busquin followed President Bush in condemning this experiment."
"The Fiori report rightly calls for a ban on this therapeutic cloning."
"Apart from that, I have serious misgivings about the exaggerated expectations aroused by some researchers and also by some of us, not only among healthy citizens, but worse, still, among patients."
"If this type of research ever finds therapeutic application at all, it will not be for at least another one to two decades."
"But what of the splendid therapies that can be developed with the aid of stem cells? Should we not develop and use them?"
"I believe so, but again, not at the expense of human embryos."
"Hence it is a miracle, and I see it as a blessing from God, that adult stem cells have been discovered."
"These stem cells, which are found in the umbilical cord, fat tissue and brain tissue, can be differentiated and also form a rich diversity of tissue types."
"So let us put all our resources, expertise and not least funding into developing therapies with the aid of this promising adult stem cell research."
"I congratulate rapporteur Fiori on the fruit of his labours presently before us, and hope that it emerges unscathed from this session."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, seldom has Parliament come up against such a sensitive and, at the same time, such an important subject as that dealt with in the Fiori report."
"This subject is utterly and completely political, a proper subject for the legislator, as we radicals have been trying in vain to make people understand in our country; it is a subject for society, concerning, first and foremost, the millions and millions of people suffering from, so far, incurable diseases, who look to us for an answer which may bring them real hope of health and life."
"Today we are potentially faced with one of those great changes in the story of human kind, comparable to the discovery of penicillin or vaccines."
"We are faced with a decisive choice that it would be unrealistic and tragic to hold back from."
"From this viewpoint, I regret to say, the excellent and instructive work by Mr Fiori has given way to a base text that is the result of the combined provisions of two fundamentalisms that are well rooted in this Parliament, which, like any fundamentalism, would like Europe to stand still while, all around it, the world is moving on."
"The spirit of Galileo is with us today."
"For us radicals, today' s choice should be clear: 'no' to the Fiori report as it stands; 'yes' to most of the amendments tabled, to achieve freedom of scientific research; 'yes' to all kinds of therapeutic research that can give life and not death to the life that really exists, not that which is only present in textbooks and now lies in laboratory freezers, waiting to be destroyed; and so 'yes' to research on stem cells, which are, in practical terms, more malleable; 'yes' to research on supernumerary embryos that have no chance of life; 'yes' to therapeutic cloning, which - as stated authoritatively by the Nobel Prize-winner, Professor Dulbecco, only yesterday and the former Italian health minister Mr Veronesi today - has nothing whatever to do with human cloning; in short, 'yes' to an adult, secular Europe that is responsible in the matter of research."
"Mr President, I simply wish to inform you that the students reading for the Masters degree in political science of the Spanish Government' s external and Latin American foundation are present in the guest' s gallery."
"They are a distinguished group of young politicians - local councillors, members of parliament, high-level officials of public administrations - from various Latin American countries who are visiting us and who have spent a fruitful working stay in Brussels this week. They are a good illustration, Mr President, of the increasingly close ties between Europe and Latin America."
"Thank you, Mr Vidal-Quadras."
"I agree with you."
"Mr President, much attention has been given to the matter we are working on today."
"We have interviewed many experts and made many visits."
"We have conferred with parliamentary colleagues at home and abroad, from both Member States and candidate countries."
"There have been many private conversations, and after all this input I have formed a completely personal opinion on this matter, which is both complex and ethically charged."
"I should like to note that I certainly respect every judgment conscientiously arrived at."
"A division into left or right, conservative or modern, is not relevant here."
"Consequently I cannot permit my view or that of other colleagues to be branded as fundamentalist in this House, as has just happened."
"Mr President, my view and voting behaviour are largely in accordance with what has been agreed in our group."
"I differ on one point: I am in favour of the use of residual embryos from IVF, but wish to limit the deliberate creation of extra embryos."
"I am opposed to the blocking off of avenues potentially offered by therapeutic cloning for one day curing such diseases as Parkinson' s and Alzheimer' s."
"Reproductive cloning has never been at issue and an absolute international ban is called for."
"I reject the production of embryos solely for research."
"In my view, we are dealing with a problem of definitions in the case of therapeutic cloning."
"Is it permissible for the nucleus of an ovum of mine, combined with a skin cell, to serve at some point in the future to make a heart cell for me?"
"Finally, patent law is inadequate: the inviolability of the human body is established, but the legislation is ambiguous and as a result patents are granted that are not in the service of mankind or of possible cures."
"I would therefore ask my D66 and VVD colleagues who voted differently in the discussion of the report, to support our group on this point too."
"Mr President, after about a year of intensive investigation into human genetics and its effects on medicine, after countless hearings and conversations during on the spot fact-finding visits, I now have less hope than when I started."
"I am thoroughly disappointed."
"The Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies in Modern Medicine did not reach the destination I expected."
"The committee' s report will not create the basis for coherent legislation on biotechnology in the Member States of the European Union that many, like myself, were looking for."
"Instead, the chaos of opinions voiced in the amendments in plenum looks like leaving it in shreds."
"In the end those shreds will no longer fit together properly."
"I therefore ask you, honourable Members, at least to allow us to prevent the worst."
"Let us vote only for what takes balanced account of the social, economic and legal aspects and not steamroller through narrow ethical boundaries."
"The European Parliament must not fail here."
"We must set standards here."
"In a representative democracy, setting standards is the duty of the directly elected parliament and is not left to governments, let alone to forces that are not primarily dedicated to the common good."
"At consultations last weekend in Nantes, the German and French governments pointed the way for a common position on the economic and ethical questions raised by biotechnology."
"To quote from a German federal government document: ""Such agreement between Germany and France could be the prelude to broader agreement at European level."""
"The European Parliament can shorten the way and set out the markers today."
"The Committee on Human Genetics, as we call it for short, has carefully compiled the necessary information and the spectrum of appraisals."
"Now, Parliament as a whole, must show science, medicine and business in the Union' s Member States the way forward for the biotechnological revolution."
"But we must not fall into the trap of a wrong kind of belief in progress."
"Not every step forward taken by human beings is, at the same time, also progress for humanity."
"We must not submit to ideologies or dogmas either, however, let alone seek to establish new ones."
"Many feel so uncertain in the ethical realm that they would rather forget it."
"But there is a lot of clarity here."
"Sometimes we simply do not see it."
"For example, a fertilised human egg cell can only become a human being and nothing else."
"So human dignity must be protected from the time the male sperm is united with the female egg."
"This absolutely fundamental right has been put in writing again and again, most recently at the start of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"All we have to do is stick to it."
"Given that, we cannot allow cloning, for whatever purpose, neither reproductive nor therapeutic."
"It cannot be allowed."
"Given that, too, we cannot allow embryos to be used, let alone created, for research."
"The medical ethos of helping and healing at least stands in the way of deliberate interventions in the human germ line, but a look at the consequences, which are catastrophic in every respect, does so too."
"I will leave the matter there."
"When it comes to the vote at midday today, we shall have to respect a number of other limits."
"But today we must also express our support for progress in the biological sciences."
"With the right support, they may perhaps bring us closer to fulfilling the dream of conquering disease and suffering, and we should give much greater support than we have hitherto to the alternatives in the realm of adult stem cells, for example."
"I think that is really where the future lies."
"Mr President, today' s debate is an extremely important one."
"In fact, what we are discussing is nothing less than life itself. We are talking about scientific research with the potential to cure serious human diseases such as Parkinson' s, Alzheimer' s, MS, diabetes and perhaps even AIDS, to improve or prolong life."
"It is definitely not a question we should treat lightly."
"It therefore strikes me as a sorry state of affairs when this Parliament explicitly refuses to acknowledge the distinction between reproductive and therapeutic cloning: the former aims at the creation of new human beings, the latter at the creation of new tissue."
"Directly or indirectly banning the latter means ruling out a host of scientific possibilities that might help human beings."
"There is no trace of subsidiarity in this report."
"Ethical and moral dilemmas especially should be solved as closely as possible to the people they affect, since they appeal directly to personal conscience."
"For this reason, the call to the Commission to come up with legislation cannot command the approval of my group."
"Finally, I am bound to say that I am offended by the monopoly that some right-wing and Green MEPs lay claim to in the ethical field."
"Some fellow MEPs give the impression that the most restrictive view is automatically the ethically superior one."
"Therefore, if we restrict or even ban promising research, which might bring the sick a cure or an alleviation of their suffering or even save their lives, that is a decision with profound ethical implications."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to support Mr Fiori's report, which I think has struck the right balance."
"My views have changed in the course of the past year as a result of the evidence we have heard on the temporary committee."
"I have two basic concerns: firstly, much of the evidence suggests that developments on embryonic stem cell research may not deliver the results we all want in terms of progress on some of the most serious illnesses that afflict many members of our society and many of our own families; secondly, in the course of this research, we will allow people, and in particular, women suffering from infertility to be exploited."
"I am not against embryo research - as an infertility sufferer myself, I have benefited from it and I have donated surplus embryos for research purposes - but we need to be sure that to achieve the aims that we all want, we do not focus in one direction only, while neglecting other areas of research which hold equal if not more promise of success."
"Mr President, many people still suffer from incurable degenerative diseases that affect the whole body, such as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson' s, Alzheimer' s, diabetes and leukaemia."
"Others, in an otherwise healthy body, have poorly functioning or damaged vital organs, such as heart, kidneys, liver or lungs."
"As human beings we have succeeded in changing all kinds of things in the world outside ourselves, but can still only solve our own physical defects to a very limited extent."
"We find the repair and enhancement of our physical fabric quite simply horrific."
"Is man about to act like his own creator and does that conflict with the purpose for which people were put on earth?"
"Few people will be enthusiastic about creating invulnerable superhumans who will eventually oust normal human beings."
"In addition, the sacrifice of human life in order to improve the quality of other lives, evokes feelings of cannibalism."
"The discussion is sometimes about extremes."
"One extreme position is the desire to ban all scientific research and imprison researchers, the other is the wish to allow every commercial use, such as those, for example, being developed by the American company Advanced Cell Technology, and hence making possible, at the individual level, everything that wealthy people can and are prepared to pay for."
"I reject both extremes."
"The use of stem cells from one' s own body or if necessary from residual embryos, is defensible."
"Any creation of separate life for this purpose should be preceded by investigation of alternatives, and with the trade in embryos we are definitely overstepping the bounds of acceptability."
"That also applies to the valuing and modification of human life at the request of the insurers."
"Weighing everything up, I feel closer to the line followed by Mr Caudron than to that of Mr Fiori."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for once the European Parliament is not lagging behind history."
"Just as an American company succeeds in cloning a human embryo, the temporary committee on human genetics publishes its report, a report which is, incidentally, an excellent one."
"In effect, it protects the human embryo by prohibiting cloning, whether for reproductive or for therapeutic purposes."
"It prohibits European public funding for research on the human embryo, advising the use of supernumerary embryos for infertile couples, and, finally, making maximum use of work on adult stem cells."
"Mankind is not the owner of life: it simply has the right to enjoy the use of that life."
"Human beings cannot, therefore, appropriate for themselves even a part of this heritage, which is, by its very nature, inalienable."
"Those who want to get rich by playing the sorcerer' s apprentice will one day have to pay royalties to the Creator."
"The human embryo should never be reduced to the status of mere laboratory material, or of a tool used for commercial purposes."
"This is why the legislators must define, for the embryo, a status which fills the current loophole in the law, in particular by forbidding the patenting of living beings."
"Given that the human genetic mechanism is so fragile and complex, and that it is also associated with the mysterious and the sacred, it would be flying in the face of humanity' s evolution, its past and its future, to reap ephemeral gains under the pretext of carrying out research."
"I, and my colleagues in the National Front, defend the integrity and the dignity of human life, from conception to natural death."
"Those who are opposed to this view have already, unwittingly, entered the realms of barbarism."
"To manipulate the mystery of life is to condemn the human race to catastrophes even more terrible than those caused by mad cow disease and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease."
"Mr President, the scientific news which has broken over the last few days has created a dramatic backdrop to the presentation of the Fiori report."
"More important for me, however, are the numerous letters which I have received from scientific academies, medical companies and patient associations begging us not to clamp down on such promising and hopeful research."
"New knowledge about human genetics will help us understand at which points genetic dynamics are vulnerable and open to environmental factors and pressure and the way in which we live, thereby allowing us to develop new strategies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses."
"Stem cell research may well have new applications in treating illnesses such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, leukaemia and many others."
"However, the boundaries on research in these fields must be marked out if we are to avoid ethical, social and legal problems."
"This was the point of the amendments which I tabled, together with other Members, as we did with the Caudron report, so as to allow the pioneering research, which I have described, to progress while striking the balance needed in order to avoid ethical problems."
"So we can look forward at some point in the future to the beneficial medical applications which this research promises."
"I trust that the European Parliament will support the line being marked out and strike the right balance between progress and ethical considerations."
"Ôhe text being put to the vote must allow for research into new applications so that, where possible, we can liberate society from the misery caused by disease."
"It should be informed not by confusion or fear or by reaction to something we do not fully understand, but by the courage to strive for new achievements which man has demonstrated ever since the time of Prometheus."
"Mr President, this debate is concerned with questions that are essential to humanity, such as what is life and how can we halt that ineluctable march towards death which is a characteristic of any existence?"
"To pass on life to another, surely that is the profound meaning of evolution, the only moral law, moreover, which is indifferent to our concepts of morality?"
"Life is undoubtedly a process."
"It is pointless to try to define the point at which life begins."
"Some people believe that it begins with the fusion of a spermatozoon with an ovum, yet each spermatozoon is alive, even though billions of them move around in vain."
"An ovum that is not fertilised ceases to live."
"The embryo, as it divides into two, then four, eight and sixteen and more cells, is the process of the living being."
"Until the fourth day, each cell is totipotent, and contains all the genetic information of a potential human being."
"Yet in order to become that human being, the embryo has to become implanted in a uterus and develop there for several months."
"However, an embryo is not just a type of material."
"Therefore, there have to be very good reasons for sacrificing it."
"Generally speaking, our societies accept abortion in order to preserve the physical or mental health of a mother."
"Cannot this idea of the lesser of two evils also be applied to supernumerary embryos for which potential parenting no longer exists?"
"Is it not better to use those embryos for serious research, rather than destroying them?"
"No one in this House defends reproductive cloning, but the possibilities opened up by therapeutic cloning deserve to be the subject of in-depth and properly integrated research."
"Our society accepts serious medical research carried out on foetuses, children, adults and corpses."
"Why should there be special rules for embryos alone?"
"I would argue in favour of science, in favour of the right to know more."
"I argue in favour of public funding for this essential research."
"It would be irresponsible to leave it to the market sector alone."
"As with any research, there is no guarantee that it will be successful, but we must follow any serious leads."
"This applies to research into adult stem cells as well as to research into any of the 216 types of cells that make up the human body."
"Only a score of those have the power of pluripotency. Nor can we neglect research into embryonic stem cells."
"They are pluripotent by nature, and may be of assistance in regenerating all the types of tissue that go to make up the human body."
"I am convinced that genetic science will continue, with or without Europe, but I hope that Europe will not be left behind in this revolution."
"I respect those Members who have doubts, who see the risks rather than the hopes, but I do not accept that we should use the essential defence of human dignity as a sort of bludgeon to silence those who do not wish to reduce the whole of human dignity to a collection of cells."
"Where would that leave the dignity of those who suffer a thousand deaths before actually dying, or those who are sunk in the depths of disease or dementia?"
"Can we really concentrate on the defence of burgeoning human life, when beings already alive are too often ignored, neglected and oppressed?"
"Surely the search for new treatments for cruel diseases, for genetic predispositions or - even worse - predestinations, is the true defence of human dignity?"
"Mr President, Mr Fiori' s report on genetics marks an important stage in the European and international debate on a sensitive, far-reaching issue which demands close attention in the political world because of the responsibilities it involves."
"Science must make progress and move forwards, and we only know a tiny fraction of what there is to know, not least about the cells we are talking about."
"That does not, however, mean that anything goes: just as freedom is, in itself, an absolute value but is never absolute because of the way things are, so science and scientific research are vital assets because of the important discoveries that can be put at the service of human kind but they cannot be considered absolute, that is to say, removed from legal, ethical or moral constraints."
"The position of the European Republicans, the Democrats and the Italy of values thus coincides with the position expressed in the vote on the Caudron report: it rejects human cloning and genetic manipulation but supports the priority funding of research on adult stem cells and embryo stem cells derived from spontaneous and therapeutic abortions, subject to strict public control."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the great area of debate between bioethics and law has been opened up, but it should not be approached from moralistic positions because the distinction is not between progressive secular people and conservative Catholics, that is a black-and-white, simplistic view, but rather between those who believe that science should be allowed to do anything, even if it goes against the dignity of life, and those who believe that that should not be possible."
"Our thanks, in any case, go to Mr Fiori: we believe that his is an important piece of work, especially if our major amendments are accepted; it will be a good basis for reflection from now onwards and for preventing major discoveries from becoming patented property for the use and consumption of the powerful rather than being placed at the service of all human kind."
"Mr President, we are unanimously opposed to reproductive cloning, which shows how dangerous it is."
"However, why should we distinguish it, semantically, from therapeutic cloning, when it is actually the same thing?"
"Does the addition of the word 'therapeutic' change the act?"
"Have we been able to separate civil nuclear energy from military nuclear energy?"
"This is all the more important since these new techniques require the accelerated production of oocytes, and we know what that means in terms of the exploitation of women' s bodies, the secondary effects on women, and the trafficking in human eggs."
"Moreover, research on adult stem cells opens up the same prospects, though without the ethical problem."
"I should just like to say a word about 'gene therapy' ."
"More often than not, the genetic element is a predisposition to a disease, and it is external factors which trigger the onset of that disease."
"Are we going to modify a gene merely on account of a predisposition, when we now know, following the discovery of the human genome, that a gene modifies other functions which are as yet unknown to us?"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is not on the basis of any religious conviction, but rather as an atheist, that I strongly urge caution."
"Mr President, it is mankind's misfortune, in my view, that recent discoveries in the field of biotechnology have come at a time when the capitalist system still prevails."
"With the inhumane, exploitative regime under which we live today, where discoveries such as this come second to the quest for profit, it is pie in the sky to imagine they might be used for the benefit of mankind."
"On the contrary, we must expect them to serve the interests of monopolies in this sector."
"It will come as no surprise to us, for example, if a market in human ovaries, embryos and stem cells springs up or if new therapies are only available to those with plenty of hard cash."
"In all events, ladies and gentlemen, we must proceed very cautiously with genetic engineering."
"I for one cannot overlook the fact that life took a billion years to develop on our planet and evolved by natural selection."
"Now we can intervene in the evolutionary process and we may perhaps see the immediate results, but we have no idea what will happen in one million year's time."
"And if you think that is a rather long time frame, may I assure you, as an astronomer, that the sun will be in the sky for another 4.5 billion years."
"We also face the depraved phenomenon of applications for patents on living organisms and human genomes."
"Our view is clear."
"It should not be possible to patent any part of the human body, not one cell, not one atom."
"We are also categorically opposed to the use of genetic codes by employers, insurance companies, secret services etc."
"The Fiori report contains interesting and useful views on a number of questions."
"In several articles it points to the risks inherent in commercialisation, especially for the less well off sections of the population."
"However, in the final analysis, it remains, to a large degree, within the confines of competitiveness and takes an almost neutral stand on the legal issue."
"Let the debate which we are bringing to a close today mark the beginning of a more general reflection on the problem and the starting point for a more responsible stand on these issues."
"Mr President, bioethics, or the ethics of the living being, forces us to face certain basic questions, and it is an honour for this House that we should be discussing them today."
"What is our conception of the human being?"
"Is it a utilitarian or scientific conception, in which human beings, and, in particular, the weakest human beings, are placed in the service of science, or is it a humanist conception, which places science in the service of human beings?"
"What constitutes the dignity of the human being?"
"Are we to accept the view that dignity may vary according to age, ability, health, or the manner in which an embryo is created?"
"No, at a time when laboratories are challenging the consciences of the whole world, I would like Parliament to insist that we all have the same dignity and the same humanity."
"What is the point of scientific research?"
"Are we going to allow research to become the mirage of a new financial Eldorado?"
"No, research must retain the nobility of its purpose - to be at the service of human beings, and in particular to relieve suffering, to assist and care for the disabled, and to improve living conditions for everyone, including those in developing countries."
"There must be no contradiction between the dignity of the embryo and that of the sick person."
"Our position must therefore be consistent and well founded."
"We must not be subject to the whims of the moment, but must base our position on respect for the dignity of the human being, which is the only guarantee of scientific progress."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Fiori' s report is ambitious and balanced."
"It is ambitious because it does not only deal with genome research, which is perhaps a fashionable topic, but it also discusses all the issues arising from and relating to that research: the uses of genetic information, the patentability of products and procedures derived from living matter, the conditions for genetic tests, cloning, research into mother cells and the research framework programme."
"And it is balanced because it presents balanced solutions which are far-removed from any particular fundamentalist position."
"Therefore, with regard to mother cells, a distinction is made between embryonic mother cells and so-called adult cells, priority is given to research into the latter - which is very promising - and it is considered that the conditions for producing and obtaining mother cells endanger the integrity of the woman' s body in the case of therapeutic cloning, and this is therefore rejected, or surplus embryos, a practice which is also therefore rejected."
"Some argue, in the name of freedom of research, that it should be possible to carry out unrestricted experiments as long as the final objective is therapeutic."
"Ladies and gentlemen, research is essential and it must be a special priority, but, like all rights, it has its limits, and human dignity, in particular, provides us with an unassailable limit."
"Those of us who believe in this dignity and who try to protect all living beings, cannot sacrifice our values on the altar of freedom of research as the supreme and unrestricted ethical standard, especially when that freedom actually becomes the freedom to carry out the research which is the most profitable for the big pharmaceutical groups."
"Today they are presenting us with visions of the future as if they were already realities, when really they are still only promises."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has had sufficient courage to avoid simplifications and to deal thoroughly with the issue in a serious and balanced way."
"His report is based on an ethical position which is acceptable to everybody, rather than certain religious positions, which are worthy of respect but which are widely rejected, nor that lay ethic which has been referred to today as a supposed supreme standard, which is equally rejected."
"I therefore believe that the report deserves our full support."
"Mr President, when we decided, about a year ago, to set up the temporary parliamentary committee on human genetics and other new technologies in modern medicine, we did not for a minute imagine that the vote in question would coincide with statements by Heads of State, scientists, private companies and other interested parties."
"The announcement about advance cell technology, which uses cloning to create human embryos, makes today's vote even more crucial."
"The debates which have been held have brought minor differences to light in important sectors, such as the protection of human rights, the inviolability of human dignity, the right to self-determination, the confidentiality of personal data, respect for people with disabilities and the ban on discriminatory treatment of employees on the basis of genetic criteria."
"It was easy to reach a broad consensus on these issues."
"The Commission also agreed that genetic information on living human beings could not be patented."
"There was also almost unanimous agreement within the temporary committee on banning funding for research into reproductive cloning."
"However, it was on the sensitive issue of therapeutic cloning that the debate and differences of opinion took up most of our time."
"The lack of any international framework or regulations for applying this research and the risk of embryos being created in obscenely large or commercial numbers were behind some of the relatively strong reservations."
"Clearly, it will not be feasible to reach a broad consensus in this sector for the time being and the work of the temporary committee must continue so that a more detailed investigation can be carried out."
"I am positive that, if we can achieve international agreement and if private- and public-sector agencies operate in scientifically predetermined areas on the basis of agreed protocols, then the reservations which I mentioned will be put aside."
"This is the only way to resolve chronic health problems without running the risk of abuse which infringes the charter of human rights on human dignity, which are principles and values which must take precedence over freedom of research."
"Mr President, this debate is about much more than our view of human genetics: it also about the role we assign ourselves as European politicians in the assessment of ethics, science and the integrity of the European citizen."
"I have no monopoly on truth and I believe that it behoves us to show humility."
"Citizens are quite capable of taking their own decisions honourably and conscientiously."
"Personally, I am in favour of scientific research that is as free as possible, with the possible prospect of a cure for hitherto incurable diseases like Parkinson' s, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, although in the latter case you can, of course, simply stop smoking."
"The work of our committee has shown that European science treats its responsibility conscientiously."
"I cannot square with my conscience the fact that we do not support and in some cases even ban the types of research under discussion, including therapeutic cloning and stem cell research using residual embryos."
"Of course, others reach different conclusions and I respect that, but we should take note of the fact that different Member States will arrive at different legislation."
"Therefore I find myself unable to support the motion before us, if it remains unchanged."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report on a difficult subject."
"I believe that Parliament must firmly reject human cloning."
"Recent developments in the United States are alarming indeed, but we cannot allow experimentation with, or a market in, human life."
"Technically speaking, there is no difference between therapeutic and reproductive cloning."
"If we allow human cloning to proceed under the guise of therapeutic cloning, we risk abuses which I fear would result in the production of a handicapped or impaired child."
"This is my greatest fear about this experimentation and I believe those fears are well-founded in some of the statements made, such as those of Dr Antinori."
"Human embryos should not be created for research purposes, but this has indeed already happened in the US this summer."
"Patent protection must be excluded from such experimentation."
"Women are being used as the raw material for such research because there is an invasive procedure to extract eggs, the raw material for cloning."
"There is already a commercial trade in this, which is very reprehensible."
"Mr President, if Europe is to be the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world, as proudly stated at the Lisbon Council, then we must provide the conditions and the environment which will encourage our scientists to test the frontiers of knowledge."
"We cannot hobble that search and yet we must also uphold the dignity of the human person."
"What is human dignity?"
"What is the dignity of someone with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis or quadriplegia resulting from spinal injury?"
"Yes, the embryo also is due dignity, but we have large numbers of supernumerary embryos resulting from in vitro fertilisation and these are usually frozen and ultimately destroyed."
"Is it not better that these be made available for research purposes, with parental permission, rather than they be uselessly destroyed?"
"It is vital that any such research in these sensitive areas be done under strict regulation and only in those countries where it is permitted and where there is adequate regulation."
"To my friends I would say, the Good Samaritan crossed the road and helped his neighbour: your neighbour may have Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease or spinal injury, or diabetes."
"With due respect, would you pass by on the other side?"
"This report also touches on the issue of the patenting of biotechnological inventions, Directive 98/44."
"This Directive has passed through all the legislative processes necessary in the European Union to make it law, Commission, Council and Parliament."
"Transposition, however, is years behind."
"It is surely up to the Commission to insist with all the legal powers at its disposal on transposition in all the remaining countries."
"Too often, in all these areas of advance, the Commission and the Member States use fine words and then dither and dally weakly while Europe falls yet further behind."
"Commissioner, please be robust. Please stand up for the future of Europe."
"Mr President, the ethical dimension of this debate is crucial, but we must not stop there: we must also discuss power."
"Who has the final say over the human body?"
"The bio-patent directive regulates that power. Unfortunately this directive is not completely transparent."
"The opportunities for patents are formulated in overly broad terms and, as a result, power shifts one-sidedly to the big patent-holders."
"We must provide a counterweight."
"In the first place, we must subject the directive to a thorough evaluation of its socio-economic consequences, and, if necessary, propose an amendment."
"Secondly, we must ensure that pharmaceutical companies communicate with the public."
"There must be public influence on a research agenda."
"What do we want to know, what can we know and who is allowed to know what we know?"
"Thirdly, we must make sure that gene therapy remains accessible to all."
"Gene therapy is so costly for the time being and that may threaten accessibility."
"Fourthly, we must ask ourselves what the results of the medical revolution are: we are living longer, we are becoming more individual, we are banishing ailments, and all that has consequences for human relationships, for the labour market and for health care."
"Finally, we must draw up a public research agenda, which we must not allow to be delimited by artificial, ethical boundaries."
"We must move from a narrow ethics based on orthodox religion to a broadly based social ethics."
"The sixth framework programme plays an essential part in this, but cooperation between national public institutions is at least as important."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of a substantial minority of my group that wishes to promote scientific research into embryonic stem cells and also supports therapeutic cloning: it is precisely with gene technology that medical breakthroughs can be achieved that would otherwise be impossible."
"We firmly reject reproductive cloning, not only of human beings but also of animals."
"We do not share the Christian and obscurantist motivation of the majority of the Fiori report."
"The view that therapeutic cloning automatically leads to reproductive cloning is untenable."
"This is what we do not support the Fiori report in its present form."
"Mr President, at a time when our fellow citizens are asking, now that we have created the Europe of merchandise, to construct a Europe of human beings, the embryo has come to the heart of Europe."
"At this point I should like to thank the President of the European Parliament for listening to the voices of some of us, following the British work last August authorising cloning for therapeutic purposes, and creating an ad hoc committee which, having held many hearings, gave rise to the Fiori report, which I welcome for its remarkable commitment to this subject."
"Thus, contrary to other parliaments, such as the French Parliament, for example, we are meeting at the very moment when a private company announces that it has carried out human cloning, under cover of therapeutic purposes."
"I understand the objective, but we must be aware of the fact that this objective is really, underneath, an alibi, if we remember that there is another objective underlying it, that of the lure of immeasurable profits and potential markets."
"What is the real issue here?"
"In defiance of the principle of the inalienability and non-patrimoniality of the human body from the moment of conception onwards, which is laid down in all international declarations, it has been proposed that we should become what we are fighting against, organisms genetically modified by the uncontrolled creation of embryos as a source of spare parts for human bodies, thereby making it possible to repair sick people."
"We know that at any given moment in a decision-making process, there comes a time when it is necessary to look up from what we are doing and ask ourselves the question, 'Shall I go on or shall I stop' ."
"We believe that the time has come to set a limit, because the line between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning is a very thin one, since therapeutic cloning is, in fact, nothing more than interrupted reproductive cloning."
"I do not know whether I am on the side of ethics, but I am well aware, at any rate, that in expressing myself in this way I am not on the side of modernity."
"Such archaic classifications are irrelevant, because I believe that the real shock to civilisation lies among the modernists, those neo-scientists who believe that the human being is a material, and those who regard the human being as an essential resource for technical purposes."
"It was in that spirit that I tabled Amendment No 213 on the non-patentability of living beings, like Amendment No 212, showing that there is no difference between therapeutic and non-therapeutic cloning."
"It is also in that spirit that I appeal to the President of the European Parliament to allow our committee to become a permanent one, and I appeal to the President of the Commission to involve the parliaments of Europe in bioethics, so as not to deprive the public of this debate, and finally I appeal to the Heads of State and Government to commit to an international convention on bioethics."
"Firstly, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur for the work that he and his staff did in producing what was a good report until we had that regrettable vote in committee which has unfortunately now produced a report which I personally cannot support."
"This debate on that report comes at a very opportune moment after American research companies announced that they had successfully cloned human embryos."
"It is quite clear that if we accept this report we will fall behind the rest of the world in the development of very important treatments for cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease."
"This debate does not impose any legal requirements upon Member States but if the messages we send out today are heard strongly across Europe, they will have serious implications for vital areas of medical research in the future."
"These proposals are restrictive and extreme."
"They do not reflect a sensible and balanced approach."
"If you look around Member States, for example the United Kingdom, we can see that a genuine lead has been taken to recognise the undoubted potential benefits of these technologies but also that there is the need for controls and proper licensing arrangements which reflect the very real ethical concerns."
"We should not, in my view, adopt these proposals as they stand because they are unrealistic, potentially damaging and will seriously harm medical research across the whole of the European Union."
"The announcement in the United States this week has quite clearly demonstrated the speed at which research is now moving and the need to move technology and regulation on at the same pace."
"If these proposals become EU policy we will see the clock being turned back rather than being speeded up to keep pace with important technological developments."
"Mr President, I am one of those opposed to cloning, including therapeutic cloning."
"The distinction between it and reproductive cloning is mainly a semantic one and, in any case, therapeutic cloning opens the door to reproductive cloning."
"Good intentions, such as the search for solutions to diseases, are not sufficient to prevent what you wish to avoid, such as, and there is unanimity on this point, reproductive cloning and eugenic research."
"Those who suggest that there is no openness, that a morality is being imposed on the general public and an ethical supremacy is being claimed, are wrong: there has been a year of discussion, all points of view have been extensively aired, the testimony of scientists and experts has been heard, and in today' s vote everyone has an equal voice."
"In the Netherlands, particularly, it often strikes me that liberals, when others do not agree with them, suddenly start speaking about the imposition of a morality."
"That fails to do justice to the facts and to the power of independent thought of their fellow MEPs."
"The suggestion that therapeutic cloning is indispensable for the preservation of human health is misleading: there are alternative research methods that are also promising."
"I am against cloning and against the use of embryos, also residual embryos, because I believe that one must not use people instrumentally, as in my view the consequences are dangerous."
"Anyway, it will lead to the making of choices between various kinds of human life and there are alternatives."
"Research is important, but the job of government is to set frameworks."
"Those frameworks must not be solely designed, as the liberals would have it, to prevent medical and scientific research from being hampered."
"Nor must they, in my opinion, be inspired only by the free market and individual interest."
"We must also look to the general interest: the consequences for people in general, and not just the sick, the consequences for society and for generations to come."
"It is impossible that we should create life and then destroy it."
"I should like to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur and am exceptionally pleased with this report."
"During this debate it has at times been difficult to distinguish heat from light."
"As politicians we have a duty to inform ourselves before being dogmatic and proscriptive on matters of medical and scientific research, albeit with the regulatory tool of the precautionary principle for areas of scientific uncertainty available to us."
"We must allow research to continue in order to relieve the suffering of the millions with serious diseases and spinal injuries, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, motor neurone disease, diabetes, cancer, heart disease: the list is endless."
"However, the proper regulation and licensing of research in the scientific community is a matter for all of us, at Member State, EU and international level, and the present state of that regulation is of some concern."
"Let me be quite clear."
"I draw the line under reproductive cloning, eugenics and the deliberate creation of embryos for research."
"But even the Vatican does not ban all embryonic stem cell research: it accepts it on material from spontaneous abortions."
"To those who would say that it is only a semantic distinction between therapeutic and reproductive cloning, I say: I have a butcher's knife in my hand, I can cut up your steak with it quite legally, or I can cut your head off with it quite illegally - proper sanctions, proper penalties."
"We have so many examples of that in life today."
"To not allow public funding for research which is legal in a Member State is a curious sanction: nobody is forcing any Member State to make any type of research legal."
"Either the research is acceptable and respectful of human life and the dignity of humankind or it is not."
"How it is funded hardly makes it more or less ethical."
"Let us regulate and license research in this most sensitive and important of areas with commensurate penalties for the exceptional rogue who would put self-glory above the common good and the destiny of humankind."
"Wherever you find him or her, may God direct the hands, hearts and heads of the scientific, political and medical communities at this exciting but frightening and bewildering crossroads in time as we test the frontiers of knowledge."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for a year now, we in this Parliament have had the opportunity to get to grips with the ethical, social, economic and legal issues raised by human genetics."
"I want to thank Mr Fiori for his comprehensive report."
"We are currently in a situation of conflict between the breathtaking progress of modern medicine and the ethical foundations of our society."
"The decoding of the human genome, the discovery of the functions of the genes, new medical techniques and now stem cell therapy are opening up revolutionary new possibilities for curing quite specific diseases."
"But this means that our political responsibility is also growing."
"It is the task of politics to define clear boundaries and give a clear direction to values."
"We simply cannot allow scientific progress and the potential treatments that result to erode ethical boundaries."
"This week the firm ACT presented us with a fait accompli with the creation of a human embryo by nuclear transfer."
"Ethical boundaries have clearly been crossed."
"We therefore urgently need to send a clear signal from the European Parliament that human dignity must be protected from research that knows no boundaries and no taboos."
"We must, therefore, speak out clearly against reproductive and therapeutic cloning of human embryos, against any interventions in the human germ line and against the production of human embryos solely for research purposes."
"This ban must apply for both private and public research."
"When it comes to stem cell research, I am, in principle, against research that consumes embryos."
"I do, however, find the research into the 72 embryonic stem cell lines that were already in existence before 1 August 2001 acceptable in basic research."
"Instead of putting life at everyone' s disposal, special support must be given to alternative research using foetal and adult stem cells."
"Every human being has the right to uniqueness."
"As politicians, we must defend that right vehemently in future."
"Mr President, I would like to join in the congratulations being expressed: our colleague, Mr Fiori, has done a tremendous job which has led to a mature and sound outcome."
"We Christian Democrats have taken a reserved attitude to the creation of human embryos for cloning, for therapeutic as well as reproductive purposes."
"On the other hand, we do not oppose the development of genetic technology; rather, we say 'yes' to research."
"But we are anxious for this to take place in a way which respects human dignity."
"A human life is of value in itself, right from its commencement, and therefore its dignity must be consciously protected."
"During this past year, I have often heard it said that we cannot shackle science or call a halt to development."
"This is an irritatingly inaccurate and careless statement."
"We are all unanimous in agreeing that a certain type of development must be halted; after all, nobody in this room wishes to permit reproductive cloning."
"Here, at least, we remember the appalling lessons of history."
"But it would seem that some have forgotten that the racial hygienists at the beginning of the century were, in their day, leading scientists, not demons."
"They wished to help humanity within the framework of their own world of values, just like many people do today."
"For this reason it is essential that politicians now take the ethical responsibility which properly belongs to them."
"We must focus our attention on what kind of values are to form the direction in which we shall advance."
"When discussing the ethics of genetic technology, people often raise the ogre of the threat of the superhuman; however the true danger lies not in the idea of creating the superhuman, but in the control of the 'subhuman' ."
"This takes concrete form in the shape of social hygiene, in which the aim is to isolate 'wrong' forms of life from the more favoured, and to destroy the unfit."
"A reminder of this has also been provided by the representatives of the disabled groups which have visited our committee: we must not create the type of society in which only the healthy are welcome."
"In two senses at least, therapeutic and reproductive cloning are no different from one another. In the technical sense, these involve the same procedure; and if we look at the case from the point of view of the embryo, in both cases this becomes a utility for someone or something other than its own, unique purpose."
"How can we ensure that a subsequent step will not be towards human cloning, simply on the grounds that, technically speaking, we have already done this?"
"There needs to be serious discussion of this now, so that we are aware of what we are really deciding."
"Mr President, the debate we are conducting today touches on the fundamental questions of human existence."
"Is there a right to life-long health?"
"Is there a right to natural children or a right to healthy natural children or, ultimately, a right to eternal life, healthy of course?"
"New techniques are available."
"We are being promised cures to many diseases."
"They are not proven as yet, at any rate not in the field of embryonic stem cell research."
"Do we really want to be blinded by the interests of self-seeking researchers?"
"Do we want to allow ourselves to be used by industry and its commercial interests?"
"The term 'therapeutic clone' is a form of misleading packaging."
"It can also be used reproductively."
"Is the production of clones or the scavenging of 'surplus' embryos in order to use their stem cells ethically acceptable?"
"No, it is not acceptable."
"It is more like a modern form of cannibalism."
"But this debate is in fact already out of date, overtaken by reality."
"There are serious alternatives, adult stem cells, stem cells from umbilical cord blood."
"These techniques are already showing great success in practical use, far greater than embryonic stem cell research."
"There are no ethical objections to such alternatives."
"It is up to politics to set boundaries."
"Science is not able to do that, because it does not want to."
"We must decide."
"We must be courageous in the face of all challenges."
"No use must be made of embryonic stem cells, regardless of whether they are cloned or surplus."
"No human germ line intervention."
"No selection, no choice between life that is valued and life that is not, but support for research in the quest for alternatives."
"Let us be courageous and set tight limits."
"It is high time we did."
"I congratulate Mr Fiori."
"The ethical guidelines in his report were agreed after a year of debate and discussion."
"There was overwhelming support for ethical research but rejection of any form of human cloning, destruction of human embryos in research, or germ line intervention."
"We were disappointed therefore when the Caudron report, voted recently, provided public funding for research in conflict with these guidelines against the constitutional position of my country and three other Member States."
"Now some amendments to the Fiori report go further than the Caudron report."
"Amendment No 238 would allow germ line intervention for therapeutic purposes and this amendment, combined with Amendment No 237, would allow therapeutic cloning."
"It is ethically wrong to harm or destroy some human lives for the potential benefit of others, and according to key international scientific leaders, research taking place in the United States is proving that using the embryo is unnecessary."
"New embryology is proving that adult and other post-natal stem cells have vast biomedical potential, as great or greater than embryonic stem cell potential, which is already being described as old embryology."
"So there are other successful, ethical and non-controversial alternatives."
"Let us remember that some scientific breakthroughs turn out to be ethical breakdowns."
"Mr President, I would like, firstly, to also congratulate Mr Fiori on his excellent report, which I fully agree with, because the very hopeful future possibilities offered to us by biotechnology must not lead us to forget that the human being cannot, under any circumstances, be used as an instrument at the service of science, and Mr Fiori' s report clearly defines ethical limits for biotechnological research."
"In fact, a supposedly civilised society such as ours, which flies the flag of human rights, cannot tolerate the manipulation of the human being, even in its embryonic state, however noble the objective may be."
"Therefore, research using embryonic mother cells, even if they are surplus, human cloning - of whatever kind, because it is all the same, since it means the destruction of a human being or opens the door to that possible destruction - and the creation of embryos for research, are unacceptable practices because they attack the dignity of the human being and the supreme value of life which this Parliament, and the European Union, claims to defend so passionately."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I say anything else I should like to congratulate most sincerely the members of the temporary committee on human genetics, chaired by Mr Goebbels, and the rapporteur, Mr Fiori, who has done a great deal of work."
"Recent developments in human cloning in the United States have once again highlighted the need for, and the urgency of, in-depth political reflection in this area, including and especially at European level."
"As you know, since this is an own-initiative report, the Commission is not obliged to adopt a formal position on it."
"However, bearing in mind the political importance of the questions that it raises, I should nevertheless like to share with you my thoughts on the main points that it deals with and the positions expressed on them in the resolution."
"I shall deal with them in the order in which they have been mentioned."
"On the subject of the framework conditions for human genetics, the Commission can only fully subscribe to what has been said."
"In matters involving human genetics it goes without saying that ethical considerations are of paramount importance."
"As Article 13 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states, research should be free but, on the other hand, technological progress may, of course, only be applied in an absolutely responsible manner."
"The idea of responsible technological progress, moreover, is one of the main axes of the action plan on issues involving science and society which the Commission will shortly be announcing."
"I now come to the major issues at stake."
"On the subject of genetic testing, the resolution mentions, very opportunely, the question of genetic tests."
"There is a real need to improve the consistency of quality standards in this field, by harmonisation or mutual recognition."
"The Commission is to undertake a study of the various technical options that are possible in this area."
"There is also an obvious need for genetic research into rare diseases to be better coordinated at European level."
"I would also remind you that in the new framework research programme, support for creating a network of laboratories working in this field will be possible in the spirit of the resolution on rare diseases adopted in 1999 by the European Parliament and the Council."
"On the subject of pharmacogenetics, the resolution also calls for the creation of a harmonised regulatory framework for the development of new genetically-based products."
"As you know, there is already a harmonised framework for the developing, testing and authorising of biomedical products."
"Community legislation on pharmaceutical products already applies to gene therapy and to the medicines used in cell therapy in terms of general principles."
"However, in view of the constant advances being made in science and biotechnology, technical adaptations will have to be made in order to cover certain products specifically."
"Thirdly, there is the issue of the use of personal data linked to genome analysis."
"As far as the use of personal data is concerned, the right to the protection of one' s private life and the requirement that there must be free and informed consent are obviously essential."
"The Commission will be examining the question of whether and to what extent it is necessary to update and supplement existing Community legislation on the protection of private life."
"Personally, I believe that one of the points that we shall be looking at closely, is the question of how such data are used by insurance companies, a question which is, moreover, explicitly mentioned in the resolution."
"On the subject of patentability, you have also mentioned the problem of the patentability of products produced using biotechnology."
"This is a particularly important question which affects fundamental concepts while, at the same time, having numerous highly technical aspects."
"As you know, the directive finally adopted by the Community in this field was adopted after ten years of intense debate, particularly in the European Parliament, and as yet it has been transposed into national legislation in only a certain number of Member States."
"Against a background of very stiff international competition, this directive gives European researchers and industrialists an indispensable framework of common reference."
"However, in view of its importance as regards innovation, the most urgent task is to establish conditions that will allow it to be applied effectively."
"At this stage it is not a question of amending the directive or of reviewing its contents, but there is no doubt that certain aspects of it need to be clarified."
"This directive, and the discussions to which it has given rise, illustrate the sort of relationships which it will be absolutely essential to establish between society in the broad sense and science, between the scientific community and the legislature."
"Science moves rapidly, and the speed at which knowledge is acquired is accelerating, and yet it is still necessary to legislate."
"It is up to the political decision-makers and the authorised public representatives to do this, and to do it responsibly."
"However, the decisions taken must be subject to constant scrutiny in the light of the progress made in acquiring knowledge, in the form of an open dialogue between researchers, lawyers, policy-makers and citizens."
"There is no doubt that case law will develop."
"It can no more do so in a 'scientific void' than science can develop in a 'legal void' ."
"In order to clarify certain aspects of this question of the patentability of products resulting from biotechnology, and the application of the directive, the high-level working party on life sciences, which I set up and which is chaired by Professor Axel Kahn, was invited to deliver an opinion on this subject."
"It recently announced an important declaration, which will be included in the Annual Report to the Parliament and the Council, as provided for in the directive."
"This working party points out that the protection of genes by patent does not apply to those elements as they exist in their natural environment, but rather to molecules which have been isolated from the human body and are used in the context of a well-defined technical application."
"It therefore emphasises the inaccurate and misleading nature of the expression 'patenting life' ."
"In the same spirit, the working party points out that it is, in no way, the function and consequence of the patent to make its holder the 'owner' of the protected object, but to confer on the holder the exclusive right to use the product of his or her invention for a certain period of time."
"It also warns against the potential negative repercussions of strategies to take out patents that are too wide-ranging in connection with research and its medical applications."
"Finally, the working party draws attention to the need to develop a real culture of intellectual property among researchers, who are often not very familiar with such realities."
"It also suggests engaging in a process of collective apprenticeship and the sharing of experience in this field, bringing together the scientific community, the legal world, the political decision-makers, industry, the media and the public."
"In this spirit, and in order to prepare the Annual Report to the Parliament and the Council on the implementation of the European directive on the patentability of biotechnological inventions, the Commission is planning to set up a working party of scientific and legal experts who will be able to clarify some of the aspects involved."
"When the directive was being prepared, the therapeutic possibilities linked to the use of stem cells were not as clearly identified as they are today."
"At the same time, therefore, the Commission has also asked the European Ethics Group for its opinion on the specific question of the patentability of products resulting from this technology."
"This opinion is expected to be given by the end of this year."
"I now come to the last point mentioned: stem cells and research on embryos and cloning."
"This question of how stem cells should be used is a particularly delicate subject, as this debate has demonstrated."
"The announcement at the beginning of this week of the results obtained from therapeutic cloning by researchers of an American company has once again raised the questions to which such technology gives rise."
"It has led me to remind you that the Commission is opposed to any form of research implying the creation of human embryos solely for research purposes or for the production of stem cells."
"However, before anything else, I would just like to remind you of a point of procedure: when it comes to bioethics, the Community does not have any normative powers."
"For reasons connected, amongst other things, with respecting the diversity and sensibilities of cultures at national level, it now falls to the Member States to establish rules and regulations in this area."
"Basically, the questions raised are currently the subject of intense debate in Member States, here in the European Parliament and, I am glad to say, in the Council of Europe, with which the Commission is cooperating closely, and also at international level."
"On certain fundamental principles there is unanimous agreement."
"Thus human reproductive cloning is universally condemned. For example, it is specifically condemned in the Charter of fundamental rights of the European Union."
"In that spirit, the Commission totally supports the Franco-German initiative seeking to establish an international convention prohibiting human reproductive cloning."
"Going beyond that issue, the problems concerning the use of stem cells of embryonic origin and the use of human embryos for research are, as you know, the subject of assessments which vary considerably according to people' s sensibilities and convictions."
"The ethical questions associated with them are complex, because we have to weigh certain fundamental principles and the risks of abuse, against the interests of patients and the possibilities of considerably reducing their suffering and that of their loved ones."
"It is never easy, therefore, to set limits, and we must try to achieve a balanced position which will be the position most widely acceptable."
"In my opinion, the position whereby the creation of human embryos is prohibited but the use, particularly for the production of stem cells, of already existing, so-called supernumerary embryos is authorised, subject to strictly controlled ethical conditions and within national law, achieves such a balance."
"This position reflects the opinion of the European Group on Ethics, which believes that the creation of human embryos by transferring the nuclei of somatic cells for research requirements would be premature, given the vast field of research that remains to be explored with the aid of other sources of human stem cells, in particular, so-called supernumerary human embryos that already exist."
"Can we definitively rule out certain research opportunities and thereby risk depriving ourselves of the means of relieving great suffering and compromising Europe' s chances of remaining at the forefront of human knowledge?"
"In our present state of knowledge, many questions still remain open, even in purely scientific terms."
"This is why the Commission will be organising a conference on 18 and 19 December here in Brussels - and here I should like to repeat my invitation to any MEPs who may be interested - on the subject of 'Stem cells: treatments for the future?'"
"The discussions are likely to cover the prospective benefits and the priorities of research using stem cells, but also the difficulties of all kinds which such research will have to confront."
"I shall end by mentioning one last point, which is that of governance and public debate."
"With this in mind, I can only support the report."
"I can tell you that the action plan on 'science and society' which we are preparing follows this approach."
"It seeks to encourage public debate on these issues."
"It is absolutely essential that the debate should be as wide-ranging and as public as possible."
"To conclude, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on issues which will broadly affect the future of European society, I am really very happy to discover that this House has played the role of an essential forum for high-quality debate."
"In a Europe whose citizens share the same fundamental values, but may have differences of opinion on certain subjects, it is specifically via the excellence of the European Parliament that the democratic confrontation between opinions should operate."
"The Commission intends to continue to associate itself with your efforts in this field, and will continue, in close collaboration with you and with the Member States, to make the essential effort to inform, to reflect and to exchange information which is implicit in responsible scientific and technological progress."

"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0382/2001) by Mr Nisticò, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the twentieth time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (short-chain chlorinated paraffins) [9461/1/2001 - C5-0301/2001 - 2000/0104(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Nisticò)"
"Busquin, Commission."
"(FR) Madam President, the Commission is not in favour of Amendment Nos 1, 2 and 3."
"Amendment Nos 1 and 3 could extend the scope that has been proposed and such a move would not be justified on the basis of our current knowledge."
"It could also undermine the scientific bases of the directive that has been proposed."
"We cannot accept Amendment No 2 because it deals with substances that are not covered by the directive proposed."
"Furthermore, this Amendment runs counter to the Commission' s right of initiative."
"Therefore, the Commission cannot support Amendment Nos 1, 2 and 3."
"Madam President, I share the position expressed by Commissioner Busquin, but it is Parliament' s wish to reduce the marketing of these substances, which are potentially dangerous to the environment and to human beings."
"Amendment Nos 1 and 2, to the recitals, represent a desire and an instruction by Parliament."
"As for Amendment No 3, we are against it."

"Mr President, what we are proposing is that in the amendment the words 'develops a mechanism' should be replaced by 'will take place' and that the words 'together with the ICAO and ECAC' , that is, the international aviation organisations, should be added."
"(The President established that there was no opposition to voting on this oral amendment) Regarding Paragraph 3 of the legislative resolution"
"There is an oral amendment which reads : ""Reserves the right to amend in second reading any annex to this regulation adopted by Council in its common position if that annex, as submitted to Council, has not been included in the Commission proposal to the European Parliament."""
"(The President established that there was no opposition to voting on this oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Rapport (A5-0390/2001) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the criminal-law protection of the Communities' financial interests [COM(2001) 272 - C5-0225/2001 - 2001/0115(COD)]"
"Madam President, now that we have made all these changes, I am sure your services will tell you that the text has become rather incoherent in terms of the text and its intention. Given the preparation of the Commission green paper on the European public prosecutor, the run-up to the IGC in 2004 and the fact that several committees of this House were not consulted, I would ask that this report be referred back to committee."
"Mr President, I can support Mr Heaton-Harris' arguments."
"This a controversial report."
"It is important that there should be as wide a consensus on this subject as possible and I should therefore like to propose that the report be referred back to the Budgetary Committee."
"Madam President, what Mr Heaton-Harris has just said is to some extent correct."
"Mr Heaton-Harris was referring to a section about the interim solution of an internal public prosecutor, whereas the other amendments to the proposal for a directive have gone through."
"I do not think that this referral back is necessarily the way to solve the problem created by the vote."
"I cannot say, and in the light of the voting in committee, I cannot see how this report should be further amended."
"Madam President, following the result of the vote there are certain inconsistencies, but they are minor."
"We are at first reading, and if every time there are inconsistencies of this type we returned the report to committee, we would have to return a huge number of first readings."
"It is therefore completely wrong to return the report to committee."
"I can only repeat my arguments yet again, Mr President: this is a very controversial subject and it is important that Parliament should, as far as possible, speak with one voice."
"I should therefore like on behalf of my group to plead for referral, to allow us to reconsider the whole matter thoroughly."
"(Parliament rejected the request to refer the report back to committee)"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Report (A5-0389/2001) by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 98/70/EC 98/70/CE[COM(2001) 241 - C5-0197/2001 - 2001/0107(COD)]"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Proposal drafted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the contributions of the European Community to the 'Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria' [COM(2001) 612 - C5-0520/2001 - 2001/0251(COD)]"
"Regarding Amendment No 4"
"Madam President, we could vote for the seven amendments en bloc, but I would like to propose an oral amendment in relation to Amendment No 4."
"According to the Spanish version, the proposed oral amendment only changes three words: in the first line, where it says 'the Community will establish a legal basis for future contributions' , it should say, 'the Commission should propose a legal basis for future contributions' , and so on until the end."
"According to the Spanish version, no greater modifications are necessary, but the problem is that the compromise text we negotiated with the Council was in English and in that version it would be necessary to make two modifications: in the first line, it would be the same modification which I mentioned for the Spanish, that is: 'The Commission should propose' , instead of 'The Community will establish' , and in the last line it should say 'on the three communicable diseases, including any further contributions to the Global Fund' ."
"Those are the two modifications I would propose to the English version."
"Madam President, in agreement with the rapporteur and the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Watson, I would like to present an oral amendment to this compromise amendment, which would add a first sentence."
"In English, it is worded as follows:"
"""..."
"Calls on the Council to do its utmost to implement the mandate from the European Council of 21 September and 19 October to unanimously adopt this proposal. Failing that, apply Article 40 ..."""
"(Because more than 12 Members were opposed to voting on this oral amendment, it was not taken into account)"
"Madam President, I really do not understand the rejection which has been expressed in this House, but I fear that we are going to see the same thing again and I am therefore not presenting this oral amendment."
"We are going to try to make it clear through our explanations of vote that the recourse to Article 40 is just a way of saying that those who do not wish to be involved in the commitment made by the Council on 21 September and 19 October are going to be isolated."
"Thank you very much, Madam President."
"Of course, Mrs Terrón i Cusí."
"I fully understand what you are saying."
"(In successive votes, Parliament adopted the two legislative resolutions)"
"Report (A5-0398/2001) by Mrs Gebhardt, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council decision setting up Eurojust with a view to reinforcing the fight against serious organised crime [12727/1/2001 - C5-0514/2001 - 2000/0817(CNS)]"

"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Proposal for a joint resolution on preparations for the Laeken European Council"
"Regarding Paragraph 19"
"Mr President, the oral amendment that I wish to propose is actually something on which agreement was reached in the negotiations on the compromise resolution, but which was dropped in the final text and should therefore be restored."
"We propose inserting the words 'and the Copenhagen criteria' after the words 'Helsinki European Council' ."
"(The President declared that there was no opposition to voting on the oral amendment) Regarding Paragraph 20"
"Mr President, my apologies, but in this case it is current events that require us to submit an oral amendment."
"We should like the following to be added to this section: ""welcomes in this respect the future meeting between the president of Cyprus and the leader of the Turkish community""."
"I believe that this accords completely with positions consistently adopted by this House."
"I trust that honourable Members will have no objection."
"(The President declared that there was no opposition to voting on the oral amendment) Regarding Paragraph 30"
"Mr President, this really will be the last time that I disturb you, in order to ask you whether my fellow-MEPs would object if we added ""supports the establishment of the International Criminal Court and invites all States to ratify its statute"" to the text."
"I believe that this would be a gain for this House to which there will hopefully be no objection."
"(The President declared that there was no opposition to voting on the oral amendment) (Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0368/2001) by Mr Leinen and Mr Méndez de Vigo, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Laeken European Council and the future of the Union [2001/2180(INI)]"
"Regarding Amendment Nos 10 and 23"
"Madam President, may I ask why the most radical amendment, No 23, is not being put to the vote first?"
"The amendments are indeed compatible and we will be voting on No 23 in a moment."
"Both amendments will be put to the vote."
"We have given serious consideration to the issue and have concluded that the amendments are compatible."
"Madam President, I would query your ruling that the two amendments are compatible."
"They are clearly addressing exactly the same issue using deliberately different language and I would have thought now that we have adopted Amendment No 10, which I welcome, Amendment No 23 is no longer necessary."
"I do not share your analysis of the matter, Mr Corbett."
"Madam President, there is really no need for me to speak now."
"I spoke before the vote."
"This amendment was, in fact, dealt with when Amendment No 10 was accepted."
"I agree with Mr Corbett there because we have asked for adequate representation of both sexes."
"That can, of course, also be fifty-fifty, it need not be two thirds one gender and only one third the other."
"So the amendment we accepted goes further."
"In that respect we have decided correctly."
"In its wisdom, the House has reached the same conclusion."
"Regarding Amendment No 2"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteurs we propose that the words 'concluding summit in December 2003' be deleted and replaced by 'opening summit' ."
"Then continue as in the text."
"There is a practical reason for this."
"The Convention will very probably end in June 2003 and if we do not want to have more than three months' break before the Intergovernmental Conference starts, it cannot be in December, but must be after the summer recess."
"It must, therefore, be amended here as requested by the proposer, to read 'There must be no more than three months' break between the end of the Convention and the opening summit of the Intergovernmental Conference.'"
"That is the oral amendment."
"(The President declared that there was no opposition to voting on the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0399/2001) by Mrs Kaufmann, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on European Governance [COM(2001) 428 - C5-0454/2001 - 2001/2181(COS)]"
"Madam President, number 18 is only a reordering."
"It is followed by Amendment No 9 and I would like to say a brief word about that."
"Firstly, this amendment is tabled not by the group but by myself, as rapporteur."
"The purpose of the amendment is to make the text more logical and also to make the content of what it says about regulatory agencies coherent."
"I discussed it with the various groups yesterday and obtained their agreement."
"That therefore means that Amendment No 9 refers to item 19, and, in particular, to the deletion of the second part of the paragraph."
"At the same time, the shortened paragraph is to be inserted before item 16, immediately after the heading 'Autonomous regulatory authorities' ."
"The word 'only' must then be inserted in the fifth line of item 16 so that it then reads '... only be approved if...' ."
"As I have the floor now, there is a translation error in the Swedish version of Paragraph 27."
"It should read 'Committee of the Regions' and not 'Economic and Social Committee' ."
"We are aware of this, Mrs Kaufmann, and have already made the necessary corrections."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0739/2001), by Mr Rocard, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on a European strategy to encourage quality employment and social policy"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Madam President, I have just been informed that the French gendarme who was shot yesterday, probably by ETA terrorists, has just died."
"On behalf of my group, and I believe on behalf of the whole House, I would like to express my condolences and sympathy in relation to this latest victim of the fight against terrorism in Europe."
"Thank you very much, Mr Barón Crespo."
"Mr Bayrou has just informed me of this terrible news and I now give him the floor."
"Madam President, the police officer we are referring to was murdered yesterday evening in my region, in the town that I represent, and, naturally, emotions are running high."
"This is the second time in a week that French police officers have been hit by the bullets of terrorists driving through police roadblocks."
"I simply wish to say that we, in this House, have known for a long time that terrorism recognises no borders."
"We have also known that what happens to some people will also happen to others and I think that if the European Parliament could, by observing a minute' s silence, express its solidarity with this officer' s family and loved ones, with the gendarmerie and with all French and European citizens affected by this evil, it would be sending out a very important signal."
"Madam President, after the motion for a resolution on Egypt had been prepared, we received a letter from the speaker of the Egyptian parliament which we would rather not have received."
"For this reason I would like to table an oral amendment that the following be inserted after recital E:"
"""expressing its regrets concerning certain paragraphs of the letter from the President of the People's Assembly of the Arab Republic of Egypt on this resolution"" ."
"I have spoken with the rapporteur about it and he has agreed to our tabling this amendment."
"(The President declared that there was no opposition to voting on the oral amendment)"
"Madam President, we would all be very happy to see the letter referred to by Mr Sakellariou, and we would be very grateful if the competent services could distribute it."
"Of course this can be done. The letter is by no means confidential."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0391/2001) by Mr Fiori, on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics and Other New Technologies in Modern Medicine, on the ethical, legal, economic and social implications of human genetics [2001/2097(INI)]"
"Regarding Amendment No 126"
"Madam President, I simply wish to point out that Parliament' s staff should be asked to check the French version of this amendment."
"Not only does it not match the original version, but it is also almost incomprehensible."
"This is extremely serious, Mrs Flesch."
"We shall devote our full attention to resolving the matter."
"Regarding Amendment No 51"
"I join Mrs Flesch in complaining about the quality of translation."
"The English version of this amendment is completely different to the French original and largely incomprehensible."
"I do not want English-speaking people who look at this amendment to think for one second that I voted for that."
"I am prepared to vote for the French version and could I ask that you investigate the quality of translation on this report."
"Mrs McNally, I fully understand what you are asking."
"I believe we all share your concern and we shall devote all our attention to resolving the matter."
"Regarding Paragraph 95"
"Madam President, I propose inserting an oral amendment in the text before us because, otherwise, it does not make sense for the parts removed include the introduction."
"The oral amendment is as follows: 'believes that the setting-up of such a forum ...' , and the text then goes on in the manner with which everyone is familiar."
"(The President declared that there was no opposition to voting on the oral amendments)"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Madam President, I have discovered, from the social briefing, that the Chilean police have stormed offices belonging to the Chilean Communist Party, arresting several workers and wounding the Secretary-General herself."
"This has taken place a few days before the elections, which will be held on 16 December, and, according to the social briefing, the Chilean government itself has been shocked by this event."
"I would ask you, Madam President, to attempt to get to the bottom of this matter, and should this information prove to be true, to convey the objection of this Parliament."
"I find it so unacceptable that this should have happened that I should personally like to express my disapproval."
"We shall certainly investigate this information, Mrs Figueiredo."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"Dell'Alba report (A5-0176/2001)"
"Madam President, I voted against the Commission proposal because the Commission is using the reform of its financial management, which I also believe to be urgently necessary, as a pretext to weaken the European Parliament' s powers of control."
"The EC Treaty provides that the Commission shall present the Parliament with all necessary information on request."
"The Commission is now seeking to make that right to information subject to provisos in the Financial Regulation."
"For example, in future, the Commission wants to check whether passing information to Parliament would be against the Union' s interests."
"That creates the absurd situation where the party under scrutiny, the Commission, decides what information to put before the one who is to scrutinise it, Parliament, and what not."
"That not only weakens Parliament, but it weakens the Commission itself."
"In future, it will have to listen to the criticism that it has learned nothing from the past and is continuing to escape effective control."
"Bouwman report (A5-0348/2001)"
". (FR) The text that we have just been considering is intended to revise a 1980 directive guaranteeing the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer and particularly the payment of salaries that have not been paid for a minimum of three months."
"This directive needed an update, which we approved, to clarify, for example, the procedure for cases in which companies have bases in several European countries, or to better protect part time and home workers."
"Nevertheless, we cannot accept the surfeit of amendments that the European Parliament has accepted, which has led, with the best intentions in the world, to a huge increase in the detailed requirements imposed on all Member States."
"It is probably worthwhile considering all the cases of labour relations that are likely to tie an individual to a company, to enumerate every type of salary, allowance or related payment or to list all cases of formal or informal insolvency, but we feel that these provisions must be referred to the legislation of the Member States."
"Similarly, it might be useful to extend the period of time during which salaries are guaranteed, but it is up to the Member States to consider, in the context of their social relations and of their own budgets, whether this extension is useful and feasible."
"What we have here is a tangible example of how a directive, which, in theory, should be limited to setting broad objectives, runs the risk of being corrupted by pressure from various sources, leading to a restrictive and overly-detailed text, which might be inappropriate to the situation in some Member States."
". UK Conservative MEPs are sympathetic to the thrust of the Bouwman Report but have voted against Amendment Nos 13 and 14, as well as some other amendments."
"These amendments go well beyond the Commission's original objectives in bringing forward this proposal, and there are no grounds for suggesting that the levels of protection in the original Directive are inadequate."
"The removal of Member States' ability to set an upper level on the amount of outstanding pay claims to be guaranteed would go well beyond the aim of providing a minimum standard of protection to safeguard the vulnerable."
"The extension to six months of the minimum period of outstanding pay claims to be guaranteed would also significantly increase public expenditure and go well beyond the social aims of the Directive."
"We note that the UK Government also supports the Conservative position, and we are hopeful that on this occasion Labour MEPs might also accept the instructions of their home government."
"I asked for roll-call votes to make sure."
". (NL) Because labour is a significant cost factor in the production of goods and even more in the supply of services, one sees, time and time again, that employers try to reduce their obligations."
"It is increasingly common for dishonest employers and those in difficulties not to settle the wage bill when the work has been carried out."
"Employees then do not receive their due or can only obtain it after having recourse to the courts."
"The European Commission' s proposal omits to lay down in what cases one can speak of an employer, an employee, or wages owing."
"Rapporteur Bouwman quite rightly proposes also bringing small independent sub-contractors, homeworkers and domestic staff within the scope of this regulation, so that there are no loopholes if a malicious employer stops paying wages."
"The setting up of national guarantee funds will be compulsory, and they must be kept separate from employers' operating capital."
"All wage claims by employees, including overtime pay, holiday bonuses and severance payments, must be covered and there must be no ceiling on payments."
"This is one of the better proposals, which would mean that the European Union would finally be doing something to help employees."
"In recent years most proposals have served mainly employers' interests."
"Foster report (A5-0415/2001)"
"Madam President, I voted for Mrs Foster' s report on airport security."
"I am pleased to highlight the fact that this document calls for surprise, unannounced inspections."
"This seems a logical course of action which, until now, has very rarely been taken, hence my appreciation."
"I notice, however, that only EUR 1.215 million is being appropriated for these inspections."
"This is an extremely modest sum and simply not enough."
"Whyever did Mrs Foster not ask for more money for these inspections?"
"One might almost say that she wanted to economise on the European Parliament budget."
"This seems rather stingy, Mrs Foster, an attitude perhaps more suited to the Scots or Genoese."
"I am Genoese and I suggest and believe it would be better to use more money for these airport inspections."
". (FR) No one is against stepping up security in airports and on aeroplanes."
"The problem, however, and concern about this is expressed in the justification for an amendment, is that the events ""of 11 September in the United States have proven that the liberalisation of airport services (...) made the strict implementation of security measures more difficult"" ."
"The privatisation of these services and its implications for the quest for profit, for high returns and for the exploitation of a work force with precarious contracts, does not make for effective security."
"Forcing civil aviation operators and the largest among them, the companies running airports and the airlines, not only to comply with long-standing security measures but also to bear the costs of these themselves would be a straightforward matter."
"Instead, the rapporteur concludes that it is up to the States to bear these costs and that even if private interests prove to be irresponsible, incapable of providing security worthy of its name, they nonetheless have the right to make profit and as a bonus, to be subsidised by States, in other words, by the general public."
"This shows utter disregard for everyone."
"This is why, by voting for further security in the aviation sector, we are condemning this new excuse to subsidise private interests from private funds."
"We have, therefore, voted against this report."
". (EL) The proposal on civil aviation security does not address so-called terrorism."
"The fight against terrorism is simply being used as an excuse to create a climate of mass fear in order to smooth the way for the anti-democratic, anti-grass roots policies being promoted."
"At the same time, and with the same excuse, a first class opportunity for speculation has arisen as a result of the 'safety' measures being recommended or imposed in the form of exorbitantly expensive equipment or services, the cost of which is being passed on to users/passengers."
"In addition, an attempt at 'internationalisation' is being made by forcing 'anti-democratic measures' on all countries, which will be subject to inspection by 'inspectors' whose mission has deliberately been left vague rather than being clearly defined."
"It is no accident that the proposal lays claim to global validity - on the pretext of transnational agreements between Member States of the European Union and other countries - given that its purpose is to make controls as broad as possible and cut grass-roots freedoms as far back as possible."
"A typical example is the new law on air traffic safety signed by President Bush on 19 November, requiring foreign airlines to submit full details of passengers bound for the USA to the relevant American authorities directly."
"The USA are asking the airlines of numerous countries to submit advance lists of all passengers detailing their full name, date and place of birth, passport number and place of issue, visa or green card number and any other information deemed necessary to identify possible terrorists."
"At the same time, they warn that, if they fail to comply, as of Thursday 29 November, passengers arriving on these airlines will undergo exceptionally stringent checks by the American authorities and their luggage will be searched thoroughly, all of which may take several hours."
"This is a bitter taste of the 'big brother' policy and of the restriction and abolition of the freedom of movement and rights of citizens in a climate of 'mass fear' , the aims of which have nothing to do with safety."
"In our view, the measures already taken more than suffice and no further measures are required."
"Terrorism has social roots and therefore needs a social response."
"Adopting more and more suppressive and, basically, ineffectual measures, which have nothing to do with combating terrorism, is mere cunning."
"I congratulate Mrs Foster on her excellent report, which I fully support."
"This is a piece of work that demonstrates considerable technical understanding in addressing an issue of crucial importance for the future of civil aviation and in respect of which I should like to emphasise the following points:"
"the need for the Member States to commit themselves to drawing up a comprehensive policy for financing security in air travel, which must be entirely under government control, because security threats against aviation are a manifestation of threats against the state;"
"the need to pass a number of common laws in the field of civil aviation under the terms of the agreements concluded at the European Civil Aviation Conference, as a means of increasing airport security in the European Union."
". (NL) The growth in air traffic was already stalling before aeroplanes full of unsuspecting passengers were used by terrorists as rockets to destroy great buildings."
"As a result of years of fierce competition between familiar traditional national airlines and adventurous newcomers, overcapacity was created, so that they are no longer able to withstand setbacks and must beg for state support in order to survive."
"The choice now seems to be between ruthless rationalisation, with a number of airlines going bankrupt and mass dismissals taking place, and government-subsidised price competition designed to maintain overcapacity."
"If Mrs Foster has her way, taxpayers will have the privilege of paying for the losses of privatised companies and private companies will have control of government policy."
"I would argue for a completely different solution from either ruthless rationalisation or the granting of subsidies."
"Pointless and wasteful competition must be replaced by cooperation and decision making on a basic network of connections to other continents and, if necessary, also to peripheral areas within Europe."
"Costs of insurance, security, advertising campaigns and fuel tax must be included in full in the ticket prices, so that flying loses its competitive advantage over the train."
"Then the retraining and the job security of staff can be paid for, in the short term, from new tax income, without granting further subsidies to companies."
"Theato report (A5-0390/2001)"
"Madam President, as you know, I am the representative of the Pensioners' Party and I got to this Parliament on the votes of Italian pensioners."
"Well then, with regard to the report by Mrs Theato on the financial interests of the European Community, I am sorry but when I read the word 'interest' I think of the interest that should be paid to pensioners for the late payment of their pensions."
"I therefore voted automatically for this document, of course, but I also thought, 'I wonder if one day we shall manage to protect pensioners' interests by getting interest paid when pensions are paid out late, which happens all over Europe!'"
"I disagree with Mr Fatuzzo on the Theato report because, as the European Democratic wing of the EPP, as the British Conservatives are, we were completely against the Theato report from start to finish."
"We felt that the initial proposal was amended out of sight by the rapporteur and she put in her proposal that the European public prosecutor would lead to Corpus Juris."
"It was mentioned many times that initially the European public prosecutor would be the first stage only to protect the Community's financial interest which would then lead on to much greater things."
"Madam President, even though you asked me to group together my roll-call votes - I was surprised you asked me in this particular report and not someone else in the Fiori report."
"You will have noticed that the British Conservatives actually managed to persuade a number of different delegations in this House to get a majority against some of the proposals."
"However, the whole report as it stood is still unacceptable."
"Firstly, I would like to say that even though I was here for the Theato report I did not participate for exactly the same reasons as Mr Heaton-Harris."
"It is totally incorrect and wrong that we participate in those kind of votes."
"Turning to the Watson report, we all agree on the need for cooperation and coordination in combating terrorism."
"However, I would like to speak with particular reference to the European arrest warrant."
"This represents a major interference and alteration of the national judicial systems and the criminal-law procedures within the Member States."
"As well as overturning the civil rights protections which have been built up by precedent and, particularly in Britain and Ireland, under the common law system, it takes no account of the different legal systems within the Member States."
"Nor is any account taken of guaranteeing the right of appeal and right to judicial review at both the executing and issuing stage, nor any account of the rights of the individual concerned."
"It also fails to set up a mechanism to sort out difficulties and problems arising from a Member State's refusal to enforce the arrest warrant outside the specific areas that it excludes."
"Finally, if this law or proposal was brought into any Member State or non-member country, Parliament would be the first to object and complain."
"Yet when a EU Member State re-introduces internment without trial and abolishes the right to judicial review, we remain silent and condone the kind of treatment that undermines civil liberties and totally ignores the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is incorrect and it is wrong."
"Even though I voted in favour, I voted with grave and serious reservations."
"Today, we have elected to abstain in the vote on the report on the criminal-law protection of the Community' s financial interests."
"We do not oppose the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor for financial concerns, but the report goes too far and into such detail as is irrelevant at this stage."
"The rapporteur is also seeking to convert the Commission directive into a regulation, which is something that we oppose."
"- (DA) Although we fully support initiatives for combating fraud, we have chosen to vote against the report, since we do not believe that introducing a European public prosecutor for financial matters is an appropriate solution to the problem."
"Hautala report (A5-0389/2001)"
"I should like to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the British Conservative Group, the European Democrat wing of the EPP, and say why we oppose the regulation being extended to agricultural tractors."
"The primary reason for this directive is not to control atmospheric pollution itself as we inhale it but to actually reduce the effect that sulphur dioxide has on advanced catalytic systems."
"Tractors are not fitted with these systems so it would be pointless to extend this regulation to tractors."
"It would result in more carbon dioxide being produced in the refineries and also a 10% increase in the price of fuel for farmers."
"So although we welcome this report as tabled we could not support the amendments on tractors and, therefore, as those amendments went through we voted against the report as a whole."
"I hope that the rapporteur, Commission and Council will take note of the fact that they were at least 70 votes short of a qualified majority for second reading."
". (FR) We are, of course, in favour of improving the quality of petrol and diesel fuels in order to protect the environment."
"Once again, however, subsidies are being proposed, not for consumers, but for producers."
"Since we are against any form of subsidy to employers and, in particular, to the extremely wealthy automobile and oil corporations, we have not voted in favour of this report."
"- (FR) In order to improve air quality, especially in urban areas, three different, but convergent, methods may be used: legislative provisions relating to air quality, standards relating to vehicle emissions and standards applicable to fuels."
"It is in this third area that successive directives have been introduced, providing for the progressive phase-out of leaded petrol and giving the Member States the option of recourse to fiscal incentives in favour of cleaner fuels."
"However, one issue was left to one side, and that was the specifications for sulphur-free fuels."
"That is what is tackled by this proposal for a directive, which is very late arriving."
"Just as we are opposed to a standard European regulation governing air quality, which is a local problem, so we think it worth harmonising fuel specifications, since the refiners' markets extend way beyond national borders."
"Tackling the subject of fuel standards should provide the opportunity for being much more vigorous in introducing specifications in favour of bio-fuels."
"Indeed, the fuels we manufacture from agricultural produce cannot be faulted in terms of the greenhouse effect, make a major contribution to Europe' s self-sufficiency in energy and constitute a very important outlet for a number of our agricultural products."
"We need to move much more vigorously in the direction of legislation that encourages the replacement of growing quantities of fossil hydrocarbons in motor fuels."
"Hugues Martin recommendation (A5-0387/2001)"
"I voted against the report by Mr Hugues Martin on relations between the European Union and the Arab Republic of Egypt, Madam President."
"Why did I vote against it?"
"Because there are civil rights that are not respected enough in Egypt."
"They concern all Egyptian citizens, of course, and before we grant any money we should demand that the basic standards of protection of Egyptian citizens of any age - young people, workers or pensioners - be respected and check that they are."
". (EL) When it signs the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement with Egypt, the Council must emphasise the need to protect Community nationals who fall victim to the lack of freedom in this country."
"In particular, the Council needs to intervene in the case of the remaining survivor of the three Greek seamen sentenced for drug smuggling about ten years ago."
"Although only young, two of them have already died in the intolerable conditions which prevail in Egyptian jails."
"The Council should intervene to save the life of the last surviving Greek seaman in jail in Egypt, who should be allowed to serve out his sentence in a Greek jail."
"This human rights issue has quite rightly caused concern in Greece and, with this in mind, I abstained from voting for the Martin Hugues motion."
". (ES) I have voted against the report in order to protest at the violations of human rights in Egypt suffered by various groups for reasons of belief, political persuasion, cultural origin and sexual orientation, as demonstrated recently by the judgment against dozens of people in Cairo."
". I voted against the report because of the ongoing human rights abuses against homosexuals, intellectuals and religious minorities."
"The Egyptian government must take measures to improve the situation of the 8-10 million Coptic Christians in Egypt, who are discriminated against in legislation and in professional and social life, as well as in the practice of their religion."
"The Coptic Christians are currently treated as second-class citizens in the state policy on public appointments."
"There is no absolute religious freedom in Egypt, as legislation restricts the ability of Christians to repair churches or build new ones."
"It is also vital that the Christian minority perceive the judiciary as impartial."
". (NL) The human rights issue in Egypt, notably the recent witch-hunt against homosexuals and the curtailing of the freedom of women, necessitates us to look at this issue carefully in the relationship between Egypt and the EU."
"The Council and the Commission are not doing enough, if anything at all. That is why I will vote against this report."
"- (FR) The discussion on the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the EC and Egypt is a tragic illustration of the European Union' s conception of foreign policy."
"In this type of agreement, what takes precedence over everything else is establishing a free-trade area in the Mediterranean and giving priority to liberalisation and the dismantling of public services."
"The Member States have no reason to be proud of the fact that they are pursuing trade relations with the Egyptian state, which scorns human rights and freedom of expression and of conscience, which practises the death penalty and which has no time for political pluralism."
"Today, the imprisonment of 52 Egyptians for homosexuality should be the time radically to re-think our relations both with Egypt and also with other countries with totalitarian tendencies."
"What is now a matter of urgency for us is to demand of President Mubarak and his government that they free these 52 detainees immediately and unconditionally."
"It is a question of penalising the Egyptian State and its policies by not contributing to the financial enrichment of a minority that despises human rights."
"I have voted in favour of this report because it strongly emphasises this requirement."
"Watson report (A5-0397/2001)"
"Madam President, I personally voted for the Watson report introducing the European arrest warrant, although I am very concerned at the fact that this report allows those prosecutors that are entitled to use the arrest warrant to do so even for crimes punishable by four months' imprisonment."
"After the terrible attack on the Twin Towers, which led us, at last, to move towards bringing in the European arrest warrant, after this, seeing it being used for chicken thieves does make me rather sad."
"I feel we should use this arrest warrant for really serious crimes and not just for much smaller crimes, where national law should prevail."
"Madam President, the European Parliament should also take action to adapt not only the individual legislations of Member States but also the functions of the investigative bodies."
"The efficacy and efficiency of action to prevent and combat terrorism depend substantially, in fact, on the coordination of these bodies and their modernisation."
"In consideration of this, we are proposing the creation of a European intelligence school."
"Currently, there are not even liaison offices between the various bodies."
"We recently had a glaring example, with serious consequences, of this lack of liaison in communication, intelligence and information activities between the bodies operating in the countries of Europe."
"It is the case - for which, in this sense, we Europeans also bear responsibility - of the barbarous murder of Commander Massoud by illegal immigrants of Tunisian nationality, who were able to travel around Europe without any difficulty on false passports stolen in Belgium and the Netherlands."
"Madam President, I want to say that there is a large discrepancy between what the European Parliament normally champions, namely democracy, human rights and the rule of law, and what has happened today, when we have adopted this report by Mr Watson on combating terrorism at a speed completely out of keeping with the analysis that ought to have been carried out and the public debate that ought to have preceded such a report."
"Adopting the report will have incalculable consequences for the rule of law in the Member States, and there are quite a few NGOs which had warned us against adopting it and called upon us to set a thorough debate in motion and undertake a detailed analysis before doing so."
"I believe that, in this connection, many of us have taken decisions contrary to our national constitutions in areas such as freedom of expression, freedom of association, democracy and the rule of law."
". (EL) My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left, does not support the report by the Committee on Citizens' Freedom and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the European arrest warrant."
"Obviously, if we want to promote unification and deal with increasingly international challenges such as terrorism and drugs, we need to create a single area of justice, but this needs to be based on safeguarding and broadening democratic rights."
"However, the European arrest warrant, especially in the hasty and thoughtless manner in which it is being pushed forward:"
"a) reflects pressure from the USA rather than the maturity of endogenous procedures in the European Union;"
"b) is being extended to a broad range of offences unconnected with terrorism, rather than being confined to the urgent challenges caused by terrorism;"
"c) is being imposed arbitrarily, rather than through consultation with civil society;"
"d) suffocates and restricts the area of justice of the Member States."
"This being the case, we are concerned that an arbitrary European structure may be created with serious democratic shortcomings."
". (EL) For some time now, and especially recently, the European Union has been no more than a factory churning out legislation which undermines democratic freedoms (Schengen Information System, extended powers for EUROPOL, European public prosecutor, restrictions on the entry and movement of immigrants)."
"A typical example is the report on initiatives to combat terrorism adopted just a few days before 11 September."
"Now the European Parliament is being asked to give its opinion - an opinion which is in no way binding on the Council or the Commission - on two framework decisions on so-called terrorism and the European arrest warrant."
"It is perfectly clear that the horrendous events of 11 September have been used as a pretext to speed up the application of political decisions taken a long time ago."
"The perpetrators of, and accessories to, these attacks have played straight into the hands of the American and European imperialists, giving them an excuse to settle both international and domestic accounts."
"The Communist Party of Greece, with its sense of responsibility for grass-roots freedoms and rights and bitter experience of the laws which sent thousands of members of the Greek resistance into jail, exile or to the firing squad and which are nightmarishly similar to a number of the provisions being proposed, has a duty to divulge the real intentions of the rulers of the European Union."
"We should point out that all so-called 'terrorist crimes' are already punished under current criminal legislation in all the Member States."
"The real aim here is to terrorise any civil resistance or disobedience movements and the parties proactively opposing and reacting to political and capitalist globalisation as a whole or certain aspects of it."
"Standard forms of resistance, such as sit-ins, or the effects of resistance, such as interruptions to electricity or water supplies when the sectors in question go on strike, can easily be classified as terrorist crimes."
"The cotton farmers reduced to desperation by union policy who have taken to the national roads in their tractors are in danger of being classified as terrorists and thrown into prison for at least 5 to 10 years."
"We have reached the point where expressing an opinion is punished as a terrorist crime."
"The framework decision on the European arrest warrant, the legality of which is open to question, undermines the sovereign rights of the Member States and contradicts Articles 5 (2), 6 and 7 of the Greek constitution."
"The abolition of double indemnity, the facility to extradite a national to another state, the facility for the state to which the accused has been extradited to extradite him (without the permission of the state which extradited him in the first place) to a third country which is not a Member State of the European Union (for example, a Kurd is extradited by Greece to Germany, which then extradites him to Turkey without asking Greece) contradict basic principles of criminal law."
"They also contradict fundamental procedural rights and freedoms which are vital to the defence of those facing prosecution."
"The terrorist law and European arrest warrant are the last bricks in the edifice of a nightmarishly suppressive mechanism."
"It is obvious that the people building this edifice know full well that their anti-grass roots policy at both European Union and global level will provoke a grass-roots reaction."
"They expect this reaction to swell and fear the deluge of grass-roots anger."
"What they do not know, or perhaps refuse to accept, is that no force on earth can stop this deluge."
"At best, the proposed amendments attempt to improve certain offensive positions or shortcomings in the text, although they do nothing to change their nature."
"We cannot be party to this sort of approach."
"The only honest stand which respects collective and individual democratic rights is to reject the two proposals outright."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"- (FR) The Commission proposals designed to harmonise the definition of terrorism, to define a minimum platform of penalties and to put in place a European arrest warrant to replace the old system of extradition leaves us feeling very unsatisfied."
"Indeed, these are old federalist projects which are being dusted off under the pretext of the attacks of 11 September but which, in reality, do not contribute any particularly crucial practical element to the fight against terrorism."
"The first proposal, relating to the definition of terrorism and the sanctions used to combat it, has been much trumpeted, as if the lack of a harmonised definition in the countries of the European Union, at present, constituted a dreadful weakness which terrorists would exploit."
"It does nothing of the kind."
"The definitions and penalties may vary from one State to another, but there is no State which leaves terrorists at liberty."
"Everyone is agreed on the matter, even if the names vary."
"The proposed text therefore satisfies the federalists' obsession with standardisation but is not going to change very much on the ground."
"The same applies to the second proposal, relating to the European arrest warrant."
"At present, extradition is, without any doubt, a fairly long procedure, but one which protects individual rights."
"The European arrest warrant might be faster, but it is not even reliable, because precautions have to be taken all the same."
"We ask, in particular, that the judicial authority of the executing Member State not be restricted to the role of formally recording the extradition request but, rather, that safeguards be established to guarantee the protection of freedoms."
"This clause is all the more necessary in view of the fact that, given the pace at which new countries are acceding to the European Union, we no longer know which countries will be members of the European Union in ten or twenty years' time."
"The procedure should be still more restrictive when the executing Member State is asked to hand over one of its own nationals to another country."
"We think that, in such cases, the normal procedure should be extradition in its traditional form, and not the European arrest warrant."
". (NL) I endorse the present report and the proposal on a framework decision to combat terrorism."
"Since terrorism is invariably cross-border in nature, the European countries will need to join forces."
"However, the European arrest warrant goes too far in one area."
"It concerns the negative list and the abolition of dual criminality, as proposed by the Commission."
"Since Member States are not very keen on surrendering criminals as it is, a general arrest warrant and hence the abolition of dual criminality will meet with major problems."
"Various Member States, including the Netherlands, will indeed make every effort to prevent surrender for euthanasia or abortion, for example."
"That is why I have supported the amendments tabled by fellow MEPs Niall Andrews and Brian Crowley."
"They call for a positive list."
"This is also in line with the Council' s current view."
"The European arrest warrant would then only apply to crimes which feature on this list."
"This is, for example, true for an arrest warrant that applies to punishable offences whose criminality has already been harmonised at European level, such as terrorism."
"If this appears to be working well, the number of crimes on the positive list can always be extended."
"Drafting a negative list may indeed be an option in future, but it is still too early for this."
"One should not forget that Member State criminal law largely reflects their national culture."
"The discrepancies between the Member States are simply too vast at the moment."
"Since the amendments tabled by Mr Andrews and Mr Crowley have not been adopted, we are unable to support the second part of the Watson report with regard to the European arrest warrant."
"It seems to make little sense to us to vote for a negative list while the Council has decided on a positive list."
"- (DA) We support the fight against terrorism, and we will defend the principle that the political struggle must be conducted by democratic means in democratic states."
"If we are voting against the Watson report on combating terrorism and on the common European arrest warrant, it is for the following reasons:"
"1."
"An attempt is being made to force the proposals through Parliament and the Council by means of an accelerated procedure that excludes the possibility of a public debate on the subject and that does not provide the opportunity to obtain a thorough analysis of the consequences for democratic rights and the rule of law."
"2."
"The common European arrest warrant will entail harmonisation of maximum and minimum penalties by the back door."
"That is extremely problematic because there are widely different juridico-political traditions in the Member States."
"Likewise, harmonisation and the introduction of a common definition of terrorism will be at odds with the very different political realities in the Member States."
"3."
"Because it is a principle that can all too easily lead to false information being given or to serious crimes going unpunished, we oppose introducing the option of reduced penalties for anonymous cooperation in the work of detection."
"4."
"An attempt is being made to force through the proposals before us at high speed and under pressure of the events of 11 September."
"However, the proposals are not concerned with the type of events that are already prohibited and in relation to which legal proceedings can be taken in all the Member States."
"Instead, the proposals are concerned with so-called European terrorism which, in terms of the very loose definition contained in the proposals, can cover everything from ETA's killing of civilians to actions and statements by individuals and legal political organisations."
"Europe must cooperate more effectively in the fight against terrorism, both within its borders and internationally."
"In our view, terrorism is one of the greatest threats to democracy, to the free exercise of human rights and to economic and social development."
"Terrorism is not a recent phenomenon, but in recent years, we have seen an increase in terrorist activities, with a profound change in the nature of terrorist offences, with new threats arising, and with the use of new and much more sophisticated instruments, which has led to the real or potential effects of these attacks becoming increasingly devastating and deadly."
"The terrible events of 11 September have made the reality of this situation painfully clear and have shown how crucial it is that we find an effective response to this scourge; it is, therefore, of vital importance that our Member States have effective criminal legislation to combat terrorism and that measures are adopted with a view to improving police and judicial cooperation, and cooperation at international level."
"The first of these initiatives proposes the adoption of a common definition of terrorist acts and a definition of levels of sanctions and penalties - which must be effective, proportionate and act as a deterrent - which must, in all Member States, reflect the gravity of these acts."
"There are currently considerable differences between Member States, inasmuch as only six Member States have specific legislation on terrorism (one of them being Portugal)."
"Harmonisation is, therefore, crucial, at this level, so as to prevent terrorists being able to take advantage of these differences in the Member States' legal processes or exploit any legal loopholes arising from the geographical limitations of investigations."
"The second initiative is based on the principle of mutual recognition of final decisions."
"Its aim is to replace traditional extradition procedures with a straightforward system of surrendering criminals on the basis of a European arrest warrant because, since extradition is a procedural, cumbersome and complex process, it is no longer appropriate to an area without borders."
"Under this new system, the European arrest warrant, on being issued in one Member State, must be executed throughout the territory of the Union, but must always, in all circumstances, respond to the concerns of Europe' s citizens in safeguarding individual rights."
"Adopting these proposals will, therefore, provide unequivocal evidence of the Member States' willingness to improve cooperation, at all levels, in the fight against terrorism."
"It is difficult, in such a short explanation of vote, to sum up all that needs to be emphasised about the dangerous negative aspects of these Commission proposals for a framework decision which, incomprehensibly, the Portuguese government supports."
"On the pretext of fighting against terrorism, the European Commission is going ahead with proposals that it has already been working on, led by Commissioner Vitorino, who, far exceeding the necessary cooperation between States, is seeking to go ahead with the supranationalisation of fundamental aspects of justice."
"The concept of 'terrorism' put forward by the Commission allows the action of those fighting for national liberation and social transformation, the battles and actions of workers and common people to be criminalised, with obvious consequences for the proper safeguard of democratic rights and fundamental freedoms."
"The proposal for a 'European arrest warrant' , which is designed to eliminate the principle of double jeopardy, even if this ends up simply being limited, is a real Trojan horse in a strategy that will have to go further and further, basing its justification on the 'needs' for the aforementioned instruments."
"Despite amending some of the negative aspects of the Commission' s proposals, the report adopts the same approach."
"Hence my vote against it."
". I have voted against this report because it does not refer to all forms of terrorism."
"It ignores totally all of the different expressions of State terrorism."
"We all are aware of the various types of terrorism that have been used by Spanish governments since 1975."
"This failure to mention State terrorism, even in its general considerations, is most regrettable."
"We all know perfectly well too, that anti-terrorist legislation such as proposed by these means do not guarantee a fair trial all over the EU."
"We are aware that in the Kingdom of Spain this very year of 2001, the Spanish government has pardoned torturers, released high officials already condemned on grounds of waging a 'dirty war' and tolerates torture in the most despicable ways, until this very moment."
"The European Parliament has closed its eyes."
"We all will regret it, because that reality is no longer the internal affair of one Member State."
". (DE) We non-attached Members were unable to vote in favour of Amendment No 34 because the direct reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which does not yet have force of law, is not legally tenable."
"As regards the 'European arrest warrant' , we prefer a positive list to the negative list contained in the report because that preserves the principle of legality as a pillar of criminal law."
"The British Conservatives voted in favour of the Watson report in order to underline our continued ongoing support for the war against terrorism, and to confirm our determination to ensure that the European Union presents a united front against those who seek to undermine our values and our way of life."
"However, we do have some reservations about some of the details in this measure."
"In particular, we are concerned that by including some 22 offences in the scope of the Arrest Warrant, this measures goes further than is necessary in tackling the immediate terrorist threat."
"(NL) Our groups are not very happy with the proposal by European Commissioner Vitorino on a European arrest warrant, although the amendments adopted by the European Parliament (Watson report) do constitute a major improvement on the Commission proposal."
"However, our main concern, to protect liberal, Dutch criminal law by applying the European arrest warrant only to a limited list of so-called euro crimes, has not yet been accommodated."
"We are in favour of a European arrest warrant in order to combat terrorism and organised crime more effectively, but only under the following conditions: firstly, that European arrests are only carried out on the basis of a positive list of euro crimes, and secondly, that the list of euro crimes is limited to serious offences which are punishable in all European countries, such as murder, for example."
"Under no circumstances must the European arrest warrant jeopardise Dutch practice on abortion, euthanasia and drugs."
"Insofar as we can make out from the little information that is available to us from the Council of Ministers, the latter is already discussing a positive list, and this list appears to contain no less than 27 broadly-defined euro crimes so far."
"Consequently, the Council is now discussing a substantially different proposal from that of the Commission."
"By studying the original Commission proposal, Parliament is lagging behind."
"Furthermore, it very much looks as if the Dutch government is able to remove more of our objections via the Council than we are via the European Parliament."
"This issue once again exposes the EU' s democratic loophole."
"Inspection by the Lower Chamber is theoretically possible because the Council takes unanimous decisions."
"However, this is difficult to realise in practice on account of the Council' s reluctance to embrace openness and due to the late availability of the documents."
"The pace at which this sensitive issue is being discussed only exacerbates the problem."
"For all these reasons, our groups will vote in favour of the amendments of the Watson report, because these are a considerable improvement on the Commission proposal, but we will abstain in the vote on the legislative resolution."
"The war against terrorism is, and will remain, a high priority within the EU, but must not be fought at the cost of the rule of law."
"We are concerned that EU governments are currently rushing to coordinate the legislation of the Member States in the war against terrorism and to amalgamate various legal traditions in a very short space of time."
"There is a risk of undermining the rule of law, particularly with the Commission' s proposed definition of the term 'terrorism' ."
"In our opinion, this definition is far too broad and allows room for too many interpretations."
"It is quite possible that people who, for political reasons, protest against prevailing social structures and use illegal means to do so, will fall within the parameters of the definition now being proposed."
"It is clearly inappropriate to go so far as to view those who protest against what they consider to be an unjust social order as terrorists."
"There is a need for terrorism to be defined more clearly than has so far been the case."
"In this respect, we therefore welcome the European Parliament' s more specific amendments."
"The European Parliament and the national parliaments must also be allowed to exercise real influence before final decisions are taken by the Council of Ministers."
". (NL) Madam President, I have voted against the Watson report for the following reasons."
"I fully support the measures against terrorism and in my view, it is possible and necessary for the EU Member States to work closely together in this field."
"The European arrest warrant can make a major contribution towards the efficiency of the fight against terrorism within European territory."
"I am of the opinion that the European arrest warrant is desirable."
"However, this should be thought through and considered more carefully, so that it is not implemented at the expense of other important matters."
"The present draft offers too little in the way of guarantees and may sound the death knell of Dutch liberal criminal policy."
"In order to strike a compromise, I have tried to table an amendment via the rapporteur which prescribes the following condition for the European arrest warrant: a European arrest warrant may only be issued for offences committed on the territory of the requesting State."
"However, this amendment has been vetoed by the Socialists in the working party."
"I have also voted against the report because the Council is expected to adopt a different draft."
"I am therefore in favour of anti-terrorist measures as well as the European arrest warrant, but not at the expense of the liberal criminal policy in the Netherlands."
". (NL) There is a great deal of confusion about the phenomenon of terrorism."
"Most terrorists do not become terrorists out of choice, but are forced to resort to extreme and unacceptable measures due to the lack of understanding shown by leading politicians for their oppositional role and their conflicting viewpoints."
"Some latterly well-respected leaders, such as those of Israel, Palestine, South Africa and many former colonies, started their political careers as terrorists."
"Terrorism is fought effectively not by creating an even greater lack of understanding and trust, but by ensuring that the problems to which terrorists want to draw attention are resolved swiftly and peacefully."
"Politicians who see the risk of terrorism in anything and everything, run the risk of ending up in a police state which lacks essential rights of freedom and democracy."
"This, in turn, leads to a tougher political climate, which creates a new breeding ground for terrorism."
"Respect for the law weakens when people notice that they are no longer protected from random arrests, lengthy custody and controversial surrender."
"This also applies if oppositional non-terrorists are bullied or if people are imprisoned for actions which are not punishable in their own countries."
"As long as there are insufficient guarantees to prevent these phenomena, a European regulation is counterproductive in the real fight against terrorism, in my view."
"This House has approved a compromise amendment on the legislative resolutions regarding the Watson report on combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant."
"Both amendments call upon the Council to apply Article 40 of the Treaty on European Union in cases where unanimity cannot be reached, or in cases when unanimity involves a substantial weakening of the proposal."
"Unfortunately, a small number of Members - including the Italian Alleanza Nazionale members - have prevented an oral amendment supported by the rapporteur himself from being voted upon; if approved, this amendment would have made Parliament' s political will clearer."
"In fact, calling upon the Council to vote under Article 40 is to be considered a last resort."
"We all hope that the Council will be able to achieve unanimity along the lines of the commitments adopted jointly in Ghent and upheld so clearly by Parliament in today' s vote."
"For our part, as Italian Members, we shall still make every effort to persuade our government to change its position and agree to extend the European arrest procedure to all the crimes included in the European Commission' s proposal and to give up the extradition procedure, which would be a patent violation of the spirit and letter of the commitments unanimously and formally adopted in Ghent and Brussels in the emotional aftermath of the tragic attack on the Twin Towers."
"I therefore hope that no country will now falter in its commitment to fight terrorism, and I hope that mine, which has always contributed to the progress of the Union, will not find itself isolated."
"These decisions are all in the hands of the Italian government, because it would also not be acceptable for its veto to jeopardise a whole policy."
"Hence the timely reference to Article 40 of the Treaty."
"- (FR) By means of this vote, we are now being asked to describe as acts of terrorism what, for us, are acts of solidarity and of justice."
"For example, 'interfering with or disrupting the supply of water, power, or other fundamental resource' ."
"Such actions are generally those of salaried employees - of workers, not Bin Ladens - who, threatened by privatisation, organise themselves to defend their conditions of work, their jobs and, indeed, the tools with which they work."
"The basis of the proposal is to punish as an act of terrorism anything aimed at threatening 'and seriously altering or destroying the political, economic, or social structures of a country' , that is to say any questioning of injustice and the established order such as the occupation by the homeless of empty housing or by the unemployed of job centres or of organisations managing unemployment insurance payments or, indeed, European demonstrations against organisations such as the IMF, WTO or the World Bank."
"Basically, a measure of this kind would tend to criminalise social activism by bringing fundamental rights into question."
"That is why I have not voted in favour of this report, which makes terrorists out of us."
". (NL) After 11 September, Commissioner Vitorino rightly prioritised previous agreements from Tampere in order to reach more effective cooperation in the fight against terrorism, police and judicial cooperation."
"That is why we give our unqualified support to the proposal on combating terrorism."
"We also support a European arrest warrant."
"However, we do not endorse the present proposal when it comes to a negative list. We consider this position to be already out-of-date since the Council is working on a positive list, rightly so."
"We are in favour of this, and we expect a decision by the Council before the end of this year."
"Indeed, the events of 11 September have forced us to take prompt action."
"That is why, despite our objections to a negative list, we will not vote against the proposal, but will abstain instead, in anticipation of the European Commission and the Council producing a concrete positive list by the end of the year, which will give the European arrest warrant in 2001 a tangible dimension."
"That is why we expect improvements which have been proposed by the Dutch Labour Party delegation, among others, to be incorporated in the work of the Council, including those pertaining to evidence, right to assistance, more scope for hearing the defendant and the principle of ne bis in idem."
". (NL) The Belgian members of the PSE Group have abstained from the final vote on the European arrest warrant."
"They support the efforts by the European Parliament to help develop the legislative framework in the fight against terrorism."
"The European arrest warrant is a useful instrument, but the Belgian members of the PSE Group oppose the generally applicable European arrest warrant for crimes which incur a sentence of more than one year."
"They are in favour of the Council' s approach with a positive list on the basis of the Europol mandate."
"Gebhardt report (A5-0398/2001)"
"Madam President, I voted for Mrs Gebhardt' s report."
"I am, naturally, in favour of any fight against injustice, and the effects of organised crime constitute a serious injustice."
"Citizens should be protected by European judges, and let us hope that soon there really will be European judges."
"For this to happen, however, there has to be a European criminal code, Madam President, which I have often called for."
"Once again, then, I insist that there should be a criminal code and a European code of criminal procedure, otherwise there is no point in having European judges."
". (EL) This is the second time a report on setting up Eurojust has been tabled for debate in plenary in the last six months."
"This time it has been scheduled on the same day as the debate on the European terrorism law and the European arrest warrant."
"Eurojust is an institution consisting of one representative from each Member State (public prosecutor, judge or police officer) and will have the widest, unaccountable powers to investigate and prosecute."
"It will basically have the power to order the authorities of any Member State to start an investigation or institute proceedings and even to take part itself in investigations by setting up joint investigation teams."
"The Member State will have to comply with its recommendations; if it does not, it must specifically justify its refusal."
"During the previous debate, the argument cited for setting up Eurojust was to fight cross-border crime, that is, to combat crime where there might be a clash between the jurisdiction of at least two countries."
"Now it would appear that the rulers of the European Union feel that they do not need any excuses."
"Under the new text, this new superpower will be able to intervene even if the crime only affects one country."
"Of course, so-called terrorism is one of the crimes for which Eurojust will have jurisdiction."
"Eurojust will be assisted in carrying out its virtuous remit by four different databases containing sensitive personal data: the criminal records kept by each Member State on their citizens, the Schengen Information System, the European judicial network and Europol's files."
"The long-winded list of personal data includes information on ""racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, and data concerning health or sex life""."
"All this means is that personal records are to be legalised through a quasi-judicial European body."
"This is, without doubt, an overly centralised and arbitrary institution which does away with any sense of national sovereignty."
"It is also an insult to the famous operational independence of the judiciary of which bourgeois democracies are so proud."
"We must not delude ourselves that the objective of this whole legal arsenal is, primarily, to stamp out common crime."
"Together with the terrorist law, the European arrest warrant and the future European public prosecutor, this is an attempt to create a suppressive supranational mechanism which will be turned against democratic freedoms and, more importantly, against the grass-roots movement when it rises up against the dominant political and economic choices being made."
"This is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
". (NL) I welcome the establishment of Eurojust and, with it, the possible cooperation between public prosecutors from the various Member States."
"Although the brief, at first sight, remains limited to coordination and assistance, Eurojust can also request inquiries or institute proceedings."
"Consequently, I am concerned that in the long term, Eurojust might develop into a European Public Prosecution Office with a general brief."
"Indeed, a European public prosecutor with responsibility for financial matters could be very useful, for he could sufficiently protect the Community' s financial interests."
"This would then be a European Public Prosecution Office with a limited brief."
"A criminal law system at EU level is, certainly at the moment, both undesirable and unrealistic."
"National criminal law is closely linked to the national sovereignty of the Member States and must be embedded in a democratic legal system with sufficient scope for supervision."
"I am, therefore, not in favour of a general European Public Prosecution Office."
"Furthermore, only a national Public Prosecution Office can take sufficient account of the cultural aspects of national criminal law."
"The decision to prosecute must, therefore, be taken at the level of the individual Member States."
"The Dutch Minister for Justice, Mr Korthals, has assured the Dutch Parliament that Eurojust will not develop into a European Public Prosecution Office."
"If the ambition was ever to set up a European Public Prosecution Office, then Eurojust would not be the right route to take."
"With this reservation, we, as the Christian Union - Calvinist Political Party Group, have decided to vote in favour of the present proposal."
"I voted for this proposal because it forms part of a coherent set of measures that can and must contribute to Europe being able to cooperate more efficiently in the fight against terrorism, both within its borders and internationally."
"In this very part-session we have welcomed the initiatives on adopting a common definition of terrorist acts and levels of sanctions, and on replacing traditional extradition procedures with a simple system of surrendering criminals, on the basis of a European arrest warrant."
"The purpose of the proposal on Eurojust is to effectively improve cooperation between the judicial authorities of the Member States, whilst ensuring that fundamental rights are safeguarded, because the fight against terrorism, and against other forms of crime, can only be effective through improved cooperation between judicial authorities and police forces, with particular emphasis on the role to be played by Europol."
"This is an important and ambitious project, because crime does not recognise borders."
"It is, therefore, important to promote this judicial cooperation, and the exchange of information between Member States."
"The European Union' s citizens have the right to demand that the Union effectively addresses the problem of ever more frequent threats of crime against their freedom and rights."
"In order to do this, a new strategy must be adopted, one that consists of coordinating all our efforts in the aim of combating and preventing crime throughout the territory of the Member States."
"Lagendijk report (A5-0386/2001)"
"Madam President, with his report, Mr Lagendijk has presented a request for assistance for FYROM."
"It is certainly a positive step for the European Union to give a helping hand to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in its current stricken situation, especially since it has been tormented by internal fighting within its borders."
"I ask, however, and insist and will be pleased if this assistance can be given to all the states of Central and Eastern Europe, which are in need of financial assistance after 50 years of communist dictatorship."
"Färm report (A5-0385/2001)"
". (NL) I have noticed that recent events have initially borne out what I predicted on 15 March and 3 May."
"I would invite you to read up on the Minutes."
"At the time, I stated that granting premature support to the Macedonian government, proclaiming desperate Albanians as extremists and distributing funds would not lead to answers, peace and reconciliation, but would fan the flames of violence."
"A proportion of the Macedonian population and of the Macedonian government dreamed of a Macedonia without Albanians, or only with completely unrecognisable and adapted residents of Albanian origin."
"That proportion wanted to buy arms with EU subsidies intended for peace."
"Hopefully, the change in the Constitution will put an end to the idea that within the borders of that country, there is only room for one language and one nation, and that all problems would be solved if the large Albanian minority were ignored, or even driven away."
"If, in future, the roles were reversed because the Albanians had become the largest nation, they will hopefully sympathise more with the ambitions of the Macedonian minority than is now the case in respect of the Albanians."
"If future aid is now employed for peace, reconciliation and reconstruction, then I can fully support the initiative."
"Färm report (A5-0410/2001)"
". (NL) The three regions which, following the collapse of former Yugoslavia, have carried on under the old name on the map of Europe, no longer even function as an informal federation."
"Even the surrender of the former President to the Tribunal in The Hague appeared to have become a matter solely for the government of the federal state where he lived."
"Montenegro has not functioned under Yugoslav customs control for a number of years now, and the deutschmark which was introduced there as currency is soon to be replaced by the euro."
"Kosovo has been cut off from the outside world by violence, and the large majority of the population wishes to keep it that way."
"They will never resign to returning to a state which they have not recognised at all for eight years."
"Today' s reality is that Yugoslavia continues to exist only in the minds of politicians and officials outside that country."
"I regret this as a friend and expert of the former federation of Yugoslavia, but I accept the reality which people have chosen at grassroots level."
"Since the third state of that name has now also disappeared, I am not opposed to financial aid for reconstruction and for the fight against poverty to the three separate regions, nor to the wish of each separately to accede to the EU."
"Färm report (A5-0411/2001)"
". (NL) The former Turkish Province of Bosnia-Herzegovina does not form an ethnic unit."
"Its boundaries were even completely wiped off the map by the provincial reorganisations of the old Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, the division into a Serbian and Croatian region following the 'Sporazum' Treaty in 1939 and the annexation to the nazi-satellite state Croatia in 1941."
"The main reason why the freedom movement under Tito chose to set up a federal state of Bosnia-Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia in 1945, was that it saw this region as a melting pot for creating one Serbo-Croat nation."
"Some time in the future, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro would fuse into one big Serbo-Croat federal state, adopting the same dominating position within the federal Yugoslavia as Russia within the Soviet Union."
"This role of melting pot proved unsuccessful."
"As in the old Yugoslavia, the majority of the population is made up of Serbs and Croats, and their loyalties lie with the new neighbouring states, Serbia or Croatia, from which they wrongly feel cut off."
"I have the impression that we are still taking too little account of this, despite the federalisation of Bosnia, as agreed in Dayton."
"Financial aid is needed, but without the proviso that joint administrative bodies must be strengthened."
"If the EU were to subsidise the transfer of powers by Flanders and Wallonia in Belgium to the federation, this would also be met with horror."
"Lagendijk report (A5-0386/2001) and"
"Färm reports (A5-0385, 0410, 0411/2001)"
"We voted against these reports, which are nothing more than a financial statement of the policy of the major Imperialist powers in this area of the world."
"The so-called 'aid' to the Balkans is, in fact, intended to 'support the balance of payments and help ease ... the external financial constraints' of these countries, as stated in one of the Färm reports (Macedonia)."
"The major powers bear a huge part of the responsibility for the break-up of the former Yugoslavia."
"They are guilty of bombings which affected not only the targeted regions but neighbouring regions as well, if only because they forced a part of the population of Kosovo into exile."
"Their variable geometric diplomacy, which involves them supporting one side and then another, playing on ethnic differences and thus reviving them, is not bringing peace to the region, but encouraging war."
"In voting against these reports, we are expressing our opposition to the Imperialist powers' overall policy on the Balkans and to their interventions."
"I am not happy with the document on the future of the European Union with regard to the Laeken Council, Madam President, even though I voted for it, because it does not say that the European Union should, in future, have the competence to legislate on European pension systems."
"All 15 Member States, plus the other 12 that have applied to join the European Union, have pension systems in deficit."
"The national governments have been unable to administer their funds."
"What better evidence could there be that only the European Union can solve the problem of those workers who hand their money over to the State and then do not get it back when they reach old age?"
"Perhaps - I hope, I am sure - the European Union will be better at administering the European citizens' pension funds."
"With regard to this report on the future of the European Union, in particular the Laeken Council, there are a number of items which I could be in favour of as we want to chart out a new and more dynamic future for the European Union."
"However, putting and accepting proposals which quasi agree with a constitution for the future of Europe, working on the assumption that this is going to happen no matter what without taking consideration or consultation with the people, is unacceptable."
"Mention has been made also of the democratic deficit and of the need to draw all strands of society together."
"With a Convention we end up with a select few non-governmental organisations supposedly representing the majority of the people in the European Union."
"However, when it comes to an implementation of what will come out of that Convention, how many countries will offer a referendum to allow for a full democratic endorsement of the future it wants to see."
"That is why I abstained on the final vote on this particular report."
"As far as the resolution on the future of the Union is concerned, there are many reasons why I could not vote in favour, and here are just two of them."
"First of all, Parliament should stop trying to avoid tackling issues that are crucial for the future of European integration, and should stop restricting itself to providing information - that is, in fact, very superficial - to those who will actually be performing our tasks."
"Furthermore, Parliament is harming its own interests by favouring the parliamentary experience of the future Chair of the Convention over an executive body, whereas the Commission, and Commissioner Barnier in particular, rightly reiterate at every opportunity that the confidence of governments in the Chair of the Convention will be a determining factor in the Convention' s hoped-for success."
"In order to issue its opinion on the preparation of the next Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament has recently adopted a very strange resolution."
"It does not even bother to mention the four themes which, according to the Nice Council, are to serve as a basis for our future debates (division of competences, simplification, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the role of the national parliaments). Instead, it gives a long list of the traditional federalist demands in all areas."
"To cap it all, it demands a Constitution for the European Union - a phrase that was not used in the Nice conclusions but which, nonetheless, the resolution says should be the IGC' s 'objective' ."
"The European Parliament would have done better to closely examine the analysis of Declaration 23 of the Nice European Council, which includes as an objective not a European Constitution but the improvement of the 'democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union' , which, in our view, seems very different, even the opposite."
"The Constitution would involve establishing a higher supra-national power, on fundamental issues as well, which would further distance Europe from its people, and would further weaken its democratic legitimacy."
"Was the Nice Council not aiming for a different objective when it mentioned 'the role of national parliaments in the European system' as one of the four themes to be included on the agenda of the next IGC?"
"The 'in' shows that the current priority should be to involve the national parliaments in the European decision-making processes, so that it can reforge links with the citizens."
"However, the European Parliament is still a long way off this crucial debate, as there is no mention of it in its resolution."
"Admittedly, the Laeken Council can always, if it wishes, head off towards the federalist clouds, but if it wants to address Europe' s real problems we would advise it to take the new direction carved out by the Nice Council."
"- (FR) We are told that this summit must 'assess the results of recent months and prepare for the future' ."
"For the workers of the European Union, the results are tens of thousands of redundancies at Moulinex, Sabena, AOM, Danone, in companies involved in IT and in your intended new economy, in which there is more redundancy than recruitment."
"The results, for working people, are an unbearable level of unemployment, an increase in insecurity and unemployment, illiteracy and a lack of healthcare."
"When the rapporteurs express their desire that 'political, economic and social progress, security and well-being for Europe' s citizens' should be achieved by means of 'the establishment of a well-balanced economic and monetary system resulting from the consolidation of economic and social cohesion policy, the strengthening of employment policy...' , they are simply repeating the hollow words used by all of those people who do not understand what it is like to fear unemployment and be insecure about the future."
"As for the creation of a Convention responsible for preparing for Europe' s future and the revision of the Treaties, the very name of the person who, in France, has been sounded out to preside over it, Giscard d'Estaing, indicates how far-removed it will be from the interests of the workers and the working population of Europe."
"We have voted against it."
"This report falls in line with the strategy of those who are relying on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to provide a further qualitative and meaningful leap in the federalist integration of the EU, under the control of the great powers which will, out of necessity, undermine the sovereignty of countries such as Portugal."
"It insists on speeding up preparations for a new Treaty, which will extend federalist integration, 'forgetting' the lessons and the political consequences of the Irish people' s rejection of the Treaty of Nice."
"Among countless other aspects of which I am critical, the report advocates the creation of a 'convention' - that some people envisage as a form of 'constituent assembly' that it sees as an instrument for imposing conditions on the exercise of the exclusive competence of national governments and parliaments with regard to revising the Treaties, which in terms of its membership, only guarantees the participation of the largest national parties, thereby diminishing the participation of parties with different political positions on Europe, and thereby undermining the pluralism and the genuinely independent and democratic participation of national parliaments."
"I therefore voted against the report."
". I wish to put it on record that I voted against a number of proposals put forward in the Leinen and Mendez de Vigo report on the Laeken Summit."
"I would like to highlight the fact that I voted against Paragraph 4(d) which calls for ""The removal of the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure""."
"This is yet again, an outlandish attack on the CAP which has served us well."
"I do not believe such a move is in the best interests of the future of the Union."
"The CAP forms the bedrock on which the Community was formed."
"It still represents certainty in a difficult economic climate."
"As a result of the adoption of this text and other proposals, I abstained on the final vote."
"I deeply regret that 430 Members of the House voted against this fundamental policy of the CAP, as I outlined earlier."
"The European Union has been a bulwark against recession in the past."
"It has been of immense advantage to my own country, Ireland and I know it will continue to be, in the future, a powerhouse for the citizens of Europe."
"But we should not pull down the good structures and leave our farmers and their families on their own."
". (EL) Clearly the plans for the future of the EU are predicated on the intention of serving the interests of big business even better and consolidating the new imperialist order."
"Unbridled neo-liberalist policies are being pushed forward, with all that this implies for the people."
"We therefore need greater, more widespread and more proactive reaction on the part of our workers and society in general in order to put a halt to this policy and bring about a radical change of direction."
"Prospects for militarising Europe, curtailing national independence and grass-roots sovereignty, restricting the fundamental social and democratic rights of our citizens and launching an all-out attack on the workers' movement and standard of living, are still the core objectives of the arrangements which will be pursued by the European Council in Laeken and then later by the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The broad involvement of national and European agencies being proposed does nothing to reverse or overturn this policy; on the contrary, it ensures that they will be on board to aid and abet its implementation."
"The involvement of all these agencies does nothing to change the substance of the debate, nor does it provide any basic opportunity to intervene, in that, apart from anything else, it will have merely advisory rather than decision-making powers."
"On the other hand, it gives the sovereign powers the chance to proceed with the implementation of their plans with some semblance of legal and democratic authority."
"An attempt is being made to head off the expected mass demonstrations which accompanied previous revisions of the Treaties in Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice, which is why the method used for the so-called 'Charter of Rights' is being used here again."
"However, the results of this method have been tested in practice and proved that broader involvement did not help to consolidate or widen individual and social rights in line with modern-day requirements; on the contrary, these rights were curtailed in line with the dictat of big business, giving rise to serious grass-roots reaction."
"The workers are fighting and will continue to fight to limit the adverse impact of these plans and decisions and every possible means will be used for this fight."
"However, they will not be duped or misled, their fight is getting stronger and stronger and their counter-attack for a different Europe, for different, grass-roots institutions which serve their interests and bring about peace and collaboration based on mutual benefits and real rather than sham respect for all their individual and collective rights is becoming more and more substantial and dynamic."
". (NL) If we considered the EU as one superstate instead of a collaborative association of free nations that want to solve their cross-border problems jointly, we have to note that this state is showing countless democratic shortcomings."
"A great deal is discussed behind closed doors between the governments of the Member States that form part of it."
"If these take part in decisions which contravene the wishes of their national parliaments, they can always blame the other Member States for the choices made."
"The superstate does boast a directly elected parliament that can discuss everything, but unlike the national parliaments, this parliament has no right of initiative, nor does it have the last word in legislation, budget and the formation of coalition."
"It can only oppose legislative documents of the European Commission if there are more voters in favour than stay-at-home voters, including those abstaining and those voting against."
"Thanks to this lack of democracy, large companies have much more, and the individual citizens or their organisations much less, influence than in a normal democracy."
"Both rapporteurs are right to opt for more democracy."
"At the same time, they also choose in favour of continued development towards more harmonisation and centralisation, a trend which has been in motion for years."
"The people of the EU stand to gain nothing from more power for a large-scale level of administration that is difficult to influence."
"This is why my party, the Dutch Socialist Party, rejects that part of the proposals."
". (FR) It is quite right that the Leinen/Méndez de Vigo report has received huge support in this House."
"By proposing a more democratic, transparent and efficient method for reforming the Treaty, the European Parliament' s resolution effectively attempts to provide a remedy for something which has been confirmed by all the opinion polls: the indifference of the citizens to European construction."
"It is to be hoped that the Laeken Summit will manage to create the essential conditions for a more logical and balanced institutional project, by means of the mandate of the Convention."
"The public will, once again, identify with the European project if the participants in the summit manage to present them with political objectives for which it is useful and necessary to strive."
"In order to implement them, it is not necessary to create new institutions."
"It will be sufficient to improve and increase the efficiency of the institutions we already have."
". (DE) I welcome the good work done by the rapporteurs and I therefore also voted in favour of the report."
"But I do object that a problem with the terms 'constitution' and 'constitutional treaty' has arisen for a second time in connection with this subject."
"When the vote was taken in plenum on the Méndez de Vigo/Seguro Report on the Treaty of Nice and the future of the Union on 31 May 2001, an official corrigendum to the protocol had to be submitted with the correct text 'constitutional treaty' ."
"The same problem arose in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs when voting on the Leinen/Méndez de Vigo Report on the Laeken European Council and the future of the European Union on 22 October 2001 in Strasbourg because of differences between the voting documents - the compromise amendments were only available in English and French - and despite my intervention it was not subsequently resolved by a linguistic correction."
"I ask Parliament's Bureau to look into this."
"Kaufmann report (A5-0399/2001)"
"Madam President, I also voted for Mrs Kaufmann' s report on European governance, which, on page 12, last line, item 21, calls for the explanations of vote of the members of the European Council, when they vote on their decisions, to be published, as these explanations of vote are currently not published."
"I am pleased to point out that, in contrast, the European Parliament not only provides for this and permits it but makes a point of allowing the Members themselves to express their explanations of vote."
"Since I am one of these Members, I agree that the reasons why the European Ministers voted one way or the other should be made known in the European Council too."
"With regard to the White Paper on European governance, I had no hesitation in voting in favour of the report by Mrs Kaufmann, since it usefully corrects some of the errors and inconsistencies of the Commission' s document."
"But it is still regrettable that Parliament has not shown more will with regard to certain points which were badly dealt with in that report, particularly on our role in the process of consulting civil society, and the need to deal directly and separately with regional powers, on the one hand, and local powers on the other."
"- (FR) On 4 September, I had the opportunity in this House, in the presence of President Prodi, to offer an initial reaction to the Commission' s White Paper on European governance."
"On that occasion I said that concern for deepening democracy, within the orderly framework of representative democracy, seemed to me to be absent from the text."
"There was confirmation of that criticism from all quarters during the subsequent debates."
"It should be pointed out that the title of the report, European 'governance' , a word which has no clear meaning in practically any language of the European Union, has simply increased the misunderstanding."
"But perhaps that was deliberate and intended to cloud the issue."
"Because the more one thinks about it, the less innocent this White Paper appears."
"I see one inconsistency, one omission and one fallacy in it."
"The inconsistency lies in the principle which, according to the White Paper (title IV, page 37), inspired the authors: ""to integrate the peoples of Europe through scrupulous respect for national identities""."
"This is as contradictory as the 'federation of nation-States' of Jacques Delors, of whom the principal author of the White Paper is a close associate."
"In the confusion resulting from it, the linchpin of the European decision-making process, the national State, is abandoned."
"The report' s proposals are aimed at (page 38) ""providing a structure for the relationship between the European Union and civil society"", developing interaction with ""regional and local actors"", strengthening public confidence in the use of experts, etc... All these actions have the effect of bypassing the national States, which disappear from the scope of the report, when they should be the key element."
"Finally, as I said on 4 September, the White Paper seems to believe that 'governance' can function while disregarding representative democracy."
"The Kaufmann report, voted for by our House, vigorously corrects this fallacy, and we are pleased about that, but it fails to point out that representative democracy is, in turn, disturbed, even distorted, if national democracy is not at centre stage."
"- (DA) The June Movement and the People' s Movement Against the EU have abstained from voting on the Kaufmann report."
"That is because, even if the report contains quite a few very positive features, the June Movement is unable to vote in favour of a report proposing measures as federalist as this."
"Bösch report (A5-0393/2001)"
"Madam President, I voted for the Bösch report on the protection of the Community' s financial interests and the fight against fraud."
"As you know, Madam President, the elderly and pensioners are victims of fraud more than anyone else."
"Since, in the European Union, in administering the money of Europe, so much money goes missing - I am sad to say that EUR 2 028 million was lost through fraud in 2000 - those who suffer most are surely the vulnerable people of the European Union."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to submit proposals for more money to be used to expose fraud before it takes place."
"I should like to agree with Mr Crowley's last couple of comments."
"The British Conservatives, who form the European Democratic wing of the PPE-DE Group, voted against the Bösch report in total because, yet again, there is mention of the European public prosecutor and explicit comments to confer more extensive powers on it when set up, thus leading to Corpus Juris."
"It is quite amazing that this House, which is keen to see the European project go forward, is very casual about the way it looks at the legal system it is trying to create for the people of the European Union."
"The European public prosecutor has many problems, not least those previously mentioned by Mr Crowley in another speech, because Britain and Ireland have completely different legal systems to the European continent."
"Yet again the British Conservatives voted with great pleasure against another report."
". (NL) On account of its largescale, the EU is far removed from its residents."
"This makes it into the ideal breeding ground for favouritism and blurring of moral standard by a small powerful elite and its environment."
"This elite deems itself above the law that applies to others."
"It appears wise for shady and parasitic enterprises to maintain good relations with members of the European Commission and top officials."
"In 1999, the Commission official, Paul van Buitenen, gave us an insight into this practice in his book 'Strijd voor Europa' [The Fight for Europe]."
"Additionally, the unnecessary circulation of large sums of money in the form of funds invites abuse and confusion."
"Every government and every interested group will, time and again, try to attract the largest possible subsidies, and to gain maximum freedom in the spending thereof."
"We cannot change this attitude by thinking up ever more bureaucratic procedures and rules."
"Funds must be intended for solidarity with those who are economically the weakest and for re-distribution to the poorest regions, rather than for patronising conduct or prestige projects."
"Anything which fails to meet this standard should remain fully within the money circuit of the national government, without any interference from Brussels."
"I share the criticism by rapporteur Bösch on the European Commission, the stagnation of inquiries into fraud and nepotism, and OLAF' s powers that are too restricted."
"The fight against the fraud that damages the Community' s financial interests should, for obvious reasons, be one of the European Commission' s main priorities for action."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group can only be delighted at the good results achieved by OLAF during 2000 and, moreover, hopes that such actions can bear even more fruit in the coming years."
"The citizens of Europe, the Member States themselves and, of course, all the Members of the European Parliament, it is fair to assume, are demanding this."
"The UEN Group and the Italian delegation, in particular, however, finds it impossible to vote in favour of the Bösch resolution, although it obviously agrees with that part of its content that shows the political will to fight fraud more effectively."
"In particular, we very strongly oppose the inclusion in the resolution of Paragraphs 32 and 35, which constitute unacceptable interference in the domestic affairs of one of the Member States."
"Indeed, 'points to recent changes in the law in Italy' - Paragraph 32 - and 'calls on the Italian government to stop blocking leave of absence for Italian public prosecutors to take up executive functions with OLAF' - Paragraph 35 - are in both form and substance unacceptable criticisms of the exercise of sovereign powers by a Member State, performed in full compliance with all democratic rules."
"We therefore strongly deplore the inclusion of the two paragraphs in the resolution, for that sets a dangerous precedent in the relations between the European Parliament and the Member States; these relations must always be characterised by mutual respect for the other' s positions, even when the positions differ."
"Agreement with Egypt (B5-0740/2001)"
". (NL) Egypt is a country that is very parsimonious when it comes to guaranteeing the protection of human rights."
"The arrest and imprisonment of 52 homosexual men on account of their sexual orientation is once again a poignant example of this."
"Despite our parliamentary questions, the European Commission failed to add the topic to the agenda at the recent summit meeting with Mr Mubarak."
"It appears that human rights issues fade into the background if military or economic interests are at stake."
"In our view, it is not right to reward Egypt for its misconduct under these circumstances, and we have therefore voted against the proposal."
"Fiori report (A5-0391/2001)"
"Madam President, I voted against Mr Fiori' s report."
"Why did I vote against it?"
"I am in favour of scientific research, but I am worried."
"Why am I worried?"
"I am worried that if we change the genes of human beings, tomorrow there will be something very important missing on the human face and in people' s lives."
"What is more important than anything else in people' s lives?"
"Love, Madam President!"
"What if, tomorrow, we have human beings who are not capable of loving, of expressing love in all its forms?"
"What future life will our children and our children' s children have?"
"That is why I am against any kind of manipulation of the origins of human life."
"Mr President, the surprising result of the vote on the Fiori report can be interpreted in various ways."
"One thing is certain: it shows that Parliament believes that we still need to think very carefully about this extremely sensitive issue."
"I will take this opportunity to reiterate the clear position of the Northern League-Padania: we are, and always shall be, against any idea of human cloning."
"Our basic premise is the conviction that the embryo that is created is human life from conception onwards and that any intervention on the embryo means its death."
"There are alternatives for research which are ethically acceptable as well as scientifically valid, such as research on stem cells, which are also present in the individual after birth."
"Therefore, on this occasion, we call for investment in research and experimentation on stem cells taken from individuals after birth."
"Mr President, today the House has shown itself unworthy of an excellent report by a committee on human genetics."
"A majority of this House, duped by an unholy alliance of socialists and liberals, has distorted a report, so that nearly all of us ended up having to vote against it in order to leave that outstanding product of the Committee on Human Genetics, the original text of the Fiori Report, standing as a beacon of Europe's protection of life."
"I am proud that this Committee, in one year, drafted this magnificent report, which will stand as the product of a committee of real experts."
"This House has yet to learn how to handle this report in a manner worthy of it."
"I appeal to the citizens of the European Union and to the organisations in it defending human life, which are at last becoming as active as the animal protection organisations, to take a close look at how Members here voted and to enter into dialogue with us, so that this House may keep to the course it has taken since the Gergo report at the beginning of the 1980s, that is, to stand up for life - human life for human beings."
"From conception to natural death, human beings deserve all the protection we can give, and without equivocation."
"Mr President, on the Fiori report, Parliament has relinquished its responsibilities as a legislative assembly, because it has taken a wide majority decision to take on the responsibilities of an authority on ethics and morals."
"This is the reason, the root cause of the failure of this Committee on Genetics."
"Fortunately, we still have the Caudron report, which, at least, tells us that the European Union will be able to fund projects on stem cells from supernumerary embryos."
"At least we shall have the assurance that we will not be forced by the European Union or European Union instructions to throw away cells that might give life and health to millions of people."
"As for the rest, it is now a matter for national laws."
"We hope that some people will be wiser than others, less willing to bow to the religious bureaucracies that try to impose their own morals and ethics on all citizens, not just the people who follow those religious practices."
"Mr President, in my view, it is extremely unfortunate and a missed opportunity for this Parliament that this report has not been adopted."
"What can this be attributed to?"
"To the fact that everything that was connected to the report was badly managed: in the first two phases, we had a rather liberal report, in fact, too liberal in my view, and we have ended up with a very restrictive final vote."
"Why is it unfortunate not to have a report?"
"It is unfortunate because at the moment, we are allowing industry to carry on unmonitored: we have not concluded any agreements on the absolutely crucial change in patent law which restricts people in their chances of being cured."
"Neither have we made any agreements on genetic tests."
"We have not reached agreement on whether, in European countries, something similar can be demanded when taking out insurance cover."
"It is a missed opportunity, we have managed it badly and I think that we have done ourselves, but certainly also the citizens of Europe, a disservice by what has happened now after eleven months."
"With regard to Mr Fiori' s report and the resolution resulting from the report, but also very largely from the work of the temporary committee on the problems of human genetics, I was compelled to vote against it because of the significant contradictions included or left in the resolution, but I must say that this vote does not do justice to the work of the committee which has been extremely well chaired by Mr Goebbels."
"I agree with the feeling which has just been expressed very rightly by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, and I must point out that the broadly negative vote of Parliament, even though it might ease everybody' s consciences, nevertheless leaves intact the considerable problems which have led to the creation of the committee and which have, furthermore, only increased since it was created, as the events of last weekend have shown once again."
"(FR) The Fiori report on the ethical, legal, economic and social aspects of human genetics is a good report, on which Mrs Montfort had also done a lot of work. Unfortunately, it has been distorted by amendments mainly presented by the Left, aimed at removing all the moral obstacles to genetic research."
"We are therefore opposed to this distorted text, and in the end, following a last minute u-turn, the European Parliament rejected it, to our great satisfaction."
"It is interesting to ask ourselves what conclusions should be drawn from this, particularly with regard to the vote at our last part-session on Article 3 of the research framework programme 2002-2006, presented by means of the Caudron report, which was to decide the conditions under which the European Union would subsidise genetic research."
"A rather obscure and unsatisfactory amendment was then voted on, in anticipation of the Fiori report, which seemed to authorise the funding of research into therapeutic cloning and research into the stem cells of embryos."
"That same amendment, which was introduced today into the Fiori report in order to distort it, has in the end also been broadly rejected by this House."
"Given that the same text was adopted at the last part-session and then rejected during this one, the least we can say is that the situation is unclear."
"We believe that we should preserve the European Parliament' s traditional position of rejecting therapeutic cloning and research into embryos in the name of respecting human dignity."
". (FR) We have voted against this report which, even amended, is unacceptable."
"The fact that it contains huge scientific errors is not the most serious thing."
"It is above all steeped, from beginning to end, in an obscurantist attitude to science and its applications."
"Some research may lead to excesses? No doubt."
"Especially in a society where the application will be carried out by private companies whose objective is profit."
"But why prohibit certain of them which are connected to genetic research, why refuse public funding for researchers whose work, the future will tell, may be decisive in terms of improving the lives of countless human beings?"
"We voted for some of the good intentions of the text where they were not restricted to being purely platonic, particularly in relation to the protection of workers, the disabled and people suffering rare diseases."
"But we refute all its reasoning, the basis of which is clerical, reactionary and misogynist."
"We reject anything that goes against the right of women to control their own bodies and to choose whether or not to terminate a pregnancy."
"With regard to patents, not only are we completely against any idea of patenting living beings, but we are against the equally horrendous patents on medical products which cannot be used for the care of millions of human beings too poor to pay."
"More generally, we are against all forms of patent on inventions which are not aimed at protecting the inventor but at safeguarding monopoly profits for the capitalist groups which market them."
"It is not research which must be restrained, but, rather, we must put an end to this economy based on profit."
"Since we trust in the ability of humanity to, one day, govern its economy and social life, freeing itself from the hindrances of private property, we confirm our trust in the work of the researchers and in what science can contribute to a society liberated from exploitation, the rule of capital and obscurantism."
". (FR) The discussion of the Fiori report and its resolution has been characterised by a brutal confrontation between promoters of the exploitation of life and embryos and defenders of their humanity and therefore their integrity."
"This stormy debate has largely taken place on the basis of a confusion of values, confirming the historical fragility of the foundations of our humanist and Christian civilisation when faced with the combined attacks of scientism and materialism."
"This confusion of values in Europe and within the Member States has prevented any possibility of defining the status of the embryo, and I regret this."
"Although science shows that the use of adult stem cells renders the use of embryonic cells pointless, scientific thinking is determined to violate the 'sanctity of life' by promoting the exploitation of the human embryo."
"This demonstrates that the defenders of the humanity of life at all its stages of development are confronted with a real ideology which is not only dehumanising, but which is cloaked in a false humanism and realism."
". (FR) I have voted in favour of this report."
"I very much regret the fact that the Fiori report on the 'ethical, legal, economic and social implications of human genetics' has been rejected in plenary session."
"The problems relating to human genetics should not be dealt with in emotional and simplistic terms."
"Nevertheless, that seems to be the approach taken by the majority of the MEPs who have voted against this balanced text."
"This vote represents an unprecedented halt for European research."
"This will therefore put the Union considerably behind its international partners, and leave many investigations in the air."
"With regard to the great fundamental principles and universal values which we defend, the European Parliament had the opportunity to totally exclude the risks of eugenics, as well as reproductive cloning, while implementing solid legal safeguards to provide a framework for what is possible and acceptable in genetic research."
"The European Parliament, by not taking a position on this very topical subject, has shown a lack of courage."
"This is all the more deplorable when we consider that numerous patients are awaiting the development of new therapies which may offer possibilities to many of them."
"I voted in favour of the 1998 directive on legal protection for biotechnological inventions, which I considered to be in order, although, like most of the texts we vote on, it certainly leaves room for improvement."
"It is, however, necessary, as we cannot allow there to be a legal vacuum on this subject in the European Union if we want to stay competitive in international research, which we certainly will not if we do not give legal protection to inventions in the field of biotechnology and freedom to research."
"Such freedom, however, must not lead to the erosion of ethical boundaries."
"The hope of sufferers that there will be treatment for their as yet incurable diseases leads me to believe that even the Church must be open-minded about putting in place, and making use of, new methods of treating chronically sick people."
"Research using existing stem cells, and the promotion of it (also favoured by President Bush of the USA) should be permitted in basic research throughout Europe."
"Research on adult and foetal stem cells should, however, be given priority."
"The use of stem cells for therapeutic purposes is marching on as a potentially revolutionary new method for treating diseases and injuries."
"The therapeutic objective is to develop differentiated cells or permanent tissues for transplantation into patients with diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, heart attacks etc., conditions for which there are, at present, no effective therapies or treatments."
"It is, in any case, clear to me that this should involve only stem cell lines which have already been produced and which can be suspended in a culture in which they can proliferate."
"For me, erosion of the ethical boundary begins with the deliberate breeding of embryos for research purposes."
"That must not be permitted."
". The Fiori report, even in its amended form, is a muddled and unhelpful contribution to the public discussion on stem cell research and other issues arising from developments in medical research."
"Decisions of this nature are largely a matter for Member States and the European Parliament must respect subsidiarity."
"The UK, for example, has quite rightly conducted its own debate on stem cell research and come to the conclusion that a tightly regulated research programme can eventually bring benefits to sufferers of highly disabling and painful conditions."
"The UK has successfully transposed the patenting directive, as all Member States should have done, and the distinction between inventions and discoveries is quite clearly understood."
"No review or attempt to change the directive is appropriate."
"For these reasons Members of the EPLP have voted against the Fiori report."
". (FR) The Fiori report has represented an historic attempt by the European Union to impose the adoption of a common position with regard to something which forms the very basis of civilisations: the definition of the human being and its dignity."
"We have witnessed a ferocious battle between the defenders of the integral and nonnegotiable dignity of the human being, of which I am one, and the promoters of an ideology which is a combination of scientism with materialism."
"By rejecting the report by 400 votes to 37, Parliament has clearly and irrefutably demonstrated the limits of European parliamentarianism."
"Together, the Members have refused any compromise solution, which is a victory for philosophy over political logic, and I am delighted about that."
"It proves that the European Parliament, which is supposed to be the 'democratic organ' of the EU, has neither the institutional legitimacy nor the political capacity to impose a common position on the basis of the 'nature of the human being' , and its dignity."
"By means of this vote, the European Parliament has proved that only the States can create the appropriate framework for dealing with these fundamental issues, respecting the cultural and spiritual traditions on which our civilisation is based."
"I am calling for a ban, at European level, on the creation of human embryos for both therapeutic and reproductive purposes, for the following two reasons:"
"1) We cannot give up the struggle to develop techniques that bring the advantages of being able to manipulate human embryos without the ethical difficulties that this poses."
"It would be a mistake for the legislator, out of the desire to give the green light to this technique, to abdicate his responsibility to pass tough legislation, for many years to come, which, in a field that develops at such speed, is all the more necessary. This would send the message to scientists and to industry that they should opt for the development of techniques that are not highly developed today and which are extremely costly, such as adult cell manipulation, but which still have a broad scope for use."
"2) The creation of human embryos by means of nuclear transfer would facilitate cloning for reproductive purposes, which is generally considered to be an aberration."
"As a matter of fact, this is the reason why the United Kingdom' s House of Lords this week rejected legislation authorising therapeutic cloning."
"This ban must allow for three exceptions, however, which would have to be tightly controlled and regulated:"
"research must be allowed on supernumary embryos, which are produced for the purpose of IVF but whose implantation is no longer possible for the genetic parents and are, consequently, frozen, eventually to be destroyed;"
"research must be allowed on the 64 cell lines that already exist;"
"research must be allowed on embryonic or foetal stem cells resulting from spontaneous or therapeutic abortions."
". (FR) I have voted against the resolution of this report as amended, as have my colleagues in the French Socialist Delegation and the Parliamentary Group of the European Socialist Party, because I have noted that the European Parliament has not managed to achieve a consensus and a reasonable position on the fundamental ethical and legal issues relating to human genetics, which I deplore."
"I therefore believe that the text obtained is inconsistent and contradictory on certain points, such as the funding of research into embryonic stem cells or into the use of surplus embryos."
"The negative vote demonstrates the inability of the rapporteur and the temporary committee to bring this difficult debate to a conclusion."
"The lack of a European Parliament opinion is all the more harmful given that we are at a point where certain Member States are going to have to transpose the directive on the patentability of living matter into their national legislation, thereby modifying their legislation in this field."
"I wanted to offer my support for research freedom, particularly for genetic research, into surplus embryonic stem cells, and although this type of research involves uncertainties and risks, it is very important that there be Community regulation and funding so that private research does not have a monopoly in this field."
"- (SV) Mr Fiori' s report adopts positions on many difficult issues regarding human genetics, including the ethical principles which ought to apply in this area."
"As a Christian Democrat, I believe that we need ethical parameters in society, with the most fundamental aspect being respect for human dignity."
"However commendable the aim, it does not justify our using people as a means to an end."
"Cloning is, therefore, unjustified in any form, whether the chosen adjective is 'therapeutic' or 'reproductive' ."
"It is impossible to make such a distinction, as therapeutic cloning is nothing other than the initial stages of reproductive cloning, with, from the beginning, a stated intention to destroy the embryo which develops from the substitution of the cell nucleus."
"The embryo already contains everything needed for a human being."
"Up to birth and beyond, we do not develop into people, but as people."
"Research using embryonic stem cells is ethically highly controversial and is, moreover, banned in four Member States (Germany, Austria, Ireland and Portugal), but this is not the case where the use of adult stem cells is concerned."
"It is, therefore, my view that research using adult stem cells should be prioritised, while ethically highly controversial embryonic stem cell research should not be funded through the Framework Programme."
"Under the principle of subsidiarity, this does not prevent individual national governments from choosing to fund such research."
"The fact that the funds available within the Framework Programme are limited means that we must set priorities."
"As such, research which is so ethically controversial and which clearly breaches the law in many Member States should not be supported."
"I have therefore chosen to support the report as it was presented prior to the reading in plenary, in line with my vote in favour of Mr Caudron' s report on the sixth framework programme."
". (FR) This is one of the fundamental issues to which the very notion of compromise has no relevance and which presents us with radical choices."
"This is the case with human genetics, where the unassailable dignity of the human being is at stake."
"The dividing lines running through this Parliament were clearly illustrated by the vote on the Fiori report."
"There is a liberal-libertarian line which exploits the flag for research freedom and claims that there is a so-called need not to be left behind by the United States and calls for European Union funding of research into embryonic stem cells and surplus cells, thereby opening the floodgates to the reification and the marketing of emerging human life, at an extreme stage of its embryonic fragility, to the development of actual embryo farms, where human embryos would be created for the sole purpose of killing them and cultivating their cells."
"The so-called compromise approach seems particularly hypocritical and is simply an indirect means of authorising therapeutic cloning."
"It consists of accepting the funding of research into cell lines obtained from embryonic stem cells, which means the destruction of embryos and affectively authorises therapeutic cloning, since cell lines do not have the same genetic heritage as the receiver suffering from an incurable disease."
"The third position, which we support, and which has been defended competently and with conviction by Elizabeth Montfort, consists of rejecting any exceptions when it comes to the dignity of the human being, at whatever stage of development."
"We demand that the prohibition of cloning be maintained and we reject the false distinction between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning, since they are exactly the same process."
"We demand the prohibition of research into embryonic stem cells and surplus embryos and we demand concerted support for research into adult stem cells, the therapeutic applications of which are particularly promising."
". (FR) The Fiori report represented an attempt by certain Members to reintroduce into European thinking an intended hierarchy for the dignity of human beings."
"Coming from the European cultural and spiritual tradition, I do not believe that any hierarchy is acceptable when it comes to human dignity."
"Whether we are talking about ill people, disabled people, people at the end or at the beginning of their lives, every human being deserves the same degree of dignity."
"Furthermore, I am categorically opposed to any attempt to subjugate any section of humanity to the supposed benefit of another."
"It is one of the great characteristics of man that he strives for his own overall good, and scientific research contributes to this while also having to adapt to it."
"Philosophy and history teach us that any compromise of the respect for the human being leads inescapably to its negation."
"Finally, it is through political courage and a clear vision of what gives the human being its dignity and greatness, that it remains possible to maintain a civilisation and a form of progress which are truly human."
"That concludes the statements on the vote."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament suspended."
"(The sitting was closed at 2.13 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 29 November 2001."
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of Thursday 29 November have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, this concerns the Fiori report which we voted on in Brussels last time."
"I have to say that this was Parliament at its worst."
"We had a temporary committee which met for ten months to discuss an issue that could have been discussed within the existing committees."
"Firstly, it was an abuse of the temporary committee status - Parliament is very fortunate to have this privilege, and I do not think that we should abuse it, especially in the way it was abused with that vote and the final outcome."
"As chairman of the Committee on Budgets, I would dearly love to know the cost of that temporary committee for an outcome that had nothing at the end of it."
"I would hope that, if we have temporary committees in future, they will deal with subjects outside the normal committee structure."
"If we have enquiries in the future, let us try to carry them out within the budget and not give rise to excess expenditure."
"Mr Wynn, I can assure you that you will receive an answer very soon."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved)"
"Order of business"
"Madam President, the Commissioner probably gave us more than we already formally have in the extremely important negotiations which were preceded by many debates here in this Parliament, and were followed by a resolution which we presented to the Commission, to which the Commissioner made reference during the negotiations at every opportunity and stated: ""in the final analysis, I need the majority and support of the European Parliament"" ."
"And we would now decide to hold a debate without a final say from us?"
"I cannot really imagine this."
"I would also like to call on the fellow MEPs from the other parties, irrespective of the content of their opinions, to conclude this debate with a political verdict."
"We owe it to the Commission and to the dignity of this House."
"Since the negotiations are of such significance, we must really employ our full powers and reach a verdict."
"Madam President, I do not think that anyone here will deny that the Doha Summit was an important political event, both for the European Union and for the whole world."
"I believe that it is equally important to carefully analyse the outcome of the summit and the decisions that were taken there."
"Rather than running the risk of adopting a superficial position, Parliament can simply publish a few brief considerations."
"However, I think that it is too early to carry out a serious political assessment, which is in fact what is expected of a parliament."
"I believe that we must wait and not vote for a resolution this week."
"I shall now put the request to the vote."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Still with regard to Tuesday, I have received a request from Mr Westendorp to postpone the vote on telecommunications until Wednesday."
"Madam President, with regard to the telecommunications package which we are going to vote on - tomorrow, in principle - I would like to ask that the vote be delayed until Wednesday."
"We have just held a meeting with the Council and the Commission and they advise us that, so that the various groups may have time to examine the compromise proposals, that vote should be held a day later."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Regarding Wednesday"
"Madam President, on Wednesday's draft agenda there is a joint debate on the Middle East at 3 p.m."
"It might be helpful for colleagues if in advance of that debate, in which there will be a great deal of interest, Parliament's services would consider reprinting copies of the joint address to this House by the Speaker of the Knesset and the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council."
"The message delivered on that occasion might shed some light in our current darkness."
"Madam President, on the list of urgent topics relating to human rights, there is one on Irian Jaya and another on Sulawesi."
"Both islands are part of one country, Indonesia."
"I propose that they be combined under one title, 'Indonesia' , and that the situation of both islands be dealt with under that title, and we would thereby have time to deal with the tragic situation in Ireland."
"I wish to make a point of order to draw the attention of this House to the grave discourtesy and disrespect shown to it by a member of the Belgian presidency."
"I refer to Mrs Magda Aelvoet, Minister for Consumer Protection, Public Health and the Environment in the Federal Parliament of Belgium."
"I wrote to Mrs Aelvoet on 13 June 2001 - and that letter was signed by 20 Members of this House - requesting a meeting with her to raise the question of the fraudulent importation of cat and dog fur products into the EU from Asia and China."
"We received no reply to that letter."
"I wrote again on 12 July 2001 and received no reply."
"Mrs Alvoet came here to Strasbourg on 12 September 2001 to address an intergroup meeting on animal welfare."
"I raised this issue with her: she said that she had written to me and had extended an invitation to the MEPs who had signed the letter with me to come and meet her in Brussels."
"When I returned to Brussels, there was no sign of this letter."
"I wrote for a third time to Mrs Aelvoet requesting the letter and have received no reply."
"Three times I have followed up with telephone calls and again received no reply."
"I find this a grave discourtesy to the Members of this House who signed that letter and I also find it astonishing that a minister in the EU presidency should come before a packed meeting of an intergroup and say that she has written to me when she knew full well that this was a lie and no letter had been sent."
"I hope, therefore, Madam President that you will confirm, on behalf of this House, that this sort of behaviour by a minister in the presidency is gravely discourteous and not going to be tolerated in future."
"Mr Stevenson, we shall certainly take note of your complaint."
"Madam President, like Mr Stevenson I want to raise a point of order with regard to a matter of discourtesy to this House."
"Some months ago I wrote to the President of the Commission asking a formal written question, as I am entitled to do as a Member."
"I received a reply which said: 'the research needed in order to provide a detailed response would be out of all proportion to the result desired and exceed the requirements of a response to a written question.'"
"That is a gross discourtesy to any Member asking a question of a body, which is supposed to be, there to serve and to be transparent in response to requests for information."
"If that were the sort of response a minister in the British Government gave to a member of the British House of Commons, he would deservedly be pilloried in that House."
"I expect better from the President of the Commission."
"I wish to say, on behalf of this House, that when a Member asks a perfectly legitimate question I expect that question to be answered to the fullest extent."
"We should not just be given an excuse and some sort of non-answer."
"I would like to remind the President of the Commission of his pledges to provide transparency and openness in terms of information to this House."
"Of course, Mr Bradbourn, I wholeheartedly agree with you."
"Madam President, I had announced that I wanted to make a statement on behalf of the Socialist Group with regard to the constitutional crisis in the European Union following the last meeting of the Council of Justice and Interior Ministers last week."
"My statement is as follows:"
"I would like to express our concern about the grave situation which has arisen in view of the Laeken Summit, because, by supporting the report by Mrs Reding, of the PPE-DE, and the report by Mr Watson, a Liberal, which was widely supported by the European Parliament, this House has defined a clear approach in the fight against terrorism."
"Since 11 September, the European Council, on two occasions, in Brussels and in Ghent, has maintained the same approach, without reservations from any Head of State or Government."
"The European Parliament has dealt with the Commission' s two proposals by means of an urgency procedure, with huge support at the last part-session in Brussels."
"Today, Parliament is going to be consulted once again and we are in a situation where one government, the Italian government, is refusing to accept something which is clear to all the institutions of the European Union."
"Madam President, I would like you to express, on behalf of my group, firstly our support for the President of the European Council, Mr Verhofstadt, who will go to Rome tomorrow to try to resolve this unacceptable situation; secondly, to express our support for the Commission, which has exercised its right to initiative responsibly and with a sense of duty."
"Finally, I would also like you to strongly protest, on behalf of Parliament, at the unacceptable statements, delivered in coarse and rude language, made at the weekend by a former colleague of ours, now an Italian Government Minister, Mr Bossi, which would make Mr Haider green with envy."
"This is a very important issue, on which we are all united."
"If we cannot move ahead as fifteen, we will do so as fourteen, but we must combat terrorism on all fronts, and one of them is corruption and the recycling and laundering of money."
"(Applause from the left)"
"I certainly share the concern that Enrique Barón Crespo has raised at the failure of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers to reach agreement on the proposal for a European arrest warrant."
"I note, however that, in addition to Mr Verhofstadt's planned visit to Rome, there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs ministers on Thursday of this week."
"It must be hoped that agreement can be reached on that occasion."
"The House anticipated that an agreement might not be reached and recommended at least consideration of the use of Article 40 of the Treaty which would allow a number of countries to proceed on the basis of reinforced cooperation."
"Nobody wants that solution; it must be hoped that we can reach agreement between 15, but, one country must not be allowed to hold up progress in the fight against terrorism called for by the Heads of State and Government in Ghent."
"(Applause from the left and the centre)"
"Madam President, I cannot remain silent for Mr Barón Crespo has, of course, made the most of the opportunity to transform what might actually be well-founded comments into a crusade, which has been on the march ever since the Italian people, of their own free will, elected a new government."
"Mr Barón Crespo just will not accept this, and the sooner he does the better."
"I want all the Members who are protesting to understand this too: democracy is this, ladies and gentlemen; every people chooses its government freely and willingly."
"More specifically, I would stress the absolute falsehood of what Mr Barón Crespo has said. The government and the Italian people are more committed to combating terrorism than anyone."
"The government and the Italian people have paid the price of terrorist attacks in recent years and have always been in the front line. It is silly to confuse the issue."
"There is no point in trying to put everything under one roof."
"We are discussing the possibility of extending the European arrest warrant and it is on this, the extension of the warrant to other offences not initially covered, that we are attempting - and we are confident that agreement will be reached - to find a way of accommodating the different legal traditions and the different legislative frameworks of each country, so that we can be sure that the decisions we take to address the current critical situation of terrorism will also provide us with a properly harmonised Community legislative framework."
"This, then is the issue, this and no other."
"Anyone who wants to exploit the tragic events of 11 September to continue with this mad campaign against a legitimately elected government will certainly not find support."
"I will end by suggesting that Mr Barón Crespo reserve his enthusiasm for more justified causes, and that he stop trying to mislead us by confusing the issues on the table."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barón Crespo's comments demand a response."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say that we expect that the Italian government, in which we have the greatest confidence, will help to ensure that we can finally reach an agreement."
"We regard the fight against terrorism as a priority, and this is an issue on which there should not be any differences between the party-political families."
"However, Mr Barón Crespo, I also believe this not an issue that should be the subject of party-political controversy, and we also know - please listen to what I am saying, I am trying to be very objective - that no result has been achieved on the party statute."
"You also know that it was not those of my own political persuasion who contributed to this failure."
"I would ask you, just as you are critical in other cases, to be critical of your own party when results are not forthcoming, as in the case of the party statute."
"Your credibility would be greater if you applied the same yardsticks right across the political spectrum."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Madam President, I think it is pretty rich to compare the European arrest warrant with a party statute."
"However, there are, of course, parties - particularly in Germany - where there is a close link between arrest warrants and their party statute."
"(Applause and laughter) I would just like to say one thing to Mr Lisi: the entire 'Forza Italia' delegation has, at all the hearings on the Commission's proposals that have taken place in this House up to now, agreed to all the European Parliament's opinions."
"So I wonder why the Italian Prime Minister, who comes from the same party as Mr Lisi - who incidentally approved all this himself - is now instructing his Minister for the Interior to veto offences which we all agreed should be prosecuted at European level."
"I wonder if this could possibly have something to do with party politics, but not the issue that Mr Barón Crespo has rightly raised here."
"Madam President, the great majority of my group have voted against the Watson report on the European arrest warrant."
"However, our motives were very different from those of Mr Berlusconi, and that is why I should like to make this contribution, mainly to avoid being tarred with the same brush."
"In principle, the Group of the Greens are in favour of a European arrest warrant, but only after a number of minimum standards have been put in place in the field of law of criminal procedure, for example with regard to legal aid or to criminal investigation methods."
"The rationale underlying a European arrest warrant is that all legal systems are more or less the same, and that it really does not matter in which country one is sentenced."
"That is not yet the case at the moment."
"If these systems were alike, it would not be so difficult to establish these minimum standards."
"I know that sooner or later, everyone will support these minimum standards, but our group has made them a condition for a European arrest warrant."
"As such, this is absolutely and fundamentally a different viewpoint from that adopted by Mr Berlusconi, and it should not be confused with his."
"Neither should it be confused with a kind of anti-European sentiment."
"We are in favour of a European arrest warrant, but only when this condition has been met."
"Madam President, Mr Poettering, you just mentioned the European party statute in connection with the European arrest warrant."
"The only real connection is that they are both things we consider to be desirable."
"However, I do not quite understand your criticism of my group."
"You were talking as if it was my group's fault that nothing has happened so far."
"As I understand it, the situation was rather different."
"There were governments that wanted parties existing in only two countries to be granted this status."
"Surely that cannot be so, the European party statute cannot be a way of providing back-door finance to national or regional parties."
"I just wanted to establish that point so that no false impressions arise or misleading discussions take place."
"Madam President, I should like to change the subject and get us off this tack."
"Today is International Human Rights Day and I wish to express my distress and horror at the tragic death of the eight refugees, including three children, who suffocated in a container in southern Ireland."
"Eight dead refugees who were the victims not so much of the traffickers, as the authorities hastened to assure us, but of European indifference and a global system which allows and encourages the free movement of heads, but not the free movement of people, of a system which condemns two thirds of the people on this planet to live in conditions of unbelievable poverty."
"The European Parliament cannot stand by impassively in the face of the present-day refugee tragedy, nor can we feel safe in fortress Europe surrounded by such human misery and such a huge development divide."
"I think it is a very good sign that we shall be debating the question of refugees and immigrants during the urgent debate on Thursday, and I would be most obliged, Madam President, if you would convey these views to the Council in Laeken."
"I wish to raise also the discovery of eight people dead in a container of furniture in County Wexford over the weekend."
"The dead included a four-year old boy, a ten-year old girl and a sixteen-year old boy."
"There were three adults found dead also - two men and a woman - and there are five survivors."
"It appears that, so far as we understand it, about 11 of these people came from Turkey, one from Albania and one from Algeria."
"It seems to me quite appalling that we have a situation in Europe where people are so desperate that they have to put themselves into the hands of criminals in order to try and find a new life in Europe."
"We have done something serious about dealing with the criminals on the one hand and with our approach to immigration on the other."
"We cannot continue to allow the situation where people are so desperate that they will do anything and even put themselves and their children at risk in order to find a new life."
"I would ask those in this House who are supporting Mr Berlusconi in opposing the European arrest warrant to ask themselves why are they supporting a situation where the criminals who put these people into this container will escape the justice which needs to be meted out to them?"
"Could I also ask, Madam President..."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Madam President, I am going to make a very simple proposal relating to International Human Rights Day."
"Given that eight people recently lost their lives in tragic circumstances and that you, Madam President, often invite us to show our respect for those who are victims of violence by observing a minute' s silence, we should, naturally, observe a minute' s silence tomorrow morning at the opening of the sitting, for the eight people who recently died at the hands of evil traffickers."
"Madam President, I hope that the new President will treat all Members equally."
"I have been indicating for quite some time - well before many people who have already spoken - that I want to make a point of order."
"I have two points."
"The first is in relation to Mr Stevenson's attack on a Belgian minister who is not here to defend herself."
"A personal and vitriolic attack like that is unjustified when the person is not present."
"Secondly, in relation to what has happened in Ireland this weekend, it is only proper that we should have a debate on this."
"People are focusing on the wrong aspect."
"It is quite clear that the fortress mentality of Europe is what is causing people to put their lives at risk, by trusting people who are trying to make a profit."
"We need to open up the borders instead of encouraging this kind of fortress mentality."
"That is the only way we are going to ensure that people do not lose their lives in such a tragic way."
"Dover and Wexford are only two examples of what is to come."
"Finally, I am very disappointed that some of my fellow Irish Members in this House did not feel that they could support this being discussed in Parliament."
"That is a tragedy, considering that it happened in their own constituency."
"Madam President, I rise to support the remarks of Mr de Rossa and Mrs McKenna with regard to the horrific situation and tragedy in Wexford, Ireland."
"The Irish Government has already expressed its sentiments in this regard and will be taking appropriate action."
"I support you also, Madam President, in making space on Thursday's agenda for a debate on this tragedy."
"Certainly, Mr Fitzsimons."
"As you know, Parliament has decided to include this issue in the debate on topical questions to be held on Thursday."
"Madam President, at the last part-session in Brussels you very kindly said that you would write to the Greek authorities about the 12 British and two Dutch plane spotters who were arrested."
"I was wondering whether you have had any reply to that letter."
"My constituent Wayne Groves is still in prison after nearly five weeks with no charge and no trial."
"I believe it is against the European Convention on Human Rights."
"I should like to know whether there is anything further you can do on their behalf and whether you have had that reply."
"Yes, Mrs Lynne, I have received a reply from Mr Papandreou, the Greek Foreign Affairs Minister, which I shall send on to you and to all Members as soon as possible, as this reply is open to public scrutiny."
"As you will see, the letter does not, unfortunately, give an entirely satisfactory response regarding the people who are being detained."
"Madam President, I should like to endorse Mrs Lynne' s point of order, but I should like to ask you to re-establish contact, and I should also like to call on my fellow Greek MEPs to ensure that these spotters, who have now spent nearly five weeks in a Greek prison for indulging in their pastime, can be brought to court before next Friday, because procedures will otherwise be delayed by a three-week break and these young men, these spotters who were enjoying their pastime, would then be locked up seven or eight weeks without being brought before the law."
"I would therefore ask you and my fellow Greek MEPs kindly to exert some political pressure to ensure that these spotters can have a court hearing before next Friday."
"Madam President, I would like to endorse the point made by Mrs Lynne."
"Today is Human Rights Day and yet there are 12 European citizens in prison in Greece without trial."
"Members opposite have been raising the issue of the European arrest warrant - this incident shows precisely why Members on this side of the House have concerns about a European arrest warrant."
"British citizens engaged in the harmless pursuit of plane-spotting find themselves in prison in Greece without trial."
"I really look forward to seeing the reply you have received, which you described as unsatisfactory, and hope you will respond in very robust terms to the Greek Government."
"They must not be allowed to keep European citizens in prison without trial."
"Unfortunately, Mr Perry, the reply was unsatisfactory, as I just said."
"Mr Papandreou' s reply was as follows: 'I have made known the interest that the Foreign Affairs Ministry is taking in the matter."
"Nevertheless, as you can understand, the executive power cannot possibly intervene in any way in the workings and the independence of the judiciary.'"
"I shall, of course, see what action I can take in this matter."
"But unfortunately the response is, for the time being, negative."
"Madam President, I should like to comment on the positions taken by the honourable Members in connection with the arrest of a number of Britons in Greece and, first, to assure them that, as Members of Parliament, we have no way of influencing the independence of the Greek judiciary, and rightly so, nor do I believe that you are able to influence the judiciary in your countries."
"Secondly, you must know, as we said during the last debate in Brussels, that the acts for which they were arrested, at least as they have been reported in the press, are acts for which they would have been arrested in any one of the fifteen Member States of the European Union."
"So we would be well advised to respect the institutions on the basis of which the fifteen Member States work together, to respect the independence of the judiciary and to respect the laws which apply in the fifteen Member States."
"Let us be clear on one thing: there are fifteen countries here, represented by numerous parties and numerous persuasions, all are equal and of equal value, and no one has the right to tell other countries how to act, as if they were countries which did not belong to Europe."
"I should like to thank you, Madam President, for writing a letter to the Greek authorities about the plane spotters, and for what you said today."
"It is particularly important that you do this on behalf of the whole European Parliament and as you represent a Member State that is not involved on either side."
"You said you would reflect on further action you would take."
"Could I ask when you will report back to the plenary on that?"
"I should also like to thank Mr Souladakis for what he said."
"I believe that there is a common understanding here of the necessity to observe human rights and of the need for cooperation between our two states in the European Union, as well as for respect for the independence of the judiciary."
"Through you, Madam President, perhaps I can appeal to all the Greek Members of this House to see whether we can produce some form of joint statement in support of those principles which might advance understanding and lead to a quicker resolution of this issue for the 12 individuals involved."
"Madam President, as you are well aware, the situation caused by ETA' s terrorism in Spain is horrendous, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your work during your Presidency."
"I would like to say once again that I totally reject ETA and all those who support it or apologise for it."
"Madam President, both myself and my party have been seriously slandered in some sections of the Spanish media, since, through illness, I was not able to attend the last part-session in Brussels, where a debate and a vote were held on Mr Watson' s report, which I fully supported through various press releases which were sent to all the Spanish media 24 hours before the debate and the vote, and which were systematically hushed up."
"For all these reasons, Madam President, I would ask for your support in this situation in which I have been unable to defend myself."
"To this end, since my position and that of my party was clear, public and expressed prior to the vote, I would like to ask you formally that my vote in favour of the Watson report and Amendments Nos 117 and 118 be registered, as that is how I would have voted had I been present."
"Furthermore, I would point out that the inclusion of my vote would not significantly alter the final result of the vote."
"Finally, I would like to publicly thank the Efe Agency, the only one to express the truth in its communications."
"We will always support the defence of life and the most fundamental rights and we will always be against murderers and those who justify and support them."
"Madam President, today we are commemorating International Human Rights Day."
"By coincidence, this week's agenda features a joint debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, requiring straightforward involvement by Parliament on human rights."
"At the beginning of this year, I denounced in this House the pardon of 15 torturers by the Spanish Government, as this means that torture will continue to be frequently practised by the Spanish police."
"Three months afterwards, a young woman, Iratxe Sorzabal,"
"(The speaker brandished a poster)"
"was sexually humiliated and subjected to torture sessions for hours from the moment of her arrest."
"These photos were taken in the hospital and show the marks ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, on Wednesday, we are going to debate an item on cooperation between the European Union and the United States in the fight against terrorism."
"However, we discovered - on the Internet, in fact - that this debate is going to be based on an exchange of letters between a representative of Mr Bush - a Mr Forster, I believe - and Mr Prodi."
"Parliament does not have a copy of these letters, although we can read them on the Internet, in which the United States government demands Europe take forty or so measures to cooperate with the fight against terrorism."
"It also appears - we can only say 'it appears' as we have no documents to refer to - that Mr Prodi sent a reply to the United States government at the end of November."
"I think that, for this slightly rushed debate to be held in more favourable conditions - the debate is, however, scheduled for Wednesday - it would be helpful for Parliament to obtain a copy of the letter that the United States government sent to Mr Prodi and Mr Prodi' s reply."
"That is the request I would like to make."
"Of course, Mr Krivine, we shall try to follow this up as soon as possible."
"Madam President, this point may be of some interest to the House."
"Honourable Members may recall voting in the mini-part-session on the Foster report on common rules in the field of civil aviation security."
"This report had to be brought forward very quickly in the light of the events of 11 September."
"We were then awaiting the response from the Transport Council meeting last Friday and everyone hoped that a common position would be reached."
"I should like to inform the House that the Transport Council and Member States did not reach a common position, despite urgent appeals from all sides on the desperate need for these measures and despite the fact that this Parliament had bent over backwards to do its very best in a very short period of time."
"The behaviour of the Member States and the Council in all of this has been quite appalling."
"This is probably one of the most important measures that has come through since 11 September and it would have affected 38 European countries."
"I will keep this House informed as to progress but I would like you, Madam President, to pass on our comments to the presidency."
"I would like to draw your attention, Madam President, and that of Parliament, to the unacceptable and discriminatory behaviour of the Albanian authorities towards the Greek minority in the town of Chimara particularly, where, last week, special police forces demolished buildings, physically abused members of that minority, to whom the buildings belonged, even women and children."
"The buildings included the minority' s administrative headquarters, the infants' school and several shops, which, on the pretext that they had been poorly constructed, were destroyed by bulldozers on the instructions of the town' s mayor, whose election, it must be stressed, was not recognised as legitimate by Council of Europe observers."
"Madam President, I think that Parliament should take on board these extremely regrettable actions when preparing for the forthcoming negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Albania."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, are we, the Members of the European Parliament, all fraudsters?"
"Are we all thieves?"
"Are we all idlers?"
"Are we timewasters who do nothing from morning to night and spend our time enjoying ourselves and getting rich?"
"I do not think so."
"Yet that is what is stated in a book by an Italian journalist, Mario Giordano, entitled 'L' Unione fa la truffa' [The Union is a swindler]."
"The title says it all."
"This journalist is also, I regret to say, the director of a major Italian television company."
"The book, which I found in a bookshop in Rome - where I had gone to meet my mother and sister as I often do - filled me with horror and sent shivers down my spine, for it describes all of us Members of Parliament as idlers who do nothing but plot frauds and robberies."
"Madam President, please would you examine this book and instigate legal proceedings for libel against Mario Giordano, who, it pains me to admit, is Italian."
"Thank you, Mr Fatuzzo, for this information."
"I can assure you that we shall take a close look at this book and see what can be done to restore our reputation."
"Madam President, I wish to draw the House's attention to the vigorous protests and exasperation of Greek farmers, who are again involved in mass dynamic demonstrations against the anti-farming policy of the European Union, which is turning them off their land, ruining them and forcing them to abandon the countryside."
"Our farmers are fighting against the policy of quotas which limits dynamic arable farming, even of products in which the European Union and Greece are nowhere near self-sufficient, such as oil, tobacco and cotton, for which the Council even ignored a resolution by the European Parliament calling for a 50% increase in quotas."
"Our farmers are fighting against their exploitation by the processing industry, which snaps up their produce at derisory prices."
"Hundreds of thousands have already abandoned farming and joined the ranks of the unemployed."
"They are calling for quotas to be abolished, at least for products in which the European Union is not self-sufficient."
"They are protesting about policy to date."
"They are calling for infrastructure projects, such as irrigation works."
"They are calling for producer prices which cover the cost of production and afford them a profit."
"Madam President, we are at their side in their just fight for survival with all the means at our disposal, even if their fight qualifies as terrorism as defined recently by the Ministers of Justice of the European Union, a definition which we fear will also be adopted by the Laeken Summit."
"Madam President, ten years ago this week, our Sakharov prize winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
"This Saturday, all living Laureates will go to Oslo to commemorate 100 years of the Nobel Peace Prize - she will not be there."
"She has been kept under house arrest since September 2000 and has not been allowed to move about freely for 13 years."
"Will you please, Madam President, send her a message of support from this Parliament and also urge the Norwegian Nobel Institute to express their deep concern about the fact that she is not able to join them on Saturday in Oslo."
"Would you also ask the Nobel Institute to urge the military junta in Rangoon, Burma, to give Aung San Suu Kyi her freedom forthwith."
"Mrs Kinnock, I am, of course, very willing to take this step, but I think that it will be even more effective after the debate, which is on the agenda under the item on human rights, has been held on Thursday."
"Once we have held the debate, I shall be able to inform the Institute of the position that the European Parliament has clearly adopted."
"I would like to inform you that, at the request of several groups, we will be holding a brief but intense commemoration tomorrow to mark the events of 11 September."
"The commemoration will take place in the House, just before the address by the President of South Korea, in other words at approximately 11.50 a.m."
"European Food Authority"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0416/2001), by Mr Whitehead, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1088/1/2001 - C5-0414/2001 - 2000/0286(COD))"
"Madam President, today's debate is the culmination of a long process which began in the days of the BSE epidemic."
"It is in a sense a proposal that comes as much from this House as from the other institutions of the European Union because our two temporary committees of inquiry culminated in the recommendation that there should be a body of this kind. One Commission fell, another came into office accepting that something of this sort should happen and it is that proposal from President Prodi, driven forward by the Commissioner, which we are dealing with today."
"It is, therefore, the work of many hands and if this debate today is considered, calm and, I hope, rational it is because of the extent to which the three sides in the triangle of forces have attempted to come to an agreed conclusion by the time of this second reading debate, in order to expedite the introduction of the new authority itself."
"There should not be any undue delay."
"If we can avoid the conciliation stage, we will do so."
"There are still perhaps a few reservations which I shall refer to in a moment, but we have come to a point where we believe we have a consensus in this House."
"We certainly have a majority in this House and I should like to thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs of the other political groups, particularly Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes for the work they have done right through since the original White Paper."
"I would also like to thank my own researcher, Michelle Smythe, and everyone from the Commission and the Council, under both the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, who have brought this forward."
"Since Mrs Aelvoet has taken a bit of a pounding today I shall pay tribute to her part in it also."
"We have now agreed on a timetable to get the new authority up and running. To do that there is a series of specific compromises: 16 new amendments which broadly find favour with the Commission - I hope Mr Byrne will be able to indicate that - and the Council."
"Firstly, we had to adopt an unusual procedure for one point that remains in some doubt, that is, the site of the new authority."
"We wanted to set out criteria for the site of the new authority as we believe we should."
"The Council, however, were not prepared to accept them in the body of the text."
"But you do not throw away the whole report for that: we have put it into the legislative resolution and we hope that you, Madam President, will be able to set out exactly what our reasoning is."
"The decision will have to be made on merit and not through the kind of political horsetrading that is currently being whispered about."
"It would be the worst possible start if this body were sited in an inappropriate place for the worst of reasons."
"We tabled the compromise amendments in order to bring forward the major priorities that this Parliament has always emphasised: firstly, a parliamentary hearing for the proposed executive director of the new authority and a three-month period for Parliament to express its opinion on the candidates for a small and tightly-focused management board."
"That is the board that will meet in public and will make its opinions equally public so the citizens of Europe can see what it recommends."
"It will have a role to play in risk analysis, risk communication and risk management, where its advice is appropriate."
"These are substantial powers."
"In addition, this legislation gives protection to those who want to report on unsafe practices in the food and feed business."
"Citizens have a duty to tell the truth and I believe we have guaranteed that."
"If the 16 compromise amendments, and the others already agreed with the presidency, are passed, we can proceed to set up the new EFSA."
"The problem of BSE, for example, is still with us: cases of it have been notified in two previously clear Member States this week."
"Everybody knows that food and animal feed have to be safer."
"The procedures whereby such products come in and out of the European Union have to be open, transparent and, above all, safe."
"Some of the practices of industrialised farming have threatened us all."
"Producers and consumers alike have everything to gain from a monitoring authority which protects the interests of all and is beholden to none."
"On that basis I commend this proposal to the House."
"We have come quite a journey since the Commission produced its first White Paper."
"At that time I had the privilege of writing the report for Parliament with my friend across the floor - Mr Whitehead - acting as shadow."
"Now I am reciprocating as shadow for his report."
"My party is not a great party for harmonisation but we are a party for harmony and that is what we have seen in this report and the way it has been dealt with."
"I too wish to play tribute to the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs, also the Commissioner, Mr David Byrne, and - dare I say it in the light of earlier comments -to Magda Aelvoet, the minister."
"I hope Ms McKenna will not take offence if I give her praise in her absence as she too has played her part in looking for and helping us to find compromises which make sense, which do not betray anybody and which take forward the concept of food safety for the peoples of Europe."
"This is an issue which is of considerable importance to people."
"There is nothing more important than the safety of the food and the drink that they and their families partake of."
"There is a European dimension to this because, increasingly, not only does food cross boundaries but people cross boundaries."
"So we need to be certain that the food we eat has been grown in soil we can trust and the fertilisers added to it are known to be safe."
"The feed that is given to livestock also plays its part in ensuring that the food that ends up in our supermarkets and on our tables merits our confidence."
"Then we want to make sure that the processing of food is safe and, finally, we want to make sure that when it is stored and retailed, it is still safe for us to take home."
"Then of course it is up to us."
"There are many critical issues in this report - the title of the food safety authority has been crucial to us."
"We do not want to see an all-singing, all-dancing bureaucracy - we want an authority which is focused on safety, on the assessment of risk, on giving guidance where appropriate to the managers of risk."
"An authority that understands that risk can never be eliminated but it can be adequately spotted and dealt with."
"Science is crucial, so is independence - that is why the siting of this authority is important."
"The pre-conciliation process - if I can call it that - that we have been going through is an example of how to take measures through Parliament and the institutions."
"At this last stage Parliament has spoken overwhelmingly with one voice."
"I know the Commission and the Council have listened and I believe they will have benefited because we are working together on this measure."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when we talk about the European Food Safety Authority today, there is one thing in particular that we need to say to the citizens of the European Union. That is that we are convinced even now, without this Food Safety Authority, that the food people in the European Union are consuming is safe."
"So safe, that I am convinced that it is among the safest in the world."
"However, if we believe that a food safety authority would have advantages and lead to improvements in the European Union, there must be good reasons for that."
"I would like to name three conditions that I believe need to be met to achieve such improvements."
"Mr Bowis and Mr Whitehead have already touched on these points."
"The first is the quality of the experts."
"It is not acceptable for people the Member States want to get rid of to be sent to this authority as experts and scientists."
"It is your job, Commissioner, to invite the Member States to send only the cream of the cream."
"Secondly, to secure improvements we need transparency and openness."
"Even more than the scientific committees, which have had a high degree of transparency since the BSE crisis, the Authority needs to ensure that it earns the people's trust."
"That means that it must be open and transparent in its activities."
"Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Byrne, we need controls."
"It is also your job, the Commission's job, to convey to the Member States that supervision and control are the most basic tasks of the Member States, something you have criminally neglected in recent years."
"If we want to carry on guaranteeing safe food, and perhaps even safer food, if we want to win back the people's trust, then we can only do this by meeting these conditions and by tightening up controls."
"If we do that, the new Food Safety Authority will be a step forward for the European Union."
"I call on you, Commissioner, to make sure that is the case."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I think it is rather fantastic that we have now brought about some pretty good legislation."
"Two years is certainly a long time, but I personally thought it would take longer."
"It is incredibly important that we talk about safety, on which we can arrive at a common view."
"Safety has to be assessed."
"Openness and public control are more important than anything else in this new legislation."
"Whatever we say and however we behave, new crises will occur and there will be new scandals."
"We are going to be presented with new scientific proposals which point in one direction or another and which, rightly or wrongly, will frighten people."
"The only way to deal with this situation is through complete openness and with total public scrutiny, for people cannot be calmed down simply through publishing decisions."
"Now, everyone with an interest - consumer and environmental organisations and the media - will immediately be given information, and not only information from a majority of scientists on a panel but also details of minority views."
"In that way, no one will be able to say that the EU is concealing anything from its citizens."
"Finally, I want to say that this is all well and good, but that I wonder how things will work out in terms of compliance and control."
"What is there in terms of a possible system of penalties to be imposed upon those Member States and companies which do not comply with the safety standards?"
"That is one step."
"It is a large step and also the first."
"Let us never forget, however, that it must be implemented. Otherwise, it will be merely hot air."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Whitehead, the Regulation that is before us is ground-breaking, in my view."
"I am indeed of the opinion that something good can come out of a crisis situation."
"We often see this in the food industry too. Crises can lead to headway being made in the legislative field."
"The Regulation that is before us constitutes one such step forward. I should like to underline a few aspects which were important to my group in particular, and which we have also adopted."
"Firstly, the Regulation will ensure that it will no longer be possible for infected food to be exported to third countries, often Third World countries."
"Secondly, the diversity of food is highlighted. It is also pointed out that traditional products exist, that we should recognise this and that food has a certain cultural role to play."
"Thirdly, we as Parliament have ensured that we have turned the proposed food authority into a food safety authority, which is quite an achievement for our Parliament."
"Thanks to Parliament and you, Mr Whitehead, we have been able to play a role and have been able to underline the significance of transparency in this respect."
"It is indeed true that we need transparency in order to restore consumer confidence."
"We, as Parliament, have also ensured that we have gained more insight into the make-up of the management board and into the appointment of the executive director."
"Finally, we have also called for more objective criteria for the location."
"When we came out of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy at second reading, we noticed we had 28 amendments, 28 amendments which the Council struggled to accept at times."
"We carried out a kind of pre-conciliation exercise, one with which I am delighted, because the rapporteurs, along with the co-rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, made certain that we, as Parliament, were able to take a united stand at the Council, a Council where we heard one voice, where Mrs Aelvoet listened to us, and I am really very pleased about that."
"Madam President, our political group is entirely in agreement with the tenor of this report."
"We also think that it is right to table a number of those amendments again that have not been incorporated into this common position."
"Furthermore, we think that these amendments are of such a kind that it should not now take very long at all to find a common solution together with the Council of Ministers and the Commission."
"The most important amendment from the European Parliament is that which makes it clear that what we are concerned with here is an authority dealing purely with food safety and not with food in general."
"For us, this clarification is important."
"It is important to focus specifically upon the safety issues."
"Amendment No 4 concerns the correspondence between the EU' s food regulations and other international agreements and regulations."
"Obviously, the EU must cooperate in this area with other parts of the world."
"However, the trend within the World Trade Organisation, in particular, is in danger of leading to a situation in which we have a series of different conflicts between different systems of regulations."
"In that case, we think it is incredibly important to assert the right to tougher rules for health and environmental reasons."
"Amendment No 22 relates to the funding of the authority."
"For us, it is an issue of principle that an authority should be financed from the Budget."
"It must not be financed by means of fees deducted for its services."
"That is why Amendment No 22 is important to us."
"A number of amendments relate to openness, and those we naturally support."
"According to Amendment No 41, board meetings must, as a rule, be public and not held behind closed doors."
"We think that is incredibly important."
"We also approve of the proposal that members should be drawn from a broad geographical area."
"The proposals we are now discussing have their background in the serious food safety crises within the EU in recent years."
"Dioxin, BSE and salmonella are just a few of the areas concerned."
"These scandals are closely linked to heavily industrialised agriculture and to an agricultural policy in which large-scale production and yield have become more important than the environment, animal protection and safe food."
"If the EU is really to be able to attend to the causes of the problems in this area, reform of the common agricultural policy is needed, above all, so that sustainability and the protection of animals and the environment are put first."
"Only then shall we really be able to tackle the basis of the food safety problems in the EU."
"Madam President, the views of the 370 million citizens of the European Union on the food chain in Europe have dramatically changed in recent years."
"This is partly due to the advent of BSE, foot-and-mouth disease in Europe and the chicken dioxin scandal that took place a couple of years ago."
"Of course the consumer is always right, but on this occasion the European Union legislators have had to redouble their efforts to improve the safety of the food chain in Europe and to restore consumer confidence in food products within the Union."
"It has not been an easy task."
"However, the White Paper mentioned by Mr Bowis that the Commission brought forward outlines a raft of directives and regulations that need to be updated and modernised so as to make the food chain in Europe safer."
"I would like to take this opportunity to commend Mr Byrne, the Commissioner for Consumer Protection and Public Health, for his absolute determination to guarantee that European Union consumers have total confidence in all food products that are sold within the Union."
"That not only means improving safety standards of production within the Union but also tightening up rules and conditions for the importation of food products into the Union."
"The key element of this White Paper is the setting up of the food authority, as we discussed today."
"It is very important that this authority is up and running as soon as possible, no matter where it is located."
"This European Food Authority can work with the 15 governments of the Union, in an advisory and preventative capacity, to guarantee that food products from farm to table comply with the highest public health standards."
"We live in an internal market with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital."
"Food is an internationally tradable product and it is therefore very important that a coordinated and common approach is taken to promoting food safety in Europe."
"This is only right and proper in the light of the fact that consumers are criss-crossing the frontiers of the European Union on a daily basis."
"I also support the approach taken by Commissioner Byrne in guaranteeing that all interested parties are given due representation with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations under the White Paper on food safety."
"Groups representing the food industry, farm organisations and consumer interests are all actively involved in the implementation of these directives and regulations."
"Indeed, as a result of the Amsterdam Treaty the European Parliament has the power of codecision with regard to the implementation of the new directives and regulations in the area of consumer protection and public health."
"We intend to remain vigilant at all times so as to guarantee that confidence in the European food chain is fully restored, sooner rather than later."
"I commend the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, and all involved in producing this excellent report."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when euro-federalists are citing the need for a political Europe, which in their view would enable European integration to become more democratic, in other words, would give fewer powers to the European Commission, what do we see happening?"
"A new body is being set up - the European Food Safety Authority - and it must be said that this authority, because of the representatives appointed to form its Management Board, will necessarily be dependent on the European Commission, despite its legal title."
"Let us cast our minds back to the unforgivable errors that the European Commission made during the mad cow epidemic. Its priority, at the time, was the creation of the single market, come what may, rather than the safety of food for European consumers."
"In order to make the European Food Safety Authority more credible in the eyes of Member States' citizens, it is not enough for its seat to be independent of the European Commission as well as physically distant."
"The members of the future Management Board of the new body must be monitored by the same citizens, through their representation at the European Parliament."
"It does not seem that the Authority is giving sufficient assurance that it will be independent."
"It will be subjected to the power of lobbies and to the wishes of the European Commission and therefore, will be independent only of universal suffrage."
"Furthermore, who can assure us that it will respect the principle of subsidiarity and individual food characteristics?"
"Will it smother small- and medium-sized food businesses with even stricter regulation, that will be tolerated by fewer and fewer citizens?"
"Why call it an 'Authority' when it has no legislative power?"
"And lastly, why give it so many resources - EUR 67 million and 339 officials - when it could be equally efficient and less costly if it worked together with the existing national agencies?"
"Thank you."
"For many years, we have been attempting to restore consumer confidence and I believe that the creation of the Food Safety Authority is a step towards achieving this goal."
"We must acknowledge that there was some excellent consultation in the management of this dossier and we must not fall behind with this today."
"Zero risk does not exist and the consequences of a bacteriological problem, whether or not this is linked to terrorism, can be extremely significant for all our citizens."
"We are well aware that food contamination can affect a large number of people."
"That is why safety must be at the heart of this system."
"We must not be overcome by panic either, because the European food chain, as a result of the many decisions that we have taken in this Chamber, is certainly one of the safest in the world. However, the shortcomings that have come to light during previous crises compel us to take further measures in the area of food safety."
"In order to be effective and credible, the Authority must bring together the leading scientific experts; it must only undertake risk assessment, as part of the Rapid Alert System, whilst risk management must remain in the public domain."
"It must also work together with the national agencies."
"Its intervention must be proportionate to the level of risk, in other words, if there are simply rumours, communication must then be stepped up."
"If, however, there is a risk, the required precautionary measures must be taken; if there is a danger, then preventative measures are necessary."
"Lastly, the Authority must be independent and utterly transparent."
"At the same time, monitoring must be increased and, in the case of a serious offence, penalties must be substantial as well as effective."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a rule our food is already safe."
"Nevertheless, 2 000 people worldwide die every year of salmonella poisoning."
"In the United States alone, 9 000 people die each year of microbe-related food poisoning."
"These are worrying statistics, and we are not even talking about other food-related illnesses."
"With the general principles of food law, we are laying new foundations for safe food and we will be building on those in the next few months and years."
"We must work on a system which fills consumers with confidence."
"Emotions sometimes run high where food is concerned, beef being a recent European example of this."
"Politicians cannot and must not ignore these emotions, but we must consider the facts."
"That is where the European Food Authority comes into its own: it must be a beacon of objectivity."
"The European Food Authority must join forces with national authorities, but we must ensure that it is not rendered powerless from the word go and that it is headed by an approachable front man who does not need to fight to impose his authority but who embodies quality and authority."
"I would like to finish off with a word of thanks to the rapporteur who has proved to personify the self-same quality and authority."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will, in effect, vote in favour of the Whitehead report."
"The European Food Safety Authority, an essential food safety mechanism serving the consumers and the political authorities of Europe alike, is essential to the performance of the functions that it will be assigned."
"Its first task is to investigate all the failings that led to the recent food safety crises, both the crises in the food business, such as chicken dioxins, food and mouth disease, trafficking in veterinary products, the excessive use of vaccines and tranquillisers on animals and also the original BSE crisis."
"I would point out that even Finland now has its first case of mad cow disease."
"That is the first point I would like to make."
"My second point is that it is the agency that must also stop the uncontrolled spread of contaminating transgenic products that are even infesting traditional cereal crops, since consumers are rejecting transgenic crops, whose only virtues are commercial. Therefore, this agency must also, other than resolving all those problems, ensure food safety from the farm to the fork."
"In order to do so, the Food Safety Authority must apply, from the beginning of 2002, the principles of transparency and monitoring that my fellow Members have already mentioned."
"The failings in the area of hygiene as being the sole criterion, which has been highlighted in the many crises that we have listed, particularly in animal feed, shows that the agency must give advice on good practice, on labelling, on products that have been produced locally, that contain dairy products, instead of dealing with industrial standards alone, which do not prevent salmonella, listeria or any of the more distressing epidemics."
"Its main function is therefore to coordinate the national agencies, and to do so, the agency must be independent and transparent."
"On the other hand, I have doubts regarding Amendment No 34, which deals with the appointment procedure to the Management Board, a process that seems hazy at best, since it refers to the meritocracy of the Management Board."
"So what exactly does meritocracy mean in an agency that should be composed of experts in the relevant scientific fields?"
"The Management Board has a political and managerial role."
"I very much fear that this meritocracy is simply a way of masking the pressure exerted by large food corporations."
"I hope that the Commissioner will be able to reassure me on this point."
"As for where the agency will be based, we believe this is a side issue..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, given the tug-of-war about the location of the European Food Safety Authority, it appears to be a highly prestigious matter."
"This does not contribute towards safer food or consumer confidence."
"Another point of concern is our keenness to impose our strict standards on the rest of the world."
"In this respect, I have to say that other parts of the world often do not have the luxury of aiming for the highest possible safety standards for food."
"Their priority is to collect sufficient food to survive."
"Needless to say, we should not simply export food which fails to meet our safety standards to those countries."
"But in those cases where export increases food safety in the countries concerned, export of this kind must be allowed."
"In those cases, the automatic destruction of batches should not be an option."
"As far as the appointment of the management board is concerned, I do agree with the compromise that has been struck with the Council."
"It is indeed unwise to enlarge this management board any further, because this could compromise its decisiveness."
"Furthermore, I am opposed to organising hearings in the European Parliament prior to appointing the members of the management board."
"This applies even more to the executive director."
"It would be wise for the European Parliament to move further away from the executive tasks of the future European Food Safety Authority."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the coming week, the Laeken Summit will adopt a number of decisions, including - it is to be hoped - a position on the food authority, deciding where it is to be based."
"We know how important it is that this decision is made."
"Several years have already passed since the beginning of this procedure; this proposal has been on the table since 1999, at least, so it is high time that the decision is taken."
"I feel that, in tabling a second time the amendment which was voted upon at first reading some months ago, Parliament is trying to make two statements, which you, Commissioner, must convey to the governments."
"The first is that this is a matter covered by the codecision procedure and so Parliament' s opinion on the criteria to be put to the vote tomorrow should also be taken into consideration when it comes to deciding the site of the authority."
"We know that one of the approaches taken at Laeken will be horse trading - you can appoint the Chair of the Convention if I can choose the site of the Authority, and you can have the Police College - but I feel, rather, that all these decisions need to be taken on the basis of certain criteria which are strictly related to the interests of the institution we are attempting to create."
"Therefore, when Parliament points out that the site chosen for the Authority should have a longstanding tradition in food safety and food safety research in general, this is clearly a criterion whose importance must be stressed."
"When we talk about a good scientific infrastructure and facilities in the field of food safety, you, Commissioner, and the Commission must stress the importance of this criterion."
"When we say that it has to be easily accessible in terms of communications and have efficient and rapid transport connections; when we say that it has to have connections with those services that deal with public health and consumer protection issues; of course it springs to my mind that the Joint Research Centre, which employs thousands of European researchers, is situated in Ispra, and therefore, my opinion can only be that these criteria apply to one candidate city alone: Parma, in Italy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work, which is just as we expected."
"I think that this regulation and this legal basis will, with the measures that follow, help to improve food safety in the European Union, and will establish the general principles of the new food law."
"With reference to general food law, I would like to mention, in particular, that this represents a real success in developing the principle of a seamless improvement in the food chain from farmer to consumer."
"A key aspect of the principles set out here remains the traceability of products."
"I believe that we have accordingly established two significant new principles and requirements for improving food safety."
"The centrepiece of the regulation is the creation of the European Food Authority, or, as it is designated in the amendment, the 'European Food Safety Authority' ."
"I do not want to spend too much time on definitions here."
"What I consider most important is the fact that the framework conditions have been created for this Authority."
"The first of these is adequate financial provision."
"It seems to me that this has not so far been achieved to the extent we might have wished, and the same applies to conditions governing communication between the Authority and the various authorities in the Member States."
"Appropriate arrangements have not yet been set up in the Member States, and there is still a lot to be done in this regard."
"As for the openness of the authority, I believe that this House's amendment is certainly correct, but we also have to guarantee that in certain circumstances the Authority can also meet behind closed doors."
"An important issue, as many others have already said, is the location of the Authority, and if the Council rejects our proposals, it seems to me that it must intend to locate the Authority in such a way that our requirements and conditions cannot be met."
"We cannot let such a situation prevail, nor can we accept it."
"The Council must finally give in on this and select a location that will facilitate communication with the Commission, Parliament and the Member States."
"Mr President, my thanks go to the rapporteur for the excellent work on this report."
"As has already been established, the European Parliament has been very active for several years now in questions relating to food safety."
"The rapporteur has also carried out very valuable work by holding discussions with the Commission and Council, in order to ensure that the start-up of the food authority is not delayed; this means that at the Laeken Summit a genuine decision really has to be made concerning the siting of the office."
"With regard to the selection criteria, in my opinion Parliament has spoken quite correctly: it is a good idea to emphasise the research connection, the fact that the office is independent, and that there will be effective experts there to guarantee quality."
"In the case of transparency, I can only agree with the previous speakers; however, transparency also means that there is cooperation with the consumer organisations."
"Let me start by saying that I am all for food and animal feed safety, but I cannot understand why the European Union believes that it is necessary to establish the European Food Safety Authority."
"I believe I am right in saying that almost all major diseases, except possibly BSE, come from countries outside the European Union."
"Therefore the World Health Organisation, which is already in existence and is doing just such work, should be adequate for this purpose and can protect all of our interests."
"This organisation serves 27 of the countries of Europe including the countries of the European Union."
"It strikes me that the European Union is creating a further quango which, like most authorities the EU sets up, will be expensive to run and turn out to be a white elephant."
"If such a need did exist, surely it should be the work of each national government to look at the appropriate problems."
"These would be pertinent to the conditions of that country and they can act accordingly."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by saying that I have great admiration for the way in which the rapporteur, and also, most definitely, the shadow rapporteurs, have dealt with this very complicated matter which was ultimately resolved very quickly."
"There are, of course, minor points which require further attention, and I would mention monitoring as one of them. Who authorises this monitoring?"
"But also, who will be organising, inspecting and running this food safety authority? This should not be sixteen, but twelve, for we need independence."
"What do we actually mean by food safety?"
"We mean that in the internal market, we will ensure that we can guarantee food safety everywhere."
"That not only includes Europe' s fifteen Member States, but also all the candidate countries."
"I have a few concerns in this respect."
"Not because food in the acceding countries would not be safe, that is not what I am saying, but I am worried about the lack of good networks in the new Member States that could carry out inspections and instil consumer confidence."
"Last Thursday, there was a meeting involving experts from the acceding countries who alerted us to the lack of such a structure."
"That is one side of the coin. Inspection, also from the government, to ensure that the process runs smoothly."
"There is also a flip side, namely the lack of a civil society."
"That means a lack of well-trained consumer organisations that are independent and that could encourage the government at any time to pursue the policy effectively."
"The same also applies to product organisations."
"I wonder if the Commissioner would be willing to give us some information on that score, enabling us to see what we can do about this in future."
"Madam President, life is one constant risk-benefit analysis - what we do, where we go and what we eat."
"While the European food chain remains one of the safest in the world, recent scandals have damaged our consumers' confidence in the food we eat and the methods we use to produce it."
"The public has lost confidence in the national and European food safety systems after the scandals and scares with beef, E.coli, lysteria, salmonella, dioxins, eggs, poultry, milk and hormones."
"The list goes on."
"The public wants to be reassured that the road from farm to market, to the supermarket, to the oven, fridge and table is as safe as can be reasonably expected."
"They want safety assessment that is neither secretive, behind the closed front door of the Commission, nor tainted by producer or pressure-group interest."
"Since the beginning of your tenure, Commissioner Byrne, you have responded to the needs of the consumers of Europe by making every effort to improve the safety of the food chain."
"This proposal is one of key importance for consumer protection in the European Union."
"The institutions of the Union have come together to set out the principles of food law with a new authority which can safeguard the food we eat and the way it is produced."
"I commend the rapporteur, Mr Whitehead, and the shadow rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for a job well done throughout the discussion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The result of their consensual approach has been to strengthen and unify the voice of the European Parliament on the key issue at stake."
"I would ask the Commission and the Council to listen to this united voice and to adopt 'European Food Safety Authority' as the title of the institution."
"Keeping the word 'safety' in the title of the authority will give a clear signal to consumers as to its purpose and goals."
"I also firmly believe that if the authority is to have the confidence and backing of the people of Europe, it is imperative that it operates and communicates in a wholly transparent and independent manner, dedicated to the assessment of food-safety risk."
"Risk communication will also be a key element."
"One has only to look at the BSE inquiry in the UK and the Philips report which stated that breakdown in risk communication was a major factor in exacerbating the crisis there."
"In conclusion, in relation to risk management, the measured and proportionate use of the proportionary principle or the political management ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, the issue of food safety is one of the many unifying factors in the Europe of the citizens we want."
"As far as the European Food Safety Authority is concerned, I feel that the European Parliament has played a very major role: a great deal was achieved between first and second readings and, in my opinion, tomorrow' s vote will produce an extremely important report for, indeed, at this point, there is no longer any excuse for procrastination."
"We will have an instrument which will help us to keep a constant check on food safety in Europe."
"As regards this major work, achieved through the efforts of both the rapporteur and the committee responsible, there are still a number of small points which, I feel, will have to be specified: for example, it is extremely important that the management board should include a representative from the agricultural sector because the fact that we are dealing with a process means that all the sectors need to be represented."
"There are still a number of gaps as regards the procedures."
"We are definitely going to use operators from the food sector and people and companies specialised in all the parts of the food chain in order to ensure that the necessary information flow banishes all fears from the tables of our fellow citizens."
"One last question is that of the site."
"An amendment has been tabled seeking to ensure that the locations of the sites of the Commission and the other institutions do not affect the choice of site."
"The site should be in a place which has a longstanding tradition in food safety and which has scientific infrastructure and substantial resources in the field of safety."
"Of course, I must put in a word for Parma, for Parma is one of the most important places in the Italian agrifoods system."
"It is my genuine hope that the Laeken Council will take this candidate into due consideration."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, unlike Mr Titford, I am convinced that setting up an efficient and independent European Food Authority as an early warning system is something very much to be welcomed."
"It should act as a transparently functioning scientific reference point for the Commission, Parliament and the Member States, but it should also be open for producers and consumers."
"Advice, information and risk communications for consumers can help to increase our confidence in the food we eat."
"Food safety is a fundamental requirement for consumers who want to eat healthily and we must take responsibility for that here."
"The food scandals over the past few years have demonstrated that we need, in particular, consistent implementation of directives and on-the-spot controls on food and animal feed."
"If we are to achieve seamless traceability of production, it is essential to optimise the way we link the scientific facilities of this Authority with the control authorities in the Member States."
"This will ensure safety in the whole chain from producer to consumer."
"And imported food must be just as safe as food produced in the EU."
"This safety can be guaranteed by imposing strict controls on food imports at the EU's present external borders."
"In parallel to this, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need to establish properly functioning systems for monitoring the safety of food and animal feed before accession."
"However, one important problem will not be solved by the regulation before us today, and that is the dividing line between food and medical products."
"We need to minimise the grey area between these two product categories, food and medical products, as far as possible."
"If we do not succeed in this, the result will be new demarcation problems and legal uncertainty."
"That is why it is a matter of urgent necessity for us to make sure that when legislation on medical products is reviewed, an unambiguous EU-wide definition of food and medical products is established, so that there is a clear dividing line, because we can only improve safety for the consumer if we establish a clear definition."
"Madam President, I recall that when President Prodi first offered me this particular portfolio in July 1999 he emphasised to me the importance of food safety during the life of this Commission."
"He particularly suggested the importance of establishing a food safety authority during that period also."
"He said that it was important that the consumers of the European Union had the same confidence in such an institution as US consumers have in their Food and Drugs Administration."
"I hope that the new authority can deliver on this for our consumers and for our citizens."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank President Prodi for his ongoing support during our work to make his idea a concrete reality."
"The wide scope of the general food law covering all aspects of the food and feed production chain that may have a direct or indirect impact on the safety of food has been maintained throughout the first and second readings."
"The Commission welcomes this."
"We also underline the importance of the wide remit which has been retained for the work of the European Food Safety Authority."
"It is important that the food authority builds a comprehensive overview of the entire chain."
"This should include aspects of animal health and welfare, animal feed safety and plant health, in particular at the primary production level."
"Given our recent food safety problems, it would have been unthinkable to have a food authority that did not cover such matters."
"The Commission supports Amendment No 1 which proposes that the authority be called the European Food Safety Authority, while ensuring that the broad remit, which is so important, is not affected."
"The Commission can support Amendments Nos 29 to 44 by Mr Whitehead, Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes."
"These replace Amendments Nos 2 to 6, 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18, 20, 25 and 27, which I do not support."
"I can also accept Amendments Nos 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21 and 26."
"Many of these add clarity to the text or enhance the transparency of the development of food law or the procedures of the European Food Safety Authority."
"I also welcome Amendments Nos 22, 23 and 24 which adjust the text to ensure that the correct budgetary procedures are in place and that arrangements for third countries, notably EFTA countries, are appropriate and in line with normal procedures for agencies."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 8 which would allow unsafe food and feed to be exported from the Community to the original supplier in a third country without any constraints or controls."
"This is clearly an unacceptable practice that I am not willing to support."
"Rejected food or feed could end up being used either in a third country or being shipped back to the EU and that would constitute a risk to food safety."
"From experience, the Commission knows that such practices are also potentially open to fraud and black market abuse."
"I do not support Amendment No 28 which refers to the selection procedure for the seat, as well as defining the selection criteria."
"However, I note that Parliament is also proposing another approach."
"This involves adopting a resolution to the report which calls upon the Council to consider certain criteria in its selection of the authority's seat."
"This House is aware that I believe strongly that the authority's seat should be chosen on rational and operational criteria that will facilitate the smooth working of the EFSA."
"For these reasons I can support the principles expressed in the resolution."
"I also support the joint declaration from the Commission, Council and Parliament concerning the members of the management board of the authority."
"I believe that Amendment No 37 on the board's size, the selection process and membership criteria achieves the right balance between the different views expressed at first reading by the three institutions."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that since I took up office as Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, I have made it clear that the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority was a top priority."
"Community measures which protect the safety of the food supply require a sound scientific basis and the authority will provide this."
"The authority is designed to be Europe's automatic first port of call on scientific matters relating to the safety of our food supply."
"Today we are taking an important step towards the establishment of the authority, towards giving the European consumer the safest food supply in the world, which is our ultimate goal."
"I would like to thank Mr Whitehead, his team and Parliamentary colleagues who have worked closely with him on the amendments at second reading, and also Mr Bowis, Mrs Paulsen and Mr Staes."
"I want to thank you for the close working relationship that existed between all of us - not just between our two great institutions, but also on a personal level between myself and all four of you."
"I discussed these issues with each of you at some stage over the last few months."
"In addition, I would like to thank the Council, both the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, and also the Minister Magda Aelvoet, who put her own shoulder to the wheel on this issue on a number of occasions."
"I also thank the people in my own Commission who worked with me so assiduously, so carefully and so hard."
"Not only do I appreciate the excellent work that has been done, but I would like to thank all those involved for the speed with which this complex proposal has been dealt with."
"The spirit of collaboration with which the three great institutions have approached this file has been admirable."
"It is clear from the amendments on which Parliament will vote that compromises have been sought which should enable the regulation to be adopted without a time-wasting conciliation process."
"This will facilitate the establishment of the European Food Safety Authority early next year."
"Electronic communications networks and services"
"The next item is the joint debate on five recommendations for second reading:"
"(A5-0433/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive) [10419/1/2001 - C5-0417/2001 - 2000/0188(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Niebler)"
"(A5-0432/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) [12170/1/2001 - C5-0490/2001 - 2000/0187(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Niebler)"
"(A5-0435/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) [10420/1/2001 - C5-0415/2001 - 2000/0184(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Paasilinna)"
"(A5-0434/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive) [10418/1/2001 - C5-0416/2001 - 2000/0186(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Brunetta)"
"(A5-0438/2001) on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the Common Position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive) [10421/1/2001 - C5-0418/2001 - 2000/0183(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Harbour)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Commission for its excellent and constructive involvement in the consultation on this telecommunications package."
"I would also like to sincerely thank the Belgian Presidency, which has shown enormous commitment in its efforts to facilitate a compromise between the Council and Parliament, and I think that if we are able to reach agreement on Wednesday, and I very much hope we will, it will be entirely due to the excellent way in which the Belgian Presidency has handled the negotiations."
"Thank you very much indeed."
"However, I also, of course, owe very special thanks to all the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs who have not only co-operated in such an outstanding way over a period of many months, but have also worked together on the compromises so constructively."
"Over the last 12 years, the EU has achieved an enormous amount in the telecommunications market."
"The monopolies of the established service providers have been broken, and there has been complete liberalisation and deregulation of the market in many areas, which has benefited both consumers and the economy in general."
"One clear result of all this has been a fall in prices and a variety of new products and services from the various providers."
"But there is, of course, nothing that cannot be improved further."
"This was evident from the 1999 telecommunications report and from the seventh implementation report recently published by the Commission."
"I would just like to mention a couple of key concepts: local loop unbundling for the benefit of alternative service providers, where further action is still needed in the Member States, and the subscriber's link to the network, which is still unsatisfactory in some Member States."
"Some established service providers are still offering dumping prices and there are also still bottlenecks as regards leased lines."
"The new legal framework for telecommunications regulation should guarantee some remedial action here."
"I would first like to briefly present my two reports on the telecommunications package and I would then like to turn to two other critical points regarding the other directives."
"First, then, the Authorisation Directive."
"The whole point of the Authorisation Directive is to harmonise authorisation arrangements in the Member States."
"I would like to stress once again, as I said at first reading, that the Commission has produced some excellent proposals here, proposals that I welcomed at first reading and which I specifically wish to support at second reading also."
"Up to now there have not been uniform procedures for operating communications networks and providing communications services."
"There have been a variety of different conditions, including, in particular, varying obligations on providers to supply information, there have been variations in the length of the procedures, and the cost and substance of the authorisations has varied."
"This situation will come to an end with the new Authorisation Directive."
"The directive also envisages a step change in the authorisation system."
"Up to now, it has been the practice to issue individual authorisations, but when the Authorisation Directive comes in, there will be a switch to general authorisations, that is to say that, in future, communications network operators will not have to obtain an official licence beforehand, but will only have to demonstrate that they intend to operate a network. However, they will have to comply with the requirements of the general authorisation scheme or of the directives."
"Obligations on providers, particularly those regarding information, will be simplified by the new directive, with requirements being limited to the essential. So we are talking about a very provider-friendly solution here."
"One of this Parliament's achievements has been the introduction of greater transparency in the granting of rights of way, for example drawing up a register setting out the procedures for granting rights of way in the Member States, and we have also managed to ensure that legal protection against rulings on rights of ways is guaranteed in all Member States."
"We would have like to have achieved even more, especially as regards costs."
"In this case, Parliament stressed the importance of providers, if at all possible, not being burdened with excessive costs in future, if I may put it that way, with regard to rights of way, numbers, the granting of licences and frequencies."
"As far as this issue is concerned, our discussions have not yet been completed."
"Should it be necessary to reach a compromise on the whole package, Parliament will surrender its own position in favour of the Council's recommendation."
"My second report is on the Radio Spectrum Decision."
"The essential objective of this decision is to involve the Commission more closely in the granting of frequencies in future, which is how it should be."
"Radio frequencies are sought-after commodities, and frequency allocation involves taking highly political decisions, and we must accordingly ensure that the decision makers who bear political responsibility are involved."
"The granting of frequencies, frequency assignment and frequency allocation are no longer just a technical matter, nowadays, but a real political game."
"There are two points on which the Council and Parliament are not yet totally in agreement, and I am therefore particularly pleased to see Mr Daems, the President-in-Office of the Council, here in the Chamber today."
"Perhaps he could say something about the two points which I am particularly concerned about later on in the debate."
"One point which Parliament has tackled repeatedly is whether it should itself be involved in future decisions on radio spectrum policy."
"This House had requested that whenever frequency reallocation, in particular, was at stake, Parliament should, through the codecision procedure, be consulted and involved in the decision-making process."
"To this end, we also adopted an amendment in committee at second reading that would guarantee us this right in a binding article contained in the directive, in the decision."
"Now, the Council only wants to include this article or this proposal as a recital in the decision."
"I would therefore like to ask Mr Daems to consider once more, if we are agreed on this, that Parliament should also be involved in radio spectrum policy via the codecision procedure, in which case we could be included in the decision itself and not just mentioned in a recital."
"My second point relates to the extent to which the Commission should be concerned with the granting of frequencies."
"Parliament requested that in the case of frequencies with Community coverage, the Commission should be called upon to intervene or put forward proposals."
"In the decision, or rather in the Belgian Presidency proposal that I now have before me, I see that by deleting two little words in Amendment No 1, that is to say 'in particular' , the decision-making power is in fact to be considerably extended."
"So I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council in this case, too, if he could consider whether we could not agree to delete those two little words, which would mean that we would be respecting the principle of subsidiarity and thus achieving a solution between the Council and Parliament."
"I find it hard to believe that the Council could not accept this too."
"I would now like to touch on two other points, concerning the framework directive and the Universal Service Directive."
"First of all, I absolutely must thank the Belgian Presidency very sincerely once again."
"The Belgian Presidency has worked out an excellent compromise for Article 6."
"This is about who will have power of decision in future when there are questions about telecommunications law - the Commission or the Member States."
"I believe that this House can accept the compromise that has emerged."
"Many Members would have liked us to go further in this area, but that was just not achievable."
"However, the compromise that has now emerged, according to which the Commission can intervene in matters of competition law, and in particular in matters of market definition and with regard to what constitutes significant market power, is, I believe, a very fair one."
"I would now like to turn to a point that I regard as particularly significant, and then I shall conclude."
"We have been concerned for many years as to how we can promote digital television still further in Europe."
"The amended proposals from the Belgian Presidency have been one of the greatest disappointments in all this, so that we will achieve nothing or very little in this area."
"Two points have emerged."
"The first is whether we can extend transmission obligations to APIs and IPGs."
"This Parliament unanimously advocated this in all the negotiations. I would ask, once again, that great thought should be given to this or that the Commission should consider how we can achieve this."
"Furthermore, on the subject of a commonly agreed standard for digital television in the European Union, I believe that we need to go further than the Belgian Presidency has indicated so far."
"Perhaps the Commission could give a clear signal here, too, in order to help digital television to make a genuine breakthrough in Europe."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, my colleagues, Europe's greatest change is, of course, the networking which has taken place; this certainly unifies us Europeans more than a common currency."
"It is of everyday and full-time significance, and its importance is growing all the time."
"The core philosophy of the entire grand project for an electronic Europe is that the digital divide should not take hold in Europe in the way that it threatens to take hold in many other parts of the world; and we, as well as Parliament, the Council and the Commission all share a common line here."
"The Commission's draft framework directive and the other statutes belonging to this telecoms package follow the correct line and are very balanced, and I am highly satisfied with them."
"In this rapidly-moving period of change, we will make up for lost ground; and particular attention has been paid to the importance of convergence, of rapprochement."
"This means that, to an ever increasing extent, the same content can be prepared on the same hardware, be transferred along the same routes and be received on the same apparatus."
"This creates a wholly new information space, or perhaps I should say information world, since this is a part of us, it is a part of us in the workplace, at home and when we are travelling."
"Here, in Parliament, we desire that this world be regulated, but that at the same time competition be secured, so that no monopolies, duopolies or cartels are generated."
"This will maintain a low pricing level, easy access, and employment and growth in this area."
"I could venture to say that if we had had these regulations in force at the time when we decided on the 'electronic Europe' at Lisbon and when (at the same time) the auction in frequencies was initiated, then it would not have been possible for the catastrophe of the frequency auctions to unfold in the way that it did."
"It would have been possible to standardise the bid auctions and to harmonise practice, and consequently such irregularities would not have taken place, the sector would not have been driven to its knees and we would have saved many hundreds from bankruptcies and the unfortunate unemployment consequences linked to these."
"A telecoms package which consolidates the Union's telecommunication legislation will have great significance in competition with others outside the European Union."
"It will result in us having more harmonised markets for this sector which in itself is already international and border-transcending."
"We will then also obtain the benefit of the European Union's advantages of scale, which in turn will surely have an impact on both employment and on the success possibilities of firms and on pricing."
"Of these five statutes, I regard the framework directive to be the most important."
"The most difficult matters have been dealt with here."
"Now we have before us my draft report which has been processed by the committee, for which I thank my colleagues (it was approved unanimously), and then also the presentation of the Presidency State."
"It has gone far in order to meet Parliament half way, and in my opinion we should approve it."
"It takes account of Parliament's stance in two central matters which we have been taking up for discussion throughout this summer and autumn: Article 6 and Article 4."
"The latter concerns the appeals procedure and the former concerns the relationship between the Commission and the national regulatory authorities."
"Now for the first time, and this can be regarded as a breakthrough, the Commission can intervene in a national statute, if this statute is not in harmony with the general statutes, both in the definition of the market and in the definition of a significant market position."
"These are the two matters which we wanted to see implemented, and now, thanks to the Presidency State, they are in your proposal. Furthermore, I hope that the Presidency State can tell us whether it is also possible that the Council may commit to this as well."
"If this is so, then this package should in my opinion be approved."
"I have been given to understand that the Commission is also of this view."
"Madam President, Commissioner Liikanen, the new regulatory framework for telecommunications replaces the Community system which opened up the national markets in Europe and brought the era of monopolies to a close."
"By way of justifying the revision of the Community telecommunications framework, the European Commission stated its intention to reduce the regulatory burdens according to the liberalisation objectives achieved on the basis of the model still in force."
"The aim was, in fact, to secure greater confidence in market forces in order to boost the competitiveness of the European market and encourage investment in the emerging markets, facilitating the provision of innovative services."
"The purpose of the revision of the prevailing model should, therefore, have the aim of gradually moving the telecommunications market on from its liberalisation phase to a phase of genuine, consolidated competition."
"The relationship between the development of the regulatory framework and the dynamics of the markets should be pursued using a forward-looking approach which favours competitive conditions, ensuring the rapid distribution of innovative services, in order to provide direction for the market and the future exclusive application of the procurement rules which are gradually replacing ex-ante rules."
"The new model should introduce a transitional phase that fosters this transition to a telecommunications market that can be managed in the same way as any other economic sector in strict respect for competition rules."
"This end can be achieved by a body of ex-ante rules harmonised at European level which are characterised by the fact that they are temporary and exceptional; in other words, the regulation that we are discussing and approving ex ante must provide for it to be abolished when a sufficient level of competition has been achieved."
"These ex ante rules must be kept to a minimum as regards requirements and strength, in order to ensure that intervention is proportionate to the regulatory objectives."
"In view of the flexibility of the new model, which very prudently extends the scope of intervention of the international regulatory authorities, the main thrust of the new regulatory framework must be the need to guarantee the supervisory power that the Commission has laid down in respect of the national authorities, in order to ensure correct interpretation of the new framework and thereby avoid distortion of the competitiveness of the European market between geographical areas."
"In fact, with the absence of a centralised authority at European level making it possible to assess the ultimate consistency of national decisions with Community objectives, the new regulatory framework is in danger of not achieving its objectives."
"To this end, Mr Daems, Commissioner Liikanen, allow me to illustrate an amendment which I tabled together with 51 Members from different political groups precisely to Mr Paasilinna' s directive."
"Mr Paasilinna has worked very hard on his proposal on the framework directive on telecommunications."
"This amendment seeks to make things clearer for operators, to avoid fragmentation in the application of Community law in the various Member States and to ensure the development of a genuine internal telecommunications market."
"The adoption of my proposal would facilitate harmonisation, which can only be achieved by establishing unambiguously defined power allowing the European Commission to intervene to guarantee that the application of Community law is coherent with objectives and pursues the same goals in all the Member States."
"Harmonisation and centralised power are the basis for the development of the pan-European telecommunications market."
"This what the operators want, this is what the market wants, Mr Daems, Commissioner Liikanen."
"The market wants the development of a pan-European telecommunications market, whereas the short-sightedness of the national authorities often tends to slow down that process of development in this phase; that is why I tabled this amendment which, I hope, will be taken into due consideration by the Belgian Presidency, the Council, the Commission and this House."
"Mr President, in the concluding part of this package of directives, the universal service and users' rights directive, for which I have been privileged to be rapporteur, are very much at the cutting edge of the whole package."
"These are things that will really mean something to all consumers and users of electronic communication services."
"The common position that we received from the Council was a major advance over the first reading text and I would like to thank the Council and Commission for accepting so many of Parliament's ideas and suggestions."
"The new text has been substantially restructured and clarified which is important for effective transposal in Member States."
"As part of that restructuring, the aspects of market intervention contained in this directive - and this is very strong market intervention at a retail price level - are clearly set out."
"It is worth reminding all of us in this House that these are very much seen as transitional measures towards a fully open market in which competition rules will reign supreme."
"That is the direction we want to move in."
"I would like to pick up on some further enhancements that we have made as a result of the second reading."
"I would like to thank the Council for working so closely with us and also to thank my colleagues on the Legal Affairs Committee who worked very closely with me in making suggestions."
"I hope that they will be pleased with the results that we have achieved."
"It is worth reminding ourselves that the whole essence of this universal service directive is to ensure that a core service is available to both able-bodied and disabled consumers across the single market, and also that the users' rights provisions must ensure that consumers have a right to clear contract terms, to comprehensive transparent pricing information and also a guarantee of other important services."
"The changes that we have particularly focused on at second reading concern some further important enhancements to the provision for disabled users."
"I am pleased to say that at the common position stage, we have a clear indication in a separate article about the importance of Member States providing for disabled users on a wide range of services, in particular ensuring that disabled users have the sort of choice and range of services that all other consumers expect."
"Those are broad-ranging provisions that will develop as services expand."
"The new area - that I am pleased we have introduced, and I would like to thank the Council for accepting this - is to encourage the development of clear quality standards related to disabled user provision."
"That is something that we have added in at this stage because it seemed to us that it was all very well having some common provisions but unless we have a way of monitoring those and making sure that those evolve with the rest of the range of services involved, then things might just stand still."
"We will not see disabled users being able to take advantage of new technology and new services in the way we would like them to."
"This is a very important provision which I am sure will have the support of all colleagues."
"The second area that we focused on in second reading was to ensure that small- and medium-sized enterprises also benefit from the sort of users' rights that are required for individual consumers."
"In a rapidly developing world, we already know that small- and medium-sized enterprises are a key target for enhanced electronic communications."
"We want SMEs to really buy into e-commerce, into the new possibilities afforded to them by enhanced electronic communications."
"They do not necessarily have the negotiating power of larger companies and therefore provision is made for them."
"In conclusion, I wish to talk about a third aspect which has involved us in a lot of tough negotiation with the Council, namely over ""must carry"" obligations which are included within this Directive."
"These allow Member States to impose obligations to carry public service channels and channels of specific interest on electronic communication systems."
"Many colleagues felt that there should be a specific extension of this to satellite and conditional access systems."
"The Council and Commission have told us that this is already covered fully in the access and interconnection directive, but colleagues have not agreed with that."
"When it comes to the compromise package that we will vote on I am prepared to recommend to colleagues that we do not support this area but on condition that the Commission assures us that it will continue to keep this under very close scrutiny when it comes to looking at the Television without Frontiers directive and also to encourage the fair access provisions."
"If we do that, I am sure that we can move forward to approve the whole package in what will be a major advance for the European economy and for Europe's competitiveness."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me, in turn, to thank the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for the work they have carried out in tandem with the presidency, in the search for a common platform on the basis of which we can reach agreement. This will allow us to take a reasonably prompt decision at long last, thus promoting the development of the entire telecom sector, and hence the development of the internal market."
"I should also like to include the Commission in my thanks, which, together with the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs, helped us in every way possible to reach a common position."
"Allow me to outline the process we went through."
"By process, I mean the procedure we followed to reach a package which is hopefully acceptable to Parliament."
"You have to bear in mind that it is not easy to reconcile very different opinions, especially where Member States are concerned, in order to be able to produce a package at the end of it."
"It is therefore in this context that the response, prepared by the presidency, to the recommendations for second reading concerning the directives which are now before us, can, in fact, be seen as a very balanced response, which in the view of the presidency might be acceptable."
"Needless to say, a number of additional explanatory statements will have to be drafted, for it is impossible to include everything in the body of a directive, for example with regard to comments by the first rapporteur, Mrs Niebler."
"In my view, it is indeed self-evident that a new policy requires information and involvement by, for example, Parliament, certainly when it comes to the use of the existing spectrum."
"Despite this, I believe that this general principle will necessitate a clarification from the party applying it, namely the Commission, and I therefore also believe that explanatory statements by the Commission, not simply on this score but also on a number of other aspects, could prove useful, as a number of rapporteurs have already stated."
"I believe my present role to be as follows: if you, as Parliament, could ensure that this common response by the Council' s presidency will be accepted by you, then this is what will actually happen in practice."
"In other words, it is, in my opinion, very important to me that I can officially say to you that, if the Commission can indeed fully support our response and if Parliament can fully accept this common position of the Council, the Council will accept this accordingly."
"In other words, it is a package, as was stated a moment ago."
"A package entails the risk that if you tug at one string of the package, the whole thing may fall apart."
"I am not saying this because I like saying this, but because political realism, with which we are all familiar, teaches us that, if we want to proceed swiftly, we need to adopt a common position which offers a huge amount of benefits."
"Let us be honest, the Council' s flexibility towards Parliament has been exemplary, and contained a crucial message which was news to me, namely that the concept of the internal market is clearly being prioritised, even by the Council."
"If you ask me, this is a very special new message."
"It is in this context that the response of the Council' s presidency is being presented to you here, and I would not like to see my colleagues who have asked me to tell you this, revisiting their previous common position by running a risk and tugging at a string - and I am saying this in all candour - for I then believe that we would be at a complete loss as to know where we would end up in some future procedure or other."
"In my view, we have now reached a point where we can make enormous headway, where the Council' s flexibility is, I dare say, rather exemplary, where we stimulate industry, where we contribute towards establishing the internal market and, via the internal market, create advantages for the consumer in all its diversity and with all its aspects, inter alia, via universal service, which we all set so much store by."
"In other words, the Council gives you the formal pledge that, if the Commission supports this fully, and if you deem this package to be acceptable, the Council will actually implement this package without any exception."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the President-in-Office for his straight-forward language, for he is simply saying 'take it or leave it' ."
"But first and foremost, I admire his enormous perseverance, particularly in the light of the fact that we have arrived at this result."
"I have to say that one important sentence in the speech of the President-in-Office stood out for me, namely the emphasis he placed on the internal market."
"Unfortunately, we have had to work for too long with a Council that no longer appeared to embrace the concept of internal market."
"Thanks to you, and I should say, thanks to many of my fellow MEPs here in the European Parliament, this has now been rectified, fortunately."
"Needless to say, what is at issue is that we will face more competition, more players, Mobile Virtual Network Operators, etc., and there is nothing wrong with that, of course."
"It is about striking a fine balance between rules on the one hand, and scope for further market development on the other."
"We are in this transitional phase, and we must aim for normality as quickly as possible, away from ex ante, towards ex post, to put it in simple terms."
"This means, therefore, that we must weigh up the whole set of rules and market interventions against the question as to whether this is really future-proof."
"In my opinion, this will need to be one of the assessment criteria for the Commission, to constantly monitor whether we could proceed any faster towards what I refer to as a more normal market, ex post, in other words."
"This also naturally leads on to the question: what will the consumer gain from this?"
"Will we receive more service and lower prices, in particular?"
"I am therefore pleased with the Council' s compromise proposal with regard to international roaming, and I would ask the Commissioner now: what steps will the Commission take in order to ensure that next year, during the summer holidays, we will not be inundated with complaints by our voters that it is still very expensive, that the cost of ringing from a landline to a mobile line is still too high."
"These are the questions which are important to our citizens, and we must simply get results on this score."
"Article 6 has been mentioned many times."
"One can appreciate it at different levels."
"I am pleased that the Council eventually took the bull by the horns and has stated that an internal market requires an independent role by the Commission."
"We will continue to fight in the next round, because what you are now offering is too little in my opinion, and more is needed for an internal market, but also on that score, we must of course establish a certain kind of realism."
"As I understand it, you have on that basis, in fact, interpreted the revision clause along the lines of 'move towards this single internal market' ."
"Although you have not adopted Amendment No 36, you have done so at a practical level, and I am extremely grateful to you for this."
"Finally, in my view, it is very important for us to hear from the Commission what steps it intends to take with regard to digital television, so as to be able to lay down this one European standard as soon as possible. This is about Europe' s future, about achieving the objective of Lisbon, and I believe that the Commission now also has a key role to play in this."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to touch on a few points in the short time I have available."
"Mr Daems, you quite rightly pointed out that you have achieved a great deal in the Council and you also referred to the flexibility on the part of the Council that this involved."
"You said that we have reached a good compromise."
"I agree, and I think that many of my colleagues in my group will see it the same way."
"It is an acceptable compromise."
"There are a good many points on which further negotiation is needed."
"Mr van Velzen hit the right note."
"We will have to carry on negotiating and fighting to achieve a common internal market, because this is just one step and further work will be needed."
"I believe that we in this House have one particular problem with this, and I have already heard a lot of people saying that it is difficult to have an informal trialogue as part of the second reading."
"That requires a great deal of work and needs a huge investment of time given all the linguistic difficulties involved."
"The whole package that we have before us is very complicated and needs a great deal of detailed work."
"I think that we here in Parliament - and I am addressing this comment more to Parliament than to the Commission and the Council, although it indirectly affects them too of course - will have to make a greater investment in ensuring that we have whatever support is required to tackle such a complex task from a political point of view."
"This will still not guarantee completion of the internal market."
"It is right that in future the Commission will have more power and scope for action."
"We have not used the word 'veto' ."
"That is probably very clever in political terms, but nevertheless it is something along those lines."
"Nevertheless, by means of cooperation and consultation, the national regulatory authorities have the power to ensure that they can take appropriate action to influence their national markets."
"There is an interesting definition of transnational markets."
"Nevertheless, there are two further problems to which previous speakers have referred regarding the interoperability of standards."
"I believe that the proposal does not go far enough in this respect."
"I cannot understand our countries, why they are not in favour of interoperability in the area of standards."
"I hope that something more will emerge in this field."
"There is also still a great deal more to be achieved, via consultation with Parliament, as regards Parliament's participation concerning technical measures, and that includes, in particular, Mrs Niebler's report, for which I am shadow rapporteur."
"I would simply venture to point out that Mr von Wogau will, I hope, be bringing forward an interesting report next year dealing more fully with the issue of Parliament's participation in such consultation processes."
"Once more, we have until Wednesday to consider things further, and the Council and the Commission have a further opportunity to comment on these points."
"I would be delighted if they would do that today."
"Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner and Minister Daems."
"Needless to say, I would naturally like to echo the words of praise expressed by my fellow MEPs for Mr Daems for all his efforts, to which Mrs Marcel has also greatly contributed, of course."
"I will return to this in a moment, for I would also like to thank all my fellow MEPs, and especially the rapporteurs, for the pleasant and close working relationship so far."
"For we must realise that what is before us was only possible thanks to the unanimity with which we in this Parliament have worked on this package."
"It was, of course, abundantly clear to the Council that we were not going to yield an inch on essential points, especially on the score that we want one internal market where companies and consumers can benefit from the achievements of that one Europe."
"And we can only achieve this in this way."
"That is why it is crucial for us to agree on sound procedures that are ultimately monitored by the Commission."
"What I miss in the Council' s package before us, is a clear stand on one European standard for digital interactive television, something which my group deeply regrets."
"What is clear is that Europe does not seem to be learning from past experience."
"Indeed, the overwhelming success of the mobile phone standard, from which consumers and companies have benefited and will do so in future, apparently failed to convince the Council enough to dare adopt a clear stand for once, namely in the field of digital television. I would therefore ask Commissioner Liikaanen whether he, following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Mr Bangemann, would be prepared to do this and would like to promote the MHP platform."
"You will have understood by now that the package that is before us, this compromise, is acceptable to my group, and I only hope that Mr Daems is prepared to confirm this."
"For then it will be implemented to the letter of the law in all Member States."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wishes to add its voice to the chorus of approval for everyone who has worked so long and hard to enable us to inch forward module by module."
"All of the previous speakers, and above all you, Mr President-in-Office, were right in saying that we need to see all this in the light of the e-Europe initiative and of the internal market."
"I would like to express my appreciation of your efforts not only personally, but also on behalf of my group, and I know that sometimes things get sorted out in the corridor, over a coffee or in other informal ways, over a sumptuous meal, for example."
"I am sorry to tell you that I have a bit of stomach ache."
"Not because I have spent so much time recently with lobbyists from one side or another over sumptuous dinners, but because depending on how you look at it, what is on offer is either too much or too little."
"Too much in the sense mentioned by Mr van Velzen: 'eat up, that is all you are getting' , or too little in as much as when we reach compromises we have to accept proposals from the European Parliament being slightly amended, with small, nebulous changes involving little words like 'shall' and 'may' , which are then taken out, so that I suddenly feel that the amendments are not so minor any more."
"I would like to briefly pick out one point, as I had an excellent exchange of information throughout the whole period of cooperation with Mr Harbour."
"I would like to highlight just one point in the context of the Universal Service Directive, and that concerns consumers with disabilities."
"We are not giving anything away here."
"We live in a society which for reasons of solidarity and on economic grounds takes whatever steps need to be taken."
"What is at stake here is that after many years we are giving some very important signals in this area, in order to give people with disabilities full access to the information and communication society as fully integrated consumers. This political willingness, this political awareness and this political will would simply not have existed to the same extent 20 years ago."
"I just wanted to mention that point to demonstrate to you all that time is a great healer."
"However, that will certainly not cure my stomach ache."
"I think that because of this stomach ache I would very gladly vote for this compromise, because, just like all of you, I am in favour of this internal market, and I would have been happier if it had already been established now, not at some point in the near future."
"However, I too will close by mentioning the crucial points that other Members have already touched upon, and which I do not really think are solved in the compromise: interoperability, digital television, transmission obligations, and Article 6 of the framework directive."
"Whether this fare is too much or too little, I think it takes us forward an inch or two."
"I would be very interested to hear what else you may have to say to us, and then, even if it upsets my stomach, we would be happy to say 'yes' ."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs on behalf of my group and on behalf of Parliament for the tremendous work that they have done on their joint reports."
"When we look at what the Council agreed upon in Lisbon and the new European initiative in particular and consider utilising the advantages which would accrue to Europe from the telecommunications revolution, we can see that there are many great opportunities out there to be grasped, but they require proper order, proper rules and proper regulation to ensure their use for the benefit of all."
"At this point I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Liikanen for the innovative measures that he has brought forward and the way that he is striving to bring Europe into the 21st century."
"I suppose it is appropriate that a man of his origins should be doing that."
"However, there are a number of dangers and risks and in particular, I want to deal with two aspects."
"First there is the universal service aspect - the universal obligation that my colleague Malcolm Harbour was talking about."
"I will take a slightly different perspective."
"There is a risk relating to competition, with new regulations and new rules being brought in, that there will be cherry-picking of the most valuable markets, the most valuable layers, and suddenly larger urban areas will benefit whilst rural areas and peripheral areas will lose out."
"On top of that, as already mentioned by Malcolm Harbour, there is the question of disabled access."
"Companies and institutions must be forced to adapt their services to suit the needs of the consumers and particularly those consumers to whom the Internet and the telecommunications revolution could open the most possibilities of all by bringing them into the real world and bringing them into dialogue."
"A third area that I wish to focus on is the risk of creating new illiterates or new gaps between those people who have computer and electronic skills and those who do not."
"We have a population in Europe today that is ageing: we have a huge middle-aged and ageing population that may not have the training and the skills necessary to usefully adapt to computers, electronic commerce and so on."
"What is happening in our schools and providing access in education is very important, but we must look to new ways of bringing in the middle-aged and the aged into the process."
"Finally, the eSchola initiative is a great one."
"I hope it can be extended to bring in older people and more peripheral areas."
"My last point is that, when we speak about consumers, let us ensure that we speak about all of the consumers of Europe not just those in the largest urban areas."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, rapporteurs, I wholly support the objective underlying the raft of proposals we are about to vote on, that of supplementing the internal market with liberalisation and the introduction of a system of genuine competition in a sector such as the telecommunications sector which is vitally important for Europe, its economy and the well-being of its citizens."
"However, I feel that no one, including the Commission, should be under any illusion that this raft of proposals, although a substantial step in the right direction, might represent a positive, definitive solution."
"I do not feel this will be the case; indeed, the fate of the regulation on unbundling the local loop, despite its almost unanimous adoption, and the difficulties encountered in its implementation bear witness to this."
"An underlying contradiction still remains in many Member States, specifically in those where publicly controlled telecommunications companies are still very influential and where, as a result, the State finds itself acting as both player and referee at the same time."
"There is a great conflict of interests within most public administrations which, in my opinion, is one of the greatest barriers to the process of liberalising the telecommunications sector."
"In order to alleviate the negative effects of the present imbalances in the different national markets, it might be appropriate to confer upon the Commission greater power to monitor and guide the national regulatory authorities, and to create mechanisms for cooperation and coordination between the national authorities."
"That is why the Italian Radicals will support Mr Brunetta' s amendment."
"Although not the final solution, it could be an appropriate path to take."
"If we want an open, competitive, effective telecommunications market, we need to fulfil an essential requirement, and that is to reduce the States' power as managers in the telecommunications sector."
"The State and the administrations must play a single role: the role they need to play of regulators."
"Playing two roles, being both players and referees at the same time, slows everything down and places the success of the liberalisation process in jeopardy."
"Mr President, the importance of the package as a whole is clear, both for a major European industry and for its customers and users."
"But are we moving fast enough to keep up with a changing market?"
"I would like to congratulate colleagues, especially the PPE-ED team, for getting to this point where much of Parliament's position has been taken on board in the Council text."
"I particularly welcome progress on Article 4 of the framework directive so that the principle of appeals against NRA decisions on the substance of an issue, not just on whether procedure has been followed correctly, has been accepted."
"This gives some comfort to operators and provides a more balanced situation."
"I also welcome moves improving Article 6 of that directive so as to achieve a more even regulatory framework across Member States through the requirement for cooperation and coordination between NRAs and the Commission."
"Personally, I prefer the voluntary approach to adopting common standards in digital television technology rather than seeking to impose one solution."
"I say, let the market provide the answer."
"The package, as now formulated, seems a big improvement on the original proposal but we are still looking for consumers' concern about levels of competition and service to be addressed through faster transition to a true internal market governed by general competition rules."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, for the cooperative and pragmatic way in which he has worked on the universal services directive."
"In particular, his efforts to achieve a consensus have led to the Socialist Group's amendments - both to strengthen the 'must carry' provisions and to give stronger rights of access to disabled users - being carried in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"The fast pace of technological change in the telecoms sector means that legislation must keep up with the pace of developments."
"But it must reflect growing expectations of users and consumers for a minimum set of services at an affordable price, guaranteeing access for all."
"The telecoms revolution has created a rise in consumer expectations."
"It is our job to respond and ensure that our legislative framework in the EU can deliver competition and consumer benefits."
"Consumers, for example, have not benefited from the existence of multiple competitors in the mobile phone market."
"Tariffs have not fallen in line with lower costs of running networks, now prompting in the UK an Oftel inquiry and a European Commission investigation."
"This directive must ensure genuine universal access and extend to all users, especially those with special social needs, those on low incomes and those with disabilities."
"The disabled will be excluded from the opportunities if there are not sufficient guarantees of access across Europe to public payphones, directory services and electronic programme options."
"In my country alone, two million blind and partially-sighted people could benefit from this directive if the Council and the Commission accept our amendments."
"Finally, on 'must carry' provisions, we need to find a means to allow services and channels in the public interest to be carried on cable and satellite platforms."
"If we do not, then I fear the future of satellite television might be dominated by the TV culture of quiz shows featuring stripping housewives, squeezing out educational and public interest programmes."
"Let us be clear: Amendment No 26 does not promote a free ride for public broadcasters on conditional access services nor indeed on imposing or mandating this."
"The fact is that market conditions do not always provide 'must carry'."
"It is appropriate to allow Member States to intervene if and when it is appropriate to do so."
"I trust the Commission and the Council will see the merits of supporting this."
"We favour a quick deal but it is conditional on the Council and the Commission accepting our amendments, which are a genuine and committed attempt to ensure that the brave new world of electronic communications is genuinely universal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Daems, if we reach an agreement this week, it will be one of the few decisions in which the European Council' s timetables are put into effect."
"That is a good reason why we should try to achieve something in this area, in contrast to what has sometimes happened with regard to other decisions about liberalisation."
"I especially want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, with whom I have worked closely."
"I want to agree with those speakers who have said that we are now introducing important rules for disabled users."
"In certain contexts, I have felt ashamed at the fact that our rules have not been as advanced as the rules in other large markets."
"I also want to emphasise what Mr Harbour said about the 'must carry' principle."
"The intensity with which we have debated TV issues in recent weeks shows that it is not entirely acceptable to distinguish between content and the principles we had when we first debated convergences."
"We are talking here about important cultural values in respect of which the Commission and the Member States must be able to depart even from strictly commercial rules."
"We should support the compromise in the Paasilinna report."
"In that context, I also hope that the Commission will apply a fairer competition policy between large and small countries than that we have seen, so that small and different markets too can continue to exist."
"That is something to which perhaps not enough attention has been given."
"Turning now to the issue of digital TV, I really regret the Council' s position on API for digital receivers."
"In many contexts, the European Parliament has clearly given its backing to an open common and approved standard."
"In this area, there is no market, as on many other issues."
"The market cannot therefore be researched."
"I hope that, before we vote on Wednesday, the Commission will be able to say when it is intended to take measures to bring about interoperability and genuine freedom of choice for consumers, and what it is intended that these measures should be."
"I therefore hope that the Commission will be able to come up with a declaration before we vote on Wednesday."
"That is important for this sector' s competitiveness in relation to other sectors within the telecommunications sector."
"Mr President, I would particularly like to join in thanking the Commission, the Council and all those Members involved."
"Thanks to their commitment, they have achieved considerable progress in the EU's telecommunications market."
"However, in contrast to what the word suggests, the term telecommunications market represents something that has not been dealt with properly, particularly in the Council common position we have before us."
"What I have in mind is digital television."
"I very much welcome the fact that not only the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, whose views I am conveying here, but also the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy have unanimously indicated that it is simply not enough for us just to talk about attempting to avoid the danger of a digital divide in the European Union."
"I am not talking about access for people with disabilities, an area in which I think significant progress has been made."
"I am talking about the principle of digital access for all, and also about the interoperability of equipment, application interfaces and services."
"I very much I regret this, whilst praising the Belgian Presidency for everything else it has achieved, but this is the drawback of this outcome: the course is now being set for equal access via a common standard for digital television, and we naturally need to strike a balance between developing the market and public interest obligations, and these two points of view have been taken into account by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market in their opinions."
"That is why I am urgently appealing to the Council, in view of this need to take cultural considerations into account, to ensure equal access for all."
"I call on you to improve this part of the text, and we will then all be able to give it our unqualified support."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as everything has been said, but not by me - as they say - I will make two or three points simply to underline what has been discussed by the previous speakers."
"I belong to the minority who, at first reading, were not satisfied with Article 6 of the framework directive."
"The compromise that has now been presented meets with my approval."
"I think a balance has been achieved between the national regulators' shadowing of the market and the Commission's right of veto, in order to stimulate the progress of the internal market, of which we are all in favour, even my group."
"This represents, in our view, very much another fragmentation of the market."
"I want to say something general about the modus operandi itself."
"Yes, we are dealing with a very fast-moving market and rapidly evolving technology, and we have tried to take that into account by acting relatively speedily."
"I want, though, just to say another word of admonition."
"Parliament - by which I mean, we - should not always deny ourselves our rights in the legislative process."
"We realise that from time to time, when the worst comes to the worst, but I think it must remain an exception."
"I would like to highlight another point."
"Mrs Hieronymi made it very clear - and, as a member of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I can only underline what she said - that a unitary standard for digital television, and its interoperability, are issues not only for industry policy, but also for consumers."
"I have promised consumers and the general public in my constituency that we would ensure that there was a standard that would enable them to receive on one TV set everything that they wanted to see and that they would not have to install several sets."
"I believe we have to go a bit further down that road."
"I would like to emphasise the very demand that Mrs Hieronymi made when she spoke just now."
"Perhaps the Commission and the Council can leap a bit further over the shadow thrown by digital television and reach a compromise."
"Then I, too, would find it easier to vote in favour of the package as a whole."
"I will end my speech there and point out that I have stuck to the speaking time allotted to me."
"Mr President, it seems to me that the outcome is a vindication of the Community method."
"Much of the process was kick-started and propelled by the declarations at the Lisbon Summit, but nothing would have happened if those declaratory statements had not been turned into excellent and workable proposals by the Commission."
"They were then propelled forward by some superb cross-party work by rapporteurs in this Parliament and fixed as a result of innovative negotiating skills on the part of the Belgian presidency and from Mr Daems - who contrived to include a gastronomic tour of Brussels in his valiant efforts to secure consensus."
"This combination was successful in dragging Member States and national regulatory authorities - some of them kicking and screaming - towards a workable pan-European approach."
"That seems to me to offer some lessons for the Barcelona Summit next year: if we want to push forward the economic reform agenda in this sector and in others, we need to continue to rely on the tried and tested Community method and not resort to the intergovernmentalism that frankly was implicit in much of what the Council seemed to suggest in the negotiation positions it took on this package."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this package is actually one of the things that are absolutely crucial to the Council Presidency, and I would like to congratulate them on the commitment they have demonstrated."
"We need sensible compromises, and we need them in quick order."
"This is a very fast-moving market, and so we need fast decision-making processes that produce binding rulings and, above all, more legal security as well."
"It is on that basis that there will be long-term investment, which is what we need in the current economic climate."
"Let me just remind you that there are, at present, eighty cases pending in Austria alone, of which only two were decided by the Supreme Court."
"This can hardly be the way into the future."
"As I see it, the authorisation directive is about harmonisation being a very positive thing, but also at the same time about the need to guarantee rights of access."
"It must be possible for the authorities to be helpful in implementing these rights if one is paying for it."
"In the access directive, the open interface is of particular importance."
"The independence of the alternative operators, and especially of the interface, is something that we should not underestimate in the future."
"The possibility of future dynamic development in this area is of the utmost importance to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"As regards universal service, we need clear definitions of universal service provisions, especially with respect to what has to be financed by the operator and what by the State; and finance by the State raises the question of whether there is to be a public invitation to tender."
"I believe that these liberalisation measures are of quite particular importance to the public - in both the internal and domestic markets."
"I cannot actually explain to my constituents the difference between a telephone call from Kehl to Strasbourg and one from Strasbourg to Paris."
"Here, I believe, there is a lot more work for us to do."
"Mr President, I very much hope that even at this very late stage, right up to the wire, we can achieve a compromise on this package between the three institutions."
"Others have mentioned the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit but there are other needs for a conclusion: the needs of industry for early clarity about the new rules, the need of European citizens for cheap, efficient competitive telecommunication services, the needs of European Union businesses for education, for research, for societal applications."
"I particularly want to ask about the rights of disabled users and to put a specific question to the Commission on the compromise presidency text."
"It is important, not just for social reasons, but for access to employment for disabled users."
"I would like to ask Commissioner Liikanen whether in his view the presidency compromise encompasses those points of principle contained in both the framework directive and the universal service directive."
"There have been serious criticisms by disabled users about non-implementation of the RTTE directive and this is a crucial point for many of us."
"Parliament has rightly supported carefully delineated powers for the Commission and understands also that some qualification is essential."
"There is a need for clear rules consistently applied within national regulatory authorities and between regulatory authorities."
"The powers for the Commission need to be circumscribed and time-limited, as indeed they were in Parliament's amendments and in the presidency compromise."
"I very much hope that when we vote on Wednesday we will have reached an agreement between the political groups and between the three institutions."
"These reports will play a critical role, not just in shaping the future of telecoms but also in ensuring a greater choice in competition in the European market."
"Even more importantly, I hope they will go some way, in our drive for the knowledge-based society, towards lessening the divide there is between those who have access to information technology and those who do not."
"I am speaking on the access and interconnection directive which is extended to provide a pro-competitive and harmonised framework to stimulate competing network infrastructures and interoperability of services."
"I hope it will ensure that bottlenecks in the market do not constrain the emergence and growth of innovative services, especially for people with disabilities and services that will benefit users and consumers."
"To achieve these ambitious objectives, we first need to influence the way in which Member States regulate access and interconnection and secondly we need operators with SMP to grant other network operators interconnection facilities in a transparent way."
"An area where we have had problems and where the harmonised approach between Members has been difficult to obtain under the current framework is international roaming and call termination in mobile networks."
"I know that this directive may not be the place for such detailed information, however, in the absence of any movement from the operators, I believe it is important for us to highlight this issue."
"The fact is the cost of terminating calls in mobile networks is ten times as much as terminating in fixed networks."
"I can appreciate some of the problems in the international roaming, but the differences are too wide to be credible in terms of actual costs incurred and there is a huge spread of prices across Europe for the same service."
"The most expensive country is almost twice as expensive as the cheapest."
"I want to try to ensure, when we are looking at a level playing field and a single market, that the retail prices are cost-based and transparent and are of benefit to the consumer especially the SMEs who are trying to gain access across Europe and take advantage of the single market."
"I hope the Commission will have greater success than they had in implementing the local-loop directive across the fifteen Member States, because this directive needs to be implemented forthwith because lower prices, wider choice and better services are an absolute priority for the EU if we are to achieve a more socially-inclusive Europe and a one-speed Europe."
"Mr President, since the European Council in Lisbon, we have travelled a long way in a relatively short space of time."
"The three institutions, Council, Parliament and Commission, were aware that the time factor was vital in the case of one of the fastest-developing technologies."
"The directive on e-commerce has already been approved, we approved the directive on the unbundling of the local loop - which, by the way, the Member States have not yet fully complied with - but now the telecommunication business, which seemed secure, is encountering more and more problems, which is clearly not beneficial to users."
"A new framework is therefore necessary."
"And that is what this package of directives we are dealing with provides."
"It is not a question of more regulation."
"It is a question of regulating what is necessary, with a balance between consumers and operators."
"But, above all, it is a question of regulating in the same way, in an equal way, in order to prevent what was happening - a fragmentation of the internal market."
"That is why the European Parliament tried to resolve this problem, and the Council, in its common position, made a counter-offer, which I believe was insufficient, but now the Presidency has achieved a package which is more sufficient."
"What we are being offered is clearly not ideal, it is not what we would all like to achieve, but as the saying goes, the best is the enemy of the good, and, for the sake of the certainty of the operators, for the sake of the need to have a filter in the Commission to deal with the problems of the internal market, and also, it should be said, for the sake of the good image of the operation of our institutions, I recommend that we approve this package."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite all the praise, in which I, of course, wish to join, there are still some large flies in the ointment, which have indeed already been mentioned."
"I am speaking in my capacity as rapporteur of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, with responsibility for consideration of the authorisation and radio spectrum directives, and also as my group's shadow rapporteur on the framework directive."
"All these reports have been adopted unanimously in the Cultural Committee, and we have managed to bring substantial points from our position to bear in the leading Committee as well."
"In the Council, on the contrary, all the Committee's concerns have been utterly cast to the winds, which it would be an understatement to describe as disappointing."
"To get to the point: even though the package of directives we are discussing is called the 'telecoms package' for the sake of brevity, it must be clearly pointed out that it certainly does not deal only with telecommunication issues in the strict sense of the word."
"Technical convergence does indeed mean that electronic services cannot be divided up by reference to their channels of distribution or the devices used to receive them, but this is specifically, in our view, about digital television and other services related to journalism."
"What matters to the Committee on Culture, therefore, is that the whole wide range of Europe's cultural diversity should find a place on the networks and not be merely subject to the laws of the market and of competition."
"This means that we see the issue of interoperability, like that of obligations to transmit, as being essential."
"By these means alone will Member States and participants in the market have the legal security to guarantee services of general interest and only thus will the provision of the full range of services for everyone be guaranteed in terms of both supply and demand."
"It is self-evident that Europe, for its part, does not have a duty to regulate the content of transmissions, but it is obliged to see to it that culture is not beaten into submission by commerce."
"The bottom line is that doing without interoperability does not only impose limits on culture, but positively militates against the internal market."
"So the Council's compromise is inadequate in every way, and we assume that there will be more change in this area."
"Mr President, I, like everybody else, or perhaps most other people in this House, want a single market."
"But I do not want a market where competition rules supreme."
"Regulation is necessary both economically and socially."
"If you have no competition, you will have no service innovation, but if you have cut-throat competition, you will not have service innovation either."
"It is necessary therefore to get the balance right."
"So, I would suggest to the Commission and Council that Parliament is offering them an opportunity to improve the balance of the package before them, and I would urge them to accept the proposals being put forward by Parliament."
"By coincidence, the Commission came forward today with a working document on the performance of industries providing services of general economic interest, and this also covered telecoms."
"That document indicates that liberalisation in general is having a net beneficial effect, but I would suggest to the Commission that they need to come forward with a lot more research and hard evidence in relation to specific sectors to convince me that it is true in all cases."
"Finally, I would suggest that the Commission needs urgently to take on board the suspicions regarding price-fixing with regard to roaming mobile telephone calls."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whenever a debate draws to its close and as important a package as this one on telecommunications is adopted, one should be, indeed must be, permitted to look into the future."
"In this instance there are a number of questions that present themselves at the same time."
"Is the Commission already able to assess how much the market will now change - not only in the direction of more competition?"
"What effects can we expect to see on jobs?"
"Can you, on the basis of the package about to be adopted, already estimate whether the digital divide really will be reduced?"
"Would what is currently going on not be an ideal opportunity to actually put transparency into practice, both as regards costs and at the consumer end?"
"We are indeed currently finding that the new directives mean that we will have to deal with a flood of confusing information about telecommunications charges, and transparency should surely be at least as important in economics as in politics."
"The Council and the Commission exerted considerable pressure on Parliament to consider their proposal as set in stone."
"However, eight amendments have been tabled by members of five different groups, which in fact proves that the basic text is insufficient."
"Those who signed these amendments, supported by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, particularly want, in order to be technically fair, the broadcasting or 'must carry' obligations to also apply to satellite, the conditional access systems and to businesses providing access to digital television. In order to safeguard legal consistency, we demand that the conditional access systems and the other associated facilities are also included in Paragraph 2, which is the purpose of Amendment No 26, the only amendment tabled by our group."
"We would like to stress to the Minister that we, like everyone here, welcome the speech on reducing the digital divide, but we would also like Parliament to be permitted, now and again, to have the power of co-decision."
"Mr President, electronic services are a public commodity in a modern knowledge society."
"Consequently, quality, affordable services, irrespective of geographical location or the user's personal profile, must be reconciled with the demands of competition, although the basic objective must be to guarantee universal access."
"Particular attention is therefore quite rightly being given to making access easier for people with disabilities."
"Consultation with users is essential in order to ensure we have optimum regulations from a social point of view."
"I particularly welcome the amendment requiring the Member States to hold public consultations in order to define users with disabilities."
"This means initiating a broad debate with individual representatives of people with disabilities, depending on their particular requirements."
"So we need to focus on measures for minority users, such as providing public telephones at fixed locations or equivalent measures for deaf or speech impaired people."
"At the same time, once this parameter is accepted, we need to develop quality of service standards for services for minority groups alongside general quality of service standards, because that is the only way we shall be able to monitor the degree of access which these people have to electronic services."
"The four directives with you today, together with the Spectrum Decision, make up the new regulatory framework for electronic communications - a cornerstone of the eEurope strategy, the information society for all agreed at the Lisbon European Council."
"Since Lisbon, successive European Councils have called on the Commission, Council and Parliament to ensure that the new framework is in place by the end of this year."
"We still have two weeks to go."
"Time is running short, but the EU still has the chance to meet this deadline."
"The package of compromise amendments before you today has a broad level of support in the Council, as the presidency told us today."
"It is, of course, a compromise."
"Nobody gets everything they want - neither Parliament, the Council nor the Commission."
"But the Commission nonetheless believes that it is a balanced compromise."
"My assessment is that neither institution is likely to get more from conciliation."
"Agreement on this package will send an important, positive signal externally."
"We all know that the communications sector has had a rough ride over the last year or so."
"Early agreement on this package will be a welcome boost."
"The package will have a positive impact on the sector in a number of different ways."
"The new framework will deregulate, requiring regulators progressively to remove regulation as it becomes unnecessary, so that they regulate only when there is market failure."
"In this way, the package provides a transition to the final objective we all share: reliance on competition law to control market power in the electronic communications sector."
"The new framework simplifies and deregulates national licensing regimes, removing prior regulatory control over market access for network and service provision, and focusing such controls only on frequency and numbering resources."
"It preserves and strengthens universal service, striking the right balance between the rights of users and the need not to impose disproportionate burdens on operators."
"In particular, it makes it clear that functional Internet access is a key part of the bundle of services that must be affordable and available to all EU citizens."
"Mr Martin asked me about the impact of this solution for the digital divide and employment."
"It is very clear that universal service has a key impact on availability."
"But we also need policy measures which concentrate on the skills of all citizens and on content."
"We need availability at a low price; we need skills and content in everyone's own language to close the digital divide."
"Finally - and crucially - the new framework, with the amendments contained in the compromise package, would include the necessary safeguards to ensure that regulators act consistently across the EU, so that companies can expect to be treated similarly in similar situations throughout the EU."
"Here I particularly want to thank the European Parliament for its strong support, without which we would not have been able to achieve this kind of compromise with the Council."
"I will explain how the compromise package deals with the three fundamental issues that dominated discussion between the Council and Parliament during second reading: right of appeal (Article 4), the transparency mechanism (Article 6 of the framework directive), including matters related to radio spectrum, and finally interoperability of digital TV equipment - which has been raised by many colleagues tonight."
"On right of appeal, the compromise package takes Parliament' s line by requiring Member States to ensure that the merits of the case are duly taken into account."
"On the transparency mechanism, the compromise package goes a long way towards Parliament and the Commission' s position."
"The text gives the Commission hard powers to require national regulatory authorities to withdraw draft measures in the key areas linked to the functioning of the single market: definition of markets and designation, or otherwise, of undertakings with significant market power (SMP)."
"Commission decisions are subject to an advisory committee procedure."
"Radio spectrum is covered by Article 6, paragraph 2, whereby regulators are required to cooperate with each other to ensure consistent application of the regulatory framework."
"The compromise does not provide for hard powers of intervention by the Commission on spectrum matters."
"Nevertheless, the Commission believes that this provision, together with the Spectrum Decision, will improve co-ordination of radio spectrum policy matters across the EU."
"With regard to the Spectrum Decision, the Commission is very satisfied with the compromise proposal, as the major objectives pursued in the original Commission proposal are met."
"The adoption of the Spectrum Decision in this form would constitute a major step forward."
"Furthermore, it demonstrates how far positions in this important matter have evolved, given the failure not so long ago of legislative proposals along similar lines."
"The Spectrum Decision in its present form will set up a general and permanent framework for addressing radio spectrum policy and legal issues in the context of all relevant Community policy areas."
"It thereby reflects the increasing importance of radio spectrum in the context of Community policy objectives which depend on the availability and efficient management of frequencies as a vital resource for the provision of economically and socially important wireless usage in electronic communications, transport, broadcasting and so on."
"The Spectrum Decision makes it possible to take appropriate action to ensure efficient use of spectrum and spectrum management."
"It also provides for technical implementing measures to be adopted under the Spectrum Decision as a mechanism to ensure legal certainty."
"Many Members of the European Parliament have raised the issue of digital television. We clearly have got the message from the European Parliament."
"On digital TV interoperability, the compromise package goes towards Parliament' s position, by taking over much of the European Parliament text."
"A new article and corresponding recital would be inserted in the framework directive, dealing specifically with interoperability of digital interactive television services."
"It would impose an obligation on Member States to encourage the use of open application programme interfaces by platform operators and equipment manufacturers."
"In addition, Member States would also be required to encourage API owners to make available, on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, all such information as is necessary to enable service providers to provide all services supported by the Application Programme Interfaces."
"Clearly an obligation to encourage does not go as far as an obligation to ensure."
"But - and I emphasise this - the provisions of Article 16 on standardisation allow standards to be made mandatory one year after entry into force of the directive if interoperability cannot be ensured by the use of voluntary standards."
"The combination of these two provisions constitutes a step forward for the interoperability of digital television, which we all agree is a desirable outcome for European consumers."
"Article 16 means that one year after entry into force of the directive, the Commission must organise public consultation then propose the comitology procedure, followed by Commission adoption."
"Furthermore, as we have really understood the strong will of the European Parliament to go forward with interoperability, the Commission is ready to start actively to promote European standards for interoperability with all stakeholders concerned."
"Mrs Read and Mr Fitzsimons raised the issue of the disabled here today."
"Firstly, on the amendments on the disabled, most of them have been accepted in the Council position, except perhaps for two, which overlap with the Council text."
"Secondly, I am personally convinced that information technologies give us better chances than before to give equal possibilities to the disabled."
"When we make society better for the disabled, it is better for all of us."
"Last week we had the information society technologies conference, in which Mrs Read also participated."
"We saw fantastic new applications which make life for the disabled better."
"We must absolutely encourage their use."
"The same was true with the e-government conference."
"We proceed along those lines."
"The accessibility guidelines recommendation from the Commission a few weeks ago is another example here."
"As far as the link between the RTTE directive and this package goes, we are ready to consider and study that issue."
"I will come back to that later."
"The compromise package is always a compromise."
"No institution gets everything it wants."
"But this compromise is a balanced one."
"It represents a proper balance between the views of the Council and Parliament."
"As such the Commission would recommend that the House accept it."
"The Commission will transmit to the sessional services of the European Parliament the detailed position on the amendments, including those not covered by the Council compromise."
"Finally, I thank the European Parliament and the presidency for their particularly close and substantial cooperation on this file."
"My particular thanks go to the rapporteurs, Mrs Niebler, Mr Paasilinna, Mr Harbour and Mr Brunetta, the rapporteurs for the five telecom directives, as well as the chairman of the committee, Mr Westendorp y Cabeza."
"But I do not want to forget the shadow rapporteurs and those other Members of the European Parliament who have participated so actively in the discussion of the telecoms package."
"It has been an excellent example of how Community method at its best can work."
"It has been an extremely complicated legal package."
"Everybody had a role to play."
"We worked towards the same compromise solution and - if it goes through this week - very rapidly."
"The outcome of this would be that Europe would have the most modern, technology-neutral legislation for the future."
"I am sure it would be good for jobs, good for growth, good for equal access for all."
"I hope that this package will be accepted this week in Parliament."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I would inform Members that the services of the Bureau have a list of the amendments accepted and not accepted by the Commission."
"The services of the Bureau will supply this list to any of you who wish to have it."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 a.m."
"Report on financial assistance for innovative and job creating SMEs"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0422/2001) by Mr Bushill-Matthews, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council: Growth and Employment Initiative - Measures on financial assistance for innovative and job-creating Small- and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (COM(2001) 399 - C5-0459/2001 - 2001/2183(COS))."
"This is Parliament's second report on the growth and employment initiative which is a multiannual programme."
"But it is also, perhaps unusually, the second one this calendar year and the reason for this is that the 1999 report was delayed until January of this year in essence because the Commission had been somewhat sluggish - a point I recollect I observed in my speech in January."
"This year, I am delighted to say that the Commission has produced a very thorough and generally much better report and I would like to thank them for the cooperation they have shown."
"Ironically, the timing has been more of a problem this time around with Parliament and that is partly because the Industry Committee decided that it wanted to produce an opinion and wrote to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee and asked if the vote in committee could be deferred."
"The vote was deferred and then the Committee on Industry decided it did not want to produce an opinion after all."
"But these things happen."
"Anyway, I would like to thank colleagues in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for their amendments which have generally improved the report substantially."
"I would like to thank the Economic Committee for their opinion which the committee fully supported and which is utterly embraced within the body of the report, and I would also like to thank the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for adopting this report unanimously a few weeks ago."
"Parliament clearly hopes that its views as expressed in this report when voted on tomorrow will be of genuine help to the Commission and the EIF in determining any programme changes for the coming year, in which case the report each year needs to be presented annually in good time well ahead of the year to come so that it can influence what happens in the year to come."
"The challenge for everybody in the year 2002 is therefore to present the report in the November plenary rather than in the December plenary."
"The Commission can help, as I hope they will, by speeding up the inter-service consultation which still seems to be a rather dozy process."
"I have it on good authority that the Commission's own report rested in certain DGs in-trays for several weeks before being lifted out so progress can be made there."
"It can also help by sharing with Parliament the quarterly information from the EIF and I thank the Commission for agreeing publicly in the Employment Committee to do this."
"This will be very helpful, but Parliament can certainly help in sharpening up its own act in terms of getting the timetable much sprucer next time around."
"Meanwhile, I would just like to highlight three points from the report: paragraph 13 where we would like to see in next year the Commission report much more concrete evidence of the employment gains that this multiannual programme has produced, not because we doubt what those employment gains might be, but we would like to see some hard data next time around."
"On paragraph 14, there are a number of references to other stages in the development of SMEs in their business cycle."
"We would like attention to be paid to this too."
"Finally, to go back to the earlier part of the report, in Recital F, where a deliberate comparison is made with the United States, because there, less regulation allows for a much more entrepreneurial spirit."
"In the EU we believe that we have to get a much more similar mindset to America in the way in which we approach SMEs."
"I note with great interest the Minutes of the Industry Council meeting on 4 and 5 December, which proudly proclaimed real progress under the Belgian presidency towards ""better practices geared towards elimination of red tape""."
"If this is true it is most welcome."
"I want to believe it."
"I would love to see the evidence."
"Certainly we all have to do our best to make it true."
"SMEs currently account for two-thirds of all workers - the majority of all workers employed in the European Union."
"But European employment laws are substantially shaped by the social partners who represent the big employers and the big trade unions but the minority of the workers."
"We all need to recognise that SMEs are the biggest employers overall, that SMEs are the biggest engine of growth for the European economies."
"It is not enough just to say that we have looked after SMEs, that we have the employment and growth initiative."
"It is a great help but we have to do much more."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many thanks, Mr Bushill-Matthews, for this excellent report."
"I would like to present briefly the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I do not want to devote myself to long explanations about why small and medium-sized enterprises are the economic backbone of European society."
"SMEs find access to finance ever more difficult, and a look at the agreements that Basle II will bring with it leads us to assume that this finance will become even more problematic."
"New methods of finance, such as venture capital, initial public offers, or all the other things currently being tried out or referred to, certainly represent a feasible way ahead, and one to which we in Europe will have to give thought, but not one to be used similarly by all SMEs."
"It is for that reason that I am glad that the Commission is taking up this issue on Europe's behalf."
"I would like, on the basis of my practical experience and of my discussions with many owners of SMEs, to tell the Commission of my principal concern, which is that future promotion of SMEs should also be tailored to their needs."
"Many owners of SMEs have no idea, or it is very hard for them to find out, where any kind of support at a European level is to be had."
"Support is meant to be transparent."
"Then I often hear complaints that support at a European level is very complicated, that compliance with the requirements imposed on SMEs is very difficult and that this often made the whole thing very expensive."
"Thirdly, all this should also be calculable in good time."
"Very lengthy application procedures stretched over many years result in small entrepreneurs quite simply running out of breath and not making it through to the final stages of the process."
"This means that everything possible needs to be done by the Commission to ensure that support for SMEs meets the needs of applicants from the target group, that is, the owners of the enterprises themselves."
"At a European level, though, we can ease the burden on SMEs or do justice to them not only by offering finance, but we should also consider how we might remove the burden from them by avoiding additional bureaucracy and regulation, which weigh down on them more and more."
"I believe it would be highly appropriate to put in place a screening procedure in the Enterprise Directorate-General which would make it possible to lodge a veto in good time, permitting the passage of regulations beneficial and appropriate to SMEs and excluding those detrimental to them."
"Mr President, Council, Commission and Parliament at last agree on something."
"The promotion of SMEs contributes to greater investment and innovation, and to the creation of new philosophies of enterprise."
"A multiannual programme was started to benefit an initiative towards growth and employment."
"Parliament approved a budget of EUR 450 million."
"SMEs are an engine for jobs in Europe."
"Seventy per cent of all workers are employed by them, and over 80% of all apprentices trained by them."
"In order to give them a better chance in the market, however, more financial and fiscal burdens have to be taken off their backs."
"They need improved access to risk capital."
"The European Investment Bank should apply its funds not only to the knowledge-based enterprises in the multimedia and biotechnology sectors, but also to cutting-edge technologies in the environmental and energy sectors and to innovative service-providers in craftsmanship, trade and tourism."
"Interest-rate subsidies paid out amount to over EUR 93 million rather than the EUR 100 million that had been envisaged, yet, all the same, 54 000 new jobs were created where 33 000 had been expected."
"If that is not a success..."
"The excellent report that Mr Bushill-Matthews has produced meets with full support from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and my committee was unanimously in favour of it."
"I echo his criticism that the report reached the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs far too late."
"Obviously there were too many services dealing with it."
"Parliament can, though, only take responsibility and perform its supervisory function if information is available in good time."
"Future reports will have to concentrate on aspects that make effective analysis possible."
"What about the quality of jobs in innovative fields?"
"How is sustainability ensured?"
"How many women - who, at the end of the day, are a significant element in the European employment strategy - are involved?"
"The Commission's report is encouraging, this criticism notwithstanding, providing, as it does, evidence that it is worth investing in these forward-looking sectors, and that is entirely in the employees' interest."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I too should like to congratulate Mr Bushill-Matthews on his report."
"He has made every effort to add this report to the agenda at the earliest opportunity and, as he has already indicated, he is not to blame for the fact that that is not the case."
"Even the Commission has made more of an effort to ensure that that is done in time, and moreover, the content of the report presented by the Commission is more substantial than when we discussed it the first time round, because we have since gained more experience with the Growth and Employment Initiative."
"The report is about this Growth and Employment Initiative and about the three financial instruments which have been developed with this initiative in mind, namely the ETF start-up facility, the JEV programme and the SME Guarantee Facility."
"Just like last year, on behalf of my group, I should like to underline the social dimension in this respect."
"This initiative is the brain child of the European Parliament that was developed in the wake of the Luxembourg Summit in 1997, and right from the outset, it was made very clear at the time that the initiatives should not only focus on this highly advanced technological sector, but should also embrace the social sector, and I am of the opinion that we cannot repeat this enough."
"There is only one point where I cannot completely follow the rapporteur in this report, and that concerns recital F which he quotes."
"He refers to the United States of America in this respect."
"More investments are made in new initiatives over there, and the decision to set up one' s own business is made more easily."
"I acknowledge that this is the case, but I disagree with his analysis that the reason for this would be the US' s milder regulatory climate."
"In my view, this is much more related to the whole culture of entrepreneurship, the fact that people over there are used to taking initiatives, that it is not of such major concern to fail once, to go bankrupt once and start again."
"In my opinion, cultural factors of this kind play a much more significant role than simply the regulatory climate."
"This remark is not really appropriate, in my view."
"I hope that we can find a compromise on that score at tomorrow' s vote, for it would be unfortunate if this report were not adopted unanimously."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group I welcome the report and I congratulate the rapporteur."
"I agree with the criticisms made of the Commission's report and many of the points made in relation to support that SMEs need, both by the rapporteur and by other speakers here tonight."
"But the report does not deal adequately with the crucial issue of whether jobs were actually created by these financial instruments."
"The amendment by my group makes explicit reference to this."
"The stated intention of the SME guarantee facility is to stimulate job creation by supporting the investment activities of SMEs within the EU through increased availability of loan finance."
"The estimate for job creation is an average 1.3 new jobs per SME over 2 years which is described as substantial."
"But we do not have a cost/benefit analysis and enough concrete information."
"I would ask colleagues to support this report but also to support the amendment which makes this point clear."
"Mr President, I am going to use my speaking time to contradict the procedural page and the previous speakers who, while claiming that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs unanimously voted in favour of the Bushill-Matthews report, have attributed to me a vote that expresses the exact opposite of what I believe in."
"This report is a plea to grant greater financial assistance to small- and medium-sized businesses."
"I am even more opposed to the idea of giving public money to private businesses since large financial and industrial corporations are often lurking behind the all-encompassing SME cause."
"It would never strike Mr Bushill-Matthews, who is known for his fervent support of the so-called free market, to propose financial assistance for workers who have been made redundant by the very same industrial and financial corporations or their counterparts."
"On the contrary, the rapporteur brings out the begging bowl without compunction, so that public money can be shifted, through the SME Guarantee facility or pre-start financing, into the coffers of large corporations so that it ends up swelling the private wealth of shareholders."
"To prove that Member States and the European institutions are no strangers to a bit of hypocrisy, this increased financial assistance is proposed in the name of job creation."
"I shall of course vote against this report."
"Public money should go to public services, to health, education, and public transport, which could and should create many more useful jobs for everyone than these start-ups, which swallow up money without showing how they are of use to society."
"The health sector has been reduced to collecting public money in order to contend with some diseases."
"I would like to see employers come round to collect public money."
"It is not up to Parliament to give taxpayers' money to help them."
"Mr President, we received with great interest the report by Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerning the second annual report on growth and employment initiatives."
"I very much appreciate the spirit of cooperation with the rapporteur and the favourable comments made on the annual report."
"In particular, I know that the committee's report - and I quote: ""welcomes generally the content and analysis within the thorough and more comprehensive 2000 report and commends the Commission and the EIF where progress has been made""."
"I would like to address the main points raised by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the report prepared by Mr Bushill-Matthews and have grouped my comments under three headings: provision of information to Parliament and its timing, geographical coverage and an updating of the instruments."
"Firstly on the provision of information."
"All the completion of the formal Commission procedures for the adoption of such a report may appear too long and, frankly, sometimes it is."
"The Commission has helped the rapporteur by providing an advance copy of the report before publication."
"We intend to continue this practice of keeping the rapporteur informed prior to the completion of the formal Commission procedure."
"We also explored to what extent we can share with the rapporteur the quarterly information received from the EIF without the need for a formal Commission procedure."
"It should be noted that this quarterly information is mainly used for operational purposes."
"It is to ensure appropriate monitoring of the programmes by the Commission services and cannot be relied upon to provide the same degree of accuracy and detail expected by the annual report."
"Secondly, on geographical coverage."
"The geographical distribution of the project signed under both the ETF start-up and the SME guarantee programmes varies considerably."
"The difficulties of implementing ETF start-up in all countries of the Union stems from the different stage of development of the venture capital market in various countries, coupled with the requirement that ETF start-up only invests pari passu with at least 50% of capital provided by the private sector."
"In those countries where little venture capital activity exists it is difficult, if not impossible, to meet the second condition."
"In the meantime the take-up of the facility has successfully continued with another foreign investment signed and three more being processed, all together corresponding to a geographical coverage of eleven countries."
"As you can see from our annual report the distribution for SME guarantee is most satisfactory."
"The initial high take-up in Germany and France was attributable to the existence of well-developed national guarantee programmes in those two countries which were able to take advantage rapidly of this facility."
"Thirdly, on the instruments."
"The three instruments of the growth and employment initiative have been integrated into the new multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship and in particular SMES 2001-2005."
"A change in market conditions prompted the Commission to suggest a refocusing of ETF start-up further upstream: seed, early stage and incubators."
"Similarly, it led the Commission to propose diversification in the SME guarantee portfolios, for instance towards microloans in favour of the smallest enterprises and ICT loans that allow small enterprises to take advantage of the potential of electronic commerce."
"Finally, with regard to the simplification of joint European ventures, our legal and budget experts have come to the conclusion that the Council decision on the multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship does not allow simplification in significant terms."
"To achieve this, a new Council decision would be required and such a decision would also need a new budget appropriation."
"Before submitting an appropriate proposal to the Council on which Parliament would be consulted, the Commission services are working on a full assessment of a joint European venture."
"In the light of this assessment, the competent Commission services may submit a proposal to reduce considerably the life of the joint European venture programme and so that the whole budget will not be used."
"But I and my services will keep you informed accordingly of any developments in this regard."
"Circulation of compound feedingstuffs"
"The next item is the report (A5-0421/2001) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the European Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 79/373/EEC on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and repealing Commission Directive 91/357/EEC (PE-CONS 3653/2001 - C5-0491/2001 - 2000/0015(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have succeeded in gaining the acceptance of open declaration of foodstuffs."
"By 'we' I mean Parliament, assuredly also with the Commission's support, but the Commission manifested a mild attack of weakness during the procedure with regard to what we considered necessary to the labelling of compound feedingstuffs."
"I think that honourable Members will back me up when I state quite clearly that, if Parliament had not had the right of co-decision in this area, we would not have been able to push this through."
"Quite apart from the matter under discussion, I wish, then, to emphasise that we need the right of co-decision in all agricultural policy matters so that, as we have done in this instance, we can come to sound and sensible results and make use of the expertise and political wisdom that reign in Parliament to support the Commission - and, I would expressly observe, to support a strong position taken by the Commission - to achieve satisfactory outcomes in the debates with the Council."
"This issue of open declaration has come a long way."
"We are now amending a directive dating back to 1979, when open declaration, which existed in Germany at any rate, was abolished at European level, and since which time I have also been active in this field, attempting to make good what went wrong then."
"It is a long time, 25 years, since then, but patience is needed in politics as everywhere else."
"That we have achieved this result is surely due to there having been the BSE crisis, which made it clear that farmers have to know what they are giving as feedingstuff if they are then to take on the responsibility for the feeding of their animals."
"This catastrophe has taught us, in the meantime, that everything we feed to animals is itself in the food chain and is - admittedly by a circuitous route rather than directly - fed to human beings as well."
"This makes it a matter of urgency that farmers should know what the feedingstuffs contain."
"We then asked you, Commissioner Byrne, and also Mr Fischler, within the framework of the parliamentary procedure to install the Commission in office, where you stood on open declaration."
"At the time you said: ""Yes, open declaration should come into being."""
"Indeed it did, but it took another two-and-a-half or three years for the legislation to be tabled."
"But a good thing is worth waiting for."
"As I have said, the Council then withdrew the good proposal from the Commission, in which the only improvement we had made was to the positive list, and the Commission agreed to the Council's proposal for a less precise declaration to be implemented."
"The result we have achieved is a change of direction - a change to the right direction."
"We now have open declaration."
"The 15% tolerance takes account of the industry's supplies and actual practice in order to avoid the possibility of partial rejection of feedingstuffs, but we have also made it possible for farmers to be told on request the exact composition of fodder and feedingstuffs."
"We have likewise obliged the Commission to supply us with a positive list, or at least a draft positive list, by the end of next year, so that we can achieve a positive result in this area within the life of this Parliament."
"There must be stipulations as to what can find its way into feedingstuffs."
"I would like, finally, to express my warmest thanks to my colleagues, most especially to Mr Friedrich, the Vice-President, who chaired the Committee, but also to Mr Kindermann."
"The three of us made up the negotiating delegation, and I must say that if we had not brought such determination, such a common mind, and what was almost joy, to the work in order to show for once that we too were in a position to turn our thoughts into words and laws, then all this would not have been possible."
"So, many thanks."
"I believe we have done a good job, and it was interesting to take part in a conciliation procedure of this sort."
"We did, admittedly, say that a mountain had roared and brought forth a mouse, for, in view of what was up for negotiation, a gigantic effort was involved."
"But it was good, too, to get an insight into something like that."
"So, to all who took part, including our other colleagues, many thanks."
"This result is something we can face our countries and our electors with."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is a saying that what is good is worth waiting for, and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, the rapporteur, has referred clearly to the never-ending story of the matter under discussion."
"It is specifically with reference to co-decision that it has at last been made clear that Parliament keeps on coming up with good ideas that find their way into work like this report on the never-ending story about the declaration of compound feedingstuffs."
"We must be clear in our own minds that we are dealing here with large quantities, and therefore with a lot of money - not the European Union's money, but that of our partners in the market."
"We are dealing with a volume of some 400 million tonnes of feedingstuffs, and it will help us to grasp how much we are talking about if we note that half, about 200 million tonnes, is made up of commercial feedingstuffs, and compound feedingstuffs make up two-thirds of that, some 115 million tonnes."
"As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf pointed out, the conciliation procedure eventually achieved a satisfactory result on the most important points at third reading stage by involving all interested parties - something which I should like very much to commend."
"As Parliament demanded, there is now open quantitative declaration, and, although the 15% is in my opinion at the upper edge of the margin, consensus has nonetheless been reached."
"It was also clearly stated that the producer, must however, and I see the 'must however' as very important here, state the exact percentages involved at the customer' s request."
"Thirdly, there is the positive list."
"About 20 000 components have been mentioned, and the drawing up of this positive list may well be a difficult task, but it will, I think, be an interesting and important one."
"More time has been conceded, and even more for formulation following the directive's implementation, but it is, I think, important that it should happen that way."
"Perhaps the evaluation report would present the right opportunity to introduce further improvements, such as, for example, the possible certification of the producer of the compound feedingstuffs."
"There is one more point I would like to mention, namely that the first positive list, to look at things in a European perspective, was the so-called purity law for beer."
"As I have said before, it was instituted in 1486 in the area I come from, and made applicable to the whole of Bavaria in 1516."
"It was a fine positive list for the production of beer, and you should put all your drive and ambition into drafting an equally good positive list for compound feedingstuffs."
"So, then, particular thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, to the chairman of the Conciliation Committee, Mr Friedrich, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mr Kindermann for the tough and persistent negotiations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, most of us agree that we achieved a very good result in the Conciliation Committee."
"I therefore wish, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, to congratulate, above all, the rapporteur on his commitment to the matter in hand and, most of all, warmly thank him for cooperating so well with his other colleagues, too."
"If the result is confirmed by this House as a whole, it will represent a further significant step towards greater transparency and safety in the production of feedingstuffs."
"In addition to this proposal for a regulation, though, there are other reports which also deal with feedingstuffs and with regard to which negotiations are currently in progress between Parliament, the Council and, above all, the Commission."
"I am thinking here only of the draft regulation on animal by-products not intended for human consumption - especially Category III, but also of the future use of leftovers from meals and waste from the production of foodstuffs."
"I do think that it should continue to be possible to use these by-products, processed under secure conditions and subject to strict controls and, above all, with the stages in processing being effectively monitored, as high-quality feedingstuffs in pig and poultry production, unless the results of future scientific research suggest otherwise."
"I look forward to the same willingness to compromise, not only on the part of Parliament, but also on the part of the Commission and of the Council, as was demonstrated in the process that we are discussing this evening."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on behalf of the ELDR Group I too would like to start by warmly thanking chairman Graefe zu Baringdorf and our consultative committee, which carried out very valuable work and demonstrated in an exemplary fashion that when one believes in what one does and makes strong efforts on its behalf, one will reach one's goals."
"Here, Parliament achieved what it wanted."
"This is a very important matter from the point of view of the farmers; these are the people who in their everyday work have to deal with these matters, and this information is very important to them."
"As Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf stated, in Germany open declaration was eliminated in 1979, while here in Finland it was eliminated in 1995."
"Now it is being reinstated."
"The only matter which generated debate and which deserves a moment's consideration is this list of permitted substances, and, in particular, the fact that the various ingredients change all the time."
"These include the byproducts of the food industry which Mr Kinderman mentioned; new feedingstuffs arrive all the time, while others disappear."
"For this reason, some sound common sense will be called for here."
"We must take thought and find out what is right and what is good, and only after that, on the basis of experience, must we go about implementing matters."
"Once again my warm thanks go to the consultative committee, which carried out splendid work from the viewpoint of Parliament and, particularly, from that of the farmers."
"Mr President, I, too, am of the opinion that this was a good report, and that the result from the Conciliation Committee opens the way to implementation, which, however, I am sure will take some time yet."
"The Community's Member States are still, in any case, responsible for the monitoring of feedingstuffs, and, as the parties in this whole process represent very diverse interests, it will be necessary, within the foreseeable future, to discuss monitoring programmes which will standardise supervision of feedingstuffs composition and norms across the board."
"I am grateful for the key data laid down in the Conciliation Committee, which is in line with my own experience."
"What worries me, though, is the apportionment of costs, specifically the costs of the declaration itself and for the monitoring of it."
"I wish to put on record my opposition to the costs continuing to be offloaded onto the farmers."
"I take the view that the transparency principle means that implementation of the procedure must involve the producers of feedingstuffs, its importers, dealers in it, and, above all, those who monitor it - who will be numerous - also themselves guaranteeing the apportionment of their costs."
"It is also my opinion that there should be safety standards in the production of feedingstuffs to guarantee and safeguard the health of people and animals, ensuring that no products come onto the market that are dubious from the point of view of health and consumer protection, which, of course, presupposes the principle that good technical production practice does not start, and is not interrupted, at purely arbitrary points."
"I do think that apportionment on this basis at every production site must prove itself in the next few years and I hope, after this report and after the positive result achieved in the Conciliation Committee, that there will not be another scandal somewhere or other in the foreseeable future, whether in wine, honey, or the many feedingstuffs we can expect to be listed, be they positive, negative, coloured green or anything else, for the list will surely be an enormous one."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to congratulate the European institutions and the members of the conciliation committee who, under the presidency of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck - who I would have liked to have been here -, who have been able, sparing no effort, to unite differing views in order to reach a reasonable compromise between the two basic positions which initially seemed incompatible."
"That is to say, firstly, the obligatory declaration of all raw materials, with a tolerance level of 15%, and the obligation of feed producers to communicate the exact percentages, whenever required by animal farmers, to which I believe we should add a time limit, set previously in this legislation, and, secondly, the positive list - which all the previous speakers have mentioned - which the Commission must present before the end of 2002, once the viability studies have been carried out."
"When it comes to restoring consumer confidence, following the recent food crises (BSE, dioxins, etc.) absolute transparency is necessary, even indispensable."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, this is an example of how, within the scope of the codecision procedure, it is possible to reach reasonable agreements - good agreements, I would say - and we in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development will therefore continue to ask the Council to gradually extend that procedure to all legislative actions in the field of the Community' s agricultural policy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by warmly congratulating the rapporteur and Parliament's Conciliation Committee, whose stubbornness has in the end produced a creditable result."
"Almost two years of negotiations with the Commission and the Council within the framework of the conciliation procedure have at last enabled us to reach a compromise on regulations on the labelling of compound feedingstuffs."
"When this House votes tomorrow on this directive, it can do so, I believe, with its mind very much at ease."
"I see this directive as proof that Parliament must in future have a right of co-decision in agricultural matters as well."
"As we are all aware, the crucial issues were the open declaration, the positive list and an evaluation report."
"Parliament's main concern was to lay down exact regulations on labelling that would provide for compulsory details of both the quantity and quality of ingredients."
"Even with the Council, which did not originally share this position, a compromise text could eventually be agreed on, according to which the ingredients must now be stated by percentage of weight with a margin for error and according to which farmers must be given the exact percentages if they request them."
"This binding statement of permissible ingredients is the only guarantee that consumers can in future have greater confidence in farmers' products, and we farmers know how much we need consumers' approval and trust."
"The positive list to be produced by the end of 2002 should make that possible."
"On the positive side, I would like to make the additional observation that Parliament must also be involved in any future amendments to the directive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, having gone through two readings and the conciliation procedure, the report on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs now prescribes the open declaration, and the Commission has to produce a proposal for a positive list for feedingstuff ingredients by the end of 2002."
"Both these points had been at the core of Parliament's concerns, but had initially been rejected by the Council."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's report is the very model of successful legislative work by Parliament and the Council."
"In spite of all the differences between the political groups, constructive collaboration made it possible to draw up points that were important to us members of Parliament's agricultural committee, and the final result was a positive one thanks to circumspect negotiations in the conciliation procedure, guided by our Vice-President, Mr Friedrich, whom I would like to take this opportunity of warmly thanking."
"This was the right step in the right direction."
"Not only was it possible for Parliament to see its two core concerns accepted, but the Council also had positive elements to contribute."
"The possibility of a + 15% tolerance margin for feedingstuff ingredients is something I see as acceptable, in that the manufacturer must state the exact percentages at the customer' s request."
"Equally in line with good practice is an evaluation report after three years and, if need be, adjustment of the tolerance margin in the light of scientific and technical developments."
"It would be desirable if we could make greater future use of the co-decision procedure on CAP matters and continue to work together as constructively."
"Whatever our successes, I would like to conclude with the single warning that good European rules are of no use unless they are monitored."
"The BSE and dioxin crises do not in some way reflect faults in European regulation; they were, rather, the result of criminal and questionable practices, which we must counter with determination and in new ways."
"Mr President, honourable Members, we all agree that agribusinesses in the EU should maintain their commitment to satisfy the legitimate expectations and demands of both the farming community and consumers."
"The marketing of compound feedingstuffs today has certainly improved in terms of traceability and transparency of composition - two issues of great concern for our major customer, the European citizen."
"These principles can apply to all feeds to animals."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf says farmers must know what is in their feed, Mr Kindermann applies this to slops and waste and catering waste and I fully agree with those statements."
"This piece of legislation is one of the milestones needed to build certainty and confidence."
"Farmers are entitled to basic information to be able to properly inform their customers."
"From the very beginning, the Council encountered great difficulties in agreeing on a common position."
"Most Member States were opposed to this obligation and the positions of Parliament and the Council were quite far apart."
"At the time, with a view to reaching a compromise, the Commission accepted the Council's position which finally had the unanimous support of all the Member States."
"This led to a difference in view between Council and Parliament after the second reading in April."
"I am pleased, however, that an acceptable solution has been found in the conciliation with the declaration of all feed materials under their specific name indicating the exact percentages with a tolerance level of around 15%."
"However, as regards the demand for a positive list of feed materials, I have already on several occasions outlined the Commission's reservations."
"This concerns especially the deadline of presenting a proposal by the end of next year."
"This task is very complex."
"The Commission has already launched a feasibility study on this issue."
"The call for tenders was published last June and the contractor is currently working on the matter and will also contact Members of this Parliament."
"I accordingly undertake to send the report on the outcome of this study to the Council and Parliament as soon as possible and in any case before 31 December, 2002."
"I cannot, however, guarantee that I will be in a position to present a legislative proposal on the establishment of a positive list."
"For this reason, it has been necessary for the Commission to make a declaration on this subject."
"Thank you very much Commissioner Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 9.30 p.m.)"
"Vote on requests for urgent procedure"
"I now give the floor to Mr Katiforis, who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Katiforis (PSE)."
"Madam President, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has considered how we should continue to work on this directive after we rejected the Commission proposal in the last plenary by a considerable majority."
"According to the regulation, we have two months in which to deliberate and then come up with a reply."
"The Economic Committee has given me until Monday to complete my negotiations with colleagues, the Commission and the Presidency."
"From what I see, there is no urgency in the matter because in any case the political agreement supposedly reached in Council on the matter is not set to begin before July."
"There is therefore plenty of time for negotiation and for making contacts, and 15 January - when we shall reply - is not too far away."
"Therefore, I see no particular need for urgent procedure and my proposal is that we reject the urgency request."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"Proposal for a Council decision on an exchange of letters between the European Community and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) concerning additional funding in 2001 under the current EC-UNRWA Convention for the years 1999-2001[COM(2001) 741 - C5-0663/2001 - 2001/0288(CNS)]"
"President."
"I will now give the floor to Mr Wynn who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible, the Committee on Budgets."
"Madam President, last night the Committee on Budgets and, I understand, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy discussed this matter."
"There is no problem with urgency being granted and we can do it without report and without debate."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"Draft Council regulation on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism[COM(2001) 569 - C5-0665/2001 - 2001/0228(CNS)]Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs"
"President."
"I will now give the floor to Mr Watson who will speak on behalf of the committee responsible, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Colleagues will recall that we dealt with this matter in urgent procedure in October."
"I am pleased to be able to report that the Council has now accepted the legal base that was being proposed."
"However, we would contest the fact that neither of the two appendices is attached to the proposal, although we understand the reasons why."
"Nonetheless, we discussed this in committee last night and we recognise the urgency."
"We would propose an urgent procedure without report."
"It would then be up to the political groups to put forward amendments, which might be similar to those we adopted in October."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"Presentation by Mr Prodi of the Commission work for the 2002 programme and the communication on the future of the European Union and strengthening the Community method"
"The next item is the Presentation of the Commission work for 2002 programme and the communication on the future of the European Union and strengthening the Community method."
"I now give the floor to Mr Prodi, President of the Commission."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the annual debate on the State of the Union is one of our most important debates and, this year, it is taking place at a key moment for the European Union."
"In recent days and months, a Greater Europe has truly been taking shape."
"In less than twelve months, it will be possible to conclude the negotiations with the candidate countries that have satisfied the criteria set for enlargement, which will mean that the Union will be able to welcome up to ten new Member States before the next European elections."
"In less than three weeks, the euro, the strongest and most visible sign of both the economic and political union of Europe, will become a tangible reality."
"Lastly, before the end of the week, the Laeken European Council will take the decision to set up a Convention, which will do the groundwork for the reform of the Treaties and, for the first time, bring together representatives of governments, national parliaments, the European Commission and this House."
"This greater Europe which is taking shape is a united, democratic, forward-looking Europe."
"The Commission has been working towards this in the year now drawing to a close and intends to continue to do so in the year that will shortly commence."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, before moving on to the work carried out by the Commission in 2001 and our programme for 2002, I would like to stress once again my belief that full, transparent cooperation between the institutions is essential for the smooth running of the Union."
"With this in mind, as early as January this year, I told you of the Commission's intention to revitalise our method of working together in order to make cooperation between our two institutions even more effective and transparent."
"Before setting out these proposals, I would like, however, to go through the fundamental principles on which, I believe, our cooperation must be based."
"Firstly, the Commission's right of initiative must be safeguarded, as it is one of the pillars of the Community structure and the guarantor of its integrity."
"A strong Commission means a strong European Parliament."
"Secondly, the tripartite nature of interinstitutional cooperation must be safeguarded."
"Indeed, it will only be effective if the two legislative bodies - Parliament and the Council - can enter into dialogue with the Commission on a common basis of transparency."
"I would now like to turn to my proposals for revitalising the system, which, I am sure, will help to greatly improve dialogue between our institutions."
"Firstly, from this year on, the work programme will no longer be a catalogue of planned legislation for that year; it will, as you have requested, be a genuine political programme."
"This programme, which the Commission hereby undertakes to follow closely, sets out both the priorities for the year in question and the initiatives needed to accomplish them."
"I know that some of you were surprised not to receive an annex to the 2002 work programme listing planned legislation, as has been the case in previous years."
"However, I want to point out that we listened very carefully to the views many of you expressed in this Chamber on 13 February."
"You asked the Commission, quite clearly, to abandon the method of listing legislative proposals employed thus far and to adopt a new method."
"We have made sure we complied with that request."
"For these reasons, which were also set out in writing by Mrs Fontaine on 10 September, we have replaced the catalogue with the much more reliable instrument of quarterly programming, which is what the College uses to plan its work and of which you will be informed at regular intervals."
"To maintain perfect transparency, however, I have also asked the Secretary-General of the Commission to forward immediately to the Secretary-General of Parliament the preliminary list of proposals put forward by the Commission departments which formed the basis for the work programme for 2002."
"If this approach produces positive results, we are willing to use it in future years as well."
"Secondly, it is equally important to point out that, in future, the preparation of such a programme will need to be based on a more structured dialogue between our institutions."
"This is why we have planned a multi-stage approach for the forthcoming year, with the preparation of the work programme for 2003 starting at the beginning of 2002."
"The two key dates for this political dialogue will be in February, when I will come to present to you the political priorities approved by the Commission for 2003, and November, when I will come to set out to you the work programme the Commission has adopted on the basis of these priorities."
"The discussions at the Conference of Presidents have shown me that we are in agreement on the broad outline I have just described."
"For our part, we will make a start as soon as possible on establishing the details and commencing practical implementation."
"Mrs de Palacio, who, at my request, has begun a dialogue with you on this matter, will continue her work and the dialogue with the aim of concluding our agreement next January."
"Lastly, I feel it is important to stress that breaking the process down into stages should not increase our respective workloads but should enable us to continue to assume our respective responsibilities."
"With regard to the 2001 budget, the list of what has been done over the course of a year is too long for me to give you a detailed account here and now."
"I shall therefore confine myself to focusing on the areas in which the Union, with a decisive contribution from the Commission, has achieved its greatest successes in 2001: the preparations for the changeover to the euro; the progress made in the enlargement negotiations; relations with the Balkan countries; the dialogue with Russia; the opening of a new round of trade negotiations at Doha; the adoption of a strategy for sustainable development which goes far beyond the mere adoption of a series of specific measures and which will gradually bring us to review all our internal policies; and lastly, the reinvigoration of the process of creating a common European area of justice and security, which has had a particularly high profile since 11 September."
"Throughout the year, in each of these fields, the Commission's actions have benefited from the crucial support of this House."
"Looking ahead to 2002, to give you a clearer picture of our tasks for the coming year, I am also sure that you will allow me to present the seven priorities indicated by the Commission in its work programme for 2002 by grouping them under four key headings."
"These four major areas are internal security, the euro and economic and social matters, enlargement and, lastly, the Future of Europe debate and the process of reforming the Union' s institutions."
"The annual strategy we drew up last February revolved around six priorities."
"However, the events of 11 September - and you will all understand that any programme must be flexible if it is to deal with unforeseen circumstances - forced us to adopt a seventh."
"Therefore, in 2002, the Commission will present a number of measures to combat terrorism and organised crime and to safeguard the security of our citizens."
"They will include the launching of an integrated system for external border controls, the development of civil protection, public health measures and steps to improve transport safety."
"As I have already had the opportunity to say, when speaking at Bruges on 12 November, improving judicial and police cooperation will lay the foundations for the creation, in the longer term, of an integrated police force to combat organised crime and terrorism."
"Ever since the beginning of its term of office, this Commission has included among the four cornerstones on which its work is based, the aim to extend Union action, hitherto primarily economic, to cover economic, social and environmental concerns."
"The programme for 2002 will not depart from this objective."
"The introduction of the euro will be the most significant as well as the most tangible step towards European integration."
"In this connection, I am particularly pleased that it has been possible to overcome all the political differences regarding cross-border payments, with the result that President Fontaine will shortly be able to announce the adoption of a common position."
"Thanks to the efforts made to prepare for the introduction of the euro, our economy is now strong, stable and, at the same time, the most open in the world."
"What would have been the impact of 11 September if we had not had the euro?"
"Stability is the basis for our future policies and we must safeguard it."
"The current economic situation is, of course, by no means easy, but I feel sure we will be able to overcome any short-term problems."
"We have the instruments to do so, and here I am referring, in particular, to the Stability Pact and the broad economic policy guidelines."
"We must, however, consider the need to improve the coordination of the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone."
"With the introduction of the single currency, our economies have never been as interdependent as they are now."
"With this in mind, I said recently that it might be advisable to concentrate on developing a code of conduct which would take specific account of the interdependence of the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone and would improve the overall coherence and the credibility of our economic policy."
"My major concerns relate more to the long term."
"Europe does indeed need structural reform."
"It is the prerequisite for sustainable growth and job creation."
"We already have the right recipe."
"In two fundamental steps, both completed during the first part of this Commission' s term of office - at Lisbon in March 2000 and at Gothenburg in June 2001 - the Member States undertook to work towards sustainable development that can combine competitiveness, social justice and respect for the environment."
"The Commission' s work programme for 2002 confirms this line of action."
"The implementation of the undertakings given at Gothenburg is one of the seven priorities identified for next year."
"Our commitment to preparing for and making a success of the meeting in Johannesburg on sustainable development is consistent with this course."
"So where do these worries stem from?"
"From the delays between the official adoption of the decisions and their practical implementation."
"The boulder blocking the course of the development of Galileo, an essential initiative and technology for the growth and competitiveness of the European economy, is only the latest on a list of obstructions that is now simply too long."
"There is no need to mention them all; one example will suffice: the European patent."
"The inability to fulfil solemnly given and announced undertakings and the lack of will to proceed along the road towards final completion of the single market are costing Europe very dearly."
"The cost of the failure to deliver on Europe, which we could call the failure to deliver on Lisbon, is rapidly becoming intolerable."
"The annual economic report that the Commission will present in just over a month' s time, indeed as part of the preparations for the Spring Council, will contain a detailed analysis of the situation, and substantial progress will, at last, have to be made in Barcelona."
"However, as I pointed out in Bruges, on its own, the Commission can do nothing. The Member States need to assume their responsibilities and make the decisions that are incumbent upon them."
"Parliament too, moreover, will have to play its part: I am still convinced, for example, that the failure to reach an agreement on the new public procurement legislation has hindered the development of our financial markets."
"In this sector, the European economy is clearly weaker than its American counterpart."
"The Commission is aware of the numerous factors that combine to make the economy healthy and, in 2002, it will present particularly important legislative proposals regarding banking and financial services."
"We will also present a strategy for consumer protection and measures to support private investment in research and development."
"One currency, one financial market and one economic policy, this must be our objective."
"In any case, our main worry concerns an essential requirement for social cohesion, employment."
"This will be the case in 2002 and will remain so for many years to come."
"This is why, in Barcelona, we will present a communication on the social aspects of the restructuring of companies, aimed at the social partners, as we are convinced that there is a positive correlation between social protection and competitiveness."
"Completing the enlargement process and making it a success for the whole of the Union, that has been the Commission's number one priority since it first took office."
"It was on 13 October 1999 when, addressing this same House, I called upon the European Council to complete the reforms necessary for enlargement before the end of 2002 and stressed that the Commission was confident that negotiations with the countries fulfilling the accession criteria could be concluded by that date."
"Today, the date of 2002 has been formally endorsed by the Union."
"The progress achieved in the course of two years has been impressive."
"We still have before us, as I am only too aware, further stages in the negotiations that will be extremely sensitive - I need only mention the chapters on the Structural Funds or agriculture - but over the next twelve months, to those countries whose efforts have brought them to a state of readiness, the door will, at last, open, allowing them to join before the next elections to this House."
"Two thousand and two will be a pivotal year, then, and the Commission's programme faithfully reflects its importance."
"This is not only because, as I pointed out just now, we must forge ahead with the negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion; it is also because we must gradually begin to identify, for each of the common policies, the objectives and instruments made necessary by the new situation of an enlarged Union with new Member States."
"In the course of 2002, but even more so in 2003 and 2004 (and the same will apply to our successors in the years after that), we will have to bring about a genuine 'intellectual revolution' ."
"It is our discussions, our plans and our action that will shape the greater Europe."
"It is essential for the Commission to adjust to the new dimensions of Europe, but it is just as important for the other EU institutions and for the Member States of the Union to do so as well."
"We must explain this new situation to our citizens to help them overcome their anxieties and make them aware of the human, cultural and economic opportunities offered by enlargement."
"From an economic standpoint, enlargement is one of the few games in which all the players stand to win."
"It will bring an increase in growth not only for the new Member States but also for the Fifteen."
"Of course, the impact of enlargement within the Union will vary from one country to another and from one region to another."
"Thanks to the single market, however, the benefits will be visible everywhere."
"However, it is not enough for this greater Europe just to expand geographically to the east and the south."
"It must continue on the path of gradual rapprochement with the Balkans and project an arc of stability from its own gates towards Russia and the Ukraine and towards the Mediterranean."
"In preparation for the meeting in Valencia in April, the Commission will table proposals for improving the functioning of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, particularly in the fields of education and culture."
"Also in the course of next year, it will propose measures for stimulating investment, improving cooperation in the field of immigration and strengthening the Union's role in the Middle East peace process."
"Enlargement is an accomplishment of historic significance."
"However, it must not lead to paralysis of the Union."
"This is the background against which the debate on European governance is taking place, a debate that the Commission helped to launch with its White Paper."
"It is crucial that the dialogue between our two institutions on the issues raised by the White Paper and the ensuing action should continue, and the work programme for 2002 lays down the details of this."
"The debate on Europe and on the future has, however, spread well beyond the confines of the White Paper and has taken on a more clearly Constitutional tone."
"Moreover, right from the beginning of its mandate, this Commission has fought for renewed vigour to be injected into the institutional debate in the Union."
"As early as September 1999, addressing you here in this same Chamber, I insisted that the Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 2000 should adopt a broader agenda, above and beyond the 'Amsterdam leftovers' ."
"At that time, I told you of my fears that the IGC would merely tinker with the machinery and not give us effective tools to take decisions."
"After the essential but undoubtedly minimal agreement reached in Nice, the Commission, along with Parliament, immediately lent its support to the idea of a Convention, something which has now been generally agreed."
"I warmly welcome this development because I am firmly convinced that this is the right path to take if we are to build the new, more democratic, more transparent Europe."
"In the meantime, a wide-ranging debate on the future of the Union is already taking place in all the European countries, and that debate must be ongoing and must provide input for the work of the Convention."
"The time when we could go on putting off the necessary reforms until tomorrow, as if events would always unfold slowly enough to await our decisions, is over."
"A major contribution to this discussion has already been made by the Mendez de Vigo and Kaufmann report and by the plenary debate which Parliament held on the topic."
"In preparation for the Laeken Council, the Commission presented a communication on 5 December."
"As we explained in that document, which is intended merely to provide a few pointers for the debate, the key to the problem lies in renewing and strengthening the Community method."
"Our aim should not be to interfere with the balances that have been built up over the last fifty years."
"Rather, what we should be doing is modernising our system and enabling the peoples of Europe to identify with it."
"What the Convention should, in my view, produce is a coherent text, underpinned by its own logic, not a mere shopping list; a text adopted by consensus, which therefore does not seek unanimity at any price and which, to avoid scaling down its essential ambitions, voices minority views where necessary; a simpler, more easily readable text which clearly sets out not only the principles guiding our action - and the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be at the heart of those principles - but also the goals to which we are aspiring; a text which makes the way in which the European public authorities work more transparent, that is which gives a clear description of both the institutions and the instruments necessary for achieving the objectives they are assigned; and lastly, a text that is capable of evolving and is therefore, to this end, a combination of a set of fundamental rules and some more technical provisions."
"Before the Convention begins its work, the Commission will state its position on many issues, such as the powers of the Union and of the Member States, the strengthening of Parliament's legislative role, the distinction between the Council's executive and legislative functions, and the Commission's executive tasks."
"The extension of majority voting, the procedures for revising the Treaties and the Union's own resources are other issues that also form part of the political debate and will have to be addressed in the near future."
"Before leaving the subject of the forthcoming Convention, I would like to focus for a moment on an issue that is usually summed up by one word: the Constitution."
"For me, what is essential is not the name eventually given to the text that grows out of the work of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. My objective is that that text, by virtue of its content and thanks to the open, democratic nature of the process that generated it, should ultimately be regarded by everyone as having the force of a Constitution."
"I am confident that the work programme for 2002 will provide the foundation on which, over the next twelve months, our two institutions can build a relationship of close, constant, fruitful cooperation."
"Thank you Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck."
"I would like to thank you for your previous kind words and for the positive assessment you have made of the cooperation between your presidency and the European Parliament."
"I think it is fair to say that we share this assessment and I would also like, in this regard, to underline to Members of this House that, to my knowledge, this is the first time that the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has participated in the debate on the Commission' s work programme for 2002."
"This is a very positive step, and I would like to welcome you and thank you."
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, it is not really all that common for the political group chairmen to express praise and appreciation."
"Normally, if we praise someone and express our appreciation for anyone, it is for the President of this Parliament."
"We often have occasion to express our thanks and praise for her."
"However, today I would like to say a word of appreciation to the Council, and to you, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, for being here today for the first time, as our President has just said."
"Last time round I was critical because the Council was not represented."
"If the Council pursues a good policy, even if it concerns working methods, then that deserves our appreciation."
"You are a Belgian; you represent the Belgian Presidency."
"I would like to thank you very sincerely on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats not only for being here today, but also for the committed way you have worked during your presidency."
"I would now like to address the President of the Commission."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have a very high regard for the President of the Commission, for his personal integrity and for his positive attitude."
"However, if we want to achieve joint successes, these successes have to be based on truthfulness and on sensible working methods and structures."
"Mr Prodi, you know of course that the political groups in the European Parliament prepare each part-session here in Strasbourg by means of their work in group meetings in Brussels."
"Many members of my group said last week in Brussels, when we were doing our preparatory work, that the 2002 work programme was on the agenda, but where was the document that we could have used to prepare for this debate in Strasbourg?"
"Many members were in favour of striking this debate from the agenda."
"Mr Prodi, I have to tell you that this should not happen again, we must never again find ourselves without a working document for such an important debate."
"I would ask you to ensure in future - and this is not just your task as President but rather one for the Commission as a whole, and for your staff - that documents are made available in good time and that the European Parliament is treated seriously, so that we can work in a reasonable way, which is in both our interest and yours."
"(Applause)"
"Reasonable working methods are essential if we are to succeed here."
"If we do not have reasonable working methods and structures, we do not have any chance of succeeding."
"We want to work towards joint success because we are firmly convinced that the Commission and this House, as committed advocates of the Community method, need to work towards the same goals."
"So if you have any colleagues who do not take Parliament so seriously, it is therefore in their own interest to consider whether working methods should not be restructured in their field."
"We are not just offering you and your fellow Commissioners a hand; we also need a sensible form of cooperation if we are to achieve joint successes."
"For that reason, relations between Parliament and the Commission need to be in good order."
"That is something that you want as well, but in that case the fine words that we certainly appreciate also need to be matched by specific practical action when it comes to cooperation."
"A programme like the one we have before us deserves to be supported by all the Members of the Commission, and indeed we have five Members of the Commission with us today, which is more than usual, but this programme covers all areas of work in 2002."
"You yourself said that you are effectively the European government, an idea with which we in our group have a great deal of sympathy."
"However, if you are effectively the European government, then the whole government should be here, with all your Members."
"I would very much welcome it if that were the case next time."
"Mr President of the Commission, when we are setting our agenda during the meeting of political group chairmen, we often hear that Commissioner A, B or C cannot be here in Strasbourg at such and such a time."
"I really must urge you, given that we are only talking about four days each month - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday - to ensure that all Members of the Commission keep those days free."
"If Parliament asks for Commissioners to be here, then they should come, and the excuse that they have other commitments is not acceptable."
"Parliament should have priority over any other commitments the Commission may have."
"There are of course exceptions - I say that because I see Commissioner Lamy is with us - when there are major world conferences on the international calendar, such as the Doha Conference, which Mr Lamy and Mr Fischler of course have to attend."
"We are not insisting on this point 100%, but basically speaking Parliament must have priority over other Commission activities."
"If I may now turn to the substance of the programme, Mr President of the Commission, we largely support what you have said."
"We are in agreement, and for that reason we should cooperate sensibly and effectively. We now expect, like you, that next weekend in Laeken the Heads of State and Government will give the Convention an ambitious mandate so as to achieve a really positive reform of the EU institutions."
"We recommend that an early start should be made on this work, at the end of February or the beginning of March, so that the Convention can be concluded at the end of 2003 under the Italian Presidency."
"We also support what you have said about enlargement."
"Up to 10 new countries could be included in the first round."
"This is not the time to say which those countries will be."
"However, we do not agree with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs when he says that we should accept all the Central European countries, as when we make a decision on this in autumn 2002, we can only accept those countries which meet the conditions."
"Those countries that do not meet the conditions cannot yet expect to join the European Union."
"It is not acceptable for countries like Hungary to have to wait because other countries are not yet ready."
"Those countries that do meet the conditions should not be held back because other countries are not yet ready, and we hope that the decisions made at that point will be the right ones."
"We also fully support your comments about the Mediterranean region."
"We need to work with great commitment under the Barcelona Process, which is becoming ever more urgent and involves an ever greater contribution to stability."
"You mentioned how important stability is for us if we want to make Europe truly competitive, because it is not enough for us simply to declare that the European Union is to become the most competitive area in the world."
"We also have to take the necessary structural measures, and that means in particular strengthening Europe as a location for investment."
"There should not just be tax incentives for major corporations, but also for medium-sized companies, so that they too can invest, and when investments are made that leads to the creation of jobs."
"I shall wind up now, Madam President."
"We have an ambitious programme, we support the Commission and we call on the Commission and the Council for us all to work together, as there should not be any competition between our various institutions, because we are all committed to the same Europe, and that is why the Commission, the Council and Parliament must each fulfil their own responsibilities."
"We are prepared to do so, and will support the other institutions when they do the same."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for her management during the Belgian Presidency and say that it truly demonstrates, in this case, that being a former Member of the European Parliament is good training for managing European affairs within a government."
"I believe that this is a type of training with a future."
"Having said that, Mr President of the Commission, we must resolve the disagreement between us with sincerity and frankness."
"At the beginning of the legislature, my group asked the Commission to present a political programme for the purposes of the vote on its investiture, and that programme, as we said at the time, had to lead to an adjustment of the annual programme, not only in legislative terms."
"What happened the other day in the Conference of Presidents, however, and what has happened again today, requires clarification."
"We have not asked you not to present the legislative programme, nor after the deadline."
"What we have asked is that you present a political programme, and you have produced a working programme: this is all very well, and we take note of it, but we also want a legislative programme, because we are one of the parties to codecision."
"And proof that we were right lies in the fact that I was told, last night, by e-mail, that the legislative programme had arrived as an annex."
"It is important that we are able to respect the deadlines and agreements we are party to and, on that basis, you can organise the work as you see fit: by means of 'planning' , 'programming' , 'rolling on' , or whatever you want."
"I very much fear that the number of officials filling in forms is going to increase."
"But that is your problem."
"You must fulfil your commitments to Parliament."
"In this respect, Mr President, I must say that you must improve the department or service of your secretariat which deals with mail, because we have raised a parliamentary question on how you are going to deal with the issue of the flax fine, specifically in Spain, and four Group Chairmen, despite the fact that the Liberal Group and the PPE-DE Group have blocked this question, which should have been seen in this House, have written to you and we are awaiting a reply."
"It is important - and I am happy that the Vice-President of the Commission is here - that we do not allow issues to fester."
"I would therefore be grateful if you could be more diligent with regard to this issue."
"These problems relating to the programme are mere child' s play compared to the current situation."
"We are on the eve of the Laeken Summit and the fundamental issue is the defence of the Community method."
"And I say this because dark clouds are appearing on the horizon."
"Yesterday in this House, on behalf of my group - and I am pleased that the President-in-Office of the Council is here - we strongly supported the Belgian Presidency of the Council and the Council itself with regard to an issue which we feel is very important - I believe that President Verhofstadt is in Rome today - and that is that we manage to introduce, as fifteen countries, the anti-terrorist legislation which this Parliament, the Council and the Commission have supported."
"We believe that this is an important defence of the Community method."
"If it is not done by 15 countries, it will be done by 14."
"We would prefer it to be 15, but this is an issue on which we clearly support them."
"We are also currently concerned about the fact, and I am referring to a point which Mr Poettering highlighted yesterday, that certain governments, of Austria and Italy, are opposed to democratic criteria appearing in the statute on political parties."
"With regard to Laeken, Mr President of the Commission, the most interesting part of your speech was the final part, when you not only supported the Convention, but you gave it content, in complete agreement with the approach contained in the Leinen-Méndez de Vigo report."
"In relation to the Convention, I would ask you to defend what you have said here today in the European Council in Laeken, to make a coherent proposal and that that proposal, even if it has to be cooled down and digested, is not left on the shelf."
"I would like to know how that is going to be coordinated with the timetable for enlargement and the reform of the Treaties before 2004, and what your position is with regard to the membership of the praesidium of the Convention."
"Furthermore, finally, do not leave the secretariat of the Convention to the Council; we must all participate in it, because a broader distribution always brings the best results."
"And, in this respect, Mr President, I would ask you to expand on the replies you have given in relation to the Convention."
"You call on Parliament and the Commission to work together - and I believe we can do great things in defence of the Community method - but it is important that you have the courage and the capacity to make use of your monopoly on initiative, which must not simply be a monopoly on operation, but which must be a means for achieving what you have proposed: texts of constitutional value and, above all, which reflect the democracy and transparency which we want in this enlarged Union."
"Madam President, when we discussed this last week in the Conference of Presidents, my group - the Liberal Democrats - voted to have a debate today and not to postpone it."
"I regret that my remarks today will mostly be about process rather than content, because I think that we still have not found the correct process."
"I would, however, like to salute the work the Commission has done this year and to acknowledge the enormous progress in the preparation of the launch of the euro; the very substantial progress on enlargement which we very much welcome; the work which is being done in south-eastern Europe; the break-through on the World Trade Organisation and the very stimulating programme on sustainable development."
"All of those and the work on the common area of justice and security are to the credit of the Commission."
"I very much agree with the focus of next year's priorities which are sensible and acceptable, particularly in that we need to work closely together on promoting the Community method in building the future of Europe."
"There are, however, questions in the legislative programme to which we need answers."
"Why last year was only 45% of the programme processed by this time of the year and 55% not?"
"How is it that 117 or 118 new items not foreseen were added?"
"I do not mind flexibility - that is good in politics - but this seems rather more chaotic than one's definition of flexibility."
"I fully respect the Commission's right of initiative, but I would urge that the Commission should not simply start in February with a general statement of priorities and then, in November, bring forward a specific work programme."
"We need an intensive dialogue between times and some intermediate staging-posts at which to make evaluations."
"We believe, Mr President of the Commission, like you, in good governance and this Parliament will commit itself to being a high quality player in terms of the input and impact on co-legislation, but that requires criteria."
"We need to discuss with each other - and this is not an attempt to interfere with the right of initiative of the Commission - is the law necessary?"
"Is it proportionate?"
"Does it respect subsidiarity?"
"Is it transparent and accountable?"
"What are the options for implementation?"
"Can we do some kind of regulatory impact assessment before we go down the line?"
"The Commission already has a wonderful process of consultation in place with social partners."
"Share this process with us as well, not because we want to interfere with your right to make the final call, but because we too are players and we cannot be left to one side or not get documents till the eve of a debate."
"Our President has communicated to you a scheme that we would commend."
"Our Conference of Presidents backs what she has said."
"Our Committee on Constitutional Affairs backs what she has said and if we can do that, next year we will discuss politics more and process less."
"We have got to get it right."
"We have to do this early to avoid a repetition of this unnecessary mutual incomprehension which helps none of us to bring good governance to the European Union."
"Mr President of the Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to share my thoughts on the main topic we are discussing today: the legislative programme and the Commission' s working programme."
"Mr President of the Commission, you told us that you wanted full and transparent cooperation between the Commission and Parliament."
"That is all very well. You told us: 'To be strong, the European Parliament needs a strong Commission' ."
"We agree. But you must understand that we cannot accept being treated as the Commission' s obedient stooge."
"We of course unreservedly acknowledge the fact that it is very important that the work programme is clearly comprehensible politically, which is the case here; this does not, however, exempt you from presenting a legislative programme."
"And yet, today we have to deal with a work programme that was sent to us at the last moment and a legislative programme of which we had no knowledge before last night."
"It is difficult for us to work under such conditions."
"The European Parliament is already suffering from having no right of legislative initiative, even in areas where the Commission is failing to act - which is, in my opinion, an institutional anomaly that should be corrected in order to reduce the democratic deficit."
"However, Parliament does enjoy the power of active cooperation, which is recognised by the Commission."
"I would remind you that, from the start of this Parliamentary term, a framework agreement exists between ourselves and the Commission, an agreement that clearly defines the role of Parliament in the legislative process."
"In accordance with this agreement, the legislative programme for 2002 should have been presented to us in October, accompanied by an assessment of the previous programme; in this way we would have been able to make criticisms, remarks and proposals at a politically appropriate time and within reasonable timescales."
"I must also underline the extent to which it would be appropriate, on a political level, for political debates on the budget and the legislative programme to mutually support and complement each other."
"October or November would be an appropriate time for this to take place."
"Today, we are two months late and there is no legislative programme, or rather, we have only just discovered one exists."
"Under these conditions, I think that Parliament is de facto deprived of its powers of control and influence, which is not a good thing."
"I would also like to remind you of some concrete facts: on 30 November, just a few days ago, less than half of the programme for 2001 had been executed."
"In addition to this, half of the initiatives taken were not included in the legislative programme for 2001."
"This is astonishing at the very least."
"It must, of course, be admitted that the unforeseen events that took place, which completely turned the political agenda on its head, justified the tabling of proposals to take account of such upheavals, but a careful reading of the texts shows that, to a great extent, these new proposals have nothing to do with the present situation, or, in any case, could have been tabled at some other time, rather than within the context of the programme for 2001."
"In my opinion, this reveals, and I think that most Members in my group would agree, that there is quite a significant degree of disorder within the Commission and a lack of common vision of the guidelines that should direct the common work of our institutions."
"The explanations that you give us to justify this, which relate to the Commission' s internal reforms, will not satisfy us forever."
"I would point out that these explanations have been given since the start of this legislature."
"We cannot accept, Mr President, that the European Parliament be deprived of its powers of control, which are clearly recognised; this situation is not good for either Parliament or for the Commission itself."
"At a time when we are talking about good governance, of reconciliation with the European citizen, the most fundamental thing is that commitments made and Parliament' s prerogatives be respected."
"Madam President, I too would like to thank the Belgian Presidency, and I hope that we shall all have a really successful summit in Laeken."
"Today we are debating the Commission's work programme, and I wish to say that my group supports the general resolution by the various political groups concerning this programme."
"Why?"
"Because there is an interinstitutional agreement between two institutions, and I do not think this House is being unreasonable in expecting the Commission to adhere to the undertakings it has given Parliament."
"Mr Prodi, in your White Paper on European Governance there is much talk about how Europe could be better governed."
"However, you are not performing one of the most elementary tasks, that is to say the presentation of a legislative programme."
"I heard this morning that an e-mail with an attachment arrived last night."
"The text that I am familiar with so far is a work programme which as far as I can see is simply full of platitudes."
"It includes announcements about comprehensive packages of measures, other measures are to be proposed, specific measures are being prepared, and so it goes on for 20 pages."
"But what the Council and Parliament need to know above all, and in good time, is what legislation will actually be presented, and, first and foremost, why."
"We need to know what the basis for this legislation is so that we can act in unison here."
"I must not forget to point out that the national parliaments, which also have a certain role in this process, and a not inconsiderable one at that, have some problems with the whole process. This is a problem that has to be solved, Mr Prodi."
"I also have a few more comments about your communication for the Laeken Summit."
"I consider that it contains some extremely interesting ideas that are worth supporting."
"It is true to say that limiting ourselves strictly to the four priorities identified in Nice would weaken the credibility of the Convention, in other words the list of issues to be addressed needs to be widened in order to meet the public's expectations and to ensure that the enlarged Union will have a viable future."
"However, I also have to say that with this paper too, I kept asking myself why the Commission was showing so little courage and vision in the run-up to such an important summit."
"What will the public think if the Commission talks about defending a certain European ideal, as it does in the document, in such an unambitious way?"
"What ideal are we talking about then?"
"What is the process of deepening that we are all in favour of to be like, and why should it just relate to democracy, as the document suggests?"
"I really find it rather mysterious why, with an eye to Laeken and particularly when we are envisaging convening a historic convention, we do not quite simply say, yes, our common goal is to create a truly democratic Europe. Furthermore, Mr Prodi, I expect, in view of all this, that in future the Commission will act far more energetically in its capacity as the motor of European integration."
"Madam President, allow me to begin with a prediction: the present Commission will scarcely survive into 2004."
"It may be toppled by new scandals involving fraud, because the former cases of fraud have not been cleared up and because the reforms that might have prevented new cases have not been introduced."
"The Commission may also be toppled by Parliament through a vote of no confidence."
"I believe it is heading for the end of the road if it does not change course now."
"Parliament' s committee chairmen have asked for what are known as the screening reports on the negotiations with the applicant countries."
"Parliament' s group chairpersons have repeated the request."
"Still we have not received them."
"MEPs sit every day in committee meetings without the relevant and up-to-date papers from the secret legislative process."
"There is solemn talk of Parliament as co-legislator, but the legislative power has, in reality, been taken over by officials and ministers in the Council and the Commission."
"We are humiliated the whole time."
"People who are humiliated can one day deliver a vote of no confidence to the Commission."
"After the ground rules had been agreed, we should have had the Commission' s legislative programme in October."
"We have now been given an essay containing general reflections and, yesterday evening, a summary containing little detail."
"However, we have still not been given a proper catalogue of laws. The Commission should present its annual programme, stating its proposed legal base for this, so that, in the case of each proposal, we can adopt a position on whether the Commission is respecting the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"That is not only a right we possess."
"It is a duty imposed by the Treaty on each individual institution."
"All the institutions must ensure that the EU does not adopt rules which the Member States can devise just as well or better."
"We are asking for an independent discussion of the annual programme as it relates to the proximity principle, and we agree with the other groups in criticising the way in which the Commission keeps its plans secret."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I feel that upholding the Community method has become a habit for many people and I would go as far as to say a religion for some, with its greater and lesser priests: President Delors, you, President Prodi, and Ferdinando Riccardi, who preaches his daily sermon in Agence Europe."
"Yet it is a religion, ladies and gentlemen, which has lost its god, for the Community method that you are all upholding was based on the centrality of the Commission, and the Commission no longer has that pivotal status."
"The Commission is no longer at the centre of our European integration, it is no longer - as it was when there were six or nine States - the driving force of European integration."
"The 15-State Europe has already brought a number of institutional innovations: Mr CFSP is totally outside the Commission' s control."
"Well then, ladies and gentlemen, I would like my friend Mr Méndez de Vigo and a great many others to answer this crucial question: do you really think that countries like France and Germany, in particular, not to mention the United Kingdom, of course, will place their confidence in a 25-member Commission, working according to the principle of collegiality, and trust it to take fundamental decisions?"
"That is impossible."
"The Commission as it was conceived, to be the central, driving force of the Community method, is no longer, and unless we change the system of European integration radically, the Commission will be increasingly reduced to playing the role of Council secretariat."
"It is, therefore, a Commission that needs to make an effort to change."
"However, I feel, Chairman Poettering, that we are, so to speak, firing on the relief workers, for the problem is institutional, it is Laeken; we need to make radical changes to the institutional system to restore the Commission' s former power and legitimacy."
"Only with the American system - with a separate Executive, with the President of the Commission being directly elected, with a scrutinising Parliament safeguarding our Constitutional framework - can we have a properly functioning Europe, a strong Commission, a strong Parliament and a strong Assembly of Member States; otherwise, our Commission' s role will increasingly be reduced to that of Council secretariat."
"Mr President, although I agree with many of the comments that have been made today about the year 2001 having been reasonably successful, there are real grounds for concern about the way in which this debate is taking place today."
"Firstly, as a matter of principle, we have the institutional agreement of 1993, which says that the programme should be presented by October, and then our agreement of 2000, under which we are to have a broad debate about the programme before it is implemented."
"Neither of these have been fulfilled in this particular case."
"Why is this totally insufficient?"
"Firstly, the programme which is presented to us lacks focus."
"It is somewhat difficult to see priorities when you have seven of them and, within the priorities, lots of themes which are generating new ideas."
"If you have more than three priorities, as Bob Zoellick, the USTR, said, you lose yourself in detail and you can never focus on what is really important."
"Secondly, we have a lack of detail."
"I understand that we now have a legislative programme sent by e-mail, but Parliament has not been associated with this and it seems, as other speakers have said, that we had a legislative programme which was not implemented this year."
"Mr Barón Crespo is right that we did not want it."
"We wanted a political programme and legislative programme and Parliament to be associated with that."
"Thirdly, there is a lack of coordination: not just coordination among ourselves but with the national parliaments."
"As Mrs Kaufmann said: how is it possible to establish a programme for the European Union if not all the actors who are concerned at political level are associated with it?"
"This leads me to say that we were better off with President Santer."
"We were better off with the last Commission as regards the way in which the programme is presented."
"At least we had a programme in its outline and there was a real effort to try to get institutional priorities, and we had a legislative programme with details, which we could see in front of us."
"My conclusion today is that the Commission is there to propose."
"It has the right of initiative but it is not the European government."
"It cannot come to us and say this is what the European Union's programme is going to be and expect us simply to accept everything that is in its documents."
"Do you not agree, Mr President, that it would be better for the success of the European Union if we were to go back to presentation of the proposals of the legislative programme in October?"
"We would then be able to discuss, debate, consult on and conclude a programme which the Union could put forward for the year ahead."
"If you have all of us with you, you will be better off than if we have interinstitutional wars, which you seem to have started this morning."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we are faced with two dilemmas here."
"The first dilemma we face is that as President of the Commission you have quite rightly, and we must be fair about this, presented a political programme."
"However, the political programme needs to be underpinned by the legislative programme required to implement the political objectives, and that is what is missing."
"Secondly, your programme does not really address the problem that we have, in fact, implemented very little of the 2001 programme."
"You did at one point suggest that Parliament and the Council were to blame, but I believe that the Commission is really responsible for this."
"Thirdly, this House has, particularly this year, either rejected or substantially amended various Commission proposals."
"How are you going to cope with the framework that this Parliament has set?"
"Your Vice-President, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, could perhaps help you here, and particularly in the fields of the environment and of transport there are very few proposals and indications as to how ""sustainability"" is to be made a reality."
"We all know that there is a whole raft of problems with implementation."
"In your paper you do indeed refer to implementation problems."
"But the Commission, too, has implementation problems."
"From the time when the Commission takes decisions and makes financial commitments to the time when monies are actually paid out, it is not uncommon for not just months but whole years to go by."
"That is why it is also important for the Commission to consider how it can improve its own implementation, and, of course, also how national governments can improve implementation of their legislative intentions or the legislative intentions of the European Union."
"That brings me to the dilemma over the Laeken communication, a dilemma that I have personally and probably share with most of us here."
"It is a good paper and its goals are good."
"The only problem, Mr President of the Commission, is this: why it is so ambivalent, so tentative, and so vague?"
"There is one sentence in which the Commission considers that it is opportune to examine the possibility of providing the Union with a constitutional text."
"Why do you not come out and say quite plainly that you are in favour of such a text, whether you call it a constitution or a charter or whatever?"
"This kind of language typifies the way in which the Commission fails to clearly express what it stands for."
"I believe that at this particular moment this is especially important, as we are to have a convention."
"Except that this convention will chiefly consist of Members of Parliament from the individual Member States."
"We are talking here about representatives of our national governments, whereas for the Community method, which is quite rightly a matter of concern, there are Members of the European Parliament and representatives of the Commission."
"If the Council - and I am addressing this comment to you, Madam President-in-Office - on top of all that decides to appoint a former prime minister, or as now seems likely, a former president, as president of the convention, rather than a former President of the Commission, then I fear that the convention will from the outset be stigmatised to some extent by the fact that the majority of its members will not be guided by the Community method, and that the majority will perhaps not be particularly interested in strengthening the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Mr Prodi, I believe that at such a stage and in the present situation, the Commission document that you adopted at the end of December should have used clearer language."
"You partly admitted that in your speech to us today."
"It is not a question of saying we could, we ought to or we should - it is question of the Commission saying that it believes we must strengthen the Community dimension, and of the Commission saying that it believes Parliament should be strengthened as the central legislative institution of the European Union."
"To that extent we are faced with a dilemma about saying that you are right."
"It would be unfair to reject what you have said today."
"But the dilemma we face is that in such a sensitive political situation we need a Commission and a Commission President who are willing to say in even stronger, clearer and more unambiguous terms what needs doing - namely that the European Union as a whole needs to be strengthened, and that the Community method will take Europe into the future."
"Mr President, my fellow MEPs have presented a great deal of justified criticism concerning the procedures in relation to today' s programme."
"Allow me, however, to welcome the fact that a kind of evaluation from the year gone by is included and that there is more strategic thinking when it comes to the Commission' s intended way of working."
"Now let us talk about the future, however."
"President Prodi outlined, of course, how it will be possible in future to deal with the issue of the annual programme."
"As Parliament' s rapporteur, I have had the opportunity to monitor this matter for quite a long time."
"I hope we can conclude it soon and begin work on the programme for 2003."
"As the co-decision procedure has developed, Parliament and the Council, too, must also play a larger role in devising the annual programme."
"That does not mean that the Commission' s right of initiative is being questioned, but that all three institutions should be more in step in encouraging both openness and efficiency in our joint work."
"Moreover, it would then be easier for national parliaments and citizens to follow the process."
"Where the timetable is concerned, it looks as if we can now perhaps agree."
"There is an introductory presentation of the general priorities, followed by thorough discussions between the Commission and the committees concerned with a view to establishing the details."
"It is important for the parliamentary committees to be involved at an early stage because it is the committees which will then deal with the proposal."
"We can then present the definitive proposal by no later than the beginning of November."
"When it comes to the content of the programme, last year' s criticism does not mean that we do not want any legislative proposals."
"On the contrary, our common framework agreement states that what we are concerned with here is the annual legislative programme."
"Parliament has demanded clear proposals in order of precedence, explanatory statements with timetables, budget references, legal bases and information about who is responsible."
"Follow-up and evaluation must also be improved."
"As we have seen, a very great many proposals are being re-introduced, at the same time as other proposals are disappearing."
"It should be possible to set up a joint database to monitor the decision-making process for each topic."
"A process which is clear, open and predictable should benefit all the institutions and also the citizens we are here to serve."
"It is our joint responsibility to ensure that this happens."
"Mr President, the Commission' s communication to the Laeken European Council, with regard to the organisation of the debate prior to the IGC, seems to us to be mistaken in both its objective and method."
"With regard to the objective, it states that we must, and I quote, 'draw up credible guidelines in order that an enlarged Europe can achieve political, economic and social integration' ."
"And yet, if the different peoples of Europe really do want common cooperation and work at a European level, none of them has, to my knowledge, ever asked for this extreme type of integration, that is to say political, economic and social unification, by means of a democratic consultation."
"The objective today is not to strengthen this 'integration-unification' , headed by supranational institutions, which we do not want, but to better organise and make more effective the nations' control over Brussels."
"Under these conditions, the Community method, useful on occasions, should not become the rule, for it is too supranational, too rigid, and removes the Union from the reality of its citizens."
"It should be provided with procedures which are more flexible, founded on respect for national democracies."
"This is why the forthcoming Convention should mainly rely upon national parliaments, which should work within networks."
"And to start with, it is these national parliaments which should have the task of organising the debate with their citizens and to put forward proposals without having to pass through an artificial forum of associations, which are European in name but not at all representative."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the priorities of the Commission' s working programme for 2002 must focus on the European Union' s immediate challenges, both in the internal field (the internal market and Economic and Monetary Union), and in the external field - especially following the attacks of 11 September - including, of course, the fight against terrorism."
"These challenges are very clear - how to revitalise our economies just a few weeks before the introduction of the single currency, how to take advantage of the challenges and opportunities offered by accession, with 13 countries seeking entry to the Union and, at the same time, how to reinvent Europe in a situation and at a moment when we are about to begin the work of a convention aimed at preparing a new Intergovernmental Conference, the objective of which must be to prevent the 'Old Continent' becoming an outdated continent."
"This Commission' s working programme for 2002 is accompanied by a communication on the Community method."
"I believe that that is an absolutely fundamental issue and we would be making a grave error if were to devote ourselves entirely to incidental issues and allow what is really crucial at the moment to stagnate."
"Next year there will be elections in several countries of the European Union and we need an institution which not only cares for the coming generations, but which takes account of their concerns and challenges."
"And that institution must be the European Commission, Mr President."
"This is not the time to analyse the decimal points presented to us by financial analysts."
"This is a time for considering the broader picture and I believe, Mr President, that it would be a serious mistake for this Parliament to exaggerate the errors which may be made by the European Commission."
"I want to say this, Mr President, because it is in the interest of Parliament and the Community as a whole to have a strong Commission."
"It therefore seems to me that, before preaching about how to sort out the world' s problems, we should take a good look at our own institution and respect the work and decisions taken in the field of our parliamentary bodies."
"I say this in relation to something Mr Barón mentioned - I regret that he is not present at the moment - and frankly I do not believe that we should take advantage of this debate to introduce extemporaneous issues which are not currently amongst our concerns or relevant to this debate."
"I also believe, Mr President, that it would be a serious mistake for the Commission not to direct all its efforts towards restoring that alliance, that harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission, which has led to all the progress made within the Community."
"Mr President, I hope that, by means of this working programme, the disagreements of the past may be transformed into the agreements of the present and I hope that that method will prevail in the work between the Commission and Parliament."
"Anything else would be to confuse what is incidental with what is fundamental."
"We should mobilise all our forces in order to consolidate, as I have said, this strategic alliance."
"President Prodi stated that he was attached to interinstitutional cooperation and full transparency."
"I, of course, welcome such a statement: it is essential for this process to work."
"But you have to start by respecting the procedures that are agreed already, that are known and that are laid down in writing."
"I have here the Framework Agreement between Parliament and the Commission agreed just two years ago."
"I also have Rule 57 of our Rules of Procedure which lays down how we deal with the annual legislative programme and reflects the agreements that have been entered into in the past with the Commission."
"That rule states that the Commission shall present its Annual Legislative Programme in October."
"Of course, we know that there can be delays, that has happened before."
"But it specifies that this Annual Legislative Programme must refer to all proposals of a legislative nature and every act included in the programme must indicate the legal basis and the timetable envisaged for its adoption."
"On these points, what we have had before us this week fails to respect our Rules of Procedure and existing agreements reached between the two institutions."
"The one positive innovation is that Rule 57(6) has for the first time been implemented with the statement made by the President-in-Office which I like others welcome."
"In fact we have a work programme, a work programme - not a legislative programme - outlining priorities."
"To outline priorities is fine and the priorities chosen are good ones - perhaps obvious ones, but nevertheless the right ones."
"But we need the detail, we need the detail that is required in our Rules of Procedure and in the Framework Agreement."
"We need it for our committees to be able to get to work and plan their work and appoint rapporteurs who can work with the Commission in the pre-legislative phase."
"It is in the Commission's interest as well as in our own interest."
"I understand that we are now receiving the detail by e-mail, but even that, as far as I can see, fails to mention the legal basis and the timetable of each proposal."
"General debates are all very well on broad priorities, but we have that several times a year when the Commission presents its programme, when each Presidency presents its programme, and we tend to have that sort of debate surrounding each European Council meeting as well."
"What we are supposed to get there is the nitty-gritty detail as well."
"President Prodi is right to say that the procedure needs improving, but we have a procedure to negotiate such improvements, the Malmström report in our committee for example."
"Mrs Malmström is already in dialogue with the Commission on that and, frankly, we should have waited for the outcome of that before changing procedure."
"The President of the Commission cannot unilaterally take existing agreements and tear them up."
"New procedures must be agreed by both institutions."
"Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, this has, I feel, been a useful debate which has served to make things clearer."
"A number of extremely clear messages have emerged which the Commission will take into account, for we have the same objectives and there is a harmonious alliance between Parliament and the Commission."
"There may have been times when our instruments were slightly out of tune, but we have worked extremely well together."
"I have several things to say on this point."
"I assure you that the Commission has been concentrating explicitly on cooperation with Parliament, and I feel, moreover, that a Commission President has never been present at so many plenary sessions or attended all the committee meetings and meetings of committee chairmen to which he is invited."
"Each Commissioner stands before the relevant Parliamentary committee on average seven times a year to discuss political issues relating to his or her responsibilities, to his or her portfolio; 80% of subjects are dealt with in plenary by the committee responsible; a record-breaking number of confidential documents has been sent to Parliament; each year, to date, we answer over 3 000 questions from Members of Parliament and dealt with 200 petitions referred to us by the Ombudsman."
"We are therefore genuinely making an enormous effort to respect our commitment to maintaining a responsible relationship with Parliament."
"Of course, there are problems and areas that need improvement, and it is precisely in order to remedy these that we have reformed our way of working."
"Today, I hear people saying, and I know what they mean, that we need more than the political programme; establishing the political programme was a step forwards but it is not enough, for it must go hand in hand with the legislative programme."
"We are finding it difficult to achieve this, and when we realised that this is what is required, we immediately took steps to establish the legislative programme, albeit with a slight delay."
"However, we are aware that the driving force of our relationship with Parliament is the political programme, for it is on the political programme that we must work together."
"People are saying we must not start in February and conclude in November and then let the relationship fall by the wayside."
"I fully agree with this sentiment."
"What I would ask, however, is that we be informed of dates for meetings with the committee chairmen a long time in advance; indeed, I assure you that on the few occasions when we were unable to meet, it was because we already had absolutely unbreakable commitments."
"However, if we establish the schedule together, I am sure we will be able to achieve our aims."
"Moving on from the subject of cooperation, I would now like to focus very briefly on the issue of the role of the Commission and of the forthcoming Convention, starting with something which may not appear to be a key point but which I consider to be extremely important, namely that we need to work alongside the Council as regards the Convention' s secretariat."
"It will be an extremely important time."
"Of course, the Convention will not take any decisions itself, but it is such an innovative way of working and the fact that it is going to work transparently before our entire continent, before the entire people of Europe, is so significant that it will ultimately acquire huge importance."
"I would like to make a further point in this regard as well, the view has been put forward on a number of different occasions that the Commission should be stronger."
"I, too, am of this opinion, but I would like to look at what we have achieved, although our achievements are sometimes understated and difficult to understand, so to speak."
"In my opinion, it is the results that count."
"The Convention did not just appear out of nowhere, it was not presented to us on a plate; the Convention was a working relationship between Parliament and the Commission immediately after Nice, at a time when both institutions were in the deepest despair."
"It is precisely this work, carried out together, which enabled us to rise again towards the goal which we had lost all hope of achieving."
"We must acknowledge the substantial help we received from the Belgian Presidency, which really took the project to heart, but it was the Parliament-Commission cooperation which won for us the chance - and I would stress, this is a chance which has never before been available in European history - to reform the institutions by means of a broad, open debate with no time pressure, so that all the European citizens can listen to us and understand what we are talking about."
"When the European citizens realise that this debate is the debate on the efficient running of the institutions, on unanimous voting or the different vetoes, the debate on the need to proceed with all speed in the interests of serving Europe itself, well, then the significance of this debate will be understood and, indeed, become crystal clear."
"Our problem was that the decisions were being taken in fora and by bodies whose significance was not understood."
"Well then, this is the strength of the Commission and the strength of Parliament - patience, and also never losing sight of our primary objectives."
"To Mr Swoboda, whose comments were extremely constructive, I would point out that, in terms of the debate we conducted on the basic text, our proposal dates from January 2001 - that is when we made every effort to ensure that the text could, slowly but surely, become the focal point of all our work."
"2001 has been a year in which we have redefined the boundaries of our work and outlined the strategy."
"Certainly, there is a great deal at stake, for our whole future, our entire future, hangs upon the Convention, but we have, at last, taken this debate to the appropriate forum where the citizens will be able to listen to us."
"Finally, on a lighter note, with regard to institutional reform, I would like to inform Mr Barón Crespo and the other four group chairmen that I replied to their letters on 5 December and that my response bears the reference number 850511."
"I therefore feel we need to reform the postal services, although whether those responsible for collecting the mail or those responsible for delivering it, I am not sure."
"In any case, for my part, I duly replied to the letter, as is my custom."
"The debate is closed."
"WTO meeting in Qatar"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the WTO meeting in Qatar."
"Honourable Members of Parliament, as you know, the fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation took place at Doha in Qatar one month ago."
"This meeting can be considered a success for the world community, and certainly for the European Union."
"It was not an easy task, for the European Union left for Doha with an ambitious, broad agenda."
"Some of you witnessed the progress of the negotiations in situ."
"As President-in-Office of the Council, I exchanged ideas on several occasions with MEPs who moreover - and that was very practical -had their meeting room immediately adjoining that of the presidency."
"I assume that everyone who was there undoubtedly sensed the great scepticism displayed initially by many WTO members with regard to the EU' s broad agenda."
"On 19 November, the General Affairs Council has been congratulated on the results obtained at Doha, and on the excellent work carried out by our negotiators, Commissioners Pascal Lamy and Franz Fischler, and their colleagues."
"It is thanks to this work, as well as the cohesion and solidarity shown by the Union through these negotiators, that they were able, in spite of the fact that the situation of the European Union within the WTO was not favourable at the start of the process, to get things back on an even keel and obtain much better results than we might have hoped for."
"The Union, which at all times remained a major player in the conference, was finally able to achieve the main objective it had set itself, of launching a new round of multilateral trade negotiations focusing on trade liberalisation, the strengthening of regulations and the acknowledgement of development needs."
"In fact, the development dimension is the main thread of what we now call the 'Doha development agenda' ."
"This is the name, in fact, that has been given to all of the texts adopted."
"The work programme adopted in view of the multilateral trade negotiations within the framework of the ministerial declaration includes a package of important implementation measures and takes up those unresolved implementation issues that aim more or less for a re-balancing or an amendment of existing agreements within the context of the negotiation agenda relating to single undertakings."
"In addition to this, all chapters in the agenda are focused on specific measures to assist developing countries, with regard, for example, to the access of their products to markets, to their special or differential treatment, technical assistance or capacity building."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot over-emphasise the importance of this fifth ministerial conference for the development dimension."
"It should take place before the end of 2003 and will be a key point in the negotiations."
"We will need, in fact, to make decisions with regard to further negotiations, notably with regard to investments and competition, issues that will have been studied during the first phase."
"It is obvious that this will be, for developing countries as well as for others, a very important time for assessment."
"Furthermore, the Union should be particularly pleased with the approval of the derogation with regard to the partnership agreement between the European Community and the ACP countries."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioners, the European Union has made a considerable effort in the field of access to medicines."
"It has managed to bring initially very diverse opinions closer together and has contributed greatly to the final text which was met by approval by all parties."
"Indeed, the statement about TRIPS and public health has given the developing countries the desired assurance that the TRIPS Agreement is indeed offering flexibility, even without amending that Agreement."
"Even NGOs have received the Agreement favourably."
"As for further legislation, an important step has been made in order to develop the environmental dimension of world trade."
"The European Union managed to ensure that negotiations on the environment start without delay, and that the link between the WTO rules and the trade rules of the multi-lateral environment agreements which form part of them becomes more transparent."
"This is a very important breakthrough."
"Furthermore, the negotiation agenda offers scope for expanding the environmental themes during the Fifth Ministerial Conference."
"However, as is always the case in negotiations, not everything went according to plan, of course."
"For example, it appeared impossible, despite efforts, to alter the developing countries' resistance to the introduction of basic labour standards in the trade negotiations."
"It appeared impossible to make a reference in the ministerial statement to the development of a permanent forum between the ILO and other international organisations, including the WTO."
"However, the European Union did manage to have the phrase scrapped which would have restricted the dialogue about basic labour standards to the ILO, and that enables us to continue our quest for a permanent forum."
"Moreover, at the suggestion of the presidency, a statement was added in the shape of this phrase to the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 14 November in Doha, Qatar, in which the Council and the Commission confirm this objective."
"The principle of future negotiations was also laid down for the so-called Singapore themes which form part of the priorities of European industry and which concern investments, competition, trade facilitation and transparency regarding government contracts."
"These will be initiated following the Fifth Ministerial Conference on the basis of explicit consensus with regard to its modalities."
"There is also reason for satisfaction in the field of agriculture."
"The negotiations will aim to further improve market access and dismantle the different types of trade-distorting aid."
"In addition to the pure trade aspects, serious consideration will also be given to non-trade concerns."
"Some of you have followed the export subsidies saga from very close range."
"You know the outcome, but let me assure you that it was nevertheless a difficult journey, and that for a long time it looked like the Commissioners would not succeed in reaching a sound agreement."
"But they did anyway, and they deserve all our congratulations on that score."
"(FR) Finally, a last word on transparency."
"The organisation of internal works at Doha was exemplary."
"The alternation between plenary sessions, on the one hand, and issue groups, on the other, ensured the necessary combination of transparency and efficiency."
"During the plenary sessions, the delegations had the opportunity to express their opinions and to listen to the positions of others, as well as listening to the assessments, I quote, of the President' s friends."
"These individuals chaired the issue groups, whose objective was to facilitate bilateral and multilateral discussions between WTO members, to harmonise positions and to draw up written agreements."
"It should be noted that none of the President' s friends were citizens of the European Union or the United States, and that these two regions were not represented at the time further balances in the text were drawn up."
"I am underlining this because, all too often, there is the tendency to believe that everything that happens at the WTO is a result of constant collusion between the United States and the European Union, and that other countries do not have a say, so this is proof that this is not the case."
"Therefore, our respective representatives read the texts at the same time as all the other delegations."
"Several delegations from developing countries showed their appreciation and satisfaction with the working method used during their closing speeches."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that today we can safely say that we have put the failure of Seattle firmly behind us."
"The credibility of the WTO has been restored."
"Furthermore, in the current international context, the success of the conference is a positive sign of international solidarity and confidence in the positive development of the world economy."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission feels that the ministerial meeting in Doha ended in success - success in terms of the objectives that had been defined for the Union, success also in terms of the interests pursued by the developing countries and success, lastly, in terms of the needs of the global economy and the multilateral trade system."
"We came back from Doha with a WTO that was both stronger and more balanced, which was the key objective of the mandate that the Council and your Parliament had given to the negotiators."
"So the results very largely lived up to many of the concerns you had expressed in this Chamber, in particular in your two resolutions of 25 October."
"I will try, in a few words, to show you how they lived up to these concerns, in the light of the Union' s three key objectives: integration of the developing countries, better governance of globalisation and better access to the market for all."
"Let us begin with the first objective, integrating the developing countries in the global economy."
"That objective is fully and constantly present in every part of the negotiating programme we adopted in Doha."
"From the point of view of development policy, we have made progress on the four aspects of trade policy that are crucial to development - better access for the developing countries to our markets, better domestic policies, in particular with regard to the investment, competition and public procurement aspects of our work programme; a stronger role for the developing countries in the multilateral negotiation process and, lastly, boosting these countries' capacity to derive benefit from the liberalisation of trade."
"One point I want to emphasise is the negotiation process."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council just pointed out - and I agree with her 100% - the working method in Doha was more transparent, which did indeed enable the developing countries, some of whom, as you may remember, had left Seattle frustrated, others furious, to play their full part in the decision-making mechanisms."
"That is an important new development."
"As for technical assistance for the developing countries, the Commission, together with the Council and, at the appropriate time, Parliament, will have to rethink the way the Union both when it is acting as such and when it is acting through the Member States, is handling the technical assistance programmes for the developing countries in the field of trade."
"Turning to a subject close your hearts, namely the special situation of the least-developed countries, let us remember what was achieved at the third United Nations conference for the least-developed countries in Brussels, which has now been incorporated in the WTO' s work programme."
"Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck referred to the declaration on intellectual property rights and health, which, I believe, is fairly typical of what we have achieved, given that the Union made the rather difficult but, in the end, positive decision to try to strike a balance between the United States' concerns on the one side and the concerns of third countries on the other."
"That is a specific case in which we acted as intermediaries and basically each side saw the other' s point of view, which finally proved the right approach to take."
"The EU' s second goal is to improve the governance of globalisation."
"You know what the Commission' s views are on this."
"Today we face a deficit of multilateral rules, which calls into question the equality between economic players, the transparency of transactions and the preservation of certain social values. This has given rise to fear or concern in some quarters."
"Markets have become globalised more rapidly than institutions and regulatory instruments."
"This is true in the economic field as in the social and environmental field."
"As I said, you know our views in this area; we need to establish coherence between all the aspects of the multilateral system and we need more constant, clear and definite relations between its various pillars."
"The WTO is one of those pillars."
"It is not the only one and it cannot support the entire weight of this coherence by itself."
"In this regard and, once again, in line with our mandate, Doha represents a considerable step forward."
"In terms of regulating the markets, global rules on investment, on competition, on public procurement and on trade facilitation now form part of the work programme."
"Regarding the environment, Doha will help establish greater international coherence by providing for negotiations to clarify the status of the multilateral agreements on the environment in the context of the WTO."
"As you know, the Union had to struggle hard to obtain this decision."
"I believe it was right to do so because this is a first step towards establishing greater coherence between the various pillars of international governance, in this case between the trade and environment pillars."
"In the event of inconsistency or potential conflict, we did not want this pillar to continue depending entirely on the WTO instrument for settling disputes, whatever the virtues of that instrument."
"With regard to one aspect of the international governance issues, we did not hide our disappointment at the outcome of the negotiations, although we accepted it."
"I am referring to the social issues."
"We did not achieve general agreement on forging the kind of clear link we had hoped to see between the International Labour Organisation and other organisations, including the WTO."
"We regret that."
"The developing countries were politically opposed to this idea and we could not overcome their opposition."
"That is not a reason for giving up."
"On the contrary, I believe we have to draw on every available multilateral means of putting this idea forward, because it represents the Union' s view and formed part of our mandate, especially as regards strengthening the multilateral aspect of the World Trade Organisation."
"Having failed to succeed in relation to this multilateral aspect, we will be developing the other aspects of Community policy, as we have now begun to do, in particular the bilateral and the unilateral parts."
"From that point of view, the agreement we reached yesterday in the Council, by a qualified majority, on renewing the system of generalised preferences - an agreement that quite considerably strengthens the social conditions on which trade preferences depend - is good news."
"It shows all those who believe this point is important that if we do not manage to make progress on every front, or at least on the unilateral front, this agreement on the part of the Council, with the assent of your Parliament, which had supported and upheld this position, and with the agreement of the Economic and Social Committee, marked a major step forward yesterday."
"On the question of the way the WTO operates, your Parliament had expressed certain concerns."
"Here we have one piece of good news, namely that Doha was indeed more open and that thanks to the rather clever variable system of plenary meetings, restricted meetings and regional participation, the African continent, for instance, was able to play a very good part in the decision-making."
"The not so good news is that for the time being no decision has been reached during this negotiating round on reforming the World Trade Organisation itself."
"To tell the truth, nobody was in favour of this reform, given the inevitable risk of deadlock."
"I think the question has simply been postponed and that it will come up again before the round we launched in Doha is concluded."
"On the specific question of relations with the national parliaments or your Parliament, the proposal to incorporate a reference to closer association between Member State parliaments was not accepted."
"This was because of pressure by a number of developing countries that were not really in favour of the idea and because of the American position, which could be described as reluctant, to say the least."
"In any case, there were not enough representatives of the American parliamentary authorities to deal with this question seriously."
"So that is where we stand at the moment."
"In fact, the Commission and Parliament have already been working in the spirit of transparency, information and consultation that we had hoped to promote within the WTO."
"I believe we are doing so to the satisfaction of those of you who are interested in these matters and I fully intend to continue along these lines."
"Our final objective is the pursuit of liberalisation of trade as such: to liberate trade in goods, services and investments, to contribute to global growth and, therefore, to reducing poverty, provided we make progress with the rules on the fair distribution of trade benefits."
"In this respect, the results are entirely in line with what we had hoped."
"In regard to abolishing customs duties on goods, for instance, we are clearly targeting tariff levels."
"This applies to the liberalisation of services - the timetable has been decided and the negotiations should open up considerable opportunities to EU companies."
"As you know, and those of you who were in Doha made sure of this, your concerns about consumer protection, health, education, public service and cultural diversity were taken into consideration."
"The negotiating programme adopted in Doha certainly does not commit us to go beyond the limits that were set both by the Council and by Parliament in this area."
"My final point concerns agriculture."
"I will now hand over to Franz Fischler who can tell you a little more about this subject."
"Here too, however, I believe we achieved our main objective, which was to ensure that the Union remained capable of taking forward the common agricultural policy at a rate that is and will be decided by the EU institutions."
"To conclude, in my capacity as, shall we say, principal negotiator, let me tell you that one of the keys to success in this business was our work with the Belgian Presidency and, via the Belgian Presidency, with the Member States, whose presence is not always entirely convenient in such circumstances, and with those of you who were there at the meeting."
"I have said it in public. I think it is perfectly acceptable for me to say it to you in a definitive manner."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in order to convey a realistic impression of what the Doha agreement means for agriculture, I would like to very briefly touch upon the individual points of the Doha declaration."
"The first part of the declaration concerns the general objective of agricultural negotiations within the framework of the WTO, that is to say the creation of a fair and market-oriented trading system."
"At the same time it also acknowledges the work that has been done since the beginning of 2000 under the 'Article 20 negotiations' ."
"The next section deals with the traditional three pillars of trade: market access, exports, and competition and domestic support measures."
"In the case of market access, the text settled on was ""comprehensive negotiations aimed at substantial improvements in market access""."
"This reflects the conclusions of the Agriculture Council on 27 September 1999, in which the importance of further liberalisation of agricultural trade as a contribution towards sustainable economic growth was recognised."
"The term 'comprehensive negotiations' means that all agricultural products can be covered by the negotiations, and also that all issues should be covered."
"In this connection we also made it clear that geographical information should also be included here."
"With regard to export subsidies, the declaration talks about reductions in all forms of export subsidies, in other words exactly what this House called for in its resolution in October."
"It is also stated that the negotiations should aim to phase out all forms of export subsidies completely."
"However, the text also clearly indicates that none of the statements on the three pillars should anticipate the outcome of the negotiations."
"There is therefore at present no commitment to negotiate the total elimination of export subsidies during this round."
"However, we also know that there is a broad coalition against continuing export subsidies."
"The Cairns Group, the USA and the 77 Group of developing countries all spoke out against continuing export subsidies."
"As regards domestic support, the text refers to substantial reductions in competition-distorting domestic support."
"This is also in line with your own resolution, which called for the rejection of competition-distorting measures, and it corresponds to our own mandate, which commits us to negotiate on domestic support while retaining the concept of the blue box and green box."
"We consciously chose the word 'concept' to indicate that we are perfectly willing to negotiate on the details of the blue box and the green box."
"The extent of distortion of competition will be a key element of all discussions relating to domestic support."
"Another important point is the special and differential treatment of the developing countries."
"I know that one of your own priorities is to integrate the developing countries in international trade."
"The wording of the Doha declaration is in accordance with this objective and it also matches the Council mandate of 1999."
"Lastly, the text deals with non-trade concerns."
"The proposals that the WTO Member States put forward in Geneva in this area are specifically recognised."
"As you know, the European Union too presented a raft of proposals on the most important non-trade concerns, such as the environment, the development of rural regions, food security, consumer affairs, labelling and animal protection."
"By specifically recognising non-trade concerns, the Doha declaration allows us to pursue these objectives further in forthcoming negotiations."
"The last section contains the timetable for agreeing on methodology, 31 March 2003, and the deadlines for presenting the comprehensive drafts."
"This is to take place before the next WTO ministerial conference, so that agreement on agriculture can be reached at the same time as the overall package, by 1 January 2005."
"Apart from the purely agricultural part of the text, I would also like to point out that the section on the TRIPS Agreement also deals with the issue of geographical information."
"This will enable us to pursue our objectives in the negotiations on geographical information and in the agricultural negotiations, and also in the TRIPS negotiations."
"Finally, in parallel to the decision on the start of the Doha development round, agreement was also reach on the ACP waiver, which allows us to conclude the solution negotiated with the USA and Ecuador to bring an end to the banana war."
"This means that the proposal the Commission has already put forward can be accepted, as soon as you here in the European Parliament have adopted your position on this, which I hope will happen in the course of this week."
"I would like to conclude with the comment that the satisfactory outcome of the Doha Conference does not necessarily mean that the forthcoming agricultural negotiations will now be straightforward."
"The objectives of the other major WTO members are in some cases very different indeed from our own, but we will do our utmost to secure the European agricultural model and at the same time to negotiate a fair and more market-oriented trading system for agricultural products."
"Things will very much depend on our continuing success in achieving a common approach on the part of the Member States, and your support will assist us in this respect."
"Another thing that will help us is continuation of the excellent cooperation that we have had with the Council and also within the Commission on this issue."
"We are going to have to interrupt this debate."
"I propose to try to finish the list of political group speakers and then break."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Members of the Commission, the launch of the new, comprehensive, three-year round of talks at the Doha Summit is a very positive signal for both the World Trade Organisation and the present world economic situation."
"The Doha development programme, which includes the liberalisation of trade as well as elements of new rules, stressed the commitment of the developed countries to capacity building in respect of the less developed countries and to helping them implement already existing WTO rules."
"I am firmly of the opinion that the small but boisterous anti-globalisation groups have now had a clear response from the less developed countries represented at Doha."
"We want to be involved in liberalising world trade and clarifying its rules, as that is also in the interest of the less developed countries."
"Every country had the opportunity to torpedo any collective decision - nobody did so, however."
"The presence of China and Taiwan at the WTO was also a significant milestone."
"We must hope that Russia will be able to clarify its own internal structures in such a way as to allow her also to take part."
"The Union' s own goals at Doha at least were successfully achieved."
"Commissioners Lamy and Fischler deserve our thanks for succeeding in seeing through to the end some tough negotiations that lasted a good number of days."
"Furthermore, the Council' s internal cohesion remained firm the whole time, something that was obviously necessary for the Union to be able to approve the outcome of the talks."
"In addition to being involved in the negotiations process itself, Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, together with Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck also, kept us Members of Parliament, who were following the events, well aware the whole time of where things were going."
"Sustainable development and the inclusion of environmental considerations in trade policy decisions were agreed to be an all-embracing objective in future talks, something that is certainly of crucial importance to us, the countries in the Union."
"As talks on the trade in agricultural products are also to be conducted in accordance with a comprehensive agenda but without any predetermined conclusion having been reached concerning forms of subsidy and timetables, this difficult matter, too, can now be negotiated peaceably whilst the Union' s common agricultural policy is being reformed."
"Our parliamentary group, which held talks with several delegations that were present at Doha, thought it regrettable that the US Congress did not send their representatives there."
"As we continue our efforts to develop WTO transparency and parliamentary monitoring of ministerial conferences, the presence of the US Congress is essential."
"It is also realistic to state that we will only be able to move forward in this matter with the approval of governments."
"Hopefully, Germany, as we unofficially heard at Doha, will before very long take the matter up formally in the WTO bodies."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, the WTO meeting in Qatar was a landmark achievement, especially for all those who realise that globalisation is one of the twenty-first century' s greatest challenges and that it is a challenge to bring it under democratic and political control."
"In the view of my group, globalisation desperately needs worldwide rules and global institutions."
"This means that globalisation can also be at the service of people, and not the other way round."
"As Commissioner Lamy said, Seattle two years ago failed on all kinds of fronts."
"It was not transparent, the groups were imbalanced and participation was not well organised."
"There was also a great deal of fear that, due to this failure, a number of matters which affect all of us greatly, including development, the right to adopt one' s own domestic policy, workers' rights, and the environment, would suffer badly as a result."
"It is actually a real achievement for us to have witnessed true change in Qatar after those two years."
"It constitutes a first step towards a new WTO, in a fight to equip globalisation with rules which are at the service of human values."
"My group is therefore delighted with the outcome of this Fourth Ministerial Conference."
"Not because we are pleased with all the aspects, far from it."
"We shall continue to apply pressure and a whole host of things are still missing, but in essence, we made a significant step forward."
"This fresh step is certainly also of importance in the removal of inequalities between North and South."
"This is one of the most important things in the globalisation phenomenon as a whole."
"It is certainly striking to note what we have achieved on the WTO agenda, both in the way in which all kinds of developing countries took part jointly in the debate in a well-organised manner, and with regard to the agenda itself."
"We wanted a development round, and at least we can now say that there is a development agenda."
"And needless to say, it will be specific results which will soon be at issue."
"In this respect, the TRIPS account and public health care are of huge importance."
"It has been recognised that when it really matters, public health care and the need for the same sometimes transcend intellectual property rights, and that allowance is made for this within intellectual property rules."
"It is clear that this requires further elucidation, but what is important is what happened there at political level."
"The recognition as such will persuade many to join a modern and new worldwide WTO."
"Needless to say, the agreements involving the waiver for the Cotonou Agreement of the ACP and EU countries are of crucial importance, for this has helped us bring about an enormous breakthrough in our relations with the ACP countries, a breakthrough which we might not have had otherwise."
"In the field of environment and trade, we managed to put a number of items on the agenda of which we feared right up to the last minute that they would not make it."
"This is an enormous leap forward, a taboo has been shattered. It should not become green protectionism, but it is of the utmost importance for us that we have managed to bring it about."
"According to our group, it is a sad state of affairs that we have not actually made any real headway on the score of democracy and transparency, as already stated by Commissioner Lamy too, and on the score of workers' rights."
"We may have prevented certain things from reverting back to the old ways, but we have a desperate need for more success in this area."
"Allow me to conclude by saying that our group has greatly valued cooperation with Commissioners Lamy and Fischler, as well as the President-in-Office, and that the Commissioner' s statement that this House must ultimately approve the Doha results, places us in a fully-fledged, grown-up democracy and a fully-fledged democratic role."
"We greatly appreciate this, and we rely on a very fruitful campaign in the years to come."
"On behalf of the Liberal Group, I would also like to extend our thanks and congratulations to the Council and Commission, especially to Commissioner Lamy."
"In our view, without the effective work of the Commissioner and the Council, in cooperation with Parliament, the new round would never have been proposed, let alone launched, and for that we are grateful."
"It seems to us that the summit at Doha represented the coming together of two themes or two trends within the WTO."
"The first theme is the first concerted attempt to accommodate the needs and legitimate complaints of developing countries."
"We have referred already to the TRIPS Agreement, the text on implementation, US movement on anti-dumping, a chink of light in the European position on agriculture - these to us are very significant developments."
"The second theme or trend is that the talks extended well beyond traditional market access preoccupations and moved towards the development of new rules, competition, investment and, above all, the environment."
"That again seems to us to be a very welcome development and we are very pleased to see that a balance seems to have been struck - a sensible and workable balance between the needs of developing countries and the need to develop new rules within the World Trade Organisation."
"Some have suggested - I think my Green friends and other critics of the WTO - that somehow these two things are incompatible with each other and that developing new rules on the WTO is anathema to the interests of the developing countries."
"We found it particularly bizarre that Green Members of this House and Green campaigners rejected talks on the environment within the WTO, in the name of the developing countries."
"To us, there is no trade-off between sustainable multilateral environmental disciplines and multilateral attempts at poverty alleviation."
"Now is the time for delivery."
"Some of the news over the last few days is a little mixed, particularly from the United States, over the concessions which were extracted from the Administration in the fast-track debate and the debate on trade and steel in Washington."
"We must keep the pressure up to make sure that the momentum that was established in Doha is maintained in the years ahead and we will certainly strive to do so."
"Mr President, it is no secret that the Green/EFA Group does not share the majority view of Parliament over the outcome of the Doha meeting."
"For us, with a few exceptions, it was not a success."
"It was an unedifying example of the richer countries bullying the poorer ones and has prompted many to assert that the so-called victory in Doha was a failure for democracy."
"While it is certainly true the developing countries asserted themselves in a much stronger way than ever before - and that is to be commended - it is also true that the outcome from Doha falls far short of the development round which was promised us."
"That is not only the view of the Green/EFA Group, but also of the vast majority of NGOs from both north and south, and of many of the southern representatives there as well."
"Let me remind you of some of the interventions in the Doha plenary debate."
"The Indian Minister of Commerce, Mr Murasoli Muran, said that the only conclusion that could be drawn is that developing countries have little say in the agenda-setting of the WTO; it appears that the whole process was a mere formality and we are being coerced against our will."
"Let me remind you of what Jamaica said."
"Ambassador Mr Randsford Smith said that we regret that the draft texts presented to this ministerial conference, as at the outcome of the Geneva preparatory process, do not sufficiently reflect or capture the position and proposals of developing countries."
"I could give you many more similar quotations."
"Let us have a look in a bit more detail at what they really mean."
"There was only a very brief acknowledgement of the need to review implementation issues: that was a key agenda issue for the developing countries going into Doha."
"The language on the phasing out of agricultural exports subsidies has been substantially watered down, due to EU objections."
"As a result, farmers in the south will continue to have their livelihoods devastated."
"As Tanzania's Trade Minister, Mr Iddi Simba, said, the wrong policy on agriculture might lose elections in France, but it loses lives in Africa."
"There is no commitment to an early phase-out of textiles and garment quotas because of strong resistance from the United States."
"Demands for development linked to the promotion of food security, which is being promoted by many developing countries, were completely ignored."
"Commissioner Lamy, I do not expect you to agree with this analysis, but at the very least you should acknowledge the very real anger and frustration of the developing countries throughout the conference and pledge that in the negotiations that are now beginning their interests will genuinely be at the forefront of our priorities."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, good work was done in Doha."
"I believe we have three good reasons to appreciate the results."
"The first is the real involvement of the southern countries and the evidence that multilateralism is effectively beginning to happen."
"Before Doha we did not have a pre-negotiated agenda; after Doha we have to deal with a whole range of claims put forward by the southern countries."
"As a result, the WTO, still fragile but better recognised, is therefore strengthened."
"Of course this is not yet the kind of democratisation the NGOs and European parliamentarians had hoped to see, but there has clearly been progress and Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck is right to emphasise the transparency and improved method seen in Doha."
"Unlike Caroline Lucas, I was not aware of general anger or frustration; on the contrary, I noted a sense of relief all round because this method enabled us to finally reach some degree of consensus."
"Let me add, and I was surprised that this was not mentioned in the opening statements, that we are committed to negotiating the reform of the instrument for settling disputes."
"Secondly, a window has been opened for examining the coherence between social questions and trade rules."
"Liberalisation is indeed continuing, in particular in order to respond to the southern countries' interests with regard to market access."
"Thanks to the European Union, however, and here I believe we can thank Pascal Lamy for his firm stance, we have the beginnings of a broad agenda - the environment, investment and competition can be negotiated on the basis of an explicit consensus."
"In substance, this is still not much and we can understand why some of the NGOs wanted a more ambitious agenda, one that included the social aspect in particular."
"If we are to achieve that, however, they and we will have to overcome some major inconsistencies."
"Indeed we must not conceal the inconsistencies between different interests and claim to always speak in the name of the south."
"Differences must be expressed if they are effectively to be overcome and that is how we managed to make progress on the question of medicines, when the north-south conjunction proved effective."
"Similarly, we can make progress on the social aspect only if we carefully reflect on how to help strengthen international trade unionism."
"Thirdly, for the first time, as much importance was attached to implementation as to the new subjects introduced."
"Here again, I did not interpret the results in the same way as Caroline Lucas."
"We made progress on the method and thanks to India we had a system not of prior evaluation but of ongoing evaluation during the negotiations: textiles, agriculture, anti-dumping measures, subsidies and even intellectual property were negotiated - with the possibility of renegotiation."
"To conclude, we still have to make great efforts for the future to ensure that the process runs smoothly and in the right directions and here I have two points to make."
"The first is that there is a strong risk that the Union' s trade policy will be handicapped by the absence of a common policy."
"We have a certain lack of cohesion here and it is up to us to clarify our agricultural and industrial social model."
"My second point is that the social question is emblematic."
"There is no question of giving up and adhering to the ILO."
"The European Union must demand the establishment of multilateral social dimensions for development and solidarity."
"So we still have a lot of work to do on this subject, but this should not frighten us."
"Mr President, the current World Trade negotiations are important to the future development of the EU, particularly in the context of enlargement."
"I am satisfied that our negotiators understand the extent of this challenge and - I hope - draw on the benefit of hindsight resulting from our experiences with the current regime."
"From an agricultural perspective, we must not allow the United States to dictate agricultural policy."
"On the last occasion they insisted on dismantling agricultural support and then proceeded to provide support for United States farmers at a level three times greater than that received by European farmers."
"I am very pleased that in the preparatory talks we seem to have reached a satisfactory agreement on export refunds."
"From an Irish perspective, export refunds are crucial because of our dependence on exports to third countries."
"Equally we need to take a strong stand on food imports from outside the EU."
"We are investing heavily in the implementation of food safety measures and have banned the use of growth promoters."
"Yet EU farmers are expected to compete with imports from countries where those products are used."
"Equally, in relation to sheepmeat, important to European, and particularly Irish, farmers - badly managed arrangements with New Zealand mean there are no controls to prevent a deliberate New Zealand policy to flood the EU market at peak production periods."
"Mr President, I consider Doha a success, but I did think before Doha and I still feel now that the European position of the strategy of expanding the agenda was a serious mistake."
"Indeed, overloading the WTO now and in the future with too many expectations for too many sectors will jeopardise the achievement of the organisation' s single, fundamental objective: market access, revitalising the stagnant situation of international trade, in the interests of both rich and poor countries."
"Lastly, Commissioner, with regard to agriculture - let us not forget, before we start to feel too pleased with ourselves, that, ultimately, Europe' s negotiating position, as Mr Fischer explained, was actually an attempt to defend the indefensible, to defend the common agricultural policy."
"We concern ourselves with working standards in Africa, Asia and South America, and yet, at Doha, we defended the wealthy French peasant farmers against the poor peasant farmers of South-East Asia, Africa and Latin America."
"This is the bottom line."
"Therefore, the agenda should not be expanded. Let us concern ourselves rather with the opening up of the markets, especially our rich agricultural and textiles markets."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the delegation for relations with the South Caucasus, I would like to inform you that a member of the Commission's diplomatic staff has been the victim of an insidious murder in Georgia."
"I wish to ask the President, on behalf of the European Parliament, to send a communication to President Shevardnaze calling upon him not only to do everything in his power to solve this crime, but also to make sure at long last that constitutional means are used to ensure that people who work in Georgia and for Georgia are guaranteed appropriate protection, so that this essential work can be done effectively."
"I regard this incident as a very serious one."
"We want to do everything to help the South Caucasus, but the South Caucasus itself must also make efforts to protect people entrusted to its care."
"We have taken note of your request, Mrs Schleicher, and I am sure it will be accepted."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Vote"
"Does the Commission wish to take the floor?"
"Mr President, it was agreed with the Commission that before the final vote on the legislative resolution the Commission would tell us to what extent it is willing to accept our amendments."
"Commemoration of the tragedy in the United States on 11 September 2001"
"Ladies and gentlemen, at the request of a number of Members we have decided very briefly to commemorate the tragic events that occurred three months ago."
"With your agreement, I will therefore read out a message."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three months ago today, at 8.46 a.m. New York time, the entire world was shaken by the horrific attacks that struck Manhattan and Washington."
"At this moment, when I would ask you to reflect and remember, my thoughts, our thoughts, go first of all to the thousands of victims and their families, to the emergency services, to the military and civilian employees whose lives were suddenly shattered."
"They also go to the American people, who, since these events, have been living in terrible fear of further attacks."
"The European Union is playing its full part in the efforts we have made in solidarity with the United States to combat international terrorism."
"The same is true of our commitment to finding urgent solutions to the conflicts that threaten world peace, especially in the Middle East."
"Only if we show the necessary resolve and cohesion can we prevent such tragedies ever happening again."
"My thoughts are with the victims of all acts of terrorism and war and I ask you to observe a minute' s silence."
"(The House rose and observed a minute' s silence)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 12 noon and resumed at 12.35 p.m.)"
"Vote (continuation)"
"Mr President, one word of explanation."
"This report now has a series of agreed amendments which we believe will be carried."
"There is one unusual procedure - the House has voted already on the criteria for the site of the European Food Safety Authority."
"The Council was not prepared to admit that as a part of the report."
"We, however, believe that it was necessary to state what the criteria should be and to insist upon that."
"The best way we can do that without going to conciliation is to vote it as a legislative resolution, binding therefore only on Parliament."
"We hope that the President of Parliament will convey that information and our view on the matter to the Laeken Summit in two days' time."
"Would the Commission now like to tell us its position with regard to the amendments?"
"- (FR) Some 30 000 farms in the European Union cultivate grass and pulse seeds, the main species involved in this common organisation of the market."
"This is, therefore, most important to employment, producers' incomes, the socio-economic balance of many regions, biodiversity and security of supply."
"On the one hand, however, the market prices received by the producers have fluctuated markedly in the last few years, while, on the other, the European Union still has a shortfall of about 15 000 tonnes."
"We should, therefore, welcome the fact that aid for seeds will be maintained at the current level, knowing that this is necessary to maintain the balance between production and the market."
"Under these circumstances, I do not think there is any need to introduce a budgetary stabiliser, since the market has shown that it is capable of regulating itself, all the more so as the Commission proposal on this stabilisation mechanism is general and vague."
"Lastly, I also find it inappropriate to model it on the mechanism set up for rice seed, which can be adjusted to the food consumption market."
"Finally, and above all, it would be unwise to share a guaranteed maximum quantity amongst the Member States, given that these seed producers often have branches in several countries."
"That is the tenor of the amendments I tabled in committee, where they were adopted unanimously."
"I am happy to note that the European Parliament proved equally wise in plenary."
"Cunha report (A5-0425/2001)"
". (NL) The fisheries agreements which the EU concludes with developing countries are bad for the environment and bad for those countries."
"The fact that EU fishermen ostensibly feel forced to move their activities from EU waters to elsewhere indicates that the fish population in EU waters has apparently decreased by these activities, so much so that the yield is now no longer sufficient."
"This environmental problem must be tackled at source, namely by reducing the fleet capacity, not by overfishing elsewhere now."
"In addition, the agreements are bad for the local economy, since modern EU ships rob local fishermen of their catches."
"It is absurd that as part of the agreement, the EU should pay money to the governments of those countries in order to help the fishermen to find other jobs."
"The amendments which the Committee on Fisheries and the ELDR have tabled to the Commission proposal are an improvement on the text of the agreement."
"D66 has therefore supported these amendments."
"Since we are opposed to the agreement as such for the above reasons, we have voted against the legislative resolution."
"Lage report (A5-0402/2001) and Cunha report (A5-0425/2001)"
"We abstained on the reports on the fisheries agreements with Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde because although they provide these states with a certain amount of revenue, the large-scale fishing by European countries merely formalises the plundering of Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde' s natural resources."
"The only reason we voted for Amendment No 7 to the Lage report and Amendment No 5 to the Cunha report is because at least they have the merit of formally specifying the amount of financial compensation, without making any advance judgment on the question of whether this sum really makes up for the loss of this natural resource."
"Gargani report (A5-0428/2001)"
". At the outset I wish to record my thanks to the rapporteur Mr Gargani for his report on the European Capital of Culture 2005."
"I fully support this report as I represent the City of Cork in the EP."
"Cork has a long and proud tradition as the second city in Ireland and has been a centre of learning, industry, trade and culture for over 800 years."
"As a major seaport it has also been open to many outside influences which have helped to evolve many new links and contacts."
"The history of Ireland could be written in Cork, for it was affected in a similar way to all of Ireland."
"Whether it relates to conquest and colonisation, the killing of the native Gaelic language and traditions, famine and emigration, Cork has been at the centre of all these tremendous changes."
"Today Cork is a well developed modern city, looking to future technologies and opportunities for development."
"However, despite this forward vision, it has never forgotten or neglected its past, indeed it treasures and protects its history and culture, in the ballet, the Opera House, the Everyman Theatre, Triskel Arts Centre, National Sculpture Factory, Crawford Art Gallery, Crawford College of Art and Design, University College Cork, Cork Institute of Technology, the School of Music, the College of Commerce, to mention just a few."
"From its past citizens in the fields of music, dance, the arts and literature it takes pride in the new generation of activists in these areas."
"We in Cork are proud of our hospitality and welcome to all and we face any new challenge presented to us with a confidence in the secure knowledge of past experience."
"In 2005, as the European Capital of Culture, Cork will show all that is great in our past but also will provide inspiration for the future."
"I take this opportunity to extend to all a welcome to Cork, now and for 2005."
"I know you will be touched by its beauty, humour, vitality and calm."
"Once you have been to Cork you will never wish to leave."
"Graefe zu Baringdorf report (A5-0421/2001)"
"Mr President, this report is on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs and therefore on what animals eat, and animals include fish."
"As you know, Mr President, I am famous among fish, particularly pensioner fish, and I therefore could not fail to ask them, especially the pensioner fish of Morocco, what they think of this directive on the contents of feedingstuffs."
"I am not joking, Mr President, I am only telling you in my customary manner why I voted for the motion."
"Breaking their usual silence, these fish told me that they support this document but that they would like me to tell Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, when he comes to amend this directive again, to ensure that there is a choice of feedingstuffs on the menu as well, so that animals do not always have to eat the same dishes."
"They get tired of having soup for lunch every day as well!"
"Whitehead report (A5-0416/2001)"
"Mr President, I would like to explain why I voted for the document on the European Food Authority."
"This second subject is a subject which takes us to the kitchen as well, Mr President - nothing to do with me."
"Maybe it is because it is lunch time that the next topic is also food-related."
"I voted for the motion because, clearly, we have to have good food on our tables."
"However, I feel that it would be a good idea for inspections to be carried out on these directives on the monitoring of foodstuffs too."
"I regret to say that our Member States do not want inspections, and so I call for the food authority to be given the power, in the future, to genuinely carry out unannounced inspections on public canteens, school canteens, company canteens and canteens in the institutions where elderly people live when they are no longer able to live with their families."
"Food is extremely important!"
"Mr President, I should like to say very briefly that it was a great pleasure for me to vote for the amendments to the common position on food safety, for which Mr Whitehead was rapporteur."
"I wanted to express gratitude for his major efforts, for thanks to his work, we have managed to reach clear and sound agreements across the political divide, and that is why we are now where we are."
"Today, we only adopted those amendments which met with complete approval by the Commission."
"In addition, agreements have already been concluded with the Council."
"This means that the Food Authority can become operational in 2002, which suggests that we are completely on schedule."
"In my view, we can safely say that this is thanks to effective cooperation, across all groups of this House."
"We have created a framework which should work."
"If the right people are now also deployed in the right places, and the Authority is accorded a location which will give it the opportunity of establishing external contacts easily, then I believe that all conditions are in place to turn this Food Authority into a success."
"It is now down to the Authority itself, and I wish it every success."
"It could be useful to the consumer to set up a European Food Authority to see to food safety at Union level."
"We agree with the principle."
"Yet we would point out that unlike similar authorities in other countries, especially the United States, the European Food Authority will only have an advisory role and no power."
"What value can its recommendations have under these circumstances?"
"I ask this, in particular, because a series of recent food scandals, from mad cow disease to dioxin in chickens, has shown that food safety and the quest for profit are a contradiction in terms."
"This means that the European Food Authority is liable to be a purely decorative body."
". (PT) Whilst some advances in establishing the European Food Authority are positive, I still maintain that it cannot act as a panacea for solving food safety problems or as a smoke screen for public opinion."
"It is important to ensure that there is an Authority which guarantees risk evaluation for the purposes of food safety, enshrined in solid scientific opinion, but it cannot free from responsibility or replace the Commission in terms of risk management of the Community food policy or the competent authorities of each Member State."
"The underlying principle of any legislation on food is the protection of human health, and for this very reason, it is vital to introduce the precautionary principle in risk management when scientific data is insufficient or inconclusive."
"However, it is questionable whether such a structure that is so cumbersome from the administrative and budgetary standpoint is necessary, but the need to ensure that one representative from each Member State takes part in the Administration should be highlighted."
"In any case, it is worth emphasising once again that the food issue can only be resolved by means of a thorough change in the CAP and a genuine food policy that is not based on the interests of the agro-industrial multinationals or the liberalisation of agricultural trade."
"I voted in favour of this report."
"We have been trying for years to restore consumer confidence and the European Food Authority is one way of doing so."
"There is no such thing as zero risk and we know what consequences a bacteriological problem (not linked only to terrorism) can have for a large number of our citizens."
"Safety must therefore lie at the heart of the proposed system."
"Yet we must not give way to panic, for let us not forget that the European food chain is one of the safest in the world."
"If it is to be effective and credible, however, the Authority will have to be supported by top scientific experts, while also drawing on the network of existing national agencies."
"Another important aspect that needs emphasising is that we must separate the evaluation of the risk, which falls within the scientific domain, and its management (the measures that are decided), which falls solely within the political domain."
"Let me remind you that whatever measures are decided must be proportionate to the level of the risk incurred."
"In the event of a perceived risk, but which has no foundation, for instance a rumour, we should respond by informing the consumers."
"In the event of a potential risk, we must take precautionary measures. Lastly, in the event of a real risk, we have to take preventive measures."
"If we want the European Food Authority to be as effective as possible, it will have to be completely independent, its composition will be a determining factor, and its decisions will have to be highly transparent."
"Lastly, the penalties imposed for serious errors or fraud must not only be considerable but, above all, applied."
". (NL) For years, quality and public health in the production of food were secondary to the pursuit of ever lower production costs."
"A cheap food package had to keep the costs down for the public at large."
"Governments and private business shared the same view about this reduction in costs, which was achieved, inter alia, by economies of scale, the use of artificial raw materials, intensification of the use of space, the import of animal feed from the Third World and an enormous number of redundancies."
"For that purpose, slaughter waste and dioxin-poisoned grass were fed to animals, or animals were gathered in pens and lorries where disease was able to spread readily."
"After all, if one wanted better food, there was a separate distribution circuit for those in a higher income bracket."
"Only when it transpired that people can contract fatal illnesses from contaminated food, did an increasing number of people want to know what they were eating."
"Once again, it is demonstrated that accidents need to happen first before the incentive is there to look for a solution to the problem."
"The solution does not lie in enhancing the European bureaucracy, or squabbles about the location and management of a new institution."
"Food safety can only be achieved if cost reduction and company profits are no longer paramount and if maximum openness is created in the field of complaints, minority verdicts, composition and safety measures."
"I look forward to the revolutionary effect which Mr Staes envisages, but it remains to be seen whether it will materialise."
"I voted for this recommendation because I believe that the common position as amended is a great improvement on the Commission' s original proposal."
"I fully subscribe to the strong wish expressed by the European institutions: the future European Food Safety Authority must be set up very soon and be operative as from the beginning of 2002."
"With that in mind, I agree with the rapporteur in wanting to see a text adopted to which the Council is likely to agree, so as to avoid a conciliation procedure, which always takes too long."
"The European Food Safety Authority will be strong and will, I hope, help us counter any food-related risks throughout the European Union."
"The Member States will continue to be responsible for monitoring and checks, while risk management and the rapid alert system will remain in the remit of the European Commission."
"Finally, I am in favour of adopting criteria for selecting the best location, in the general interest, for the European Food Safety Authority: I believe that the town of Lille fully satisfies the conditions laid down in the recommendation."
". I wholeheartedly support this report by my Socialist colleague which calls for the establishment of general principles and requirements of food law and for a European Food Authority."
"Food Safety is of great concern to the majority of the European Union's citizens and it is therefore vital that this Authority will be efficient, democratic and transparent once it is fixed."
"In such a way, the role proposed for Parliament will ensure that this body will remain under close scrutiny and that it will prove to be as legitimate as possible."
"Moreover, it is highly desirable that the future location of this Authority should be physically independent from other EU institutions."
"This will ensure that it remains independent and thus more credible in citizens' eyes."
"Finally, the call for close cooperation with the relevant bodies is pertinent: when there is a suspected food risk it makes sense that the Authority should capitalise on the knowledge available in other related associations."
"(NL) The group encompassing the Dutch D66 Party has endorsed the Whitehead report on the European Food Authority. D66 is pleased with the timing of this report, immediately preceding the European Summit in Laeken."
"After all, the question of EFA' s location cannot be seen in isolation from the as yet unresolved issue of the EP' s location and the ludicrous shuttle between Brussels and Strasbourg."
"We assume that the Heads of Government will look into these issues at length in Laeken."
"Bushill-Matthews report (A5-0422/2001)"
"Mr President, Mr Bushill-Matthews' report is on financial assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"A Genoese 70-year old pensioner, Mr Guido Facchinetti, who is an expert cook and has worked in restaurants all his life, asked me to vote for this document for the reasons I have already given, namely that it is appropriate for small and medium-sized enterprises to be financed by Europe."
"He said to me: ""If I had the financial where-with-all, despite the fact I am 70 years old, I would open new restaurants throughout Europe serving trenette with pesto, Genoa-style chick pea flour, Recco focaccia and Camogli pan-fried fish"" - apologies to any of my fish-loving friends who are listening - ""for these are excellent dishes and I would like to take them to the whole of Europe."
"All I need is the money!"""
"I hope that this document will make it possible for him to continue to exercise his outstanding abilities as an Italian and a Genoese cook."
". (PT) The launch of the Growth and Employment Initiative is a very positive step in terms of increasing and improving employment prospects in the EU."
"In the last few years, SMEs and micro-companies have been responsible for creating the largest number of new jobs."
"The report submitted by the Commission provides an objective analysis of the development of the three financial instruments for SMEs: the Start-up Facility (ETF), the Joint European Venture (JEV) Programme and the SME Guarantee Facility."
"However, the critical observations set out in Mr Bushill-Mathews' report, which I share and voted for, are highly relevant."
"I would like to stress, firstly, the need for the Commission to indicate clearly in future the degree to which forecasts of job creation actually materialise."
"Secondly, the Commission should carry out an in-depth analysis of the reasons which lead some countries to make extensive use of the different programmes and others to record a low or nil rate of use."
"I would like to point out in this respect that Portugal is one of the Member States not included in the ETF-Start-up Facility, aimed at initial-phase investment in high technology projects."
"Indeed, as far as the SME Guarantee Facility in the 31.12.2000 reference period is concerned, the rate of use is quite low."
"According to preliminary data supplied by the financial intermediaries, only eight Portuguese SMEs benefited from a guarantee under this mechanism, whereas in Spain there were 2 812 beneficiaries."
"That analysis will be a very important indicator for the definition and adoption of regulatory measures, particularly in terms of transparent access to information, simplification of the procedures for submitting applications and speedy allocation of funds."
". (EL) The policy being applied by the European Union and the Member States is forcing hundreds of thousands of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) into bankruptcy every year, because they are unable to withstand the onslaught of the monopolies."
"With the signs of a slump in the economy becoming more and more marked, SMEs and jobs are the first to go and the generally limited and short-term jobs linked to the occasional subsidy do nothing to counteract this."
"The Commission proposal merely serves the objective of reinforcing the European venture capital market by setting up financial intermediaries, who are neither controlled nor operate on the basis of job-creating criteria."
"In most cases, SMEs do not receive direct funding, in that applications must be addressed to intermediaries, generally conventional 'risk and investment capital funds' which are guaranteed by the EIB and which receive credits and guarantees from it."
"Thus, in the final analysis, no one apart from the European Investment Bank, knows which SME is being supported and what funding plans and jobs will result."
"These intermediary financial organisations, which have signed contracts with the European Investment Fund, tend to favour early stage investments in high technology sectors such as information technology, communications and the biosciences."
"So exactly what aid and which SMEs are we talking about, given that traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, small handicraft enterprises and tourist and commercial enterprises fall outside the funding framework, despite the fact that they are able to promote innovative products?"
"The highly important specific weight of SMEs in the economy of each country is being ignored, despite its having been proven that they represent the backbone of the business sector in Europe and are the only enterprises to have created any jobs over recent years."
"The unequal geographical distribution of this aid is also typical of growing regional inequalities between the Member States, in that over half this funding (be it in the form of start-up aid or the guarantee mechanism) will go to France and Germany, while in Greece, for example, this aid is non-existent because there is no venture capital market to speak of."
"We harbour no illusions as to the nature of the EU's employment policy or its policy on SMEs, which is basically non-existent, or the interests which that policy represents, which is why we feel that any reference to employment, to fighting unemployment and to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises within the guidelines for this policy is pure hypocrisy."
"Faced with these choices, the workers and small and medium-sized businessmen are joining forces in their fight and struggle to overturn this policy and promote a different policy which takes account of man and his present-day needs."
". (NL) Small enterprises used to be a very common phenomenon."
"In the last 150 years, they have been systematically bought up and forced out of business by large newcomers."
"Only in the last few years has there been a surprising, renewed interest in small enterprises."
"Unlike before, the big ones now stand to gain from their existence, since they can pass on tasks which they are unable to carry out at a cheaper price."
"They involve outsiders in low-wage countries or sell vulnerable parts of their enterprise to the staff or management."
"The business risks, including absorbing the peaks and troughs in transport and repair activities, are then borne by a third party."
"In most cases, costly collective wage agreements and schemes for better conditions at work fall by the wayside."
"In order to survive, people in such small enterprises must work harder and longer hours than they used to in the large enterprises."
"The small ones may think that they are independent, but they rely completely on the bank and on the larger enterprises with which they have outstanding contracts. Consequently, their existence can come to an unexpected end very quickly."
"Chances are that ultimately, government aid for small enterprises invariably benefits the large enterprises."
"However, I do not dismiss this aid just like that, for there are also situations where small enterprises can offer sound, fresh opportunities to groups of workers, notably to migrants and pioneers in the field of technical innovation."
". I wholeheartedly support this report which endorses the Commission report on financial assistance to SMEs through the Growth and Employment Initiative."
"Since it is presently the case that most SMEs have some difficulty in breaking into the technology market, this financial assistance can often symbolise the make or break of a potentially very successful SME."
"It is all too often bemoaned that the EU has failed to foster a culture of innovation and enterprise: the European Investment Fund (EIF) is a vital way in which this imbalance can and should be redressed."
"The call for the close evaluation of projects is also welcome: in such a way there will be a vital element of accountability in the scheme."
"To bolster this, the call for the involvement for the European Parliament is also vital."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Draft general budget for 2002 (as amended by the Council) and Letter of Amendment 2/2002"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following four reports, tabled on behalf of the Committee on Budgets:"
"(A5-0400/2001) by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002 as modified by the Council (all sections), and Letter of Amendment No 2/2001 to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2002;"
"(A5-0427/2001) by Mr Colom i Naval, on financial programming 2002-2006;"
"(A5-0447/2001) by Mr Wynn, on the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument;"
"(A5-0439/2001) by Mr Turchi, on Trans-European-Networks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to be meeting you here again in order to shed light on the salient points of the second reading of the EU' s draft general budget, as drawn up on 22 November."
"It is one of the last, but also one of the most important stages in the sometimes complicated process in which the Community budget is brought about."
"I greatly value the fact that I am able to make this statement before the MEPs who, as representatives of the European democracy, are meeting here in plenary session."
"According to the rules of the interinstitutional agreement, this second reading of the Council was preceded by a consultative meeting of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which took place on 21 November."
"I believe I can speak on behalf of all participants in this lengthy meeting, which did not finish until the small hours, when I say that it was not only a success from a budgetary point of view, because the general budget for 2002 will now soon be established, but also politically speaking, for we managed to agree on a number of new elements which presented themselves to us since our first reading and which need to be discussed, as well as a number of priorities."
"On behalf of the Council, I should like to express a word of thanks to the Parliament' s delegations and Mrs Schreyer, who went out of her way to achieve this result."
"I should first of all like to focus on the new elements. Needless to say, there were the events of 11 September."
"Entirely in line with what was decided at the consultation meeting, the Council wanted to set up a scheme to finance the effects in Afghanistan and in the neighbouring countries after these tragic events."
"In our jargon, this means that the geographically oriented budget items are increased, and by these we mean the items for Asia and TACIS of the external policy."
"For example, at second reading, the Council decided to pledge a total amount of nearly EUR 488 million in commitment appropriations for Asia."
"The Council also wanted to leave open a wide margin under the maximum of Heading 4 'External action' with a view to meeting possible future needs in those regions."
"This margin is also in line with the agreement that was reached with the European Parliament to maintain a minimum margin of EUR 70 million for any needs in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries."
"Moreover, I should like to remind you that it was also agreed to earmark a minimum amount of EUR 35 million in reserve for emergency aid of Heading 6 for possible needs of this kind."
"These elements formed an important part of the discussions we held."
"Another new element that came up in the discussions, is the conversion programme of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleet following the failure to set up a fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"In this respect, the Council has included EUR 170 million of commitment appropriations under Heading 2 of the draft budget and has decided to use the flexibility instrument for the corresponding amount."
"In this connection, may I remind you that the Council, by way of accommodating the EP' s wishes, has approved a specific allocation of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 2 for the regions which border the candidate countries, and has also approved the use of the flexibility instrument for the corresponding amount?"
"In the framework of the agreement with the European Parliament on an amount of EUR 20 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 3 for those border regions, the Council has approved the trial project: 'Effects of enlargement in the border regions' ."
"This agreement was unquestionably one of the key points of the 2002 budgetary procedure."
"In order to give this more lasting form, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have decided in favour of inclusion in the 2003 budget, taking into consideration the maximum amounts established in Berlin, together with EUR 27 million that were not placed on the 2002 budget which form part of the EUR 197 million which the Commission had proposed in the financial statement pertaining to the fleet conversion programme, as well as EUR 15 million for the border regions."
"As far as the priorities are concerned, I would remind you that the Council officially adopted conclusions concerning the budgetary guidelines for the forthcoming budgetary procedure in March of this year for the first time."
"In doing so, the Council wanted to indicate its budgetary procedures for the year 2002, as is the European Parliament' s and the Commission' s wont."
"During the negotiations, the Council continually pointed at these principles and priorities, and adhered to the same."
"In my view, this is a sound method, for it indicates more clearly what it is about and what the goal is, and it enhances transparency."
"I therefore believe that we all stand to benefit from the Council' s continued efforts in this direction."
"Let us start with the priorities which are close to the European Parliament' s heart."
"I am delighted that an agreement has been reached in the framework of the joint declaration on the management of the commitments outstanding (the RALs) and of the elimination in the medium term of what people started to refer to as 'abnormal RALs' ."
"I would point out that abnormal RALs, which we defined as sleeping obligations for which no payments have been made over the past two years, as well as old obligations which have been on the budget for at least five years, cannot only be reduced by increasing the appropriations for payment, but also by causing obligations to lapse to a large extent."
"I believe that the measures announced by the Commission will ensure that this matter be resolved satisfactorily in due course."
"Moreover, we managed to agree on a statement regarding the implementation profile for the 2002 budget."
"This statement means that the implementation of the budget will be spread over the course of the year as equally as possible."
"The so-called December fever must be avoided in this respect."
"In order to achieve this, the Commission has envisaged the following measures. It aims to implement the 2002 budget, taking into account the implementation of the 2001 budget, and make the necessary changes."
"The budgetary authority will be notified when the implementation profile deviates considerably from the proposed profile."
"Furthermore, an implementation plan for the 2002 per heading of the financial perspectives will be sent upon submittal of the preliminary draft budget for 2003."
"I am convinced that these measures correspond to the horizontal amendments which the European Parliament approved at first reading, so that we can look forward to the budget approval with confidence."
"The Council has also devoted special attention to the priorities which the European Parliament had listed at first reading, inter alia by agreeing to the additional appropriations for e-learning and immigration."
"Needless to say, I am pleased with the post-ECSC regulations and the pledge by the Spanish Presidency to redraft the Financial Regulation."
"I should like to conclude this last list of priorities to be taken into account with one of the Council' s essential priorities, namely the controlled increase of payment appropriations."
"I shall come back to this in due course."
"At second reading of the budget, we took account of the agreements concluded during consultation."
"We have tried to adopt a budget which can accommodate all the EU' s priorities, on the one hand, and which can take into consideration the points which were brought up after first reading without losing sight of the real needs and scope for spending the appropriations, on the other."
"I should like to outline the other results to you for each heading."
"As far as agricultural expenditure is concerned, letter of amendment 2 has been adopted in its entirety."
"Moreover, the Council has restored the proposed amounts in the preliminary draft budget for the budget lines which were cut at first reading and to which the letter of amendment refers."
"An additional EUR 4.5 million has been included, as agreed during the consultation of 21 November, whereby Parliament' s observations were taken into account."
"In a joint declaration with the European Parliament, special attention has been paid to the protection of animals during transport."
"I am also delighted that our institutions can reach agreement on the points of this letter of amendment which pertain to expenditure for rural development, fisheries agreements and the inclusion in the budget of the surplus available from the previous budget year in the sum of EUR 1.2 billion."
"I believe I have already outlined the key results in connection with the structural measures, namely the inclusion of EUR 170 million by way of commitment appropriations and EUR 39 million in payment appropriations for the conversion of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleet, and the amount of EUR 30 million for the regions which border the candidate countries, whereby use is made of the flexibility instrument in both cases."
"With regard to internal policy, the Council has kept most points of its first reading and has also partially adopted a number of major amendments of the European Parliament, including e-learning, which entails EUR 5 million, and the European refugee fund, which entails an increase of EUR 5 million."
"The rapporteurs have tried to convince us and they have succeeded, but the Council' s willingness to cooperate should also be highlighted here, in my view."
"It is under this heading that quite a considerable proportion of the measures will be funded for the benefit of the regions which border the candidate countries."
"As far as the external policy is concerned, the Council has not only increased the budget items covering Asia and TACIS by EUR 66 million compared to the draft budget, it has also adopted letter of amendment 2 concerning international fisheries agreements."
"Concerning the common security policy, an amount of EUR 30 million in commitment appropriations has been included, in accordance with the results of the consultation of 21 November."
"As for administrative expenses, the three institutions agreed to hold extensive discussions about the report of the Secretaries General regarding the multi-annual development."
"In my view, quite a few options are still left open."
"As far as the EP' s budget is concerned, the Council has adopted draft Supplementary and Amending Budget 5 for 2001, by means of which expenditure for buildings can be forecast in the framework of the 2003 budget, with the obligation to reduce the expenditure in 2003 by an equal amount."
"For a number of years now, the Council has adopted a comprehensive approach during its reading, which means that the main issues in the draft budget are the set priorities and the extent of the expenditure category."
"Thanks to this approach, the Council has managed to remain under the existing annual maximum amounts of expenditure, established in the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May 1999."
"Additionally, in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement, it has managed to ensure that within the maximum amounts of financial perspectives, margins remain available, as a result of which different Community measures and policy lines can be prioritised."
"When the second reading was drafted, the Council aimed for a budgetary discipline, so much so that the budget increases are in line with those of the national budgets."
"The total increase of payment appropriations is therefore restricted to 2%."
"As you know, agreement was reached during the consultation of 21 November in the framework of this general agreement with the help of the Commission."
"The Council relies on the fact that the European Parliament will carry on in this vein during its second reading, so that the percentage increase does not exceed the agreed maximum amounts."
"Before you have a final discussion on the budget, I should like to emphasise that the Council has endeavoured to take account of certain budgetary rules and basic provisions concerning the inclusion in the reserve of appropriations, the make-up of expenditure, legal bases, preparatory actions and trial projects."
"That is why the Council would state once again that it is opposed to Parliament' s use of conditional reserves, which is in contravention of the Financial Regulation."
"Furthermore, the Council has once again opted for the outcome of the first reading of the draft budget for heading B7-1 concerning the European Development Fund, since the increase of a funding or even of a margin in the budget lacks the necessary legal basis and is therefore not possible."
"Moreover, allow me to remind you that this is intrinsically about compulsory expenditure."
"I should like to conclude this brief outline of the second reading by the Council by highlighting that the budgetary procedure been conducted in a good atmosphere."
"As in the past, emotions sometimes ran high during the discussions."
"Everyone has put forward their view in clear, concise, sometimes lengthy, yet forceful terms."
"However, the aim of the consultation procedure has not been overlooked: namely to bring about agreement between the two arms of the budgetary authority with the help of the Commission."
"On my own behalf and that of the Council, I should like to thank in particular Mr Terence Wynn, the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, and the two rapporteurs, Mr Carlos Costa Neves and Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg, as well as all the members of the Committee on Budgets, with whom I have had the pleasure of working over these six months of the presidency of the Council, in which I have not only become familiar with the European budgetary procedure, but have also learnt to appreciate it."
"I thank you for your attention."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the constructive attitude of both branches of the budgetary authority, the European Parliament and the European Council, and with the support of the Commission, it has been possible, throughout the different phases of the complex budgetary process, to find an answer to a series of new challenges, ensure that previous commitments are fulfilled and deal with most of the priorities defined for 2002."
"In the light of a markedly balanced end result, it is only fair to single out the work of the members of the Budgetary Commission, the vital contribution of the draftsmen of the opinions of other committees, the responsible involvement of the political groups, the negotiating skills of the Belgian Presidency demonstrated by Minister Vande Lanotte, whom I congratulate, the competence of the Commission departments, which I hereby single out in the person of the Director-General for the Budget, Mr Mangasson, the work of the entire College of Commissioners and the particular endeavours of the Commissioner for the Budget, Mrs Schreyer, whom I would also like to congratulate."
"I would also like to make a special personal reference to the invaluable support and contribution of the secretariat of the Budgetary Commission for the excellent results they achieved."
"They went far beyond the call of duty."
"In a rapid assessment of the results achieved, we should mention the establishment of better conditions for continuing to improve the performance of the budget and make it more effective."
"The joint declarations issued by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are very important."
"For the first time, the Council accepted amendments adopted at first reading by Parliament within the framework of the common agricultural policy, thereby opening up promising prospects for cooperation."
"It was also possible to meet new needs deriving from the failure to sign the fisheries agreement with Morocco and the impact of enlargement through the financing of a restructuring programme for the Portuguese and Spanish fishing fleets, and specific support for certain border regions."
"Fourthly, financing was agreed for three new agencies with competence in the area of maritime safety, air safety and food quality."
"There is also an initial response to new challenges relating to the situation following the attacks of September 11, in particular in the areas of policing, justice and external action; here again special reference should be made to the financing of humanitarian and reconstruction actions in Afghanistan and neighbouring countries."
"I would further stress the strengthening of the ability to act in terms of e-learning and the special importance given to the response to the tragic situation of the refugees."
"Support for the Commission reforms and progress in preparing for enlargement are also envisaged."
"Compliance with commitments entered into previously, whether in the context of Agenda 2000 with regard to the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds, or with regard to programmes arising from codecision or even concerning the policy on external action, are also matters which should be addressed."
"Of course, it is only normal that new challenges are appearing for the future."
"I would single out the following: the endowments needed for expenses of Headings III - Internal Policies, IV - External Policies and V - Administrative Expenses are subject to enormous pressure and the fact that the situation is under control for the time being should not delude us."
"The problems will arise again in the next few years and it will become increasingly difficult to find solutions."
"In this context, I would mention with regret the rigidity of the budgetary structure deriving from the Financial Perspective in force, which means that in some categories there are substantial balances and in others the situation is becoming increasingly complicated."
"It is incomprehensible that with the current difficulties in various sectors, such as external action, there was a balance of EUR 11 billion outstanding in the year 2000, which is around 14% of the total expenditure."
"We must have the courage to adopt in good time the solutions that in this case are so obvious."
"At the same time, it must be stated again that the division of budgetary expenses into compulsory and non-compulsory is a completely outdated concept and, in the light of the most elementary principles of democracy, it is unacceptable for the effective competence of Parliament to be limited to non-compulsory expenses (around half of the budget) and it is incomprehensible that it has no competence as regards the revenue system."
"The 2002 budget is ready and I believe it merits your approval."
"As for the tasks for the future and the new role of the European Parliament in the budgetary process, we will be here to deal with them."
"Once again, thank you all very much."
"I would particularly like to thank my fellow MEP, Mr Costa Neves, for all the work he has done over the past year. For the equanimity and meticulousness which he employed, his willingness to take the contribution of other, also smaller, groups seriously and the way in which he managed to persuade everyone to adopt the same line, which was no mean feat."
"At the start of the budgetary procedure, it looked as if the pain for the 2002 budget was mainly concentrated in heading 5."
"Needless to say, I was delighted with this as rapporteur. However, now, having reached December, we could say that Mr Costa Neves has yet again assumed the leading role, for Heading 4 is now also showing cracks again."
"For the third year running, we have had to supplement the budget by 200 million by calling on the flexibility instrument."
"We therefore continue to scrounge in order to fund the political tasks of the European Union."
"Despite this, it was once again possible to reach agreement with the Council. However, as far as my group is concerned, our support is not really heart-felt, and this has everything to do with the tragic rituals and traditions which typify the budgetary procedure."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has praised the Community budgetary method and although, admittedly, this method always ultimately culminates in agreement, more than anything, the annual budgetary ritual is a rather irrational process."
"The Commission presents a proposal, the Council takes a huge slice off the proposed amount, Parliament adds a bit more, and we are then supposed to come up with something wonderful in the renowned consultation."
"It did occur to me to break up the cycle and to simply leave a number of Council cutbacks in heading 5 where they are, including the cutback at the Court of Justice."
"It did seem like a healthy exercise to let the Council come face to face with the effects of its actions and its unilateral obsession to remain well below the ceiling of the financial perspectives."
"Unfortunately, I did not do this. I have had feedback that that is what I should have done."
"I decided against it because otherwise the wrong people would yet again be penalised."
"This view about assuming one' s responsibility fits in well with the idea that we also mooted at first reading, namely that political promises made by Heads of Governments and Ministers should be accompanied by a financial picture."
"We have drawn the necessary lessons in the reconstruction of the Balkans, and it seems fairer to me if it is indicated whether new tasks also require new funding, and - that is at the same time a promise - whether aid to a region in crisis will require cutbacks in peace projects in the Middle East or in projects against sexual violence in South Africa."
"What is at any rate a bonus is that this time, aid to Afghanistan featured as a prominent part of the consultation and, unlike in the Balkans, external pledges were not made at donor conferences first, upon which we were expected to pick up the pieces, but these were discussed during the consultations."
"I hope that this was not simply a question of good timing, but the start of a positive development."
"Another bizarre aspect of the budgetary procedure is the implementation of the budget, and we as Parliament are also guilty of making empty promises."
"We want tens of millions of euros more for South America, for instance, without knowing exactly why only 60% of last year' s funding was spent."
"And each year, we intend to better monitor and adjust the Commission' s budget, which is no reason not to do it this year."
"My group will therefore grant priority to this aspect during the preparation of the 2003 budget."
"However, my group is pleased with the minor changes in the Council' s budget in the area of foreign policy expenditure."
"Not a great deal of money is involved, but it is significant nevertheless."
"It is now clear that Parliament will from now on give its verdict about the Council' s budget in terms of operational expenditure, which is an improvement."
"The budget is a means, not an end."
"It funds our activities for citizens in Europe and elsewhere, and if there is one slogan of which the European policy-maker cannot get enough, then surely it must be that Europe should be closer to the citizen."
"And you cannot get much closer than the people of Elsene, our neighbours in Brussels, and I am therefore delighted with the paragraph in the present resolution which urges us to draw up a sound inventory of what we need, and how we can provide for it, and also to take account of the interests of the citizens in the immediate vicinity, before we start making plans for new Parliament buildings."
"I would thank the Bureau for all its efforts and I hope that the planned hearing will lead to positive results, also with regard to the conservation of the quaint little station."
"It is important to put forward great visions, but it is just as important to face up to the practical implications of these."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to apologise to the House because I must leave, since I have obligations in my capacity as Vice-President in a few minutes time and I will not therefore be able to attend the whole of the debate."
"The report which I have just had the honour of presenting deals with an important contribution to the Community' s budgeting and programming system."
"We had an agreement, based on the joint declaration of 20 July 2000, in which we established a system for programming and verifying the activities of the Commission in relation to the Financial Perspectives."
"Its objective was to serve as a guide for the decisions of the Budgetary Authority, offer a vision of the margins available in each heading, taking account of the contributions already approved during the codecision procedure, and facilitating the application of the new assessment procedure originating from the aforementioned joint declaration."
"We are now in an important financial year and, for the first time - we will thank the Commission for this - it offers us this opportunity to see the programming of Headings 3 and 4, in relation to our activities."
"There is an issue which interests us, a very methodological issue, on how to plan, in the future, the programmes which are already under way, and there is just one point which interests us: for certain programmes, for certain budget lines, future inflation is included, by means of what the Commission calls a budgetary deflater, and, in our opinion, it ought to be a budgetary inflater."
"There is a technical contradiction here."
"The Financial Perspectives are expressed in standard euros, while the programming works in current euros for each year."
"The result is that we do not really know, when we reach an agreement, what value we may have for the previous year because it will depend on real inflation."
"Anybody who has been a trade unionist knows that one can lie through statistics in many ways and this is one of them - by mixing current prices with standard prices; and I will not therefore insist on this."
"I am going to give you an example - by hiding future inflation in the framework programme, the Commission reaches the conclusion that, according to its figures, between 2002 and 2006, we will have an increase in annual contributions of 14.3%."
"Inflation is hiding the fact that, basically, we really only have an increase of 4.9%."
"This is the real increase."
"The rest, which brings it up to 14%, is inflation."
"That is what we do not like."
"The other day, the Commission told the Committee on Budgets that, with the euro, inflation is dead."
"Praise the Lord!"
"I accept that, but I am from the school of Saint Thomas and prefer, when it comes to these things, to see before believing."
"When I have seen that inflation has disappeared, I will accept the removal of this type of differentiation between standard prices and current prices and, therefore, this is the main issue from our point of view."
"All the rest of the Commission' s work we believe to be excellent."
"Our concern is really to prevent a situation where, through this technique, the higher real inflation is, the greater the margin available will be."
"It makes no sense and therefore our request, included in the motion for a resolution, is very simple: if it suits the Commission to continue working, for whatever reason, in terms of current euros, it should do so, but the information it offers Parliament must also be expressed in standard euros."
"This is the key point of our report."
"As for everything else, I would like to thank the Commission for the effort it has made to offer us this information for the first time."
"Mr President, I am a somewhat unexpected rapporteur for this report."
"The report is in my name because the person who has done all the work on this, the standing rapporteur for the financial perspective, Mr Colom i Naval, decided after a lot of consideration that he could not present it to Parliament."
"I know his reasons why."
"I have spoken to him about them."
"I can respect those reasons but I am somewhat saddened that he is not giving this report instead of me."
"For the last three years the flexibility instrument has been the main aspect of the budget and it has overshadowed everything else."
"On this occasion we are using it for two programmes, as has been said by speakers before me."
"I do not have to outline what that is, but I have to outline one small problem which we have not yet resolved, that is, how the remaining money - the EUR 27 million for the reconversion of the Spanish fisheries fleet - will be found for the budget after next year."
"That remains an issue on which I am sure the Commission will be creative and inventive when it comes to next year's budget - to make sure that money can be found, because it is certainly expected."
"When the interinstitutional agreement was agreed, the flexibility instrument was one of the items which was reluctantly agreed by both sides - reluctantly from our side because there was a lot of resistance to the IIA anyway."
"Do not forget that it was passed in this Parliament by a simple majority, not by a qualified majority."
"That was an issue in itself."
"The Council did not really like this idea anyway."
"If I remember correctly it was the Commission that proposed it as a way out of the impasse."
"It is a good job that it was proposed because it has 'saved our bacon' for the last three years."
"In the first instance it was the great debate on how to fund Kosovo."
"The Council did not want to use it and we went to the wire, if you can remember that famous occasion in this Chamber when we each had two voting lists."
"Then last year it was on how to fund Serbia."
"That in itself was a problem and now on this occasion we have how to fund the reconversion of the fisheries fleet and also the cross-border initiatives."
"These last three years have shown the creaking structure of the financial perspective."
"I am sure that this is a point that Mr Colom i Naval would have made."
"We have a situation where the financial perspective has great problems with heading 3, heading 4 and certainly heading 5."
"Unless Parliament and Council begin to get some sort of agreement on how to fund these categories in the future, the consequences will be there for all to see."
"It is the consequences of pre-enlargement."
"It is not necessarily enlargement itself."
"The preparations for pre-enlargement will be as big a headache as the enlargement issue itself."
"We also have the needs of Afghanistan, or perhaps I should say the unknown needs of Afghanistan."
"What are we going to do about that?"
"What are we going to do if we get a hoped-for peace agreement in the Middle East?"
"Where is that money going to come from?"
"There is no room at present in heading 4."
"I have heard rumours that the Commission may be proposing an extra flexibility instrument for heading 4."
"If it does, it will be a welcome addition, but whether it would be agreed by the Council is a different matter."
"This head-in-the-sand attitude cannot prevail if we are trying to be serious about how we manage the Union's budget and the taxpayers' expenses in the future."
"The negotiations with the Belgian presidency at the second conciliation were 100% better than the first conciliation, which was a waste of time, as I made known last time."
"At least this time it was good to do business with the Belgians, as it was last time when I was general rapporteur for the 1994 budget."
"There are areas where we have our differences, such as in heading 3 where we have always had difficulties."
"In heading 5, one of the main areas where we differ is in our support for the Commission on the reform programme, especially on the establishment plan and the posts that are needed."
"However, whilst we have agreed on the establishment plan, the Committee on Budgets voted for one third of those posts in reserve, albeit by a one-vote majority."
"The coordinators and the rapporteur are working very hard to try to ensure that we can get a position which will deliver a qualified majority on Thursday because if we do not, we may end up with the Council's position which would not aid the Commission's reform process as we would want it to do."
"I have seen the letter that Commissioners Schreyer, Kinnock and de Palacio have written, where they state that the conditions for release of the reserve have been met."
"If I was not the chairman of the Committee on Budgets I would say that I agree with those sentiments, but since I am the chairman of the Committee on Budgets I could not possibly say any such thing."
"I would like you to know that hopefully, between the vote on Thursday and the not-too-distant future, we can all be in a position where we can see the Commission's proposals coming to fruition and we can get on with the job of making Europe the place that the citizens expect it to be and not associated with the great mystique that it represents for too many of them right now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission' s annual report on Trans-European Networks provides a general outlook on Community assistance in the three main areas of TENs (transport, energy and telecommunications), which are financed either through the general Union budget or through other Community sources such as the EIB and the Cohesion Fund."
"I believe that, overall, it is a good report, if one also takes into account the fact that 1999 was a pivotal year for this sector, in fact, 1999 saw the modification of the financial regulation, the approval of the financial framework for 2000-2006 and the creation of ISPA; this year, 50% of the funding was devoted to transport infrastructure works and the emergence of Galileo as a new and priority TEN project."
"This does not mean, however, that there are no criticisms to be levelled at the Commission; these derive above all from the type of report it has given us and not from the implementation of the Trans-European Networks."
"The first criticism I intend to make about the report concerns the lack of references to the qualitative development of TEN projects."
"Very often, the initiation and completion of projects have taken much longer than expected because of procedural differences and a lack of coordination."
"In several cases, Member States have had different priorities, while the notion of public or private partnership is not yet well developed."
"In future, therefore, the Commission should attach additional information on the projects to its reports, such as, for instance, the original plans, timetables and the results achieved."
"This would, first and foremost, increase transparency and thus also permit more effective and productive monitoring of the situation."
"Secondly, the financial evaluation of TENs should include information on funding through local, regional and national budgets and also through private resources, since roughly 80% of the total funds comes from these sources."
"It would thus be possible to obtain an overall view of the state of funding and to check that the commitments undertaken by Member States are maintained."
"Thirdly, I believe that the financial resources available for TENs are too limited in view of the continual challenges faced by the transport sector."
"The percentage of TEN activities funded by the general budget is constantly falling, while EIB loans cover more than three-quarters of the funding in this sector, and this is highlighted."
"My view is that the funding package for transport TENs should be reviewed and adapted to actual needs, especially in light of the reductions in other sectors, such as the environment."
"Lastly, I believe we must properly address the problem of road traffic, the constant increase in which runs contrary to the objectives that were proposed when TENs were created."
"I think this is due to a lack of cross-border cooperation, which necessarily undermines the interoperability and promotion of rail networks."
"To get round this problem it will, I think, be necessary to gradually shift the emphasis away from the Essen priority projects and national infrastructure projects towards transit and cross-border projects, so as to strengthen the policy of sustainable transport and promote integration between different modes of transport."
"In conclusion, I should also like to mention the budget that we are about to vote on."
"I believe we have come to the end of two not inconsiderable political problems which reflect the additional needs which have emerged in view of the changed international situation."
"In second reading, we have left an ample margin for assistance to Afghanistan and neighbouring regions, and with the Council we have agreed on the figure of EUR 488 million for cooperation with developing countries in Asia."
"Once again, then, we have given evidence of our political sensitivity and lent our support to the common foreign and security policy."
"It was unthinkable that the Union might absent itself at a time like this, and it was also unthinkable that Parliament might default after the explicit request by the Council."
"This does not, however, mean that everything is fine and that no criticisms should be made."
"Nevertheless, I must especially congratulate the rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg, as well as all the Secretariat staff who have helped and supported us through both good and difficult moments."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the result of the budget negotiations that we have before us is self-evident."
"During the period of the budget negotiations, that is to say from the time the preliminary draft budget was submitted to the present day, many new demands on the EU budget have arisen."
"World events, the terrorist attacks of 11 September, the war in Afghanistan, and the crisis in the Middle East have all given rise to new budgetary requirements."
"The crises in the agricultural sector that we have witnessed this year have meant new budget requirements in the coming year, and the public's changing expectations also need to be reflected."
"Together, we have succeeded in adapting the 2002 budget to these new challenges and given how often the European Union is criticised, we should make sure that this positive outcome is heard loud and clear."
"We have succeeded, and this is thanks to the well-balanced and reconciliatory way in which you, Mr Costa Neves, have approached the negotiations, and we wish to thank you very sincerely for that."
"We have also succeeded because of the exacting approach of the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Wynn, who also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, and we have succeeded because of the skilful way in which the negotiations were conducted at the crucial point by the President-in-Office - by you, Mr Vande Lanotte - and I would like to sincerely thank all of you, together with the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Colom i Naval, the entire committee, and also you, Mr Turchi, on behalf of the entire Commission, for this very fruitful cooperation."
"I would also like to mention Mr Seppänen."
"He had the historic task of presenting the report on the last budget of the European Coal and Steel Community."
"And we can also describe the level of the EU budget as well-nigh historical, that is to say the EU budget share."
"The budget as a proportion of Europe's GNP is lower for next year than at any time during the 1990s."
"It will amount to only 1.03% of Europe's GNP."
"The EU budget is accordingly EUR 4.6 billion lower than the amount provided for next year in the financial perspective."
"EUR 4.6 billion is almost 5% of the entire budget, or to put it another way, it was envisaged in the financial perspective that the budget for 2002 might be 5% higher than is now actually being agreed."
"I am stressing this point firstly because it reflects the budgetary discipline that prevails at European level, and, Mr President-in-Office, because the EU budget is therefore below the average growth rate for budgets in the Member States."
"That is also worth emphasising."
"Secondly, this result also demonstrates that scope for action has been created to allow the EU to take on new financial tasks, and I am referring here, in particular, to the debate on the costs of enlargement."
"That therefore means that Europe, the European budget, is prepared to assume new tasks."
"Aid to Afghanistan for peaceful future development of that country is a new task for which the European Union should, and will, assume responsibility."
"An initial provision has been made for this in the 2002 budget, with EUR 130 million in addition to the funds already earmarked for humanitarian aid."
"This is a positive result, particularly in view of the fact that it would be disastrous if we were to reduce our commitment to the Balkans."
"That cannot be allowed to happen, and for that reason the same amount is being made available for the Balkans as this year, with a part being brought forward to the end of the current budget year."
"Further aid is also needed for Palestine."
"Together with other donors, we are making good some of the loss of income that the Palestinian Autonomy Authority has suffered because Israel is holding back tax and customs receipts because of the escalation of the conflict."
"The use of this money in Palestine is subject to strict controls."
"It is supervised by the International Monetary Fund, and there are no indications that this money is being misused to purchase arms."
"That would of course be totally unacceptable."
"The European Union is supporting public health and it is supporting education."
"We want to use our contributions to give the peace process a chance."
"That is our aim, I am very glad that at yesterday's Council press conference the Minister, Mr Perez stressed that Israel, too, regards financial support for Palestine as being important."
"The European Union is in the process of shouldering more responsibility on the world political scene, and that is a good thing."
"This involves a greater commitment to civil crisis management, which in turn requires financial means and, as you know, and as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets has stressed once again, the budgetary rules are such that funds released elsewhere cannot simply be used for additional expenditure on external policy."
"Of the EUR 4.6 billion that the 2002 budget will be below the amount provided for next year in the financial perspective, we cannot just use EUR 400 or 500 million for coping with external policy crises. Nor can we simply use money from the budget surplus to finance new requirements."
"That is why the Commission has proposed that by means of an agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, an extra reserve should be created for additional external policy actions, and I believe that this is in fact the ideal way to avoid unravelling the financial perspective whilst still addressing the new challenges facing the Community in a Community-oriented way. It would be a good thing if the Laeken Council could also express its support for this approach."
"A new feature of the 2002 budget is the commitment of funds for measures in the area of judicial cooperation, including the development of the new information system for Schengen and for Eurojust."
"The Commission's estimate of funds for this area is something quite new."
"Another new item is the programme to restructure the Spanish and to some extent the Portuguese fishing fleets which up to now have been able to fish in Morocco's waters."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the budgetary authority accepts the Commission's proposal both with regard to the level of this special programme - EUR 197 million - and also concerning the specific shape of the programme and the proposal to finance it by mobilising the flexibility instrument."
"The compromise solution of making additional funds available in the 2002 budget for the regions bordering the candidate countries was really not easy to achieve."
"However, the compromise of entering part of the additional amount in the 2003 budget for these two requirements is acceptable, and I can assure you that the Commission will make the necessary financial proposals for 2003, so that the funds for the programme to restructure the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets will be available."
"It is now up to Spain and the border regions to implement the programmes being allocated additional funds as rapidly as possible, and the Commission will support this."
"I say this because it is evident that the public and the fishing industry in Spain expect this now, as do small and medium-sized enterprises in the border regions."
"Parliament has this year once again very strongly supported the Commission's reform process during the discussions on the budget."
"I would like to express the Commission's heartfelt thanks for this."
"However, I nevertheless wish to touch on one point, and a very important one at that, regarding the reserve for the 105 new posts envisaged up to now."
"In the Committee on Budgets you agreed two conditions for lifting this reserve."
"The first is that the Commission should bring forward a proposal for a permanent early retirement scheme."
"The Commission has already included this in its guidelines for personnel policy, and will consult on a proposal for amending the statute."
"The second condition was better matching of budgetary decisions and the Commission's work programme."
"This was also the subject of this morning's debate, and the Commission undertakes that, as from next year, it will present the most important initiatives with an impact on the budget at an earlier stage."
"I can also assure you personally that I will support this request for the budgetary implications for the coming year of new legislative proposals to be made clear at the appropriate stage of the budget process."
"I hope that we will also reach a satisfactory outcome on this point."
"Two thousand and two is an important year for agricultural policy."
"The interim review of the agricultural policy has to be presented."
"Next year the agricultural budget will rise by only 0.5%, which is less than the average, and that is despite the fact that, for example, there is EUR 400 million in the budget for the reimbursement of expenditure to Member States because of foot and mouth disease and that a total of EUR 8 billion is available for the beef sector."
"The reform process, the mid-term review, not only has a financial dimension, it is also about setting objectives in agricultural policy, and the second pillar, the promotion of rural development, has an important role to play here."
"However, with regard to the Sapard programme of pre-accession aid for agriculture, the Commission still considers that the proposal for a new programme is not the right way to go."
"Two thousand and two will also be a very important year for the enlargement of the European Union."
"Negotiations should be concluded for the countries that have made the greatest progress, and in concrete terms this means that budget-related negotiations on agricultural policy, structural policy and on the budget itself will be completed."
"The Council intends to have determined its common negotiating position for the budget chapter by the end of next June."
"The budget chapter is, of course, the crowning achievement of the accession negotiations."
"The Commission has already agreed to present a proposal that will not go beyond the amounts set in Agenda 2000 for new Member States for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006."
"That was also laid down in the interinstitutional agreement."
"The Commission accordingly expects to receive the support of the budgetary authority for no more and no less than these annual amounts being made available."
"Two thousand and two is also the year in which the convention on the reform of the European treaties will start its work."
"We are now virtually on the eve of the Laeken Summit and of having to agree the programme of work for the convention."
"An important subject for the future to be dealt with by the convention will be the Parliament's budget rights."
"The outcome of the 2002 budget negotiations is evident and this outcome will once again enable the challenges to be met."
"Nevertheless, it should be clear for the future that the European Parliament finally deserves full budget rights."
"This is a touchstone for the democratic development of the European Union."
"Mr President, I should like to inform the House that an agreement was reached on the European arrest warrant at the end of the meeting between Prime Minister Verhofstadt and Prime Minister Berlusconi."
"Italy will sign the proposal, but the measures needed to change the Italian Constitution have been referred to the Italian Parliament, because, as certain emeritus judges of the constitutional court have observed, the European arrest warrant conflicts with the Constitution."
"The Italian Prime Minister has therefore asked Parliament itself to amend the Constitution."
"The press conference at which the news will be given is just starting."
"Thank you, Mr Tajani."
"This is good news for everyone."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Costa Neves, for the efforts he has made to achieve a balanced and reasonable budget which respects the competences and prerogatives of this Parliament."
"We now have to ensure maximum efficiency in its management and I therefore call on the European Commission to spend the money in a balanced fashion between all geographical areas, since I do not believe it is correct to undermine the priorities set by the European Parliament by redistributing appropriations at the end of the financial year."
"To this end, the Commission clearly needs to be provided with the necessary human resources, and the Committee on Foreign Affairs has asked, particularly with regard to the management of external aid, for the Commission to have those human resources which will allow it to carry out the efficient management we are referring to."
"Finally, Mr President, I share the concern expressed by other Members, because, in order to fund new priorities in subsequent financial years, new resources will be required, so as not to jeopardise the European Union' s external action commitments."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, who is nearly at the end of the second reading."
"I need to remind him, from a control point of view that we anticipate and look forward to him taking a keen interest in how the budget is implemented by the Commission next year and how he drives it forward from there."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control tabled a number of amendments to the budget to gain extra information and evaluations from the Commission."
"We are actually getting somewhere this year."
"It is a tactic we have decided to use in future years as well."
"We would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets for allowing us to have a say on transfers, in which we are particularly interested."
"Finally, I thank the rapporteur again for taking a keen interest in the amendment concerning the European Court of Auditors."
"We on the committee will be looking at this carefully because we understand that the Court of Auditors will be coming to us for more money, staff and resources in the future."
"We are very interested to see how this year's situation develops over the course of 2002."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, I would also like to congratulate the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves."
"I also want to offer congratulations and thanks to all my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets."
"It is a rare privilege - and I can measure its worth as a committee rapporteur - to be able to say that the Committee on Budgets accepted all the demands we had made, they were, of course, legitimate and carefully considered, and which were put forward in Parliament at second reading."
"So I want to thank the general rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Budgets."
"That said, I would like to address the Council more directly, address the intelligence of the Council, if I dare put it that way, knowing that Mr Vande Lanotte is bound to understand what I mean."
"Four years ago, the European Parliament proposed setting up a European fund for refugees, an idea that the Council angrily struck off the list at second reading."
"No European refugee fund."
"Four years have passed and now the Council has just proposed more money than we ourselves had even asked for the European refugee fund it had refused to create."
"It took the Council all of four years to understand, to become responsible and, with respect, to show some intelligence."
"Another example: for several years now we have included a Schengen list at the budget' s first reading, because for several years we have wanted some of its aspects to be communitised and financed from the Community budget."
"Each year the Council would angrily strike off the Schengen heading at second reading."
"This time, the Council needs the Schengen heading we had introduced because it has to finance SIS II and has decided to finance it on a Community basis."
"That brings me to the third problem."
"We decided - Parliament did so at first reading and will do so at second reading - to vote to enter EUR 5 million under the Europol heading to combat terrorism."
"The Council did not accept this at second reading."
"I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to do the impossible and to create the necessary legal basis and agreements."
"I would ask it to use this money without waiting four years, because the terrorists for their part will not wait that long."
"Mr President, I would like to take this opportunity to make a number of basic points with regard to the agencies."
"The decision to deal with the agencies on an individual basis was an important one."
"I have very carefully read through the amendments proposed by the specialised committees, and to those of you who sit on them I would therefore like to send out a signal."
"I ask you, firstly, to take a close look at the agencies with a view to seeing whether or not they work well, and then read the report of the Court of Auditors."
"Something else, too, about the new agencies."
"I think policy is tending in the direction of creating even more agencies, something, which also appears to be the Commission's strategy."
"In general terms, this is not to be rejected out of hand, but it becomes objectionable when it comes to finance, as the Commission does not include their funds in the calculations."
"So if, in future, the Commission or the agencies, as the case may be, come wanting more resources, then heading 3 will not be able to take the strain."
"I too would like to congratulate both the rapporteurs on their budget reports and thank them for the collaborative approach that they have adopted."
"We have had a tough budgetary procedure especially in relation to the priorities of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"This will present my committee with problems in meeting obligations on a number of programmes."
"These programmes are not just crucial to achieving a dynamic knowledge - based Europe but, in the light of the tough current economic climate that the European businesses and organisations are facing, our key to achieving our aims of creating new jobs and supporting businesses."
"However, I appreciate the constraints that we are working under and, as someone who in the past has emphasised the need for prudence, efficiency and economy, I know that my committee will do its utmost to deliver growth and prosperity for the EU."
"The issues that I really want to raise concern the implementation of the budget."
"First, there is the Commission habit of ignoring some of the priorities of this budget authority and I want to give you an example from my committee in relation to the synergy programme."
"It is a small programme, but nevertheless an important one."
"However, it did not actually suit the particular director-general to implement this programme last year and so it was just ignored because they believed it did not have a big enough impact."
"Secondly, there is the use of transfers, which I believe are open to misuse because often these happen very late in the budgetary process and the Commission will transfer money from areas which are priorities for Parliament to those that are priorities for them."
"We must have mechanisms in place to stop this recurring year on year."
"Thirdly, there is the lack of synchronisation between the budgetary process and the launch of legislative programmes."
"It makes a mockery of the budgetary process and the authorities when you have the launch of the budgetary process in February and the launch of the legislative programme in November."
"Very quickly, I wish to move on to the other institutions budgets."
"This concentrates largely on preparations for enlargement."
"I understand that Parliament has made plans for new buildings to incorporate the new Member States."
"However, if we are increasing buildings in Brussels, it is important that we learn from the lessons from Strasbourg and that we do not make the same mistakes as we did with this building which generated a lot of negative publicity and reflected very badly on Parliament."
