"On another matter, in 1999 there have been large under-spends in the Community initiatives, the cohesion fund and many other areas."
"In some cases this is the second or third consecutive year when there has been a large transfer away from particular lines."
"This demonstrates the need for Parliament to monitor budget implementation more closely throughout the year."
"The subject committees must take more responsibility for monitoring the budget lines within those areas."
"If we do that then we can feed that into the budgetary process and make sure that we are more on track during the course of the year."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join the two previous speakers in expressing my thanks and praise for the work done by the general rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets."
"As regards Budget 2000, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs was working towards four objectives."
"The first of these objectives was to align the budgetary nomenclature with the priorities defined by the Treaty of Amsterdam and, in particular, the fact that henceforth the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice is one of the fundamental objectives of the Union."
"This is the reason why we proposed, with the support of the Committee on Budgets in this matter, to gather all the policies and budget lines relating to the creation of this area of freedom, security and justice under a single title comprising five chapters corresponding to the main policies dedicated to the establishment of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"As our second objective, we wished to rationalise and restructure the budgetary instruments in the sector of asylum and immigration policy."
"When drawing up the budget for 1999, we managed to create the European Fund for Refugees."
"Unfortunately, following events in Kosovo, the Council was forced to mobilise virtually all these resources in order to deal with the emergency situation in Kosovo and in the Member States."
"This is the reason why the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has proposed that, henceforth, in the area of asylum and immigration policy, there should be two budgetary instruments: firstly, a European Refugee Fund intended to finance by structural means the necessary measures relating to the reception, integration and voluntary repatriation of refugees in the event of a normal flow of refugees, and secondly, a second budget line with the objective of making it possible to take emergency measures in the event of a mass influx of refugees."
"Indeed, with this, we anticipated the request of the European Council at Tampere, as the Council considered it appropriate to envisage creating a financial reserve, in some form or another, intended to offer temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of refugees."
"Mr President, this instrument is something we have already proposed."
"Our third objective was to strengthen resources in the area of the fight against crime, and our fourth objective was a budget line making it possible to undertake measures within the framework of the Commission Action Plan 2000-2004 for combating drugs trafficking."
"Mr President, with all due respect to the rapporteurs, the Committee on Budgets will not take seriously the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market is applauding it for its work!"
"The Committee on Budgets has let down the European Court of Justice, as has the Council!"
"I know that in the political process law is frequently considered irritating."
"However, to disregard in such a way the work of the European Court of Justice on European integration and legal protection of the individual is verging on scandalous!"
"The question arises as to what role a specialised committee should continue to play when the Committee on Budgets, in a generous gesture, simply sweeps all the carefully considered, moderate proposals from the table?"
"So what role should specialised committees continue to play?"
"I fear that legal protection in this European Union will continue to be limited."
"It is all too clear who is responsible for this."
"We should not expose ourselves to the danger of limiting legal protection in the European Union, not least when we constantly talk of wanting to create an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Mr President, I took over the job of committee draftsman following the heart attack of Mr Desama who was originally to have done the work for the committee."
"We hope he will soon be back with us."
"My thanks and congratulations to Mr Bourlanges for his painstaking work on behalf of the Members of Parliament."
"The Committee on Industry covers 120 budget lines - so you can see our task is fairly complex!"
"We cover the energy programmes, those relating to industry, including small and medium firms, the research programmes under the framework programmes which of course amount to more or less 60% of the internal policy expenditure of the European Union, and the trade and technical assistance lines."
"As far as the energy lines are concerned, we were sorry that the Committee on Budgets did not follow our line in increasing the expenditure for Altener and Save."
"Those are renewable energy and energy efficiency programmes currently in conciliation."
"If we get, as expected, an increase as a result of conciliation more money will, of course, be asked for next year."
"As far as research is concerned, and after very many long discussions with Mr Bourlanges, I am interested to know what he intends to do."
"We, in the Industry Committee, do not want the research programmes broken down into dozens and dozens of lines, one for each key action."
"But we do want to monitor each key action."
"I think we have reached an agreement with the Commission that information will be provided to us at intervals and in a form that allows us to monitor that spending in the way we want to."
"I am also sorry that the Committee on Budgets did not approve moving the training of the nuclear inspectorate in the former Soviet Union from the external policy to the energy line where that training could be done far more efficiently."
"We have made this argument very clearly and we will make it again."
"As far as monitoring is concerned, we intend in our committee to take one member responsible for monitoring each of the 120 lines."
"They will be expected to follow the spending, to look at the way the projects are organised, to visit the projects and to be in a position to let us know how things are going."
"Mr President, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Budget Committee and the Budget rapporteur in particular for the good cooperation we have had with them in this first reading."
"That is code for saying that the employment committee got pretty much what it was looking for in this first reading and I am grateful for that."
"Others have referred to the Structural Funds."
"We are broadly happy with the fact that the Budget Committee agreed with our recommendations, so I would like to look instead at a number of subcategories of lines."
"One that is important to the Employment Committee is that of Social Dialogue."
"There we have ended up with EUR 4.5 million more than the European Commission were looking for initially."
"That I think is more in line with the tasks that we are facing in that important area and it includes appropriations to involve representatives from accession countries in Central and Eastern Europe which we think is very important."
"We have less than we wanted on B3-4003."
"That is a cause of disappointment because it is an important area with the expected implementation of the European company statute and, we hope, progress on the general framework for information and consultation of expenditure."
"We are happy that what we were looking for in relation to NGOs has been agreed in the first reading."
"This, we think, is a very important area - the idea of developing civil dialogue."
"I am particularly pleased that funding will continue for the NGO platform which I think is an important part of developing civil dialogue."
"Employment, of course, is one of the most important issues from the point of view of the Employment Committee."
"And here, with budget lines B5-502 and B5-503, we have combined some EUR 24 million more than the Commission' s original proposals."
"We think that is an excellent outcome."
"We are looking to implementing the employment chapter from Amsterdam and making progress in relation to the macroeconomic dialogue agreed at Cologne."
"We are therefore grateful that we have the funding to move those important issues forward."
"Two slight problems in conclusion, President."
"One is that we still have no enduring legal base for NGOs."
"I hope the Commission and the Council will make progress on that, otherwise the civil dialogue will end at the end of next year."
"That would be catastrophic."
"The other difficulty relates to technical assistance and the funds that have been transferred into the reserve."
"I hope that the Commissioner for Social Affairs will act quickly to provide the information necessary to release 50% at second reading."
"Mr President, firstly I congratulate the rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets on the work he has done this year."
"I also thank Mr Wynn for the cheerful way in which he conducts the Budget Committee, a new experience for me."
"The rapporteur has done very well given the constraints he has been under this year."
"Whilst the budget lines under the responsibility of the Committee of the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are not great in monetary terms, they play a vital role in facilitating the development of the Union' s policies, and particularly in bringing closer to the Union and realising the needs and desires of the ordinary citizens."
"The Budgets Committee rapporteur has acknowledged a number of points we have made and has enabled us to maintain spending in most areas and develop it modestly in one or two."
"I cannot thank the Council in the same way when I examine their PDB."
"They have to give greater priority to the interests and needs of citizens."
"Utilising the amounts determined last year through the conciliation on the Whitehead report, the consumer affairs budget lines will continue to build confidence amongst the public, reassuring them that we are not just a Europe open for business but are also campaigning for citizens' rights as consumers."
"The additional monies granted for the additional posts in the Veterinary Health Office in Dublin will reassure our citizens that we are taking steps to protect the quality and safety of the food on their plates."
"The new health responsibilities put into the Amsterdam Treaty can be developed using the additional monies granted on the health budget line."
"I particularly welcome the possibility of developing new strategies for dealing with mental health problems and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer' s and CJD."
"Equally, as we come to the end of the fifth action plan on the environment, the monies available to begin development of the sixth action plan are most welcome."
"If I have a disappointment, it concerns the rapporteur' s approach to the various agencies of the Union, set up by the Commission."
"I was the only draftsman, along with Mr Bourlanges, to meet the representatives of the agencies and I heard good arguments for increasing monies available to those agencies for the work they are doing with the applicant states of Eastern and Central Europe and for bringing on to the market orphan drugs that are so vital for a relatively small number of people with diseases difficult to treat."
"I feel that perhaps more consideration could have been given to the arguments they made."
"I am very disappointed the rapporteur of the Budgets Committee did not accept the validity of the arguments as I have done."
"I can only hope that in the following years we can address the problems they have identified."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, relations between the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgets were always tense during preliminary work on the budget."
"That is clear and, given that the greater part of the budget falls within the agricultural sector, it was only to be expected."
"Which is why it is particularly pleasing that, on this occasion, we can state that cooperation has been a whole lot better than in the past."
"This is in no small measure owing to the committee chairpersons and, above all, the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, but also, it should be added, to senior members of all groups."
"Nevertheless, not all the wishes of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would manage a majority today; we know that."
"All the same, we place particular importance on not accepting the Council proposals for across-the-board cuts and, above all, on providing for a moderate increase in veterinary and plant health expenditure and in sales promotion."
"Veterinary and plant health expenditure is not just agricultural expenditure, but also expenditure in terms of sensible, forward-looking consumer protection."
"The new second pillar in the matter of rural development is, of course, a special concern of the Committee."
"Here we simply cannot understand the reservation of the Council."
"We are pleased that, in its letter of amendment, the Commission opposes Parliament' s position."
"The multifunctional tasks of agriculture relating to food, maintaining the countryside, nature conservation and tourism as a job sector of the future which will expand rather than diminish are a major concern for the whole Parliament."
"The Council really must accept that, in future, changes will be made to agricultural sector expenditure across the individual blocks of which it is made up."
"But that must not lead to us pursuing the cheap option and imagining that we can simply free up money for other policy areas by making across-the-board cuts in the agricultural sector, which not only covers expenditure on farmers but also that on all rural matters."
"It should be noted that recent years have seen a convergence of Parliament and the Commission in this sector."
"The previous lack of vision on the part of the Council must give way to a more realistic approach, not least with a view to what the future holds for us in terms of the powers of Parliament, also where the budget is concerned."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee asked for an opinion, the Committee on Fisheries."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Fisheries has studied in detail the figures in the budget relating to fisheries."
"The debate was tense and lively."
"There were many differences of opinion, firstly on FIFG, secondly on support for the common European fisheries policy by the Council and the Member States, above all in relation to international fisheries agreements such as the most recent one with Morocco, and thirdly on relations between the EU and other international organisations."
"We appeal for the European Parliament at least to try to maintain the level of appropriations allocated to the common fisheries policy in recent financial years."
"On my initiative, we in the Committee have drafted three amendments which have all recently been adopted either directly or indirectly by the Committee on Budgets."
"In particular, the Committee on Fisheries is concerned about line B2-901 concerning supervision and monitoring measures by the Member States, line B2-903 concerning support for the common European fisheries policy and line B7-8000 concerning international fisheries agreements."
"The budgetary policy variously affects the three following core issues."
"Firstly: structural operations."
"At the Berlin Summit, EUR 161 million were earmarked for regions outside Objective 1 areas."
"That is a truly considerable amount, yet the commitment and payment appropriations increased in 1998 and 1999 and might, in all probability, increase further."
"Secondly: the draft budget does not allocate sufficient money for the implementation of an effective supervision and monitoring policy."
"In 1999 alone, the Member States applied for more money than was available in the EU budgets."
"This explains why the Committee on Fisheries applied for an additional sum of EUR 2 million."
"At the same time, we are understandably reassured by the fact that there is sustainable management of resources, systematic recording of basic data and an intensification of dialogue with the industry."
"Accordingly, the Committee on Fisheries then made this application a high budgetary priority."
"The third matter is obviously Morocco."
"We welcome the negotiating mandate which the Council has finally awarded."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the common fisheries policy - but I do not really need to tell you that - requires major support by the Community."
"I do not just mean financial support."
"We are facing major challenges."
"We must all make it perfectly clear that that the EU, which constitutes a superpower in the fisheries sector, is prepared to stand up for an industry which concerns numerous regions, States and citizens of the Union."
"The number and quality of jobs is of significant added value to the EU and, as we all know, also plays a crucial role in enlargement."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport and Tourism I would like to endorse warmly the approach adopted by the general rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges."
"In particular I would like to thank him for the attention he has paid to liaising with my committee over recent months and our predecessors in the past year."
"My committee has advanced five budget priorities: Objective 1, 2, Interreg, transport safety and sustainable mobility."
"I will deal with the regional policy priorities first."
"I agree with the general rapporteur' s comment that the cuts to Structural Fund appropriations are completely unacceptable."
"So what are the cuts proposed by the Council?"
"The Council is proposing that the payment appropriations are cut by EUR 433 million for Objective 1, EUR 95 million for Objective 2 and EUR 33 million for Interreg."
"This Parliament enthusiastically endorsed the Agenda 2000 Structural Fund programme."
"We expect the new Structural Fund programmes to be launched in the coming year with a flying start."
"This simply will not be possible if these cuts proceed."
"The Council is advocating a reduction in advance payments to new programmes to just 3.5%."
"In contrast, this Parliament has previously considered that advance payments at the time of first commitment should be in excess of 10% of total funds."
"In our view, if these cuts proceed regional regeneration will be put at risk."
"Existing programmes will stall before they are transformed into new programmes."
"Momentum will be lost."
"Inevitably the poorest communities in the poorest regions will suffer the most."
"The bottom line is that new jobs will not be created and existing jobs will be put at risk."
"My committee has proposed 100% restoration of these three budget lines to the level of the provisional draft budget."
"This EUR 561 million increase in Structural Fund appropriations will allow us to honour properly historic commitments and ensure the new Agenda 2000 programmes hit the ground running."
"We also endorse, incidentally, the proposed 20% entry into reserve pending the successful outcome of our discussions over the guidelines."
"I will now turn briefly if I may to transport and just say to members that I hope they are able to support the Committee on Budgets' moves to restore the cuts to the transport safety line and the cuts to the line on sustainable mobility."
"I would like to conclude by thanking all my colleagues on the committee for the support they have given me through this budget process."
"Mr President, this is the third occasion I have been asked to be draftsman for the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport."
"It is not an easy job, there is never enough money, but it is one I would rather do than be the general budget rapporteur."
"I would like to add my thanks to those already expressed to Mr Bourlanges for the support he has shown to the Culture Committee."
"Culture has not come out of the budget process as well as it wished, but we are doing rather better than the Council of Ministers' proposal and have figures close to the 1999 level."
"Our main education programme, Socrates, and the programmes of Youth and Culture have been mauled by the Council of Ministers."
"I would say that the EUR 238 million proposed for Socrates is simply not enough to do a sensible job."
"Last week I met the Committee of British University Vice-Chancellors."
"They told me that no-one - student or university - gets involved in Socrates because of the money."
"They do it because they believe in Europe and they want to make the single market work."
"But we have to ask ourselves, are the figures now so low as to make the objectives unrealistic?"
"Let us hope that the conciliation procedure taking place tomorrow will recognise the need to give a higher priority to Europe' s students and increase the funding."
"The total for our share of the budget is approximately EUR 600 million, a lot of money until you divide it by 370 million people - less than 1% of our budget, not a bottomless pit."
"In the year 2000, the EU will spend less than EUR 2 per citizen on education, encouraging young people to participate in exchange programmes or to acquire knowledge of different languages and cultures, on informing its citizens about the future developments of the Union while supporting our audio-visual industry."
"Of this scant EUR 2 support for Europe' s cultural heritage will be less than 20 cents."
"The call for the millennium must be EUR 1 per head on Europe' s culture."
"What we are currently engaged in is tokenism and symbolic expenditure only."
"Even there we manage to get it wrong."
"I do not criticise individual staff, but I receive too many complaints from prestigious organisations like the European Youth Orchestra, the European Youth Parliament, the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation - renowned organisations doing a wonderful job for Europe and our young people."
"Not one of those organisations covered by budget lines 3021 or B3-2005 has received a single euro yet in 1999 for their budgets."
"Can we make the millennium the year when our systems work."
"Mr Prodi, Mrs Reding and Mrs Schreyer, we are relying on you to do it better this coming year."
"I will finish by telling you a story."
"I live in a small village in Hampshire with a population of 2 500 people."
"My wife is the chairman of the parish council."
"I asked her what she spends on cultural, sports and social activities for the village."
"They spend EUR 50 000, or EUR 20 per head."
"So if anybody comes to me for European support, I tell them they are much more likely to get realistic support from their village council than they are from the EU."
"Mr President, the budget debate is always a key moment to express one' s political will."
"For the European Union, it represents the opportunity to reassert its firm moral duty to extend a helping hand to the developing world; the opportunity to show how much we wish to combat poverty, injustice, discrimination of all kinds, the lack of democracy, violation of human rights and attacks on freedom."
"In short, it is the opportunity to show our determination to pursue our development policy, even if we must review it here and there in order to make it more efficient and more transparent."
"From this point of view, the draft budget for the year 2000 gives rise to serious concern."
"In saying that, I am of course referring to Category 4, which Mr Bourlanges has just discussed at length."
"In addition to the fact that first the Commission and then the Council have proposed very significant reductions in all the budget lines concerned, we now have to respond to a great number of tragic situations throughout the world."
"We have to respond to the tragic situation of the Kosovar people and commit considerable resources to the reconstruction of the country."
"But we must do this by freeing up new appropriations and not by amputating all the Category 4 lines by approximately 10%."
"We cannot make the very poorest people pay for the operations of the European Union."
"We cannot set the poor of one country against the poor of another country or distinguish between good victims and bad victims, and I am very sorry that the Council to some extent presented the problem in these terms, by setting different cases of poverty against each other."
"We need sufficient appropriations to finance reconstruction in Kosovo, of course, but also for East Timor."
"And, believe me, ECHO appropriations will not be enough to fund everything, no more than transferring appropriations from one line to the next according to current priorities."
"We also have to finance the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which is a priority for the European Parliament."
"We must therefore invite the Council to review the Financial Perspective for our external policies in Category 4."
"I believe that Parliament is fairly unanimous on this point."
"I must also thank, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, both the general rapporteur for the budget, Mr Bourlanges, and the Committee on Budgets, as well as its chairman, Mr Wynn, for the stance they have taken on this matter."
"Nonetheless, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, we have decided to submit three amendments."
"The first involves the question of gender."
"Throughout Africa, women are taking action; they are the driving force, the hope of Africa for the next millennium, and we must support this movement."
"The second amendment concerns the lines of health, reproduction, and the fight against AIDS, which we propose to merge."
"This merging must not, however, be grounds for a reduction in appropriations."
"Twenty-five million people in Africa are going to die of AIDS, twenty-five million potential patients, nine tenths of whom, due to lack of scanning and lack of sex education, are unaware of the danger lurking in their body."
"AIDS will be the next tragedy in Africa."
"The third amendment which we wish to submit concerns line B7-6000 on the Community contribution to the operations of NGOs."
"The draft budget envisages a drastic reduction in the appropriations allocated to this line."
"Mr Bourlanges proposed instead to increase them, and I thank him for this."
"What we propose is to amend the wording."
"This is an amendment which does not have financial implications but which is going to enable the Liaison Committee ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, according to an ancient Chinese proverb 'women are half of Heaven' and it is only right that in the European Union women should also be involved in the budget in the same proportion."
"Perhaps that is why the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities is the last in the series of Committees to be heard this morning."
"We in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities have few priorities: firstly, actions specific to women and, secondly, gender mainstreaming in all Community policies."
"The Fourth Action Programme for Equal Opportunities expires at the end of the year 2000 and I would like to remind Commissioner Diamantopoulou of the promise which she made to the Committee to submit as soon as possible a proposal for continuing this programme so that the Fifth Action Programme can follow on seamlessly."
"DAPHNE, the programme for combating violence against children, youths and women, must pass through the second reading as quickly as possible in order to retain here also continuity with the promotion period which is expiring."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is asking here for a broad interpretation of the term ""health"" which covers not just physical but also mental and social well-being."
"The Community initiative NOW is expiring and therefore funds must be made available in the new Community initiative EQUAL specifically for promoting women."
"The labour market, education and training are key areas for the active promotion of women and accompanying measures, e.g. support for dependants, play a major role for women in particular and help to make access to the labour market easier."
"Unfortunately it is still the case that in the European Union, we need special promotional opportunities for women also."
"The same also applies to public relations work and the information society where we should direct our attention to women in the applicant countries in particular."
"The funds for the European Women' s Lobby, which also represents the interests of women in Europe, must also be made available in Budget 2000."
"Europe is facing up to its responsibility in development policy and therefore the funds here must not be cut under any circumstances."
"It makes sense to group together the budget lines B7-631 and B7-6211 into a single line."
"But this must then be allocated the corresponding monies."
"Family planning and health care for mothers and children are among the most important principles of population policy."
"Here, women are a key factor which we must use to lead developing countries out of poverty."
"The involvement of women in social, economic and political life must be expanded."
"By purposefully promoting women within population and development policy, we can help to produce a stable social background, to modify existing structures and to develop new structures."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities is proposing only a few amendments and I would invite you to support them."
"Mr President, firstly, on behalf of my group I would like in particular to warmly thank the two general rapporteurs for the correct points of focus and the correct strategy which they have developed."
"If in a public debate concerning budgetary reorganisation and savings measures we advocate a limited revision of the Financial Perspective, we are doing this as a Parliament with a clear conscience because in the past, we have always maintained that Parliament was able to responsibly set the necessary European political priorities whilst striving for greater efficiency and transparency in the budgetary procedure."
"Of course, it is not a matter of financing new political needs simply by increasing funds."
"But, on the other hand, current development makes it clear that parts of the Berlin Agreement were not quite so prudent and forward-looking and that there is a need here for further improvement."
"I would like to address the following comments to the Council and the Council Presidency: you do not need to remind us that we have a responsibility to the European taxpayer and that we too have a responsibility to exercise budgetary discipline."
"I would much prefer it if in the future the Council did its share of the homework rather better."
"It really was scandalous that the Council recommended to Parliament granting discharge of the budgets for 1996 and 1997 to the Commission."
"Since a major part of the Community budget is handled by the Member States, I would recommend that, in the interests of good housekeeping, the Council pay attention in this matter to efficiency, transparency and tidy implementation so that the Commission is not forced in future to repeatedly resort to the funds of the charging procedure."
"If this part of the job is done, then the Council can feel free to make new proposals to Parliament on how we should conduct ourselves in matters of budgetary procedure."
"I am very grateful to Commissioner Schreyer that she opposed the figures."
"What was the preliminary draft?"
"What proposals did the Council lay on the table?"
"How is this to be assessed in connection with the ceilings on financial expenditure on which we jointly agreed?"
"We certainly do not want to use up the margins which, in terms of the 1.27% of the gross national product of the Member States, now comprise EUR 9-10 billion."
"But I would also like to say very clearly that there are international commitments which we have undertaken towards developing countries, towards third countries, which cannot simply be cut across-the-board by 10%!"
"That is visionless and politically indefensible."
"That is nothing but bookkeeping!"
"The Council really should distance itself from this!"
"In this regard, I would also like to make clear that it is not just a matter of setting in motion the necessary priorities for external action, such as the reconstruction of Kosovo, but, so that it is reasonably organised and initiated, the Council must also meet Parliament halfway in the matter of how we should organise this aid and how the future reconstruction agency for Kosovo should really operate?"
"I believe that here also the Council must compromise with Parliament."
"The rapporteur correctly pinpointed the problems of the Technical Assistance Offices."
"We are prepared to give the Commission the necessary funds for administrative expenditure and the management of all these projects if in return Parliament is involved in the deliberations on reform."
"I believe that we can have good dialogue here."
"I would also like to take up what my Mr Perry said: multiannual programmes such as SOCRATES and LIFE are indeed programmes which the citizens outside expect from us and here also we should provide the quality and the necessary funds as a contribution to European development, the European integration process."
"The Commission has taken a first step towards Parliament in the form of the comments of Mrs Schreyer that we should strive for reallocation, the use of a smaller portion of the flexibility reserve and possibly an amendment to the Financial Perspective."
"This is a first step but, where cuts are concerned, there is an onus on the Commission and the Council to provide evidence line-by-line, whether it is genuinely the case that funds are not being drained away, or whether the intention is to block the politically desired priorities of Parliament."
"The onus is on you."
"Then we can have various debates."
"I believe that we still have a lot to do before December, before the second reading."
"Parliament is agreed: we need a limited revision of the Financial Perspective so that, unlike this year, we do not need to again crib our way through x number of different supplementary and amending budgets!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, firstly, Mr Böge, a minor correction: I would like to thank the three rapporteurs, not two."
"Mr Pittella also submitted an extremely important report to us;"
"I would therefore like to thank the three rapporteurs for the genuinely constructive cooperation which has accompanied the budgetary procedure this year."
"I must also thank all those who have approached us from the individual committees with their requests and who, in the majority of cases, in the vast majority of cases, have shown a great deal of understanding for the fact that in a limited framework much is desirable but not everything is possible."
"We are dealing here with monies which are of course limited, and indeed limited with our approval, but which must reflect the tasks which we have carried out at European level."
"The European Union budget for the year 2000 is a special budget, not just because it was initiated by the old Parliament, but because there was also a binding interinstitutional agreement which we adopted at the same time and which has had to be continued after the re-election."
"It is this interinstitutional agreement which restricts us, but which has also opened up additional opportunities for us; I shall come back to this."
"Thirdly, Budget 2000 is noteworthy because this year we are entering the period of the next Financial Perspective, which runs to 2006, and today we must put down important markers for the coming years."
"Fourthly, following the Treaty of Amsterdam, the European Union is in a situation of facing many new challenges, for example in matters of internal policies, the area of freedom, security and justice, the employment chapter or increased opportunities in health protection and even consumer protection."
"However, additional tasks also require that we make available the necessary funds, since otherwise it is nothing more than lip service and budgets should not be mere lip service."
"We must, therefore, clearly define our priorities and make it very clear what they are."
"We have done this in the past and will do it in the future."
"Turning to the President-in-Office of the Council, I must say: obviously for us this is about people, people in the form of the taxpayer who must raise what we spend here, but also the people to whom the money must be made available, for whom we are deciding policies."
"We are not making policies as a game between the Commission, the Council and Parliament for our own benefit, but in order to create the best possible conditions for the development of the European Union and for the people with whom we are dealing."
"In the past we have placed great importance on the citizens being able to verify that we ensure careful handling of our taxes."
"In terms of appropriations which concern commitment appropriations, Budget 2000 is lower than the budget 1999."
"Just go to the finance ministers in your Member States and tell them that they must submit a budget plan which is lower than the plan for the previous year."
"I would like to see that."
"That is the first thing we must get on top of."
"Here we are acting accordingly and anyone should be aware of this if they come to us and say that we only want increases."
"That is not the case."
"We handle the money very, very carefully."
"However, because we are working with and on behalf of people, one of our particular tasks is Category 4, external action."
"Here the Council has actually come up and said: we want to finance an important future task and an important current task which must be spread over the coming years, i.e. aid for the people of Kosovo."
"To finance that we are carrying out a 10% cut in all lines."
"Mr Böge said that this is visionless and this is a neat term."
"Are you aware, for example, that in these lines we must then cut by 10% financial aid for Israel and the Palestinian people, i.e. the aid for establishing peace in the region?"
"Are you aware that we must cut by 10% population programmes and funds for combating the scourge of AIDS in developing countries?"
"Are you aware that tackling anti-personnel mines, which is also in our budget lines, will have to be cut by 10%, or that we must cut by 10% measures by non-governmental organisations in developing countries, e.g. for street children in Guatemala or in other regions of the world because we do not want to have any vision, because we do not want to take a close look at where these funds ought to come from?"
"This cannot be the policy which we want to pursue."
"An across-the-board cut with the lawnmower is indefensible and, therefore, we must and will fight it and we will cite Category 4 as part of the interinstitutional agreement."
"Although it is difficult, we will observe the other parts of the interinstitutional agreement."
"We also have problems with other categories, e.g. Category 3, which contains the traditional focal points of our policy: environmental policy, youth training programmes, research and trans-European networks with their possibilities for creating jobs and improving our competitiveness in global dealings."
"Here also things are very tight because we are outlining ever more tasks but are not getting the necessary funds."
"We are shifting tasks from national to European level, expressis verbis, but then we are not getting the appropriate financial resources. This cannot be a sound policy."
"We need to discuss this."
"All the same, within this Category we will not endeavour to increase the funds."
"Within the interinstitutional agreement, we have established that, in future, agricultural policy too can be definitively co-decided by us."
"In future, we cannot just promote the production of individual products, but the development of rural areas."
"This is an extremely important matter for us, and finally, allow me to say something on staffing policy."
"In this too we have acted extremely responsibly, as in previous years."
"Except in two central areas, we have not provided for additional jobs."
"OLAF must be strengthened, whilst the second area concerns veterinary protection and food controls, where we have made a very modest increase of five staff."
"This much we owe to the people, who demand that we ensure that they have safe food to eat."
"These, in brief, are the focal points."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I too would like to begin by thanking the three rapporteurs for leaving no stone unturned in their work."
"I would particularly like to thank Mr Bourlanges."
"I have often noticed that it takes him less than 15 minutes for him to win various people over with his eloquence."
"We adopted the Financial Perspective in May this year and it is a shame that we did not manage an absolute majority."
"We managed an ordinary majority."
"But at least we managed some kind of majority and so I think we should respect the Perspective."
"My group believes that we should in fact do this as often as we possibly can."
"There is one category in which this it is difficult to do so and I intend to take this up again at a later stage."
"It is Category 4."
"In broad terms, I would like to lend firm support to the position adopted by the rapporteur where his policy on TAOs, the Technical Assistance Offices, is concerned."
"If we look at the events of the past year we have no choice but to make this issue as transparent as possible."
"We must know what concerns the public sector and what concerns the private sector."
"Let us just go through the various categories."
"Firstly, Category 1: agriculture."
"For around three years now we have had a new procedure for this: the ad hoc procedure."
"We are due to receive a report from the Commission at the end of this week containing the most recent estimates of how much agriculture will cost in the year 2000."
"I have no idea how the Council is able to determine where cutbacks can be made as early as July."
"A percentage cut in agricultural expenditure in all the lines is out of the question."
"It simply cannot be done."
"We must wait to see what the estimates are and after next week we will be in a position to talk about what exactly it is that agriculture needs."
"I feel that the course of action taken by the Council is very much against the spirit of the agreement."
"As far as the innovations in agricultural expenditure are concerned, Category 1B, we firmly endorse those amendments that say that we must do something about the nitrate problem in Europe."
"We also feel that something must be done in terms of a quality-control policy for European agricultural products."
"Exactly one year ago a report on this was unanimously adopted in this Parliament and it happens to be the case that I was the author of it."
"As far as Category 2 is concerned, we believe that the payment appropriations must reflect actual needs and I think that we need to have another exchange of ideas on the subject."
"Category 4 is something my group has discussed intensively and indeed it continues to do so."
"I believe that I can put the rapporteur' s mind at rest."
"A majority of people supports his position."
"The majority of people believe that it will not do to make cuts in funds for other countries that need help."
"We must pay this money."
"The same group of people feels that Kosovo is part of Europe and ought to be given priority."
"Turkey must be helped and East Timor must be helped."
"There is also another group of people, probably a minority - and the rapporteur will not be surprised to hear that I am one of them - that believes that the figures need to be scrutinised once again."
"Can Kosovo really absorb the 500 million when its gross national product is between EUR 800 million and EUR 1 billion?"
"I would be pleased to have another look at exactly how this has been calculated some time."
"I also feel that as much attention as possible must be given in the coming months to seeing if we can still solve the problem."
"I would now like to say something about expenditure on administration."
"We consider it to be essential that the rapporteur and the rapporteur for the year 2001 get down some time to answering the question as to what exactly comes under part A of the budget and what comes under part B. Turning now to Category A-30 in particular: when can an aid organisation call upon EEC funding?"
"The criteria for this are far too opaque to our mind."
"What does have a bearing on expenditure on administration?"
"We hear this day in day out and many of us are uncomfortable with it."
"The proportion of elderly people within society continues to increase."
"The pension problem in Europe must be given serious consideration at some stage."
"I too believe that this will be a fine task for the Commission to attend to."
"The phase we are about to enter between first and second reading will be particularly interesting this time round."
"I feel we must carefully examine all the headings once again for whichever way you look at it, a rigorous budget is what we need at this moment in time and that is what we are all going to have to strive for."
"Three rapporteurs and many draftsmen of opinions. Mr President, on behalf of the Green Group I would like to say how obliged I am to them for their endeavours, which have resulted in the piles of reports that I have here before me."
"Unfortunately I am only in a position to single out a few points and I intend to start with expenditure in the field of external action, since it is this area that is at the heart of this discussion on the budget."
"I share the rapporteur' s disapproval of the European Commission' s proposal to organise development cooperation under geographical headings from now on and to reduce thematic budget headings."
"It is by using the horizontal approach that we are in fact able to boost precisely those activities relating to subjects which we make our political priority: human rights, the environment and emancipation for example."
"Four years after reproductive rights were fought for at the United Nations conference in Beijing, the European budget heading on this is being torpedoed."
"I am very pleased that the rapporteur still put this right in his report."
"What is a pity is that this subject is going to be added to the budget heading on AIDS."
"Condoms seem to me to be a common denominator but there are also other aspects to the right of women to self-determination over their bodies."
"I fully support what the rapporteur has to say on financing the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"Minister Siimes reminded us of our obligations to the taxpayer and that the money must be spent wisely."
"I think that is precisely our point."
"The Kosovo pot is being filled at present by means of an across-the-board cut of 10% in expenditure on external action."
"This drip-feed method is, in every respect, a short-sighted approach of the kind used in accountancy and does not testify to a serious weighing up of priorities."
"The question that needs to be asked most is whether or not this amendment to an EU external policy area will also have its advantages in the long term."
"Mr Walter has already mentioned a number of examples."
"There will be less money for the peace process in the Middle East; less money for projects aimed at reintegrating demobilised soldiers into society."
"The lesson Kosovo has to teach us is not being taken to heart."
"There is less money being invested in conflict prevention."
"My group therefore believes that the reconstruction of Kosovo should be financed by raising the ceiling on Category 4."
"The financial assistance for East Timor and Turkey will, however, be more limited in scope."
"I agree with Mr Mulder that there is a case here for looking at the possibility as to whether the money can be found in the existing budget."
"This will certainly mean setting priorities, and that being the case, using the European budget to subsidise large enterprises' exports will not be one of my first priorities."
"It may also be possible to create some room for manoeuvre - and that is perhaps something for discussion with the Council - by taking the EUR 89 million destined for humanitarian activities in Kosovo out of the humanitarian aid pot and carry it over to the total financial package for the region."
"These differences must not, however, be allowed to conceal - and I said earlier that I share the rapporteur' s opinion - the fact that more money must be made available for external policy because it is unacceptable to allow Kosovo to suffer on account of the developing countries."
"Another major point of discussion in the Committee on Budgets was the subsidising of non-governmental organisations."
"Budget heading 3021 - Mr Perry has already made reference to this too - contains a list of organisations awarded a precise amount."
"I do not intend to call the work of these organisations into question here, but I do feel that it is appalling that Parliament is going to have to be drafted in where the granting of individual subsidies is concerned."
"It is understandable though, from the point of view of the organisations concerned, for the Commission is failing badly in its tasks if organisations have to wait a year and a half for subsidies to be awarded or if criteria are changed in the meantime."
"The amount of red tape involved has to be seen to be believed."
"That is precisely what puts a brake on initiatives from EU citizens. The reform of the Commission is therefore also going to have to play its part in improving service provision by ensuring that money is spent efficiently, in a transparent manner, and also in accordance with the political choices of the budgetary authorities."
"That is not to say that the choices made by the budgetary authority itself are always rational."
"The cultivation and export of tobacco is being subsidised to the value of almost EUR 1 billion for example."
"In addition, we spend several millions a year on informing people about the negative consequences of smoking tobacco."
"How can we still justify this?"
"Accordingly, my group proposes that we should reduce this tobacco subsidy by 10%."
"My final point, Mr President, relates to the Members' voluntary pension scheme."
"This became the talk of the town because the affiliated Members were receiving extra pensions from European resources through this arrangement."
"This will all be gone into at length during the negotiations on the Statute and I will not attempt to prejudge any decision on this at this early stage."
"What I do want us to achieve in the course of these negotiations is to see the pension fund become independent of Parliament, both in terms of its administrative and political structure."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, any budget is the expression of political choices par excellence."
"From this point of view, I think there is a singular contradiction between piling on the tasks assigned to the European Union, while subtracting the resources necessary to fulfil these tasks."
"The iron logic of the budgetary Stability Pact does not go at all well with the ambition for a Europe of greater social justice and greater solidarity."
"Let me sum up as follows for the benefit of the uninitiated, by which I mean our fellow citizens, in order to make explicit the main themes of the draft budget submitted to us by the Council of Ministers."
"Agricultural expenditure: a systematic 10% cut of all the credit lines in relation to the Commission' s preliminary draft budget, without even examining the specific requirements, case by case."
"Structural Funds: appreciable reduction in the regional aid appropriations."
"Internal policies, that is, excluding research and networks, all policies supporting employment, youth, training, the environment, culture: a reduction of nearly 18% in relation to our current budget."
"External policies, especially in the area of cooperation with the countries of the South: the chop."
"Examples have been given already, but let me add: food aid down by 9% in relation to the present, cooperation with Africa down by 12% and aid to NGOs down by 35%."
"This choice is completely unacceptable in the opinion of my group."
"The reason put forward to attempt to justify these swinging cuts is the unexpected appearance of new priorities, which are incidentally perfectly legitimate, such as aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo, our contribution to the construction of East Timor now that it has been liberated, our solidarity with the earthquake victims in Turkey and financing of a fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"This argument is inadmissible, in my opinion."
"It is not acceptable to rob Peter to pay Paul."
"While my group is by no means arguing in favour of recklessly increasing Union expenditures, we still think it necessary, if the need arises, as is clearly the case, to utilise the margin for the increase in expenditure which is authorised under the agreements signed between the Member States themselves."
"Yet, as a percentage of the gross domestic product of the Union, the volume of the Council' s draft budget is less than that of the Commission' s preliminary draft budget, which was already less than that of the Berlin Agreement which in turn was less than the ceiling set by the Edinburgh Agreements."
"Where is it all going to end?"
"We have to know what we really want to achieve and allocate appropriate resources, within reason."
"This is why my group is requesting, within the limits envisaged under the agreements signed by the Member States themselves, a review of the Financial Perspective for all the items I have just mentioned."
"And, Monsieur Bourlanges, since he who can do more can do less, we are at all events supporting the rapporteur' s proposal for the review of the Financial Perspective for external policies."
"In addition, I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members to some amendments proposed by my group in favour of a study on the application of the Tobin tax in support of the world cultural heritage classified by UNESCO within the countries of the Union, in favour of a freeze on aid to Turkey, excluding, of course, aid to the earthquake victims, until the Turkish authorities change their attitude to the Kurdish people, on the question of Cyprus and on the subject of human rights in general."
"Finally, we urgently demand that the appropriations allocated in the 1999 budget to the European Women's Lobby, which unites 1400 women' s organisations and which performs work of a high quality, are renewed in their entirety in the 2000 budget."
"As you can see, these are common sense proposals on which all progressive Members of Parliament, and even others, can and should agree."
"Mr President, the budgetary procedure for the year 2000 is henceforth included within the strict financial framework with the regulated expenditure for the period 2000-2006, as accepted by this House in the interinstitutional agreement."
"If the same stringency in budgetary matters prevails as much at the level of the States as in the Union, here it is chiefly a response to the demands of some Member States, and we know that the first victim of this stringency will be the common agricultural policy."
"A gradual decrease of expenditure is being organised deliberately, to the detriment of farmers."
"As regards the Structural Funds, European regional policy has become a real handicap for France, contrary to the myth complacently propounded by some, including, alas, the current Commissioner responsible for regional policy."
"On the subject of foreign policy, we are of course in favour of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, an essential agreement in European-Mediterranean relations, which are too often neglected by the Union."
"We are also in favour of financial support for East Timor and of aid for Turkey in the aftermath of the earthquakes."
"As for aid for Kosovo, let us one last time deplore the bombing of a European State by the countries of the Union."
"Yesterday we bombed the Balkans and today we must help to reconstruct the region and re-establish peace, but this means re-establishing peace for everyone, including the Kosovo Serbs."
"We can indeed clearly see what this increase in the total appropriation for foreign policy actions foreshadows."
"The austerity that the Financial Perspective herald will in fact be a sort of selective austerity: foreign policy rather than agricultural policy."
"The significant weakening of agricultural policy and the dubious regional policy are elements that our group could not possibly accept."
"And if there were further need, paragraph 20 of Mr Bourlanges' resolution, which considers the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non-compulsory expenditure to be seriously anachronistic, would be sufficient to justify our rejection of the budget."
"Mr President, last May this Parliament endorsed the financial framework for the period 2000-2006."
"That implied a readiness to observe the necessary budgetary discipline."
"We must assess Budget 2000 against this background."
"The rapporteur proposes that we should go way beyond the ceiling on expenditure on external action."
"He is playing for high stakes in so doing; seeing as this will only unsettle matters where the interinstitutional agreement is concerned."
"Financing important priorities such as Kosovo and East Timor is now becoming dependent on a political game that Parliament and the Council are playing over the Financial Perspective."
"Moreover, what credibility can a Parliament have when it wants to renegotiate the financial ceiling that it itself agreed with such a short time ago?"
"It is far too early to call upon Article 19 of the interinstitutional agreement."
"We must first look seriously at the various possibilities for financing these new priorities within the present framework."
"I am thinking, for example, of those areas where there was underspending in 1999 and of the possibility of making cutbacks in programmes with low expenditure figures such as MEDA."
"Next a few words about the Structural Funds."
"The current problems with the payment appropriations are evidence of the fact that the budget for the Structural Funds has been pegged at too high a level in the past."
"The rapporteur proposes to incorporate 50% of outstanding payments into Budget 2000."
"I am very apprehensive about this enforced increase in the appropriations."
"Can such an amount be absorbed and is the Commission capable of managing this extra money effectively?"
"I cannot support those who are in favour of incorporating the resources of the European Central Bank into the European Union' s budget."
"After all, this would mean the budgetary authority gaining control over the European Central Bank' s capital, which would jeopardise the independence that the ECB needs to have."
"Furthermore, the European Union is not a shareholder of the European Central Bank."
"Any distribution of profits would then go not to the EU but to the national central banks."
"We are amazed to see an amendment to the effect that the Commission is attempting to draw up a statute for European political parties."
"Only parties matching up to this blueprint would be considered for financial assistance."
"There is no way that we can go along with this attempt at centralism."
"Drawing up a statute of this kind is a matter for the political parties themselves in the first instance."
"Moreover, the party organisations reflect national cultures and diversity."
"Any attempts to squeeze the political parties into a European straitjacket will only serve to widen the gulf between Brussels and the citizens of Europe."
"On a final note, the Virrankoski report contains the umpteenth declaration of intent to revise the regulations governing travel cost reimbursement on the basis of costs actually incurred."
"But are we not getting to the point when it is time to convert words into deeds?"
"Our group put forward an amendment aimed at achieving this but the Committee on Budgets rejected it."
"That was a lost opportunity and it sends out the wrong signal to the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur and, with a great deal of respect for the work he has done, thank him very sincerely for this draft budget which is courageous and innovative in many aspects."
"The rapporteur is to be praised for having achieved it by means of a budgetary procedure which has run its course with the utmost smoothness, even if Parliament is in the process of issuing a major challenge to the Council - a challenge which, in my opinion, is worth accepting."
"I am referring, obviously, to the Financial Perspective and the need for Europe to prove itself worthy of the role it wishes to play in the world, without making an over-complicated issue of the budget of the Union."
"In 1999 we had a budget - I say this to the ladies and gentlemen of the Council in particular, I am reminding you of this because it is a matter which affects us all - in 1999, Commissioner, we had a budget of EUR 96 billion."
"This year, a milestone year, what with the war in Kosovo, the events in East Timor, the earthquakes in Turkey and the commitments of a Union that wishes to take on more responsibility in the international arena, the Council is proposing a budget of EUR 92 billion, that is, EUR 4 billion less than the budget for the previous year."
"The Edinburgh perspectives set us an ever higher ceiling and the Council gives us an ever more limited budget, meaning that it will be necessary to cut back on actions in the field of development, for example, or human rights and many other actions, in order to finance the priorities which have been set, and it is not our fault if Europe is the great paymaster of foreign policy."
"We shall be responsible for the payments, while other people are responsible for the policy, and I hope that this is going to change."
"Parliament will therefore do well, on Thursday, to ask you to go beyond these Financial Perspective."
"Do we wish to finance reconstruction in Kosovo?"
"Fine."
"Do we wish to assist the integration of Turkey, including by subsidising its immediate dramatic needs?"
"Do we have a new nation emerging into the international arena after all these massacres which have taken place?"
"Then, let us finance these policies, for heaven' s sake."
"We have an interinstitutional agreement that allows us, if exceptional events require, to go beyond the Financial Perspective, so why not do it?"
"That would be EUR 1.5 billion more."
"It will still be less than the 1999 budget, but I think that the citizens of Europe will clearly see that this endeavour is not only logical, but also perfectly feasible at the level of the budgets of our Member States."
"We would therefore do well to proceed in this way and I think that Parliament should follow through and, if necessary, demand that we have recourse to the former Article 203 of the budget."
"A brief word on TAOs."
"There too I think we are demonstrating great pragmatism."
"I thank the rapporteur very much."
"We have an interim solution which, I think, will enable us, by means of dialogue with the Commission, to find an agreement on a definitive solution."
"I am pointing out this pragmatic aspect of our report for the year 2000 and I would compare it to policies which were rather more extremist in which a clean sweep was made of mini-budgets and then one found oneself with one or two thousand TAOs which could not be managed because the project had been axed in the meantime without any thought as to the consequences."
"So, I congratulate the rapporteur."
"As regards political parties, may I say that, frankly, asking the Commission to lay down the status of political parties - I am referring to the contribution of the last speaker - is neither fair nor worthy."
"Mr President, like others who have already participated in this debate I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs, but in particular Mr Bourlanges."
"In his opening remarks, he clarified for us the perspective for the 2000 budget in putting forward the idea that we have to have more programmes, we have to have more countries and we have to have less money."
"There seems to be a contradiction here which, in the longer term when we come to enlargement, when we come to a new intergovernmental conference, we are quite clearly going to have to resolve in the context of our budget procedures."
"For my part, I would like to focus my remarks on three aspects which concern the running of European policies and the attitudes which we have taken in Parliament in previous years to these aspects."
"This is in the particular context of the Commission."
"We, as a parliament, want to make sure that accountability is seen to work for those who elected us and to make sure that we have value for money in the running of the programmes."
"The first item in internal policy refers to information policy."
"In the last Parliament we wanted to make sure that we had proper functioning interinstitutional cooperation."
"We made progress in that respect by making sure that in terms of the general information lines, in terms of the specific campaigns, we had good cooperation on both sides."
"But we did not arrive at a common framework for this interinstitutional cooperation as we in Parliament had wanted."
"There is some degree of concern at some of the initial moves the Commission is now making in its information structures which we in Parliament will keep a close eye on. In particular, we had asked in the last Parliament, and indeed in previous Parliaments, for the Commission and Parliament offices to work closely together in the Member States."
"I have put down an amendment, our group has put down an amendment, to make sure that we can have a report from the Commission on how far this has gone."
"There are still one or two countries where the Commission and Parliament are separate in terms of structure and we need to be particularly vigilant in instances where more than 75 or 80% of the appropriations go into paying for salaries and buildings rather than adequate information policies."
"Secondly, in terms of external policy, particularly in terms of Kosovo, the hearing we organised a few days ago with the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets, was very revealing to me, in particular the fact that this is not a short-term commitment."
"We had evidence from Mr Bildt, Mr Kouchner, Mr Hombach and then from all the other agencies, that this is a long-term problem we have in front of us."
"We must, therefore, make sure not only that we get proper coherence between the agencies working on the ground but also Madam President-of-the Council, that we do not take decisions which mean that we are spending money futilely because of a Council decision that we must have some people removed some 100 miles away in another place."
"We must make sure that when we come to Mrs Pack' s report later this week we take the right decisions and that the Council understands Parliament' s feelings on that."
"In the longer term, we must ensure that we have vision and - as you said Commissioner - we need to have the idea of building civil society in the longer term, not just as some kind of short-term project."
"Kosovo and stability in the Balkans must be a long-term project."
"It is us, as Europeans, who have to take that responsibility."
"We cannot expect others to take on that particular responsibility for us."
"I therefore welcome the idea of a working committee between the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets."
"We must make sure not only that funds are properly spent but that the ideas which are coming through are properly coordinated."
"Lastly, in terms of administration policy, there are the Technical Assistance Offices."
"I would underline what Mr Böge said to the Council."
"The Council has been absent from this debate on discharge."
"With nonchalant ease, they have gone through approving the 1996, the 1997 discharge, and it has been up to us in Parliament to press for change at every turn."
"Therefore in terms of EU reform we are right, as a parliament, to say that we do not wish to see new posts until we know where the posts are going."
"What are the real needs of the Commission?"
"Secondly, we are right to say that we should not have Technical Assistance Offices performing tasks through temporary officials in what are meant to be permanent posts for the Commission."
"We must find some way of having a dialogue between the institutions over the next 12 months to make sure that these reforms take place and that we have the right kind of criteria for making sure that we are getting value for money from the staff."
"Otherwise - and I will end on this proposal: we must start cutting programmes if we do not have the proper staff resources available to run them, because ultimately we must make sure that these processes are accountable and we must make sure that we get value for money in the system."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group in relation to the Virrankoski report."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good approach to this issue and to say that the Socialist Group broadly agrees with the matters he has raised."
"On the issue of staffing, which affects all the institutions, we take the view that we have to find a balance between financial prudence and the ability of the institutions to do their job properly."
"As we have just heard, there is a danger of the institutions taking on new tasks which they are unable to resource properly."
"Mr Virrankoski has just about got the balance right."
"We would have liked to be a bit more generous to Parliament in terms of staffing resources."
"On the European Parliament section of the budget, we firstly welcome the fact there has been a marked change in attitude between the Bureau and the Budgets Committee."
"As someone who sits on both, perhaps I can comment on this."
"The way in which the Bureau and the Budgets Committee have worked together to come to a compromise on Parliament' s budget has been very constructive."
"I want to highlight just three issues within Parliament budget."
"One is the issue of the Members' Statute."
"There was a suggestion that we should put money on the line for a Members' Statute."
"The Socialists rejected this idea, not in any way to weaken our approach to the Members' Statute; through our comments we indicate we strongly support the notion of a Members' Statute but believe it is now up to the Council to respond to Parliament' s proposals in this area."
"Similarly with political parties, the Socialist Group strongly supports the notion of European political parties."
"But you simply cannot put money on the line without having an idea of who is going to qualify for this money, what purposes the money is going to be used for, and so on. Parliament has produced an excellent report - the Tsatsos report - in this area."
"It is now up to the Commission to bring forward a proposal on how we might implement the proposal for a European political party."
"Once that happens, again the Socialists would be happy to negotiate the idea of putting money on the line."
"Finally, and perhaps something that you and I, Mr President, take a personal interest in, the notion of regional offices."
"The Bureau of Parliament last night decided that Edinburgh, Marseilles, Milan, Munich and Barcelona should all have regional offices."
"We have put money in the reserve in the budget."
"When we come to second reading, I hope we can release that money from the reserve and get on with implementing the policy of regional offices."
"They are vital in terms of Parliament' s strategy of bringing Parliament closer to the people."
"The only other institution' s budget I want to talk about specifically and briefly is the Court of Justice' s budget."
"My view, and I am sure the view of many in this House, is that justice delayed is often justice denied."
"It is quite clear that the Court of Justice has not had the resources to carry out its tasks properly."
"The Council has made a limited gesture in terms of improving staffing of the Court."
"Parliament wants to go further."
"I hope we will support the rapporteur' s proposal here."
"In particular, delays in interpretation and translation are causing major problems for the Court."
"We should do all in our power to resolve this."
"The Virrankoski report does that."
"I turn briefly to the Bourlanges report which is outwith my own remit."
"I put on record my support for Mr Bourlanges' approach to the 2000 budget."
"He is absolutely right to reject the 10% across the board crude reduction in development lines."
"It is true, as the Council says, that some development lines have not been used well."
"It is true that some suffer from underspend."
"But simply to say that we cut them all by 10% is a very crude mechanism."
"The Council needs to make a more refined proposal before we come to second reading."
"At the moment, the rapporteur is absolutely right."
"Money for East Timor, Kosovo and other emergencies like Turkey, has to come from new money unless the Council makes a more refined proposal."
"To pick up Mr Elles' last point on the Technical Assistance Offices, again, the Council has been silent on this."
"It was the root of the problem with the Santer Commission."
"What the rapporteur has said in his report is absolutely right on this issue."
"Again, the Socialist Group gives him 100% backing."
"Mr President, I should also like first of all to express my appreciation of the sterling work which Mr Bourlanges, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Pittella have done as rapporteurs for the budget."
"As a Liberal, I personally have the basic attitude that we should be thrifty when it comes to public expenditure."
"In fact, I also think we have tried to live up to that basic principle when discussing the budget."
"I therefore want to emphasise that, when a majority of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party gives its backing to the strategy which the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, has devised and which aims at rejecting the 10% general reduction in external expenditure, this does not reflect an unwillingness on our part to make savings."
"It is, on the other hand, a rejection of the way in which the Commission and the Council have proposed financing the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"As has been mentioned many times today, it is unreasonable that poor countries in Africa should in this way finance the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"All the more so when, with the signing of the interinstitutional agreement in the spring, it was anticipated that there would be a need to find funds specifically for Kosovo and that the reconstruction would be expensive."
"It is important that a solution to this problem is found, and it is my hope that, in the negotiations, the Council will show the required flexibility so that we might find a solution within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement."
"We have started with the assumption that EUR 500 million should be found for the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"That is the Commission' s figure."
"But, in the Committee on Budgets, we have also, through a conference among other things, received information to make us question whether that figure has not been set rather too high for the year 2000 and whether we might not be concerned here with a more long-term commitment."
"This also indicates that a great deal of effort will have to be made to find a solution involving all the various institutions."
"As a new member, I have been very pleased, during the Committee on Budgets' negotiations, to experience the discipline which characterises its work."
"We have tried to live up to an unwritten rule about avoiding dotting the ""i"" s and crossing the ""t"" s too much when it comes to noting specific budget appropriations."
"These tie down the administration and can lead to far too little flexibility and a lack of accountability if we go too far in that direction."
"Noting specifically which funds are to be earmarked for which purposes is obviously an important tool for Parliament when preparing a budget."
"But any tool can become blunt and lose its power if it is not used with care."
"Despite our attempts at restraint, there are many examples of dotting the ""i"" s and crossing the ""t"" s in the budget, including many good examples."
"I think that in principle, however, it is goals and frameworks we ought to be aiming for to as great an extent as possible."
"It is our task as politicians to establish goals and set the general frameworks."
"We need to beware of specifying too much detail."
"In this connection, I want vigorously to back up Mr Virrankoski' s proposal that budgets should be prepared and controlled on the basis of activities and in relation to goals, as he has recommended they should be in his report."
"Clearly, the circumstances of the past year - what with the Commission' s departure and the reports by the Committee of Independent Experts - provide a reminder that we need to secure for ourselves a foundation which can give us confidence that resources are being administered in a reasonable way."
"There have been good signals from the new Commissioners, and I think we are all looking forward to fruitful cooperation with both Mrs Schreyer and Neil Kinnock, but they must live with the burden of what we have experienced."
"This is also the background to why so much money has been placed in reserve."
"The Technical Assistance Offices, or TAOs, have been established by the Commission as a roundabout way of getting administration into those areas which could not be administered with the given resources."
"And the Experts' report shows that the necessary follow-up and supervision was not in place."
"We need the Commission to provide realistic assessments of the need for administrative resources."
"This is the background to the situation in which payments into the technical accounts have been placed in a reserve, and there is a need for open dialogue concerning future administration."
"As I say, those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party attach a lot of importance to a solution being found which all three institutions can live with. The next few years will demand a lot from us."
"There will continue to be major external tasks to consider."
"Enlargement of the European Union will necessitate a constant re-ordering of our priorities, and we need to continue tidying things up internally."
"The prior condition for tackling these things is constructive cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I think we are heading for some difficult debates given that Parliament is pretty much agreed - even my group - that we oppose the across-the-board 10% cuts in funding."
"We would like to thank Mr Bourlanges for his preliminary work, even though we certainly envisage the need to amend some points of the negotiations."
"It has already been mentioned by Mr Mulder that there must still be a critical review of expenditure on Kosovo, of the assessment of expenditure on Kosovo."
"As a group, we also consider that there must also be a critical review of the fisheries agreement."
"In these areas also we must ensure more efficiency, more ecological principles."
"There are some points where a critical review may be necessary, e.g. the export agreement with Japan."
"Nevertheless, we believe that additional tasks - and in this case many additional tasks would pass to the European budget - must also mean additional funds being allocated."
"We therefore need a critical review of the Financial Perspective."
"We would like to thank the Commissioner for intimating this."
"In any case, we are prepared to cooperate constructively in this matter."
"We think that Kosovo can certainly be financed with fresh funds, but we consider that the other points - Turkey, the fisheries agreement, etc. -must be financed by the budget for the current appropriations."
"However, Parliament has also clearly shown in today' s debate that it is increasingly aware of its responsibility, not just insofar as concerns the effective use of funds, but also the discharging of funds."
"It is not just a matter of introducing new budget lines and critically reviewing whether all the budget lines can be used correctly and effectively; it is also about ensuring during the course of the year that the programmes are run properly."
"We are also responsible for this."
"I hope that these were not just isolated declarations today, but that in the coming year Parliament will also assume the responsibility of critically reviewing in all the Committees whether the appropriated funds are also being discharged properly."
"I would like to briefly address another subject that has also been mentioned here and which will be important."
"We must, in order to increase trust in the European institutions, also increase the efficiency of parliamentary work itself."
"In this regard, we have already heard several key points today."
"Firstly, it is a matter of swiftly developing a Members' Statute, an Assistants' Statute."
"Also, and here I am opposing some of the previous speakers - it is a matter of developing a European Parties' Statute since I think that, in the area of party financing at European level also, we need more transparency, more efficiency."
"The voters must know what funds are available in these areas."
"This, of course, requires that we clearly define what a European Party is and what sort of work is done at European level."
"It also, of course, requires that we critically and precisely determine what in this case the term ""European area"" means."
"How far does the European Union' s coordinating task go?"
"It cannot just be about the EU."
"It must also cover enlargement in the east."
"Funds must also be made available for this."
"But in all these areas we need more transparency."
"Finally, one more area in which I think that Parliament must also do its homework properly is the whole question of estate management."
"Here, in my opinion, mistakes have been made in the past."
"We must therefore ensure that in future the monies in this area are used much more efficiently and purposefully!"
"Mr President, the first budget of this new financial framework confirms and reinforces the grave apprehensions we had during the debates on Agenda 2000 and on the interinstitutional agreement that goes with it."
"Indeed, the most striking point about this budget is its obvious lack of appropriations with which to confront specific objectives, given that it is in Category 4 on external action and cooperation that this shortfall is most evident."
"On this matter, I would like to express not only my strong disagreement with the indiscriminate horizontal cuts that the Council is proposing in this Category, but also to state my general agreement with the strategy that the rapporteur is proposing to us. I also agree with the fact that in essence, it is aiming for a revision of the Financial Perspective so that they will respond to new priorities without previous objectives being affected as a result."
"Within the scope of this strategy, we are pleased to note that Timor is one of this budget' s priorities, and we particularly welcome the fact that the rapporteur has accepted the insertion of a new heading in order to deal with the reconstruction of that region, which is moreover what we on the Committee on Development and Cooperation had proposed and approved."
"This is, moreover, the only way in which we can respond to the new situation in Timor, whilst at the same time respecting the legal basis for intervening in the right way."
"The proposal of EUR 30 million in payment appropriations, however, seems insufficient to us."
"This is why we want to see this merely as the starting point for a final sum which will be established in the near future and in the context of the Conference of Donors, which is in progress and in which the European Union is participating."
"By the same token, we would only accept the insertion of this new heading for Timor in a multiannual perspective to be considered within an international framework."
"One final, very specific point, which is nevertheless of great importance: it is essential to ensure - if this has not already been done - that under heading B7-6000, concerning non-governmental organisations, there is a reference to the Liaison Committee in the respective commentary."
"Indeed it would be absurd if this did not happen."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Bourlanges for his competence and the great balance he has shown in preparing this budget."
"However, I must emphasise the fact that this year' s budget cannot fulfil the objectives set at the beginning, that is, a revival of the Union' s economy and, above all, growth in employment."
"Indeed, if we start by cutting back the budgets by 10% and we hit sectors like industry, trade, transport and in some cases, even agriculture, we will not be able to revive our economy and become more competitive with regard to competitors such as the United States and NAFTA."
"We must not forget that these are our real competitors and that therefore, only budgetary policies aimed at protecting investments and economic growth will allow us to lay the foundations for a Union which will certainly be stronger from a structural and economic point of view."
"In view of this, I therefore propose that during the next period, we no longer analyse the programmes and their related credit lines for periods of four, five or six years but for shorter periods - one or two years at most - as the rationales of the market and investment in a now global economy no longer correspond to the criterion which the budget itself was built on."
"In fact, everything is moving much more quickly and much more competitively on the market."
"This will allow us to intervene immediately in specific sectors and, at the same time, to verify whether our budgetary policy is on course, moving in the direction we set out."
"In short, this is a budget which must be revised by including new credit lines with regard to international interventions."
"I therefore agree with the line set out in Mr Bourlanges' report, although nothing must be taken away from the other credit lines that have already been allocated."
"At the same time, however, we must endeavour to alter the content and rationale of the budget to take into account the challenges that the Union will have to face over the coming years, in particular the fact that the real enemy to be overcome within the individual States is unemployment."
"Mr President, the budget line for reproductive health has been halved by the Council and the Commission."
"But, every minute, 380 women become pregnant."
"Of these pregnancies, 190 are unwanted or unplanned."
"One hundred and eleven women experience pregnancy-related complications and 40 have unsafe abortions."
"Every single minute, there is a death following a pregnancy-related complication."
"Approximately 300 million women suffer from short- or long-term illnesses because of complications in pregnancy."
"That is more than a quarter of all women living in developing countries."
"The risk of dying in pregnancy or while giving birth is 1 in 8 in Angola, while it is 1 in 8,700 in a country like Switzerland."
"Only 53% of women in developing countries give birth with a doctor, nurse or midwife present."
"Seventeen per cent give birth completely alone."
"At least 60% of all pregnant women in developing countries are anaemic."
"We know what it means for a family if the mother is sick or dies."
"The mother' s income goes on food, clothes, schooling and health care."
"If there is no access to reproductive health facilities, there are consequences for the whole family, not least the children who, in the worst case, also die when the mother dies or else stop going to school and become malnourished."
"Reproductive health is cheap, costing EUR 2 or 3 per woman per year."
"It is also cost-effective when one considers the consequences for the whole family."
"This year, almost 600,000 women will die in pregnancy or while giving birth."
"By far the majority of these fatalities could be avoided."
"It is therefore incredibly important to maintain this particular budget line for reproductive health."
"A lot has been said about Kosovo."
"Of course, I completely share the view that it is outrageous to let poor countries pay for the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"Mr President, the draft budget for the year 2000, EUR 92 billion, a margin of flexibility for our Parliament of EUR 1.5 billion taking into consideration the Financial Perspective, the across-the-board reductions in all appropriations, or at least in appropriations for agriculture, the lack of ambition, and the usual thin spreading of resources and budgetary gimmickry; in other words, it is a draft budget with no great innovations. It is to Mr Bourlanges' great credit that he attempted to make the discussion more lively by introducing technical objections."
"He presented a fine study with a sort of pot pourri of everything he has written since March and all that with the attitude of an official of the French Supreme Audit Office."
"Well, that is all very well."
"The only innovations are not deliberate."
"It is the first budget of the 21st century, one which will indeed see the dissolution of the European Union following the Seattle Conference where the Community preference will be abandoned."
"It is the first budget to implement the Financial Perspective for 2000-2006, which Mr Bourlanges is also asking that we review."
"It is the first budget which is going to verge on the EUR 100 billion mark if we adopt the amendments which Mr Bourlanges is proposing and, speaking of Mr Bourlanges, who I might call the financier from ""Uncle Jean Monnet' s Cabin"" , this is a first for him, his first report following the general report, after that of Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, Mr Tillich, Mr Lamassoure or others."
"Apart from the change in presentation in the form of Mr Bourlanges, 2000 is much like 1999 as far as the budget is concerned."
"Firstly one finds once again the European Parliament' s ongoing aspiration to make its presence felt. This has been a constant ever since 1979."
"This is a natural tendency on the part of all parliaments throughout the world."
"The judgements of the Court of Justice of the European Communities have multiplied."
"The 1995 budget was even cancelled, and President Hänsch refused to sign, and, every single time, there is this conflict about NCE and CE."
"Well, Mr Bourlanges is bringing us back to this bellicose atmosphere, even quoting Marshal Foch, which is appropriate, I suppose."
"In the backwater of the European budget there is not enough room for two crocodiles, the crocodile of the European Council and the crocodile of the European Parliament which, after eating up the Commission by toppling Santer, now wants to eat the Council too."
"So Mr Bourlanges proposes to be voluntarist, he wishes to increase Community expenditure by 7%, he is an ultraliberal who has forgotten the budget rationing pact which he wanted to inflict on others, and he is doling out money because Christmas is coming, 135 million for Turkey, 500 million for Kosovo."
"First we bomb, then we rebuild."
"And then there is even East Timor."
"It is said that it is old monarchs who concern themselves with foreign policy."
"Of course, the farmers are not entitled to the same largesse, unless they move to Turkey."
"The only problem, obviously, is that if you keep increasing expenditure, one day you will also have to increase revenue and contemplate a Community tax."
"But in the meantime, well, Italy will pay, and France will pay another EUR 600 million."
"I shall conclude, as Mr Bourlanges quoted Saint Matthew, by quoting Jesus, asking Simon Peter."
"""What thinkest thou, Simon?"
"Of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute?"
"Of their own children, or of strangers?"
"Peter saith unto him, Of strangers."
"Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free."""
"But with Mr Bourlanges' tendencies, how long will this freedom last?"
"Mr President, this budget is fundamental to the development of Europe in the next few years."
"It is the first budget in accordance with the new Financial Perspective and institutional harmony will depend very much on its efficient execution, and without that harmony - and I would like to underline this - it will be very difficult to implement a genuine European policy."
"We must remember that the previous Parliament approved, in May, the Financial Perspective for 2000-2006 and the interinstitutional agreement."
"Parliament approved them by a simple but, nevertheless, clear majority."
"We must also remember that the Berlin Council approved the Financial Perspective by means of an extraordinarily complicated consensus, which began with some extremely divergent standpoints between the Governments and, furthermore, with a European Commission which had resigned and a European Parliament which was at the end of its mandate."
"What I mean by this is that it is now of fundamental importance to defend the Financial Perspective."
"Only in this way for example can we guarantee the financing of the Union' s structural policies."
"It is clear however that the interinstitutional agreement itself provides for a review of the Financial Perspective if necessary."
"If the Council has not found any other way of financing the reconstruction of Kosovo other than an across-the-board cut in the external activities of the Union, it is logical that the European Parliament will want to defend those lines."
"In any case, we believe that the notion of defending the validity of the approved Financial Perspective and the notion of needing to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo by means of a limited review of that perspective, are compatible notions."
"If this is the proposal which Commissioner Schreyer is making, I hope that this Parliament will welcome it."
"With regard to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, we should point out that the commitment presented by the rapporteur on the first reading calms the fears of a significant section of the Community fishing industry."
"We must remember that the fisheries agreement with Morocco affects almost 30,000 citizens of the Union and that regions such as Galicia, the Canary Islands and Andalusia have a large proportion of their fleet fishing in Moroccan waters."
"It is normal - and this is the view of the rapporteur and my own group - that, at the beginning of the budgetary process, we should be concerned to see that in the first reading no commitment had been specified for these EUR 125 million."
"Nevertheless, and bearing in mind that fishing policy is a Community policy whose funding is separate from the Treaties, a formula has been found between all of us that allows the Council' s amendments not to be rejected in the first reading, including those referring to fishing, but rather defers their approval until such a time as financial agreement is reached with the Council."
"We would have preferred to separate the fishing agreement from the rest of the Community' s external activities."
"In our opinion, this is a confusion of two categories of expenditure and two different kinds of problem."
"However, it is also clear that the outgoing Commission did not include any indication concerning the renewal of the agreement in its preliminary draft and, for this reason, did not include any appropriation in the reserve."
"If the outgoing Commission had been willing to take that political step, we would not now have to wait for the second reading."
"We repeat however that we will have a political commitment on the part of the European Parliament to prioritise the funding of the said fisheries agreement."
"This will serve to calm the fears of all those families and economic sectors which urgently need this agreement."
"Finally, what we do ask the rapporteur and the representatives of the Council is that an enormous effort be made in terms of negotiation."
"We do not want to reach the second reading with a proposal to break the interinstitutional agreement and thereby end up with no Financial Perspective."
"I repeat: we need a Financial Perspective and we need the interinstitutional agreement."
"But we also need credible, and therefore well financed, external European activities."
"We need both things."
"And we want the Member States to confront these exceptional circumstances, and the reconstruction of Kosovo is an exceptional circumstance, with exceptional solutions which must not be sought by means of a simple across-the-board cut imposed on Parliament in their lines and programmes."
"The general rapporteur has said this: we are in a paradoxical position which requires a real solution."
"The priorities are clear."
"Now, representatives of the Council, the negotiation must begin."
"Mr President, it is customary to congratulate and thank the rapporteurs and I will do that as chairman of the committee, and there are three of them - let us not forget that."
"First of all, Mr Virrankoski who has done a thorough job."
"He came to this position halfway through the year; his attitude has been exemplary and he really deserves the congratulations of Parliament, not just the committee."
"Secondly, Mr Pittella who, as a new member, came to the committee and has made quite a significant point about the phasing-in of the ECSC funds."
"It is quite an innovative approach and he should be congratulated."
"And while we are giving out congratulations I shall also congratulate the Commissioner on her speech which was politically realistic."
"Well done Commissioner!"
"But the main congratulations go to Mr Bourlanges."
"When Mr Bourlanges began he said it was the first time he had had 15 minutes to speak in Parliament, and my immediate thought was ""yes and that will not be long enough"" ."
"Sure enough it was not long enough - he exceeded it by almost a minute and still had not said half the things he wanted to say."
"Mr Bourlanges, I congratulate you on your approach to the budget."
"It is fair to say there has never been a dull moment."
"You are pragmatic, innovative and, most importantly, serious."
"That is shown in your attitude towards the BATs."
"You may well be known as ""BATman Bourlanges"" although I cannot quite see you with a cape and mask, wearing underpants outside your pants, but you have done an extremely good job on the BATs!"
"This first reading is predominantly about the asterisk amendment concerning Kosovo, the Morocco fisheries agreement, East Timor and Turkey, which was mentioned by the rapporteur."
"I have to stress this point quite clearly to the Council and - to a lesser extent - to the Commission because I think they understand."
"We take the interinstitutional agreement extremely seriously."
"There are forces within this Parliament which would quite happily see it scrapped tomorrow but as far as I am concerned my job - and the job of Parliament per se - is to defend the agreement which we made earlier this year."
"We have shown that we are prepared to do that."
"If we were against it the Category 3 ceiling would have been exceeded, and on that point, incidentally, all three institutions have a problem with the amount deemed necessary for codecision lines such as Socrates."
"This is not just a problem for the year 2000, it is an ongoing problem."
"Can I say to both the presidency and the Commission that this is something we need to find a solution to together and quickly."
"The amendment for Category 4 should not be seen as Parliament just flexing its muscles."
"I hasten to add this is not a threat - though that may sound like a contradiction of something I have to say a little later on."
"But I do not want the Council to see it as a threat."
"We do not want the Council thinking that we think we have them ""by the Balkans"" so to speak; we are not trying to squeeze them too hard, though that may be the wrong phrase to use."
"It should be seen as an invitation for our two institutions to sit down and agree a solution."
"That is what we should be aiming to do, President-in-Office."
"We look forward to the proposal from the Commission which will come forward next week."
"In the light of what Mrs Schreyer has said, I look forward with anticipation."
"I hope the Council can do the same."
"But I do need to stress to the Council that this is not the Grand Old Duke of York marching his troops up the hill, just to march them down again."
"This is not just some act by Parliament to mount a show of force, but at the end of the day Member States will put pressure on individual Members whose parties are in government to get us to change our mind."
"Things do not work like that because of the majorities that now exist within this Parliament."
"If we do not get an agreement on the revision of the Financial Perspective especially, I am fairly certain that Article 272 will be invoked."
"There is no doubt about that and Council should be in no doubt about that whatsoever."
"That it is not a threat, it is a statement of intent."
"Let me reiterate the philosophy of two of my predecessors: Mr von der Vring and Mr Samland."
"I want the Council to take back this message."
"What we are fighting for is Parliament' s rights, we are not fighting for money."
"It is about the rights of this Parliament and that is the message they have to understand through and through."
"Once they understand that message I am quite sure that the discussions we should and will have will be fruitful."
"I know the political constraints that Member States are working within, we are all serious about - as you put it - the principles of cost efficiency and rigour."
"We abide by those same principles but in this instance, after what Parliament has fought for over the years, this revision of the interinstitutional agreement, a revision of the Financial Perspective as outlined in the interinstitutional agreement, is extremely important to Parliament."
"I hope that is understood."
"Mr President, I would like to add my voice to those who have already expressed their satisfaction and support for the basic outline in the Bourlanges report."
"Mr Bourlanges stands before a double paradox - a debate on the budget which deals with expenditure but not income, and then a budget subject to the double conflicting pressure of an increase in the tasks of the European Union and an actual trend towards reduction of the European GDP rate which is reflected in the Union' s budget."
"The way out of the paradox has been suggested to us and means not accepting tomorrow' s priorities being financed by the sacrifices and priorities of today and yesterday, and consequently, financing new, indispensable priorities of external actions by increasing the Financial Perspective for Category 4."
"I hope that the European Parliament will follow the rapporteur' s statement and that the Executive Commission and the Council will accept the consequences of this."
"However, I do not think that everything can come down to difficult negotiations that seek a possible compromise between new resources and the sacrifice of former priorities."
"It would be a short-sighted attitude which is largely hypocritical and out of keeping with the irreversible prospect of an extension of the Union' s competences and geographical enlargement of the Union' s strategy."
"This prospect is dictated by the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, but even more so by the change in global political balances following the war in Kosovo."
"One of the few and sure guarantees of stability and prosperity in Europe which cannot be ignored is Europe' s active presence on the world stage and its unequivocal, open attitude towards progressive enlargement policies, even towards south-east Europe and the Balkans in the perspective of that parallel virtual enlargement of peace and security which Mr Prodi has given us a glimpse of."
"In these circumstances, we need to make a bold choice."
"We need the hypothesis which is contained in Mr Bourlanges' proposal to be set out for all to see."
"We have to say that the emperor is naked!"
"Today the European Parliament, the Executive Commission and the Council have to take on the responsibility for opening a broad, thorough debate in full view of the European taxpayers."
"In short, we need to ask ourselves whether or not the moment has arrived to entrust the European institutions with greater shares of financial resources."
"This must not lead to any increase in public spending in Europe, but requires individual countries, all the European countries, to be willing to transfer the resources corresponding to the de facto transfer of competences to the Union."
"The increase in the Community budget will and can correspond to a reduction in national budgets."
"The task we have before us is a formidable one which can no longer be avoided, for otherwise the all the European institutions will lose credibility."
"I hope that Parliament will take this path."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to give my reaction to the rather naïve comments made by Mr Martinez about Kosovo."
"The money that we want to spend in Kosovo, Mr Martinez, will largely be spent on rebuilding the 80,000 homes that were destroyed there."
"Those homes, Mr Martinez, were destroyed not by NATO but by your friends there, that is to say, by certain Serbian paramilitary organisations."
"That is the truth of the matter and there is no other."
"I am indebted to the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets for their support for Amendment No 69, which I submitted with the support of Mrs Van Lancker and Mr Beysen, as well as most of the Flemish and French-speaking Belgian Members."
"It provides for an appropriation of EUR 50 million to be taken up in the financial reserves for financing the activities to be undertaken by those producers or Member States wishing to set up an integrated quality control system for the whole food chain."
"That will make it possible for us to restore the consumer' s faith in his or her food."
"And so I will take the opportunity at this plenary sitting to say that it is my express wish that the Council should lend its support to this amendment."
"Secondly, I would like to affirm my support for paragraphs 13, 17 and 57 of the Bourlanges report."
"Paragraph 57 relates to the allocation of additional posts to OLAF and the Veterinary Office in Dublin."
"I endorse what Mrs Morgan, Mr Walter and Mr Mulder had to say about this."
"Paragraphs 13 and 17 concern the future of the TAOs, the Technical Assistance Offices."
"As Mr Bourlanges rightly says, the measures produced by the European Commission do not satisfy our demands."
"I regret that Mrs Siimes' reaction to the proposals made by rapporteur Bourlanges was one of slight disenchantment."
"The Council maintains that the European Parliament is proposing very far-reaching reforms and that it will not be possible to accommodate these in Budget 2000."
"Mrs Siimes, the citizens of Europe expect us to exercise robust and financially-transparent administration and it is therefore absolutely essential that we see to it that the Technical Assistance Offices are gradually disbanded."
"I would refer you to what Mr Elles has just had to say on the matter."
"And so it is my hope that the overtures we have made to you do not fall on deaf ears."
"Mr President, the main proposition of the Bourlanges report involves increasing the budget by EUR 700 million to finance what he calls the four priorities, with, first and foremost, aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo."
"I am in favour of aid for Kosovo."
"But financing for the reconstruction of Kosovo, and indeed Serbia, where the fate of the population seems not to be of interest to the European institutions, should be taken out of the military budget of the powers responsible for the destruction."
"The humanitarian arguments which we have heard serve mainly to hide the fact that EUR 500 million of public money, supposedly earmarked for Kosovo, only serve to make profits for big business in the private sector, especially building firms and public works contractors."
"The Members of Lutte ouvrière and the Ligue communiste révolutionnaire have no intention of sanctioning the European budget either directly or indirectly."
"This budget reflects the fundamental orientation of the European institutions, responsible for facilitating the activities of the large capitalist groups, including in the areas which are most damaging to society, such as the redundancy plans which are responsible for the gravity of the unemployment situation and the spread of poverty."
"On the subject of internal policies, since the Bourlanges report establishes priorities, the first priority should be to prevent all the redundancy plans announced by Renault-Nissan, Alsthom, Rhône-Poulenc, Hoechst-Marion-Roussel and many others."
"This is the only way to oppose the rise in unemployment effectively without it taking a single penny from the budget."
"Mr President, there is one financial matter of importance to Ireland which I would like to focus on during this wide-ranging debate on the budget."
"This relates to the continuation of the European Peace and Reconciliation Fund for the period 2000 to 2006."
"As a Member of Parliament for the constituency of Connaught/Ulster I certainly welcome the decision of EU leaders taken in Cologne this year to ensure the continuation of this programme."
"Peace and Reconciliation has been successful."
"I believe it was a wise and sensible decision to continue this programme."
"For the border county region which I represent it will be worth something in the region of IEP 80 million."
"But my primary concern relates to the transitional period between the ending of the existing programme and the commencement of the next programme."
"It is important that transitional financial arrangements are put in place so as to guarantee that those organisations who oversee the fund can smoothly make the changeover from the existing programme to the new programme."
"In conclusion, I believe a roll-over will ensure the retention of the excellent staff on both sides of the border who have played no small part in ensuring the success of the programme."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in undertaking our first reading of Budget 2000 today, we are discussing the first budget under the guidance of the new Commissioner, under your guidance Mrs Schreyer."
"And it is the first budget to be treated in accordance with the Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000 from March of this year."
"I think that both these points are worth mentioning."
"Firstly, because I had expected more involvement by the Commissioner in the budgetary procedure; there was actually little to be seen and heard."
"Secondly, because in the first year of implementation of the decisions on Agenda 2000 there is already a need to discuss revision of the Financial Perspective."
"This also I consider to be fully worthy of note because the wish list of the foreign ministers, which has grown in recent years, means that today we can no longer cope financially."
"The buck has been passed to us to bring about a solution in this and to find a way to handle matters from a budgetary point of view."
"To be perfectly honest, I find this unacceptable."
"First of all, the foreign ministers should be at one with their own finance ministers and then we can also sensibly implement this in the budget."
"However, I would also like to say a few words on the so-called ""small budgets"" ."
"Firstly: I do not consider it credible that, as the European Parliament, we should, on the one hand, require the most stringent tests from all other institutions, in particular the Commission, that we should expect the staffing structure to be adapted to new challenges and that we should want to accomplish this through the European budget, when, on the other hand, we are not prepared, here in our own domain, in the parliamentary budget and in the parliamentary administration, to take the necessary action."
"For this reason, as the Group of the European Peoples' Party, we have commissioned a study which, for our own administration, will bring about opportunities for staff development and task allocation within our departments."
"We have - and I would like to state this quite clearly - started an initiative to find a neat solution to the budget funds which we must manage ourselves as a Parliament - I am referring here, in particular, to travel costs."
"In this regard, in the very near future I am expecting specific proposals from our parliamentary administration which can then be treated accordingly by our Bureau."
"It must not be the case that the initiative which we as the Group of the European Peoples' Party have started leads in the end to savings being made where it makes least sense, i.e. in the very place where real work is done, Strasbourg."
"In the European Court of Justice, there has been an urgent need to increase the number of interpreters."
"It must not be the case that Court processes are delayed for two or three years due solely to problems with interpreters."
"Here we as a Parliament have seen the need and assume our responsibility."
"The Committee on Regional Policy has now found a solution for solving its staffing problems internally."
"It is not a matter for the budgetary authority, but something they can do, and indeed are doing, by their own efforts."
"I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their loyal cooperation and hope that in the second reading also we can adopt a sound budget."
"Mr President, naturally enough the rapporteur and some of the previous speakers have already alluded obviously to what for me is one of the crucial political elements - if not the crucial element - of this draft budget."
"But, as rapporteur for the interinstitutional agreement and the Financial Perspective, I feel compelled to emphasise it."
"Few people interpreted Berlin as a success: the European Council confused austerity with miserliness."
"I will not repeat my criticisms: I refer you to the Minutes of the plenary sittings."
"Between 25 March and 6 May, we held the last round of negotiations between Parliament and the Council."
"During that long and intense month of bargaining, Parliament made an effort to persuade the Council that there was more to the Union than the EAGGF and the Structural Funds, that the remaining 20% of the budget was also used to serve the Union' s objectives and that, often, it affects issues which were politically very sensitive."
"The Ministers implicitly recognised the obstinacy of their leaders, but did not want to find fault with them barely five weeks later."
"For this reason they only accepted the slightest and most miserly alterations to Category 3 (Internal Policies) and Category 5 (Administrative Expenditure)."
"The insuperable stumbling block was Category 4 (External Action) and not even the war in the Balkans persuaded them to accept the higher figure."
"One of the Ministers who negotiated and who is now a Commissioner came to recognise that it was possible that the Financial Perspective would have to be revised before it entered into force, but that we would have to wait until the Commission provided an estimate of costs."
"Once again, the Council confused the multiannual budgetary framework, that is to say the Financial Perspective, with the budget itself: a self-interested short-sightedness which hindered suitable and appropriate political decision-making and which led to a bungled handling of the budget."
"What is the situation?"
"We are beginning to see the cost of the needs of Kosovo, there has been an earthquake in Turkey and a political disaster in East Timor, not to mention the need to pay for the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which the government of the principal country involved must have forgotten in the negotiations in Berlin."
"The Council intends to resolve the matter by cutting a good proportion of the aid to Russia and the Mediterranean area with the rest coming from proportionate reductions in the other external programmes."
"Very cunning."
"The Financial Perspective has also failed to take into account the question of the accession of Cyprus and Malta."
"I believe that we should bear in mind that the interinstitutional agreement includes a mechanism for revision of the Financial Perspective for these cases, and that it is there to be used when necessary."
"There are those who keep an empty bottle in the fridge in case their visitors do not wish to drink anything."
"If the Commission now presents a proposal for revision of the Financial Perspective, think of that bottle, Madam Minister."
"Commissioner, Mr President, the current climate conference in Bonn is crying out for more funds for renewable energies; to wit funds from the EU, both for research and for demonstration projects."
"The recent nuclear accidents in Japan and South Korea again show how overdue a new energy policy is."
"Regarding the EURATOM credits, we in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy are asking that Parliament be consulted immediately."
"It is incomprehensible to us that our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets cannot support this as parliamentarians."
"The sole purpose of the budget lines in the area of trade is, professedly, to promote exports and create free market access."
"Yet this so-called ""free market"" only exists for multinational concerns because, for example, the SME cannot access either the information on money allocation nor the programmes themselves."
"In the last two decades exports from Latin America have increased by 300% whilst the gross domestic product in those countries has only increased by 3.3%."
"Since the beginning of the worldwide policy of a liberalised world economic area, there has been a massive redistribution from the rich to the poor, both within societies and between States."
"I advocate the opposite political trend."
"The result is that the financial assistance from the EU is indirect subsidisation."
"It is precisely this which contradicts the declared concept of free trade."
"Ultimately, what we are seeing here is another of the many inherent contradictions in WTO policy."
"Mr President, any budget reflects the financial implementation of the intended policy."
"Consequently, the decision to accept or reject the budget can, of course, only be bound up with how the focal points of the policy match up to one' s own ideas and whether the available financial funds are sufficient."
"What then, in my opinion, are the main criteria for this budget?"
"Firstly, a drastic minimisation of the unemployment which dominates in the Member States of the European Union."
"Secondly, a reduction in the economic and social divergences in the Member States."
"Thirdly, the enlargement of the European Union and, fourthly, a peaceful, democratic and social development of all regions in the world."
"If, and this I am assuming, you share these starting points, albeit there will certainly be differences of opinions as to the ways in which we reach these goals, it must be clear that the budget, as it stands, cannot be affirmed."
"Mrs Schreyer, I am, of course, in favour of reorganising and redistributing."
"I would immediately switch the focus from large enterprise to small and medium-sized economic policy which safeguards jobs."
"I would immediately move from an offer-oriented economic policy to a demand-oriented economic policy in order to boost consumption."
"But it is absurd to find ever more responsibilities for the European Union without providing it with the necessary financial funds."
"It cannot be the duty of Parliament to accept that the Council wants to finance important new political needs by renouncing traditional needs."
"Similarly, it cannot be the duty of this Parliament to accept that the Member States want to reorganise their budgets to the detriment of the European Union budget."
"Consequently, I consider that the most urgent task, given that we have a new Parliament and a new Commission, is to give consideration to the fact that the Financial Perspective really must be amended and that the interinstitutional agreement must also be modified."
"Mr President, Budget 2000 contains some technical improvements while an attempt has been made to do away with the usual over-budgeting for structural arrangements."
"Over-budgeting is an unsound budgeting practice, and it is important that it should disappear completely from the EU' s budget."
"I have noted the Council' s savings in regard to both structural arrangements and the agricultural sphere."
"These I support, even though they only constitute a small beginning when it comes to the required changes to the EU' s financial arrangements."
"In a changing world, we must be in a position to make adjustments to the budget far more quickly so that, without increasing the overall budget, we might meet any new needs including, first and foremost, the development needs of the new Member States in Eastern Europe but also the need for emergency aid and reconstruction in the Balkans, which ought not to be financed through cutbacks in support to the Third World."
"Overall, the EU has no need for more money but, rather, a need to use the existing money more sensibly."
"I want to emphasise that a more professional and accountable administration of the EU' s financial resources will provide rich opportunities to get more out of the same amount of money."
"Everywhere, there is a need for activity-based budgeting."
"More cost-conscious administration must be implemented and the wastefulness of which we have again and again seen examples and which the Court of Auditors' reports have revealed for a number of years must be eliminated if the EU' s citizens are at all going to be able to regard the EU' s institutions as serious partners in the development of Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to draw Parliament' s attention to the fact that the draft budget for 2000 did not envisage any allocation of funds to line B1-3800 concerning the promotion of agricultural products, an amount used solely to discharge the past, and I would of course like to thank the rapporteur, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, for his understanding, and Mr Böge and Mr Görlach for their support."
"As a result, all the efforts made in favour of quality beef, fruit, vegetables and dairy products would be in danger of being wiped out, even though this action is part of the Community action which could be entered in the green box at the WTO."
"The pretext of setting up an evaluation study does not justify the suspension of appropriations whose continuation is the guarantee of success."
"The professionals in the Member States who participate widely in this action are in agreement in favour of a study."
"Such a study could in particular result in the harmonisation of the Community contribution which currently varies between 40 and 100%, according to the products."
"For the same period, there are plans to finance a communication action for third countries, but in the absence of an implementing regulation, it will probably not be possible to use the provision in the year 2000."
"Finally, provision is also made for the promotion of the labelling. The Commission, however, is actually proposing to defer the implementation of labelling for one year, making the promotion of this non-existent product completely useless."
"It is therefore possible to continue to promote quality products without requiring additional expenditure, and I therefore ask the Commission not to stop promoting quality products, for these products are the external face of difficult regions, local products and the earnings of family farms in Europe."
"Mr President, supporting the economic reconstruction and the political renewal of a free, democratic and independent East Timor is not only nor is it fundamentally a question of humanitarian aid."
"What it represents above all is the confirmation that the Europe that we are building is ruled by universal values which are equally resonant across the world."
"It also means that military invasion is not an acceptable method of extending borders, whoever perpetrates such an act and whatever geopolitical factors and interests may be involved."
"It means above all, that liberty, democracy and respect for human rights are the fundamental principles according to which we would like to see our world develop."
"By deciding that the budget for the year 2000 is to make Europe' s financial contribution to Timor one of the four great European priorities, the European Parliament will be giving an unmistakable political signal to Europeans and to the world."
"I am pleased to note here the determined way in which the Commission and most particularly the Commissioner directly responsible for this matter, Chris Patten, is committed to supporting East Timor."
"In spite of the huge budgetary constrictions within which we work, the Commission managed to find the means to respond to the most pressing needs even in 1999."
"The assessment reports on the reconstruction costs for East Timor, as well as for the attendant international financial aid plan, have still not been completed which means that it is not yet possible to have an accurate estimate of the European contribution to the costs of reconstruction."
"The political message that we shall be giving when we vote next Thursday in favour of Mr Bourlanges' draft legislative resolution is nevertheless unmistakable."
"Europe' s support for East Timor is an absolute priority for Parliament in terms of the budget for the year 2000. It gives an accurate reflection of the feelings of many Socialist MEPs and of those from other benches who came here to give their evidence in the debate that we held on the situation in East Timor in the September part-session."
"(The sitting was suspended at and resumed at 3.00 p.m.)"
"Mr President, we approach the draft budget 2000 with considerable concern, particularly regarding the lines on development and cooperation but also those concerning human rights, as other Members have already said."
"Indeed, we have the impression that this budget is restricting all those things which are dearest to us."
"At a time when the requirement is for women to take greater part in the decision-making process, the corresponding budget lines are being restricted."
"At a time when the wish is for the environment, particularly the protection of tropical forests, to be integrated into the development process, the appropriations allocated to this are being reduced."
"At a time when developing countries are being asked to respect the principle of good government, with respect for human rights, our own budget on this crucial issue is being drastically reduced."
"Finally, at the very time when Lusaka is reminding us of the human and economic ravages due to AIDS in Africa, we are reducing the funds dedicated to it, contrary to the Commissioner Nielson' s assertions, while mixing them in with the policy on health and reproduction."
"Furthermore, we can only regret the re-orientation which involves favouring aid to States rather than to NGOs, especially the organisations of the South which are, however, known to be more effective and which make it possible to really target society."
"In short, we cannot be satisfied with this new distribution of appropriations which destabilises the priorities of the European Union in developing countries."
"Mr President, I would like to express my support for Mr Bourlanges' s position regarding the amendment of the Financial Perspective."
"At the same time, I wonder how Finland, as the country to hold the Presidency, has clung to the untenable position of the Council, according to which world events do not influence the EU budgetary framework and the final sums fixed in the budget itself."
"In the same connection, I would also like to draw attention to the calls there have been to adopt financial support for European political parties."
"Our group, the Confederal group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, has another stand in this matter."
"We do not want Europe' s taxpayers' money to be spent on support for political parties."
"We would also like to see a revision of the pay and benefits enjoyed by MEPs by adopting a common rule, whereby MEPs do not receive unjustifiable expense compensations and everyone is paid a fair salary and remuneration."
"Mr President, in the time available I want to refer to just one particular line in the budget which is the school milk scheme where the Commission has proposals to reduce the allocation from EUR 96 million to EUR 53 million."
"In 1997 Ireland for example received over IEP 1.4 million from the European Union for the administration of the school milk programme."
"As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development I fully support the scheme, both now and in the future."
"However, I am disappointed that reductions are being made in the overall budgetary allocation but I hope that the European Council, when it comes to reviewing the second reading of the EU budget for the year 2000, will take on board the recommendation of this Parliament that it should increase the funding for the programme to EUR 67 million or IEP 53 million in next year' s allocation."
"Mr President, it feels good to be able to say, in my first speech in the European Parliament, that the EU' s budget for the year 2000 has its sights set on a number of important processes."
"I am thinking of the importance of increased democratic support for the EU' s activities and of the importance of concentrating on crucial issues, for example the fight against unemployment and the enlargement of the European Union to include the new applicant countries."
"These tasks go hand in hand."
"The European Union must win the fight against unemployment so as to break down ordinary workers' and employees' mistrust of the European Union."
"In order to succeed, the enlargement of the European Union must quickly give rise to social and economic improvements for the citizens of the applicant countries."
"That is why we now want to increase the resources for developing dialogue between the two sides of industry."
"It is a question, among other things, of giving employees a say in the development of the Employment Pact and coordinated economic policy."
"It is equally important that the applicant countries should now be able to participate in the dialogue with a view to constructive cooperation on the labour market in these countries too."
"The procedure leading towards membership for Eastern and Central European countries, among others, is a difficult one."
"It is not enough to design well-balanced accession agreements."
"For EU membership to be a palpable and advantageous change in the eyes of ordinary citizens, the current state of affairs needs to change, and companies and employees need to be able to create a labour market which is not only dynamic but also grants rights to employees."
"Enlargement of the European Union must not mean that companies exploit a situation where there are low wages and poorer social security or that taxes and environmental demands are evaded."
"Employees in the new Member States have the same legitimate claims upon social entitlements and influence as we do."
"In this budget, we want, both for their and for our own sakes, to support dialogue between employers and employees and the establishment of union rights in the applicant countries too."
"In the same way, we would point out how important it is for the EU' s Committee of the Regions to have resources to develop contacts with regions and municipalities in the applicant countries."
"We also support the proposal for a special initiative to promote local and regional cooperation around the Baltic and the Barents Sea."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying how indebted I am to the rapporteur, who has done some sterling work in this area."
"He has developed a strategy that everyone can support."
"My colleague Mr Wynn may have feared that we would end up with a ""Duke of York"" -type scenario, but I feel that the whole affair is more akin to a scene from Asterix and Obelix, where Asterix has a special part to play in this case and we then have to vie with the Council, which plays the part of Julius Caesar."
"That is my first point."
"I must say that we can be satisfied with regard to Category 3, which is of particular interest to me."
"The rapporteur has struck the right balance here."
"But I would like to temper this comment with a caution to the Commissioner."
"I would ask that she does not start making changes to the categories when she puts her package together."
"We have decided most emphatically to restrict ourselves to Category 4 and if she starts on Category 3 then I think we might run into difficulties."
"I am very curious as to the contents of this package."
"I believe that the Council and in fact the Commission itself are responsible to a certain extent for the problems now facing us."
"The Commission because it misjudged the fisheries agreement, thereby actually reducing our margin, and of course the Council because it allowed Africa to foot the bill for the remainder."
"I have one more small point to make about Kosovo."
"It relates to a particular concern of mine besides that of the total amount to be spent on Kosovo."
"Of course we can consider the situation in terms of existing needs."
"I am completely in agreement with taking this approach."
"But we must also look at how much Kosovo' s economy can bear."
"If we were to provide assistance amounting to approximately 50% of Kosovo' s GNP - and there is a possibility of this happening if very high estimates are made - then I fear that the inflationary and other consequences for the economy would outweigh the benefits afforded by the assistance."
"I would ask the Commissioner to look not just at existing needs but also at the macroeconomic consequences."
"It is very clear that this is what happened at the time of the Marshall Plan."
"That is when it all started."
"We should also look very closely at this matter in the case of Kosovo, and we must learn from our experiences in Bosnia as far as that is concerned."
"Mr President, I would like to start by saying that it is very difficult for me to get on with my work here in Strasbourg owing to the fact that for the second time now, my case of documents has failed to reach my office."
"I would like to thank all those involved in the budgetary procedure for their work, which had to be executed with very little room for manoeuvre and was intended to send out a message to all the citizens of Europe."
"We are able to do this as far as Category 3 is concerned, which relates to internal policies."
"The youth programme, the SOCRATES programme, the cultural programme and issues relating to women and equality all provide us with the opportunity to make clear to the citizens what we want to achieve."
"A mistake was made in the case of Category 3, that is to say, when the vote took place in the Committee on Budgets an amendment was adopted by a very slim majority which could cause considerable damage if it is not corrected."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities submitted a remark and a budget for the European Women' s Lobby in line A-3037, as it did the previous year, but the remark now states that this line is to be opened to all non-governmental organisations."
"May I remind you that we as a parliament have supported this umbrella organisation for European women' s organisations and have entrusted it with the task of implementing the plan of action agreed in Peking at non-governmental organisation level, and I think it would be disastrous if just any women' s organisation could have a share in this budget."
"That is why I would ask you all to correct the amendment again and to vote against Amendment No 443 and in favour of the amendment tabled by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"We weighed the situation up very carefully and exercised great restraint as regards the amendments relating to gender mainstreaming and the question of firmly establishing equal opportunities in all European policies."
"I would particularly ask the rapporteur to take this into account and to support the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Mr President, all budget work is about setting priorities."
"There are grounds for asking the question now and again, ""What should the EU' s tasks really be?"""
"It is in fact the answer to this question which ought to guide work on the budget, too."
"Within a short period, we shall be facing what will probably be the biggest round of enlargement of the EU ever."
"It is a prerequisite of enlargement that there should be extensive changes to the budget and that we should begin to make these changes right now."
"This ought to involve making cuts right now in Category 1."
"We can begin this work by reducing the tobacco subsidy, among other things, and in such a way that it can be abolished completely within a ten-year period."
"A number of so-called unforeseen expenses have arisen in the course of the year' s work on the budget, and this means large demands for increased expenditure in Category 4."
"Humanitarian efforts to help refugees or victims of war in Kosovo, people injured in the earthquake in Turkey or innocent people hit by events in East Timor have obviously led to demands being made upon the European Union."
"As I see it, it must be an obvious objective successfully to deal with these matters too within the frameworks which we ourselves have been involved in setting up."
"That is where the important issue of prioritising comes into the picture."
"We have budget frameworks in the form of an interinstitutional agreement, signed less than six months ago."
"In my view, it would be extraordinarily unfortunate if this should need to be cancelled."
"I am in fact proceeding on the assumption that it will be possible for this issue to be solved jointly by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers before the second round of discussions."
"Mr President, this is my first budget."
"I should like to begin by thanking Mr Wynn and Mr Bourlanges and the other two rapporteurs for simplifying a very complex process for me."
"I believe that the European Union is changing."
"The institutions are having to become more representative."
"In that spirit, we should be trying to bring the European budget closer to the electorate."
"It is crucial for the citizens of the EU to know what their stake in the EU' s policies and operations really is, what they are paying and what they are paying for."
"Increased transparency will be the key to the future success of all EU institutions."
"That means assessing every budget line to see how it benefits the citizens of Europe."
"Given the commitment in the Treaty of Amsterdam to incorporating the interests of consumers into all other policy areas of the EU and the derisory level of the consumer budget, which stands at a quarter of one percent of total EU spending, there is a need to begin by making sure that valuable programmes such as the school milk scheme are safeguarded."
"This is not the case in the draft budget as my colleague, Mr Hyland, said earlier."
"The draft budget for the school milk programme throughout Europe has been reduced by 50%."
"This cut is a drastic measure for a programme that has benefits for both consumer and producer alike."
"The reason I feel strongly about this budget line is that it has an impact on the long- and short-term health of people, it addresses social deprivation issues and it impacts on the economy and jobs in my region."
"I do not have any difficulty with the reform of the CAP if it means cheaper and safer products for the consumer."
"I know that people are concerned about paying for subsidies that increase prices for them as consumers."
"The response I had from the Commission in the Budgets Committee was initially quite disappointing."
"They said that social issues are not within the original remit of the programme."
"But it now emerges from the Trialogue meeting last week that the Commission will be proposing an increase of EUR 31 million."
"I welcome this."
"I must say that I am disappointed that the Council is not here because I would like to know if they will support this."
"People out there are not concerned about the finer points or headings of the subsidy."
"What matters to them is the impact and the positive benefit of policies, such as this one."
"I accept totally the need to streamline and introduce efficiencies in the management of this scheme and others and to improve value for money, but a more effective way in terms of amending the budget would be to outline improvements and provide an implementation plan for the future."
"The Commission, in estimating spending, should look at funding in its totality."
"I call on Members to support this endorsement and amendment in Thursday' s vote."
"Mr President, in this debate, the European Parliament has the opportunity consistently to underline its resolve concerning the future of the European Union."
"In this context, I must emphasise the fact that the Council' s draft budget represents less than 1.10% of the Community' s GDP, an amount which is already quite low in itself and what is more, is considerably lower than the ceiling of 1.27% set in Edinburgh and confirmed in Berlin. This should be cause for serious reflection for those who want Europe to do more and to do it better."
"Having said this, I agree completely with the rapporteur Jean-Louis Bourlanges, whom I congratulate for the quality of his work, concerning the obligation to meet, in the budget for the year 2000, major needs which have recently arisen in the area of Category 4 on external action without calling into question other needs which have been previously defined, as the Council is trying to do."
"Taking away from some in order to meet others is not acceptable!"
"Across-the-board cuts are an aberration!"
"I am also against any reduction in the level of Category 1 on agriculture and Category 2 on structural operations."
"Amongst the new priorities, I would single out that of the reconstruction of East Timor, a region which has been a permanent target of the attention of the European Parliament which in September, once more adopted a firm resolution."
"In terms of the political commitment it represents, I think that the proposal to dedicate a specific budgetary heading to East Timor is of great significance."
"It is a shame that the Commission' s estimates - EUR 30 million - are not in line with reality."
"Once we have consistent forecasts, we will have to make the necessary adjustments."
"Two final observations: the first is the difficulty in understanding and then in explaining why there is a legal basis, and rightly so, for assisting victims of natural disasters anywhere in the world, as we are very rightly going to do for Turkey, but there is no such basis for doing the same at home."
"Today let me remind you, it is Greece."
"Tomorrow, God knows. Secondly, there is the expectation, that I insist be noted, of the specific measures and the resulting funds which the Commission is obliged to propose for the outermost regions of the Community which have been recognised, identified and defined since Amsterdam in the Treaty on European Union."
"Mr President, adopting the budget for the cultural sector is more difficult than usual this time."
"The Socrates II programme is presently the object of conciliation, and the recommendations for a second reading on the Youth for Europe action programme and the Culture 2000 programme will be discussed in the plenary sitting on Wednesday, which is tomorrow."
"Thus the final effort to have these multiannual programmes approved still remains to be made."
"The greatest differences of opinion between Parliament and the Council relate to the financing of the programmes, which is still open."
"At the same time, the Committee on Budgets has had to present the allocations for the implementation of the programmes next year."
"It has to be clearly pointed out that the figures presented by the Committee on Budgets do not constitute a stand on the result of conciliations."
"A schematic mathematical method is not suited to multiannual programmes."
"The financing of the programmes has caused worry to the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and it might not be just a one-off problem."
"We have to alter parliamentary procedures with regard to the budgetary procedure for multiannual programmes that are the object of the codecision procedure."
"The opinion of the Committee on Budgets relates to the report on the first reading, but there is no official collaboration between the special committee and the Committee on Budgets in connection with the second reading and conciliation."
"That can easily lead to breaks in the flow of information and misunderstandings between the special committee and the Committee on Budgets."
"The worst that can happen, however, is that Parliament' s position on financing for the programmes remains unclear; that can be used against Parliament."
"As multiannual programmes must in any case adapt to the general Financial Perspective of the relevant budget heading as well as the budget as a whole, it is necessary, in my opinion, for Parliament to enhance the effectiveness of its internal coordination when discussing multiannual programmes and the budget."
"Communication between the special committee and the Committee on Budgets should not be broken at Parliament' s first reading, after which some time might pass until the matter is finally resolved."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam emphasises Parliament' s position as a responsible and effective decision-maker."
"That is why we need Parliament to have a common and sustainable view of the matter under discussion in budgetary negotiations and conciliations."
"Mr President, this year, once again, we rapporteurs and speakers are using the word rigour in relation to the budget."
"And if it is clear that rigour is required in the implementation of the budget, I would also claim that we require rigour in the drawing up of the budget."
"And it is difficult to be rigorous in the drawing up of the budget if one does not have rigorous information."
"And here today, how many of us have had to insist on the question of the fishing agreement, a clear case of a lack of rigorous information."
"The previous Commission should have foreseen that the said agreement was going to be discussed again, that it was going to be renewed and that therefore it would have to be reflected in the budget."
"With regard to the other institutions, when we speak, for example, of interinstitutional cooperation, how much rigour was there in the information on the day when our colleagues previously agreed that a Common Organisational Structure had to be set up and what is the reality today when we decide that we have to dissolve that common structure?"
"I believe that we lack rigorous information."
"When we speak of building policy, who has the genuine information about the continuous changes between the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions who say ""now I am going to that building"" , ""now I am not interested"" , ""now I am going to the other"" ?"
"When we speak of the rigour necessary for interinstitutional cooperation with regard to the buildings in Luxembourg, has Parliament decided what the effective minimums and maximums are which Parliament requires in Luxembourg?"
"When we talk about expecting enlargements as from 2002, are we taking account, in our building policy, of the enlargements to come, in 2002, 2003 and 2004?"
"Rigour also has to be demanded of the members of other committees: the Committee on Budgets must not always be seen as the baddy, the one who always makes all the cuts."
"The other committees must take responsibility in the knowledge that new policies mean new expenditure, that for every increase there must be a cut."
"And with regard to MEPs allowances, I believe that the current regulation is less unjust than any situation which the absence of a regulation would cause."
"In any event, it can only be reformed by means of the Members' Statute."
"Mr President, Commissioner Schreyer, we have just had a very interesting discussion."
"The Members have endeavoured to get to the heart of the issues."
"At the same time, we should not forget the goals of the European Union, the most important of which is to make our budget lines as effective as possible in terms of creating employment."
"Which budget lines can we use to create fresh employment opportunities in Europe?"
"Another interesting question of course is which budget lines we can use to secure fresh taxation revenue."
"Revenue is a very important area and we should examine these issues in detail."
"On the other hand, we must take a look at which of the products currently on offer in the EU superstore we could take off the shelves."
"Which products could be returned to the national level?"
"It would be interesting to set up a research programme into which activities are currently being performed at European level that could in fact be dealt with much more easily, more efficiently and better at national level."
"This would free up our time and give us the opportunity to concern ourselves with the new projects, new goals and all the aspirations that we have expressed here today."
"There are two budget lines that are particularly dear to my heart."
"One is B5-512, financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises, support for family businesses."
"The SMEs account for 66% of jobs."
"In excess of 55% of turnover in the European Community is generated by these enterprises."
"We must concentrate our energies on specific programmes, start-up support, transfer of business know-how, and on the Euro-infocentres, for it is these that will give rise to fresh employment opportunities and fresh sources of taxation revenue."
"The second budget line B5-234 concerns financial support for the European digital capacity for global networks."
"Commissioner Liikanen advised this House that there will be approximately 1.2 million additional jobs by the year 2002, but we will not be in a position to guarantee the necessary quality of staff."
"We must train people and ensure that this labour market of 1.2 million jobs can be exploited in future, and that we develop programmes that will enable us to get people into work."
"This will put us on the right footing in terms of the Internet, e-commerce and the many sectors which will bring brand new opportunities to Europe, and there is no question but that we should work on this."
"In addition, programmes such as BEST are of crucial importance to us."
"When it comes to enterprises of this kind - there are 18 million SMEs in Europe, 50% of which have no employees - we must make the legal requirements pertaining to them a great deal simpler so that they can concentrate on their main tasks of satisfying customer requirements and offering the right products and services."
"That is what creates jobs and new opportunities."
"That is why we should also look to encourage innovation in schools and to reinforce initiative and innovation in schools - from primary school to university level - so as to give this sector completely new impetus and also enable new opportunities to develop there."
"We must reach agreement with the supply sector."
"How can we foster links between small and large companies so that the former can learn from the latter, so that we can help them with the introduction of the euro, so that we can promote transfer of business know-how, and so that we can tackle any year 2000-related problems?"
"To close, I would like to mention the enormous challenge we have before us, that of enlargement."
"I believe that enlargement also represents a huge opportunity for small companies."
"But we should not shrink from providing them with the support they need."
"There are only a few more years to go."
"Many are already involved over there, many are interested, and I believe that the work being done at grass roots level is interesting and affords new opportunities."
"We in the European Parliament recognise the challenge to give our commitment and invest our energies here, and I would like to take the opportunity today to thank you for your support in this, Commissioner."
"Many thanks, Mr Rübig."
"Also many thanks for coming to work on what is a national holiday in your country."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Many thanks for your interesting and highly varied contributions to the debate, and above all, thank you very much for making the atmosphere in which this debate has taken place an extremely constructive one."
"I would like to limit myself to a few points in my speech, points which I would like to come back to since, in my view, Parliament and Commission proposals must be reconciled."
"I wish to refer, firstly, to market measures in the agricultural sector."
"The Commission agrees that it is of course, necessary for the budget appropriations for the year 2000 to correspond to actual requirements as far as possible, and that no artificial reductions should be made here."
"That was our position in the preliminary draft budget and it will be maintained in the letter of amendment."
"Turning now to the measures in the rural development sector, I had pointed out that I also considered this second pillar of agricultural policy to be an absolutely essential addition."
"Accordingly, the Commission will propose a limited increase for agricultural development measures so that the Member States are also given the incentive to step up their efforts as far as environmental protection in the agricultural sector is concerned and as regards establishing structures to ensure safety in the food chain."
"I would like to mention the issue of research."
"It is being proposed here to divide up those budget lines in the budget plan which relate to the research sector."
"I believe that there is a pre-condition to consensual solutions."
"The Commission will always inform the European Parliament before there is a need to amend the appropriations for key actions and before these amendments are actually carried out, and it will of course substantiate these in full."
"I hope that on this basis we will be able to reach a consensual solution as to how matters are to be represented in the budget plan."
"I will now turn to the question of the TAOs, which Mr Bourlanges, Mr Wynn and Mr Elles went into very deeply again."
"The new Commission will undertake and examine the award of contracts to the technical assistance offices according to the various criteria, which, again, you have discussed, in order to reach a clear decision here as to what has to be undertaken by public administration and what can be undertaken by the assistance offices."
"This issue will also be a main theme of the blueprint paper on administrative reform and institutional reforms."
"It will then also be possible, against the background of this blueprint - as is desired by the European Parliament - to estimate the overall staffing requirement."
"Finally, I would just like to address the question of financing the important measures associated with reconstruction in Kosovo."
"Mr Bourlanges rightly pointed out that it is not a task which lasts only one year."
"On the other hand though, we are in a situation where we do not yet have a definite basis to be able to estimate the overall requirement."
"That is why the Commission is proposing that we should first review the Financial Perspective for the year 2000 and only then, once definite figures are available, should we talk about how the necessary funds for the ensuing years are to be made available."
"There have also been a few critical comments made on the question of what our approach will need to be in the year 2000."
"The question of how the sum of EUR 500 million stands in relation to Kosovo' s estimated GDP is indeed worthy of mention."
"On the other hand, though, I think that we should continue to stand by the figure that the EU has in fact quoted in the political sphere - it has said that it will make EUR 500 million available for the year 2000 - so as to avoid giving the impression that the EU is backing out of its political responsibilities."
"I have gained the impression from this debate that the Commission' s proposal, which I myself put forward, could form a sound basis for compromise."
"I would like to come back again to Mr Böge' s and Mrs Buitenweg' s contributions to the debate."
"The Commission proposes a limited revision, as you yourselves mentioned, and it also very important that we should make a point of providing for and taking account of ECHO measures for Kosovo."
"The Commission will therefore propose that all three instruments should be used i.e. reallocation of funds, use of the flexibility instrument and review of the Financial Perspective."
"In the Institutional Agreement we all have an excellent legacy on which to base our handling of Budget 2000 and fruitful cooperation, and as far as that goes, I am very confident, having had this debate, that it will be possible to reach a consensual solution and make the budget for the year 2000 one in which we can have faith."
", rapporteur."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Schreyer for the remarks she has just made. We will appreciate her proposal, once she has drawn it up, which will help us to understand."
"For the moment, I shall limit myself to one small comment, which Mrs Schreyer will understand perfectly, on the subject of research appropriations."
"I appreciated the terms of the commitments which were publicly undertaken by the Commissioner regarding the management of the lines for research."
"Like everyone, I believe, on the Committee on Budgets, I attach particular importance to seeing these commitments being made in writing further to the highly interesting letter which Mrs Schreyer sent us and to which our chairman, Mr Wynn, responded requesting, I believe, further details."
"I shall therefore ask you, Commissioner, together with your colleagues, please, to formalise the commitments that you have just undertaken in the terms you deem appropriate, so that we can be familiar with the facts and we can proceed to the vote on Thursday on the basis of clear commitments which do not allow for any misunderstanding between us."
"I see that the Commissioner is nodding in agreement, which means that there is no need to continue the debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote on the budget will take place on Thursday at 10.00 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 3.45 p.m. and resumed at 4.30 p.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the best laid plans in life are wont to go wrong."
"Mr Duisenberg should in fact be here by now but he is stuck in a traffic jam."
"I shall, therefore, open the sitting and suspend it again straightaway for another fifteen minutes in the hope that he will have arrived by then."
"If not, then I am afraid that we will have to repeat the same formal procedure once again."
"I am not the one to blame; presumably it is the motorways."
"Thank you for bearing with me."
"(The sitting was suspended at 4.30 p.m. and resumed at 5.20 p.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, please take your places, as Mr Duisenberg has just joined us."
"Mr Duisenberg, we have been waiting for you, if I may say, with some impatience, and we are delighted that you have at last been able to join us."
"ECB annual report"
"The next item is the report (A5-0035/1999) by Mr Huhne, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the 1998 annual report of the European Central Bank (C4-0211/1999)."
"I shall give the floor immediately to Mr Duisenberg."
". I have great pleasure in presenting the first annual report of the European Central Bank to the European Parliament at today' s plenary sitting."
"Almost ten months have passed since the euro was successfully introduced and the European Central Bank took over full operational responsibility for the single monetary policy."
"Many of us feel that, with the launch of the single currency, the process of European integration has gained a new quality."
"Indeed, the transfer of a core competency of the modern state, namely monetary policy, to a truly European and independent organisation such as the ECB must be regarded as a historic event which marks an unprecedented degree of economic and political integration within the European Union."
"The smooth transition to this new era of European integration and the successful operational start of the ECB was the outcome of several years of intense and thorough preparation."
"The Annual Report of the ECB gives a detailed account both of the final preparatory work conducted by the Eurosystem in the run-up to the introduction of the single currency and of the main economic and monetary developments within the European Union in 1998 and in the first few weeks of 1999."
"Since the information contained in the annual report is of a self-explanatory nature, it might be more useful if I concentrate my remarks here and now on some of the issues addressed by the draft resolution prepared by your Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"After that I shall be happy to answer any questions you might have."
"I should like to start by commenting on the discharge of the ECB' s accountability vis-à-vis the European Parliament."
"The Treaty establishing the European Community contains various provisions to ensure the democratic accountability of the ECB, one of the cornerstones of which is certainly the presentation of the Annual Report to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union."
"However, apart from this annual exercise, the ECB and the European Parliament have established several other contacts."
"First and possibly most importantly, I should like to mention the regular hearings held by the European Parliament' s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Within the scope of these hearings, which - in line with the European Parliament' s Rules of Procedure - take place on a quarterly basis, I provide detailed explanations regarding both our assessment of current economic and monetary developments and the decisions taken by the ECB."
"Transcripts of these hearings are published on the websites of both the European Parliament and the ECB."
"Moreover, the European Parliament has invited members of the Executive Board of the ECB and of the staff to participate in additional hearings on a number of specific issues, including the external representation of the Eurosystem, the preparation of euro banknotes and statistical matters."
"Furthermore, the ECB also had the opportunity to welcome delegations of members of the European Parliament' s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to its premises in Frankfurt."
"We attach great importance to these visits and will be pleased to continue to host such events."
"However, since these visits to the ECB are of a more informal nature, it goes without saying that they have to be considered as an additional tool for communication between the two institutions and cannot be seen as a substitute for regular public hearings at the European Parliament."
"In setting up its communication policy, the Central Bank decided to go beyond the transparency requirements of the Treaty."
"Thus, while the Treaty requires the ECB to publish a quarterly report on its activities, the ECB has decided to publish such a report on a monthly basis, the Monthly Bulletin, which gives a detailed presentation of economic and monetary developments."
"In addition, there are a number of other communication tools that the ECB regularly uses."
"First, let me mention the extended press conferences that the Vice-President and I hold immediately after the first meeting of the Governing Council every month, transcripts of which - including transcripts of the questions and answer session are also accessible via the ECB' s website."
"You, of course, are aware of the broad range of publications that the ECB has issued on specific subjects related to its fields of responsibility."
"Our communication policy gives clear priority to maintaining and enhancing the credibility of the Eurosystem and confidence in the euro, both of which - credibility and confidence - are crucial elements in the successful conduct of monetary policy."
"In this context, one should always bear in mind the fact that the Governing Council acts as a collegial body, and that all decisions have to be communicated to the public in a clear and consistent way."
"Speaking a common language is particularly important for a central bank operating in a monetary union comprising several countries."
"Contradictory indications about the decisions taken by the ECB and the underlying reasons might trigger unwarranted market expectations and increase uncertainty, thereby running counter to the very objective of being transparent with regard to the conduct of monetary policy."
"I should like to stress that the information provided at the press conferences held after the meetings of the Governing Council, together with the analysis contained both in the ECB Monthly Bulletin and in the other channels of communication comes very close, in substance, to the publication of ""summary minutes"" ."
"In view of the broad variety of publicly available information issued by the ECB, it is my firm belief and conviction that the ECB can stand comparison with other central banks in the field of transparency."
"In this context, I should also like to comment briefly on the request to publish the ECB' s internal forecasts."
"First, it would, at this moment, clearly be premature to consider such a step since the Eurosystem - that is, the ECB and the eleven national central banks - has yet to gain experience with its forecasts."
"More time will be needed before we can assume that all the technical issues have been addressed properly, and the publication of forecasts can be considered without endangering the ECB' s credibility."
"I am confident, however, that we can achieve this in the course of next year."
"Let me also emphasise that the role of the ECB' s internal forecasts in the decision-making process should not be overestimated."
"Such forecasts constitute one piece of information made available to the Governing Council, but certainly not the only one."
"The role of our internal forecasts within the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem therefore differs from the role of inflation forecasts in a strategy of direct inflation targeting."
"Finally, I should like to recall that the Monthly Bulletin - especially in its extended quarterly version - provides a forward-looking analysis, including reviews of the outlook for price developments."
"The ECB has also been asked to publish reports featuring national data relating to countries participating in the euro area."
"The publication of such data, however, would, in our view, be misleading since the single monetary policy cannot be directed at country-specific situations."
"On the contrary, the Eurosystem must take a euro area-wide perspective in its assessment of the economic situation in general and the outlook for price stability in particular."
"Publication by the ECB of detailed reports for each country participating in the euro area would run counter to the necessary creation of an area-wide perspective in the conduct, discussion and thinking of monetary policy."
"However, it should be recognised that the national central banks of the Eurosystem continue to produce their own regular reports that address national economic and financial developments in some detail."
"I should now like briefly to expand upon another issue which I know is of fundamental concern to the European Parliament, namely the contribution of monetary policy to the general economic policies in the Community."
"The Treaty provides for a fundamentally sound allocation of objectives and policy instruments between the monetary and governmental authorities in Europe."
"The Eurosystem is responsible for maintaining price stability."
"To this end, the Eurosystem has adopted a monetary policy strategy that is forward-looking and acts promptly to address threats to price stability."
"The Treaty also states that, without prejudice to its primary objective of price stability, the Eurosystem shall support the general economic policies in the Community."
"By maintaining price stability, it is our firm belief monetary policy makes the best contribution it can to achieving a high level of output and employment in the medium-term."
"Price stability has beneficial effects on general economic performance - including growth and employment prospects - through many channels, of which I should like to mention the following."
"First, in an environment of price stability, the market mechanism will allocate resources more efficiently to their most productive uses."
"Markets function most effectively when relative price signals are not distorted by fluctuations in the general price level."
"Second, a climate of price stability reduces the inflation risk premia in interest rates, particularly in longer-term rates, and thereby improves the conditions for financing investment."
"Third, lasting price stability serves the interests of social justice and helps to protect the weakest members of our society, such as pensioners and the unemployed, who depend on fixed incomes and who cannot protect themselves against the costs of inflation with other assets, such as property or shares."
"Broad agreement exists that there is no long-term trade-off between price stability and economic growth."
"Attempting to use monetary policy to raise real economic activity above its sustainable level will, in the long run, simply lead to ever higher inflation, but not to faster economic growth."
"Such an attempt would simply forfeit the benefits of stable prices, which I have just outlined, and would therefore prejudice growth and employment prospects over the medium term."
"While the contribution it makes through maintaining price stability must not be overlooked, monetary policy clearly cannot solve the serious structural unemployment problem in the euro area."
"Other policy areas have the instruments needed and are thus responsible for solving the structural problems."
"Decisive action in this field is certainly required to improve growth and employment prospects."
"Safeguarding sound government finances is a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and achieving strong sustainable growth which is conducive to employment creation."
"In this context, the Stability and Growth Pact sets the right incentives for the conduct of sound and disciplined fiscal policies across all participating Member States."
"In addition, structural reforms in labour and goods markets, as well as a moderate development of wage costs, can best address the root causes of currently high unemployment in Europe."
"The clear division of policy responsibilities I have just described enhances the credibility of monetary and economic policies in Europe, increases transparency and facilitates accountability."
"It provides the proper incentives for the policy-makers in individual policy areas."
"If all parties concerned respect the fundamental allocation of these responsibilities and act accordingly, the achievement of the objectives of all policy areas will be the natural outcome of their individual policy choices."
"In this regard the Eurosystem supports the idea of a dialogue between monetary policy and other policy areas in the form of an open exchange of information."
"However, such a dialogue should be clearly distinguished from any attempts to coordinate policies ex ante, so as to achieve a certain ""policy mix"" , which would blur the fundamental responsibilities I described."
"Such coordination would tend to decrease accountability, reduce the transparency of the policy framework for the public and increase uncertainty about policy actions, potentially threatening to destabilise the economy."
"Finally, the debate on a ""balanced and appropriate policy mix"" should not be used to deflect attention from the structural reforms that are so urgently needed to address the euro area' s serious structural unemployment problem."
"One other matter, which is addressed by your committee is the ECB' s contribution to financial stability, and in particular the question of the provision of emergency liquidity to financial institutions in distress."
"Allow me to explain some of our main considerations in this regard."
"The main guiding principle within the Eurosystem with reference to the provision of emergency liquidity to individual financial institutions is that the competent national central bank would be responsible for providing such assistance to those institutions operating within its jurisdiction."
"The ECB does, however, have to be informed of this in a timely manner."
"In addition, in operations of relevance to the single monetary policy, the decision-making bodies of the Eurosystem will be involved in assessing the compatibility of the envisaged operations with the pursuit of monetary stability."
"In the case of a general liquidity crisis resulting from a gridlock in the payment system, for instance, the direct involvement of the Eurosystem could be expected."
"For the markets it would be sufficient to know that there is a clearly articulated capability and willingness to act if really necessary."
"It is not common practice amongst central banks to disclose the conditions and practicalities of emergency liquidity assistance arrangements."
"In particular, there are typically no official documents describing the conditions under which emergency liquidity would be extended or what procedures would be followed."
"Indeed, ex ante commitments would be counter-productive in this field, since they would restrict the ability of the central bank to act to contain systemic disturbances with unforeseen features."
"Moreover, this policy of ""constructive ambiguity"" can limit the associated problem of moral hazard."
"Finally, I should like to turn to a different issue which has also been raised by the European Parliament on several occasions, namely the question of cross-border retail payment services in the euro area."
"The ECB is aware of the criticism that has been expressed with reference to the low level of efficiency and high costs involved in the processing of such payments and it fully shares the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in this regard."
"The current situation is particularly unsatisfactory in the area of cross-border credit transfers, whereas the situation in the area of cross-border card-based payments raises fewer concerns."
"As you will be aware, one of the basic tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem by the Treaty is the promotion of the smooth functioning of payment systems."
"However, the involvement of central banks in retail payment systems is, in general, less pronounced than in large-value payment systems, mainly because retail payment systems entail significantly lower systemic risks."
"Nevertheless, the Eurosystem is concerned with efficiency issues related to cross-border retail payments."
"At present, the performance of cross-border retail payment systems is clearly lagging behind the policy objectives of Economic and Monetary Union and, indeed, behind the expectations of many European citizens and small enterprises."
"After the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002, these differences in service levels for national and cross-border payments within the single currency area will become even more apparent."
"Against this background, the ECB strongly advocates the creation of a single payment area in order fully to reap the benefits of the single currency."
"In order to give a clear signal to the banking industry and the public, the ECB published a number of objectives in September which it expects the industry to fulfil and which should contribute towards substantial improvements."
"The current inadequacies are linked, in part, to the still predominant recourse to correspondent banking and the lack of adequate interbank infrastructures."
"More efficient funds transfer arrangements have been set up in recent years, but they are too fragmented and economies of scale are very limited."
"One pre-condition, therefore, for achieving a substantial enhancement in the processing of cross-border retail payments is undoubtedly the fact that the banking industry must implement common technical features in the processing of funds between banks."
"However, this is unlikely to be sufficient."
"The banking industry must also improve substantially its internal procedures for processing cross-border payments, as well as its communication with the customer."
"This, in turn, requires a more extensive use of automation and standardisation."
"In this respect, I should like to draw attention to the standards agreed within the framework of the European Committee for Banking Standards, which I consider to be of particular importance."
"The ECB is organising meetings with all parties involved in order to bring the implementation of the standards forward."
"Once the conditions related to interbank processing and internal procedures have been met, it should be possible for the banking industry to decrease substantially the price of cross-border credit transfers and to reduce the execution time to that needed for domestic payments plus one day."
"The ECB expects the banks in the euro area to achieve substantial improvements by 1 January 2002 at the latest."
"The ECB will act as a catalyst for change and will, together with the national central banks of the Eurosystem, discuss these issues with the euro area banking industry in order to play a supportive and coordinating role in this regard."
"At present, an operational involvement of the ECB does not appear to be justified since there are already some indications that the general appreciation of the problem by the private sector is now increasing."
"The ECB will, however, closely monitor further developments in this area and will inform the European Parliament and the general public about the progress achieved."
"It is an honour to be chosen as the rapporteur for this important report."
"This is the first occasion on which the European Parliament has given its views on the progress of the European Central Bank and in this context it is my pleasant duty to congratulate the ECB and Mr Duisenberg, as President, on its success so far."
"The launch of the euro itself is a truly historic moment in the life of an extraordinary undertaking."
"It represents a substantial technical achievement and the many officials involved deserve our thanks and our appreciation."
"Clearly it is still early days in terms of judgement on the results of the ECB' s mandate but here, too, we can already point to many positive signs, not least that investors are prepared to lend euro area governments their money at very low rates of interest."
"This is a real vote of confidence that the ECB will continue to deliver price stability and will not allow an inflationary erosion of people' s savings."
"It is very much in this context of overwhelming support for the objectives of the ECB and of praise for its achievements so far that my remaining remarks should be seen."
"Only if the ECB is open about the way it reaches its decisions will it be able to retain support in bad times as well as in good."
"It may achieve its objective of price stability but without openness it will not be clear whether that objective has been attained by design and can therefore be repeated in future or by lucky accident which may therefore require some improvement in its methods of working."
"The committee was also struck by the fact that other central banks have moved more rapidly in recent years towards greater openness."
"The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, Sweden' s Riksbank, the Bank of England all publish the individual votes of the committee that decides interest rates."
"They all publish forecasts, they all give information about the nature of the debate within their governing councils."
"In all of these respects - objective measures of transparency - the ECB lags behind normal international practice."
"The committee therefore proposes, firstly that the ECB should publish a summary minute giving both sides of the argument, for and against monetary actions."
"Secondly, the ECB should publish a six-monthly forecast of economic developments in the euro area."
"Mr Duisenberg' s remarks to us today are particularly welcome in that respect because he has promised that he that will do just that within the next year."
"Thirdly, the ECB should discuss on a regular basis developments in each of the Member States of the euro area in order to have a positive influence on price and wage developments which must, as Mr Duisenberg rightly pointed out, differ from Member State to Member State."
"Finally, the committee may request that the President appears following each significant monetary action."
"These measures would do much to foster a culture of transparency."
"The committee was unable to support a call now for the publication of votes as is in the Liberal group amendment today."
"It was felt that a young institution should have time to find its feet."
"Most members felt that publication might intensify the public pressures on governing council members to vote in line with their national interest."
"Similarly, the committee did not support the Liberal position that it would be useful to publish the ECB' s econometric models of the euro area, partly for fear that they may be abused."
"The committee also rejected the Greens' view as expressed in their amendment today, that the price stability mandate should be altered to take account of the difficulties faced by manufacturers alone if their prices fall."
"The amendment from the EPP, however, clarifies the paragraph and should, in our view, be supported."
"Mr President, I would like to highlight briefly some other points that we make."
"The first is to thank Mr Duisenberg again for his assurance to this House that the process of cooperation between the ECB and the national central banks is now adequate, even in the case of a serious crisis in which a euro area financial institution may need to be supported."
"I would also like to stress the committee' s view that the ECB should bring pressure to bear on those Member States which rely excessively on short-term debt, as this can present dangers, particularly during a financial crisis."
"Thirdly, we encourage the ECB to fulfil its role on the international stage as one of the three main pillars of the international monetary system."
"Finally, I very much welcome, too, Mr Duisenberg' s taking up of a point in the report about the need to reduce the costs of cross-border payments, particularly for smaller payments which affect individual members."
"Mr President, if the euro is as great a success as I hope and expect, it will play its part in revolutionising the European economy."
"By completing the single European market it will give Europe' s consumers more choice of goods and services, of higher quality and at lower prices and will, therefore, spur greater increases in living standards."
"It will provide jobs in expanding industries which is the only sure guarantee of future prosperity."
"Although I have no doubt that the ECB will face many difficult challenges in the years ahead, I am pleased to report that so far it has risen to the challenges it has faced with considerable élan."
"We can look forward to a future which builds on its recent success."
"Mr President, President Duisenberg, rapporteur, I would like to outline five thoughts briefly."
"Firstly, we have heard that this is the first report of the ECB and first position that we have been called upon to express on it."
"It can be discerned immediately that the report describes the status quo of a year that has now passed and does not definitively clarify the work of the ECB and our relationship to the ECB."
"Cooperation between the European Parliament and the ECB, as well as the operating methods of the European Central Bank, are in a process of evolution."
"Much of our criticism or our requirements today will seem self-evident in a while."
"I would, however, like to say on behalf of our group that we consider the fundamental conditions to be sacrosanct."
"The Group of the European People' s Party/European Democrats sees itself as the political group which says yes to the independence of the ECB, to reinforcement of the stability policy, regarding both price stability and currency stability, and which also says yes to further reduction of the public debt, to new growth and employment and to the credibility of monetary policy."
"These fundamental positions of ours, in addition to the tension between autonomy, confidence, a transparent public record and the essential intensification of monetary dialogue with the European Parliament, are crucial for us to be able to assess the work of the ECB, but also for the preparation of our own report and the operating methods of Parliament."
"We have already heard briefly today that the main theme of the report is the year 1998, a year in which it was announced which countries had met the convergence criteria - eleven of them, the location of the ECB was decided, the EMI was taken on, the third phase of economic and monetary union was introduced and the ECB Governing Council decided on the stability strategy, based on the two recognised pillars."
"It has to be said, a lot happened in the course of this year."
"In spite of some currency turbulence on other continents, the euro has already demonstrated that it can earn confidence, and the conversion of existing currencies to the new currency on 1 January 1999 was achieved smoothly."
"At this point, therefore, I would like above all to offer congratulations and thanks."
"Congratulations and thanks to the European Monetary Institute, the national banks, the European Central Bank, represented here today by President Duisenberg, but also to all the Member States who, by means of many politically necessary reforms, drove forward further structural and institutional reforms and fulfilled the convergence criteria, and not forgetting the citizens who support this necessary step towards European integration with increasing approval."
"Permit me to say in conclusion that fulfilment of the convergence criteria has led to price stability, exchange rate stability and to improved public finances."
"These three successes are the prerequisite for economic growth, on the one hand, essential investment in the future, on the other hand, and creating jobs and making them secure."
"Considering that the report contains all our fundamental conditions, my hope is that it will meet with wide approval."
"Mr President, our primary objective is to establish the euro, after a successful start at the beginning of this year, as a stable currency in the long term, to make it an international reserve currency and to ensure that it is accepted by the citizens."
"I am particularly pleased that the President stressed again today that the European Central Bank also regards consumer protection as an important task within monetary union."
"The independence of the European Central Bank is important for the objectives I mentioned, but its credibility and the degree to which the public can have confidence in it are important too."
"In a democratic legal system, the institutional and political independence of an institution is only possible if democratic legitimisation is guaranteed at the same time, and that includes transparency of decisions and indeed the possibility of understanding these decisions."
"In this respect, a central role falls to the European Parliament, and I think that the dialogue on monetary policy, in the form established between this Parliament and the European Central Bank, is a good start for future years in the euro area."
"I know how difficult it was, and this is shown in the annual report, to set up the European Central Bank, and indeed the whole system, and to get Monetary Union underway without problems."
"I also consider it very positive that the European Central Bank has improved its information policy."
"I do think, on the other hand, that it is not sufficient to allocate only an ancillary role in this communication policy to the European Parliament, as the open forum for European policy."
"It is important to see the special role of the European Parliament here too and I also think therefore that ECB information services and transparency could be significantly improved with regard to the European Parliament."
"By that I do not mean that we necessarily need to have verbatim reports of meetings published now, but it would be useful to have outline minutes of meetings giving the arguments for and against, making it possible to understand the way in which the European Central Bank actually makes its evaluation in the assessment of the risk of inflation or of deflation."
"It has not been clear to us to date how an assessment can be made or is made in this area regarding the development of prices over and above goods and services, with reference, for example, also to property markets or share markets."
"There is therefore some uncertainty in this area as to the basis for decision making and the intelligibility of decisions, just as there still is with reference to the forecasts and models."
"The European Central Bank must be allowed some time. It is only 10 months since the child came of age and became responsible in the monetary arena, but it must continue in this direction."
"I am convinced of the fact that trusting collaboration between the ECB and Parliament will also contribute towards achieving greater certainty and confidence among the public."
"At the moment there is great speculation on the subject of the ECB' s decisions in matters of interest rate policy."
"In this context within the euro area, I expressly welcome the ECB decision last Thursday to leave interest rates unchanged."
"This shows that the ECB is taking its responsibility in supporting other national economic objectives, particularly employment, seriously, and we know that the economic ""spring"" in the European Union, in spite of the varied developments within the euro area of the 11, certainly needs even further support."
"I think that the drop in oil prices, together with the fall in consumer prices which has already been experienced and which is expected to continue in the telecommunications, electricity and financial service sectors as a result of competition and the liberalisation of the market also certainly played a part in the decisions of last Thursday."
"This should continue to be the case."
"I am filled with consternation regarding the ECB' s attack upon the Employment Pact."
"I would ask the ECB to make a constructive contribution towards achieving the Growth and Employment Pact and to say very clearly what part it intends to play in the macroeconomic dialogue in order to contribute to a balanced policy mix."
"It is no longer possible for monetary policy just to be responsible for price stability."
"It is no longer possible for budgetary policy just to be responsible for state finance, and social partners for moderate wage policy."
"There must be real liaison here in the interests of the further development of European Economic and Monetary Union, and also a shared position in this area in the interests of increasing employment."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I am pleased to express our support and favourable position with regard to the report presented by Mr Huhne, concerning the 1998 annual report of the European Central Bank."
"First of all, we must congratulate ourselves on the process of introducing the euro."
"It is now a complete reality which is operating with total normality on all the economic levels envisaged - in the Member States, in the European Union, on an international level."
"The good leadership and management of the European Central Bank has undoubtedly contributed to this normality and we should congratulate it and its President since, during the early months of the establishment of the euro, when the initial approaches were adopted, they had to overcome - and they did it skilfully - certain adverse circumstances at moments which were clearly delicate at an internal as well as an international level."
"At that time - and I must insist on this - the European Central Bank displayed skill, good leadership and management and the ability to maintain the principles of independence."
"This very solidity, which has been demonstrated in so few months, should allow us to be braver, more decisive in some areas which have already been mentioned, which are in Mr Huhne' s report and which I would like to insist on."
"One of them is clearly the issue of transparency in some areas that the President of the Central Bank himself has already mentioned."
"The publication of the forecasts, the possibility of having access to the minutes of meetings and a global report on the economic progress of the Member States are elements which will contribute - as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, by means of the intervention of its President, Mrs Randzio-Plath, has demonstrated, and as mentioned in Mr Huhne' s report - to the consolidation of the level of internal and international acceptance and, of course, transparency, not only with regard to public opinion but also with regard to the experts in monetary affairs."
"Let me end by insisting on the specific position of the Liberal Group which calls for, after the transitional period of two years, the publication of votes, the various positions taken in the meetings of the Executive Board and the macroeconomic models, which I believe would allow more convincing and accurate forecasts to be made by those whose operations relate to the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, this is the first time that the new Parliament is fulfilling its mission of supervising the European Central Bank."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance heartily supports the Huhne report, not only for its professional quality but also for its general attitude of mind."
"It is effectively a response to the fundamental problem which faces us today, that of accountability in managing monetary policy."
"What is the nature of this problem?"
"The Central Bank is not a fourth estate."
"It is not, for example, in a position to challenge the social rights gained by Europeans."
"These rights are enshrined either in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in national bodies of legislation and in conventions between management and unions."
"The Central Bank, on the other hand, has been assigned a specific function by Europeans, that of ensuring price stability."
"The Maastricht Treaty is not very specific on the manner in which it must actually be accountable for the fulfilment of its mission with regard to national representatives."
"All central or international banks of major countries are bound, in one form or another, by this democratic accountability with regard to the socio-economic community - in the Anglo-Saxon countries through Parliament and in Germany through the federate banks of the Länder."
"Today we have to invent the forms of democratic responsibility of the European Central Bank."
"The Huhne report already provides many possible routes."
"We support the two amendments tabled by the rapporteur himself, for publication of votes in the Council of the European Central Bank and the econometric models on which these votes are based."
"Only the most complete transparency of the relationship between the objectives set by the Treaty and the actions of the members of the Council will make it possible for Europeans to actually measure whether the members of the Council are fulfilling their mission properly, not that we doubt it."
"From this point of view, the Huhne report is justifiably very pleased with the reduction in interest rates which occurred in April."
"Apart from the positive effect of this decision on employment, it is in line with the objective of ecological sustainability, which is to say the rejection of a policy of excessively favouring immediate prospects at the expense of long- term future prospects."
"This is why our group is concerned about the rumours of a forthcoming increase in interest rates."
"Such a decision would compromise both the upturn in employment in Europe and ecological investment, especially that related to saving energy and combating the greenhouse effect."
"Such a decision could only be taken in the event that price stability was threatened."
"Well, price stability applies in both directions."
"For many months, the consumer price index has been increasing at a rate of 1%, while the industrial price index on the other hand has been decreasing, at a rate of 1%."
"This deflation in industrial prices prompts giving preference to short-term prospects. It would become dangerous if real interest rates were to increase."
"In order to prevent such situations arising, our Group is proposing an amendment drawing the attention of the European Central Bank to its mandate to ensure price stability in both directions."
"President Duisenberg, I would like to mention three matters critical to this first annual report of the European Central Bank: accountability, transparency and employment."
"Firstly, in my view, the content and the drafting of the report do not make it sufficiently clear that the European Central Bank is willing to subject itself to democratic control by the European Parliament."
"This is demonstrated by the fact that dialogue on monetary matters between Parliament and the ECB is assessed on page 95/96 on just the same terms as cooperation with other institutions."
"In my opinion, this is in contradiction to Article 113 of the Treaty on European Union, which makes it mandatory for the ECB to present an annual report of its activities and its monetary policy to Parliament."
"This is precisely what you get as a result of the fact that the European Central Bank' s accountability towards Parliament is described in such vague terms in this Article."
"I therefore support the request made in the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, to wit, that the ECB should take immediate action in order in future to at least take into account fully the special relationship with the European Parliament established by the Treaty on European Union."
"This brings me to my second comment."
"It is not acceptable that the European Central Bank should give no details of the background and reasons for its decisions on monetary policy."
"Indeed, this Parliament is the forum where the ECB must present its monetary decisions, justify them and, if necessary, let them be criticised."
"If this does not take place, then Parliament cannot fulfil its own task of supervising the activity of the Bank."
"Monetary policy is, as is known, a highly political matter, and it is precisely for that reason that the Bank must demand a high degree of transparency with regard to decision-making."
"Thirdly, what for me is a central question, there is clear dissent in this House, President Duisenberg, as to the views you have just expressed."
"I am of the opinion that the European Central Bank must make a contribution to economic growth and employment by means of its monetary policy."
"It is not right for full employment to be de facto abandoned as a political objective and for everything, literally everything, to be subordinated to monetary stability."
"I still consider this to be the crucial foundation for establishing..."
"(The President cut the speaker off.)"
"Mr President, today our Parliament has the President of the European Central Bank as its guest, that is to say the president of the first institution to which the nations of Europe, by who knows what perturbation, have decided, eleven of them at least, to confer to give sovereign power."
"Thus, Mr Duisenberg, even though today' s poor attendance does not seem to back up my statement, you are nonetheless the successor to the emperors and popes who, since the time of Charlemagne, have dreamt of unifying our continent by faith or by force."
"No doubt you will even have more power or influence, in the final analysis, than they ever did, even if it is to be a less flamboyant form of power, since at the end of this millennium which seems to set money up as the ultimate universal value, you are poised to hold both temporal power and spiritual power within the European Union."
"Confronted with this - I do not know how to describe it exactly - this ""Bank State"" or this ""Holy Bank"" , the Vice-President of which, Mr Noyer, recently explained to us ingratiatingly, but in English, how responsible it felt for the long term whilst governments, on the other hand, gave in to short term whims because they were subject to the vagaries of universal suffrage. Confronted, then, with the omnipotence of this Bank, the excellent report by our fellow Member, Mr Huhne, calls for greater transparency, without however daring to go as far as demanding of you what might pass for exhibitionism, that is to say, ceasing to maintain anonymity regarding decisions."
"We can only approve these excellent resolutions, while being aware that there is even more talk of transparency when democracy is being relinquished or sidelined."
"Let us recall, for that matter, that transparency comes from the Russian glasnost."
"That is why, Mr Duisenberg, I believe that today' s meeting, and particularly the ridiculous opposition force which Parliament is attempting to exert in relation to the considerable power which has been entrusted to you, can only worry anyone who attaches importance to national sovereignty, which is just one way for nations to keep control of their own fate."
"I only hope that, aware of the power which has been granted you, you will be able to exercise this power with all the wisdom one could hope for."
"Mr President, the ECB' s first annual report looks back over 1998, a year dominated by the build-up to the launch of the single currency on 1 January 1999."
"The transition to the third stage of EMU proceeded fairly uneventfully."
"We can justifiably be pleased about that."
"But it has since become apparent that bringing about the monetary union of eleven Member States also has its drawbacks."
"These negative effects could, in the main, have been foreseen, but this Parliament never gave them serious attention during the run-up to EMU."
"One issue that is now receiving people' s undivided attention is that of the divergent rate of inflation in the euro countries."
"Currency depreciation is significantly higher in Ireland, Spain and the Netherlands in particular."
"There will be no change here in the foreseeable future."
"According to the estimates published by the IMF yesterday, the Netherlands can expect inflation to be at 2.3% next year."
"The constant rise in consumer spending is prompting the Dutch Government to make concerned and admonishing comments, but it is doing the wrong things in policy terms: tax reductions instead of debt reduction."
"Following an inquiry into the situation, the ECB concluded that the differing rates of inflation ought not to be a major cause for concern."
"Regional differences in the rate of inflation are in fact greater still in the United States."
"However, federal states in the US benefit from automatic stabilisers coming into play via the federal budget."
"The mobility of labour is also much greater in the United States."
"I tend to feel that the ECB wants to play fast and loose and I would like its President to clarify his position."
"I also want to ask him if the banking supervision system needs to be adapted."
"As things stand it is decentralised and that is fine, but is the supervisory process not rendered more difficult by transnational mergers with banks outside the euro area?"
"I would be pleased to hear what you intend to do about this."
"Mr President of the Central Bank, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members."
"Certainly, this first report by the European Central Bank is compensating for the launch of the euro and you and the Governing Council of the bank are taking on a great responsibility."
"The Huhne report certainly contains positive elements, especially as regards the request to the European Central Bank for more information regarding the grounds for the decisions it adopted through the publication of concise Minutes including dissenting opinions as well."
"However, there is a point in the report which, Mr President, in my opinion is completely unacceptable."
"I am referring to point 11, which states that Parliament regards 'the reduction of 50 basis points in interest rates on 8 April 1999 as appropriate, and welcomes in particular the reasons given for it' , which tells us that the cut in rates supported the general economic policies in the Community."
"Regarding the method, I wonder why on earth Parliament, in discussing the 1998 report of the European Central Bank, feels the need to include its approbation of a specific measure which the European Central Bank will give an account of in its next report - the 1999 report."
"Moreover, how can we consider judging the effects of the manoeuvre on taxes after only a few weeks?"
"And what sense is there in Parliament giving an opinion of one single act of the Central Bank?"
"Considering this matter further, I find this approbation totally out of place."
"Yesterday, both the head economist of the Central Bank, Mr Issing, and Vice-President Noyer implied that a fresh increase in taxation is imminent. Does this not maybe prove that the decision taken in April was wrong, given that in the meantime there has been no unexpected shock?"
"And was the long-term tax increase not due to the loss of credibility owing to that very cut?"
"We have the suspicion, actually more than a suspicion, that that decision was made following political pressure - for example, Oscar Lafontaine - and that Parliament, with today' s approval, wishes to confirm the move towards a Central Bank which is subordinate to political requirements or even electoral interests."
"I believe that the Central Bank' s strategy must focus exclusively on currency and prices."
"It would be suicide, as today others have repeatedly advocated, to think that European leaders can put pressure on the Central Bank so that it will make up for their inability to relaunch the economy through structural reforms, liberalisation of the markets - the job market first and foremost - and tight budgetary policy which must be coupled with a reduction of the tax burden on people and firms."
"Mr President, President Duisenberg, I too would like to express my delight at being able to welcome President Duisenberg here today."
"Why is the debate we are having today so important?"
"The European Central Bank is autonomous, and my group is surely the one which always stressed this most."
"But, at the same time, the European Central Bank must make decisions which concern every individual citizen of Europe."
"It is therefore particularly important that the bank should not exist in an ivory tower but that it should continue to justify itself to the public."
"There are a variety of ways in which it can achieve this."
"I would also like to point out that the European Parliament has a particularly privileged role here."
"The European Parliament is explicitly mentioned in the Treaties as the partner of the European Central Bank in dialogue, and this is not the case in the same way with other institutions."
"The European Parliament is a forum where all of Europe can in fact take part in the debate; though I would have liked to see a rather larger participation in this debate today, for I am of the opinion that this debate is of great significance."
"The European Central Bank is autonomous."
"It is committed in the first instance to ensuring price stability."
"At this point, I would like to remind Mrs Randzio-Plath that the Treaty plainly stipulates that the prime objective of the European Central Bank is to ensure price stability and that any other objectives may be pursued only if they can be achieved without any risk to price stability, and that price stability itself, as the President has already stated, can have positive social and economic effects."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to say that the European Central Bank has achieved some outstanding work in the course of this last year, since it was founded."
"It has taken some very important decisions, for example, its decision on the definition of price stability."
"That is of very great significance for the long-term development of our debate on this question."
"Even in its decision regarding the minimum reserves, which were rather controversial, the European Central Bank, i.e. the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, has demonstrated great perceptiveness."
"It has, at least, passed its period of probation as far as that goes."
"I would however like to specify that throughout this probationary period the Bank experienced fair weather, economically speaking."
"Perhaps occasionally things were rather hazy, but, on the whole, we are going through a period of positive economic development."
"It will be much more difficult for the European Central Bank to take uncomfortable decisions, such as, for example, raising interest rates rather than lowering them, if the economic situation becomes more difficult and if actual risks to price stability arise."
"In the first months of its existence, the European Central Bank has earned our confidence, but if it is to be able in the future to withstand such situations, then this confidence must be systematically consolidated in the years to come and, Mr President, in that endeavour you may count on the support of my group."
"We are called upon to vote on a draft amendment which demands that the votes of the individual members of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank should be made public."
"I would like to make it perfectly clear that my own group will never agree to such an amendment."
"Why not?"
"Individuals sit on the Governing Council of the Bank, who are personally responsible for monetary stability and who make decisions as individuals within this Governing Council."
"There is not, therefore, any weighting of votes, such as there is in the Council of Ministers, since it has been determined that these are people who have to vote here as individuals."
"Publishing the votes could lead to a situation where there would then be national debates on the behaviour of individual members."
"That would be extraordinarily negative both for the European Central Bank and also for all of us."
"The European Central Bank has achieved some excellent work, it has earned the confidence of the citizens by dint of its work in the last few months, and this is what we are going to reflect in this resolution."
"Mr President, this first annual report of the Central Bank gives me the opportunity to make an on the whole positive assessment of the work accomplished to date by the European Central Bank and the operation of the euro area."
"The Central Bank has managed to fulfil its primary mission of maintaining price stability."
"The general economic policies of the Union have been accompanied by an opportune reduction in key interest rates."
"The countries participating in the euro area have been in a position to continue their structural improvement."
"Growth has returned in the majority of European countries."
"Following the doubling of petroleum prices, a slight upsurge has been observed in inflation."
"The ECB has a duty to remain vigilant, but as the mean rate of inflation of the euro-11 is still well under the 2% mark, I dare to hope that the Governing Council will give growth and, consequently, further reduction in unemployment, a chance."
"According to ECB estimates, some four fifths of unemployment is structural in nature."
"More recent studies show that in fact less than one fifth of unemployment is structural."
"This type of unemployment linked to the current economic climate could be absorbed only by more vigorous growth."
"While emphasising the need to continue the policy of stability, I would like to ask President Duisenberg the following question: can Europe' s only ambition be to pursue a macroeconomic policy focused on stability alone?"
"In my view, the fight against inflation must go hand in hand with the improved coordination of budgetary policies and the establishment of a macroeconomic framework favourable to growth and to employment."
"When assessing the work of the ECB and the positive effect of the euro area, one must consider the internationalisation of financial markets."
"One is bound to observe that Europe has come to terms with the crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil rather well."
"Without the euro, some more vulnerable Member States would probably have experienced monetary difficulties along with, who knows, some cases of competitive devaluation."
"The euro is also a victory of Community regulation over the disordered interaction of individual financial markets."
"People will bring up the objection that, since its successful launch, the value of the euro has depreciated in comparison with the dollar."
"This is to forget that, within a floating exchange rate system, the main currencies are always going to evolve in relation to each other."
"In the last twenty years, the yearly slide in the volatile Mark/Dollar exchange rate has, on several occasions, exceeded 10%."
"The only criticism I have of the ECB is that it should be a bit less reticent about international exposure in all the various for a."
"The ECB is one of the most important central banks in the world."
"It is its duty to take a particularly close interest in the vulnerability of the international banking system and the fragility of the financial sector throughout the world."
"The crisis in Asia was not triggered by traditional macroeconomic imbalances, but by the financial excesses of the private sector."
"The irrational exuberance which characterises some stock exchanges, the excessive indebtedness of American households and of some economic sectors in important countries cause a definite threat to hang over worldwide economic stability."
"The ECB should make a firm commitment in all the appropriate fora to create a new regulatory framework for the structure of international finance."
"The essential complement ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, we in Sweden are relatively new to the EU, and I am new to this House."
"It is my understanding that we Swedes still have a lot to learn within the field of European cooperation."
"At the same time, it is my conviction that there is also a great deal for the EU to learn from how we handle some things in Sweden, for example the issues of openness and public access to official records."
"When it comes to the report on the European Central Bank, there is every reason to wonder whether we should not be able to do more to increase openness within the European Central Bank and public control of its affairs, to strengthen the Bank' s legitimacy and to increase democratic support for it."
"We Liberals believe that this is needed, and without, moreover, encroaching upon the Bank' s independence or reducing its efficiency."
"The Bank of Sweden now reports, with two weeks' delay, upon the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors."
"Monetary considerations, together with the positions adopted by the various Board Members, are reported on at this time."
"Last week, Swedes learned that the Deputy Chief Executive of the Bank of Sweden, together with a further Member of the Board, did not back the Bank' s latest report on inflation."
"They advocated a rise in interest rates but were voted down."
"Similar openness would be to the advantage of the European Central Bank too."
"Why?"
"Well, openness leads to clarity, which reduces uneasiness in the market and makes for stability. However, Mr Duisenberg and I are clearly not properly in agreement about this argument."
"Openness would increase our citizens' support for the Bank and make it easier for everyone to understand the goal of monetary policy: that price stability, just as Mr Duisenberg said, should lead to growth and employment."
"In my opinion, being open about strategies and prognoses, internal discussions and methods of voting will also actually increase Board Members' accountability, not reduce it."
"It is actually a good thing to be open to public scrutiny."
"I want to say too that we have today been able to see that support for EMU in Sweden has increased, which I am glad about."
"I should like to tell Mr Duisenberg that support for EMU and the likelihood of taking Sweden into EMU will increase if he and the European Central Bank display greater openness."
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, it is probably not necessary to say it, but please allow me to emphasise, as a humble MEP from a small country - the Basque Country - that you have a lot of power but it is a democratic power."
"And contrary to what somebody said a little while ago, we do know who granted that power."
"In the current phase of European construction we are seeing significant economic and monetary integration processes, which have been speeded up since the adoption of the single currency."
"In the real economy we are witnessing great mergers and concentrations which must be carried out in accordance with good practice and respect for consumer rights."
"At an institutional level the Central Bank plays a key role and we would also like this role to be counterbalanced with the transparency demanded of those institutions which result from the votes of the citizens."
"Somebody said that one should not grow fond of banks because they will never grow fond of you."
"We do not intend to present you with a rosy picture or a wonderful idyll, but we do not believe that it is too much to ask that at least they are transparent with the citizens of Europe who are affected by their policies and measures."
"In general terms we agree with the Huhne report, which emphasises the quality of the annual report of the ECB and the progress made in the communication of the Bank' s policy."
"We also agree with the measures proposed with regard to the increase in transparency and the need to clarify what the European Central Bank understands monetary policy to be, beyond price stability - which is evidently its main function - because this will undoubtedly contribute to an appropriate and balanced policy mix which is aimed at promoting sustainable development and lasting employment."
"I must insist once again on transparency: do not apply a bandage until you are injured."
"Mr Solbes said in an appearance before this Parliament that he would try to cooperate with the Members without prejudice to the quality of his work."
"Transparency does not have to be incompatible with the protection of aims of monetary policy."
"We are not asking for miracles nor that a great song and dance be made about what is going to be done, but simply that its management model be more transparent."
"If you take note of what other Central Banks have done and if you trust in this Parliament, have no doubt that we will make progress with transparency without endangering the objectives of the European Central Bank."
"Mr President, the European Central Bank is still very much an institution which makes crucial decisions for the millions of citizens of the European Union without being subject to any democratic or political control."
"From this point of view, when Parliament considers that progress is being made because regular press conferences are held following any Governing Council meetings and because, in addition to annual reports, the ECB also publishes monthly reports, this invokes a false sense of true democracy among the peoples of Europe."
"This 'progress' has, in fact, been run-of-the-mill practice at the central banks since the 1930s!"
"Mr President, European citizens are, first and foremost, interested in and, at the same time, concerned by the content of the policies of the European Central Bank, the European Union and the Member States - policies which give absolute priority to so-called monetary stability and the interests of major credit capital, at the cost of dramatic job losses and the total disintegration of the so-called European social model."
"Workers are concerned by the fact that the European Central Bank considers a growth rate of over 2.5% to be dangerous for the notorious monetary stability, thereby deferring indefinitely efforts to address the issue of unemployment."
"The average inflation rate of the 11 countries within the euro area is below 1%."
"Some countries have already entered an anti-inflationary phase, but there are growing signs of a rise in interest rates in order to maintain monetary stability."
"Mr President, with growth rates below 2%, with a new rise in interest rates, with deflation and the rigorous implementation of the Stability Pact, growing pressure is being brought to bear on the security and social rights of workers, and this will indirectly bring about a dramatic deterioration in their living standards and working conditions."
"Mr President, first of all, we must analyse the first period of the ECB' s activities which, as we know, began a year ago in the hope of becoming, in time, the main institution for intervention in the economies of the Member States of the Union."
"On the one hand, we have all noticed the greater role played recently by this institution - and indirectly, at the same time, the whole Union - in terms of economic policy and, especially, employment policy."
"On the other hand, this was not sufficient to ensure that the euro was not affected by speculation or weakened in the face of our competitors - which, of course, we must definitely not ignore - which are the United States and NAFTA."
"In fact the euro, which started with a strong position in the money markets, after a few months was exposed to attacks which were, to say the least, speculative."
"We must take note of this signal and always ensure that the focus behind major political, budgetary and monetary strategies is not the new single currency but a long-term view taking into account the need to give the euro and the Member States stability, and above all, to relaunch the Union' s economy and the employment situation which concerns each of us in this Parliament so greatly."
"Therefore, we must continue along the path which President Duisenberg is establishing within his role and the institution itself."
"However, at the same time, we must monitor price stability so that we can control the greater evil with which we are all familiar - inflation - and at the same time keep interest rates low to stimulate investments and relaunch the European industrial sector, making it more competitive with regard to the other States."
"In doing this, we would bring prestige to a new institution like the ECB and we would gain political credibility internationally."
"In a debate like this about this important institution known as the European Central Bank, two starting points might be taken."
"One can talk about what is apparent, that is to say the surface details; or one can talk about what is real."
"The European Central Bank' s mode of functioning is to stay on the surface."
"It is a question of regulations and rules of procedure."
"We are conducting a rather shadowy debate here, and it is also interesting what the rapporteur has written in the explanatory statement, namely that the European Parliament ""is responsible both for receiving and debating the annual report of the ECB and for monitoring the ECB"" ."
"There is no basis for this."
"Neither Article 113 of the Treaty nor Article 15 of the Statute give Parliament any powers other than the power to talk."
"So we can talk, then, and come up with comments about openness, as my excellent Swedish colleague has done, and I concur fully with the criticism of the culture of secrecy."
"But the reality is the European Central Bank as a political tool, and this House believes that the question of the euro and its establishment as an important institution is a matter which is over and done with."
"It is not!"
"It is a success, writes the rapporteur at the start of the report."
"Success according to what criteria?"
"Is it a criterion of success that the exchange rate has fallen since the euro was established?"
"And, if one considers social criteria such as unemployment, it hits you right in the eye that the three North European countries which are outside the single currency (namely Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain) have significantly lower unemployment than certain areas in the EU, where it is catastrophically high."
"Is this success?"
"The next step consists of referenda in the Scandinavian countries, and these will perhaps introduce a different agenda."
"Mr President, nine months after the euro' s launch and with enthusiasm for its future role as the major international reserve currency dimmed as the result of exchange rate weakness, it cannot be heralded as an unqualified success."
"It remains to be seen if the ""one-size-fits-all"" model of interest rates will work in countries like Ireland, without causing large tax rises and damaging the popularity of the Euro-project."
"Nevertheless I applaud the aims and coherence of the Huhne report as a basis for defining accountability of the Central Bank, on which I should like to say a few words, particularly on the issue of transparency and accountability."
"Some may question why I, as a British Member, should like to speak on this issue."
"I would like to point out that Britain and the British Conservative Party - to which I belong - have never been hostile to the euro as a currency for those Member States which genuinely wish to join, as we are all bound together through our membership of the single market so that a collapse in confidence for the euro would affect us all, whether we are in or outside the EMU."
"For this reason it is vital that the Central Bank enjoys the confidence of the financial markets."
"We live in an era of massive capital flows and foreign exchange markets."
"Some £300 billion is traded every day in the City of London."
"A collapse in the credibility of or belief that the Bank would not be prepared to pursue an anti-inflationary policy at all costs could have severe repercussions economically throughout the whole Union."
"I believe that only the Central Bank, for instance, should pronounce when necessary on foreign exchange target zones for the euro, to avoid conflicting messages being given to the financial markets."
"It is also vital, in my opinion, that the Bank be encouraged to follow the example of other leading central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in America, and make transparency a central feature of all its activities."
"I regret, therefore, that attempts to require the Bank to publish the names of those present, the voting on monetary actions, after a grace period of some two years and the publication of the ECB' s econometric models were defeated at committee stage and have not been put before this House today."
"It was also confusing yesterday to hear that Mr Issing, the ECB' s chief economist, reportedly stated in London that the Bank would not publish economic forecasts for Euro-land, perpetuating a culture of secrecy."
"I welcome Mr Duisenberg' s clarification on this issue today."
"I believe that any confident central bank would welcome the opportunity for its members to be challenged on the fundamental assumptions underlying their decisions."
"But particularly in the ECB' s case, as it does not have the track record of the mighty Bundesbank and could quickly lose the confidence of the financial markets if it is reluctant to protect itself through greater transparency."
"Openness to criticism is not a weakness but a strength."
"As a doctor I know that advances in medicine are often achieved only after rigorous scrutiny and challenge in peer review journals."
"The Bank has to learn to operate within the same spirit."
"I also believe that the financial markets and the people of Europe will expect no less of this new Central Bank and that this Parliament should be relentless in the pursuit of an open and accountable European Central Bank for the near future."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Central Bank, Commissioner, I believe that our sitting, today, is a founding act."
"This is the first time that you have presented your annual report to this House as President of the Central Bank."
"Indeed, if I am interpreting the Treaty on European Union correctly, this is an essential element in the balance designed by the people who set up Economic and Monetary Union, with the success we have seen, taking into account the conditions of the transition to the euro on 1 January this year."
"This balance, in fact, involves both the independence of your institution and the annual report which you must present to our own institution."
"This is the meeting we are witnessing today."
"Unlike some of my fellow citizens, I believe that today we are here reaching the very core of your democratic responsibility."
"As you know, this institution has clearly shown its will to exercise fully the competences accorded under the Treaty."
"Parliament set the condition of having a hearing with each of the members of your Executive Board; it meets you on a regular basis, and considers today' s meeting to be the high point of this approach."
"It is only to be expected that our debate today should be more concerned with the methods rather than the basis of the monetary policy."
"You are still just about in your initial running-in period, as are we."
"We must take advantage of this period to strengthen the resources that we, the European Parliament, have."
"But for your part, you too, Mr President, must perhaps take advantage of it to review again your idea of the relationship between your institution and ours."
"So, as regards transparency - many people before me have said it, but let me repeat it once again - if we want to be able to really act as an intermediary in monetary policy, which you implement and which we discuss, then we need you to present the decisions you are taking, and give your reasons and justifications for them."
"As regards monetary policy itself, you said, Mr President, that it cannot solve the structural problems of the labour market."
"Very well."
"But it can make a contribution, and this is what the Treaty invites you to do, and what we invite you to do."
"Sustained growth in Europe is essential if we wish to solve the problem of employment."
"There will be no structural reform without growth."
"Certainly, positive signs are appearing."
"We know that more gradual growth today is already enabling the creation of jobs in some of our countries."
"But if we want sustainable growth for a high level of employment, we need monetary policy to accompany this movement."
"This is what the treaty invites you to do, and this is the matter on which we expect positive signs from you."
"In this sense, the policy which you are pursuing in the area of interest rate policy is clearly essential, and we are awaiting very clear commitments from you in this respect."
"Mr President, this is an important debate for it is the first time we have come to discuss the European Central Bank' s report."
"The fact that President Duisenberg is present serves to underline the special relationship that the ECB has with our Parliament."
"The Liberals are satisfied with the ECB' s report and with the four proposals put forward by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for there to be more transparency in the bank' s dealings."
"But we are disappointed that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has shown itself unwilling to take one step more towards achieving still greater openness, hence my group has submitted a number of amendments to this end."
"I refer in particular to the publication of votes and the voting behaviour of each individual member of the Governing Council."
"We believe that this could only strengthen, not weaken the independence of the members."
"After all, the ex officio attendance of the Council of Ministers and the European Commission means that the national governments too are now in a position to know how the members vote and are able to bring pressure to bear at will, but then this is done completely unverifiably and behind closed doors."
"We do not doubt the integrity of the members of the Governing Council and openness is, we think, the best way in which to guarantee greater integrity."
"We have no time for the argument that members could not then change their minds. Of course they can if, for example, circumstances changed or new arguments were put forward."
"It may well be that their voting behaviour would initiate debate, but we are sufficiently reassured that the members of the Council have the fortitude to deal with this."
"Greater openness is a sign of strength and inspires confidence."
"We consider this to weigh more heavily than any possible risks."
"What is more, publication would bring the Bank more into line with the Federal Reserve Bank in the United States and the Bank of Japan."
"Why should we Europeans act as if we have something to hide?"
"Surely that is only going to weaken confidence in the euro?"
"Mr President, as liberals we are very much in favour of the ECB' s being independent and we value the part the President has to play in upholding this."
"But we believe that greater openness would reinforce the independence and authority of the ECB and request that Parliament supports moves to this end."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mr Huhne for an interesting report containing a number of important clarifications."
"Among other things, he points out that the European Central Bank is altogether too secretive, that the meetings are held in camera and also that the current President, Mr Duisenberg is against the minutes from the Bank' s discussions being published."
"There are a lot of people who have taken up this point, so that Parliament is expressing a strong opinion on the matter."
"Mr Huhne complains in his report that the European Central Bank does not display the same openness as the central banks in the USA, Japan and England."
"Olle Schmidt talks about the Bank of Sweden' s publishing the minutes as soon as two weeks after the meetings concerned."
"Why should not the European Central Bank be able to do the same?"
"There are various arguments in favour of this culture of secrecy."
"One of these which has been put forward is quite startling, I think."
"This is an argument to the effect that the Bank' s leading personnel will be better able to withstand pressure from lobbyists and individual governments if they have a duty of confidentiality imposed upon them."
"I think that, in this way, an amazing lack of confidence in these people' s strength of character, integrity and independence is being expressed."
"They are mistrusted, which shows that it is not only ourselves, who are among those critical of the EU, who are mistrustful. Instead, I would maintain that distrust of the Bank' s leading personnel is written into the Bank' s own statute."
"Finally, I also want to associate myself with Mr Huhne' s understanding of the goal and significance of monetary policy."
"I want to go a step further and say that the ideology concerning stability is just that: an ideology."
"If we look at what has happened in Europe in recent years, it appears, rather, that the policy of stabilisation merely stabilises unemployment."
"Ortega y Gasset said that wasted effort leads to melancholy, and I, in order not to become a victim of melancholy, am not going to repeat any of the ideas which have been expressed here."
"I will simply highlight some of the points with which I agree or disagree."
"The vice-chairman of my committee said, referring to the history of the euro, that we would have to go back as far as Charlemagne and probably Diocletian, who is the grandfather of the euro."
"And as a Spaniard I must mention Charles I, who wanted to unify the European currencies on the basis of the Cologne mark."
"And this leads me to the speech made by an English Conservative Member, who explained what the single currency required in order for the financial markets to have faith in it."
"What they probably need most is for the United Kingdom to join the single currency."
"Having said this and to get to the point, the Treaty of Maastricht enshrined the principle of price stability and put in place a fully independent European Central Bank to uphold this principle."
"But the Treaty of Maastricht did not deal with the institutional consequences of this decision, and for this reason we are talking today about the independence of the Central Bank, the relationship between the Central Bank and other institutions and the unresolved problems."
"In Amsterdam, the decision was taken not to amend the Treaty of Maastricht in any way, and therefore the problems which were pending are still pending."
"We are now on the eve of an Intergovernmental Conference which has to deal with the consequences of the decisions which we have taken before."
"Much has been said here about independence and it is true that, with the Treaty of Maastricht, those of us who believed that price stability was an essential condition for sustained development and that a Central Bank was necessary to control inflation have been vindicated, while those who believed that it was possible to implement any economic or monetary policy provided it produced short-term artificial growth, have been proved wrong."
"The spokesman of my group has expressed this very well and I will not repeat it."
"But because we believe in this model, we also believe that we should adopt decisions so that this model does not fall apart."
"Firstly, we have the problem of transparency, a topic the rapporteur handled with humour and skill."
"We believe in the independence of the Central Bank, but this Central Bank is much more independent than the Bundesbank or the United States Federal Reserve, because it was not created by an act of Parliament and cannot be modified by one, because it does not exist side by side with a government that has its own economic policy."
"And this has led some people to talk of a type of platonic aristocracy composed of a series of independent experts to whom decisions regarding monetary policy are entrusted in the belief - probably correct - that money is too serious an issue for politicians to deal with."
"For this reason, if we do not want this model to fall apart, it is necessary to prioritise transparency measures, and I whole-heartedly subscribe to each and every one of the measures which the rapporteur has mentioned."
"Secondly, we have the problem of the relationship of the Central Bank with the other European institutions."
"It has been said here that the priority objective is dealing with inflation, but it is not the only one: we have to think in terms of, amongst other things, an economic focus, responsibility, the international representation of the euro and the monitoring of the banking institutions at a time of significant mergers amongst the financial institutions."
"Mr President, Mr President of the European Central Bank, this debate is taking place with the euro having been in place for nine months, in conditions which enables us to affirm that its introduction has been successful, even if only in the limited sense that the transition to the third phase of the Economic and Monetary Union has taken place with no great upsets."
"Given that much of this success is undoubtedly due to the Central Bank, we must communicate our congratulations to its President, and we hereby do so."
"Having said this, we must stress two or three points: firstly - and this has been mentioned this afternoon and Mr Duisenberg knows perfectly well that it is a concern of this Parliament - we have the question of transparency."
"Given that this has been discussed here this afternoon, I will not pursue this argument, particularly as I know that Mr Duisenberg is perfectly aware of the Socialist Group' s position in this regard."
"The second issue I want to address, which for me is more important, is that of growth and employment, specifically the relationship between monetary policy and growth and employment."
"We agree with you, Mr President of the ECB, when you say that price stability is necessary for growth, and that growth and the creation of employment cannot happen without guaranteed price stability."
"Likewise we agree with you when you say that monetary policy alone cannot resolve the problem of unemployment."
"But we must also warn - and you understand this perfectly - that bad decisions regarding monetary policy may harm growth and prevent the economic recuperation which has started."
"There is no lack of historical examples in this respect and the warning is worthwhile at a time when economic recuperation in Europe is far from being confirmed and when, at the same time, there is speculation about the imminence of a stricter monetary policy."
"Lastly, I would like to take this opportunity, given that the Commission is present in this debate, to remind you of something which has also been repeated many times by this Parliament and which, in any case, is very important to our group: economic policy does not end with currency and does not end with monetary policy."
"The third phase of Economic and Monetary Union raises the issue, even more than in the past, of the need for a more robust and articulate coordination of economic policies."
"In this case, it is the responsibility - I would say the main responsibility in this area - of the Commission."
"You know this, Mr Solbes, and we call on you to face this responsibility, and in this you will surely be able to rely on the support of this Parliament."
"Mr President, obviously I do not share with the rapporteur in offering congratulations to the ECB."
"As for presenting the purely formal actions of the managers of the European Central Bank to involve the European Parliament as if it were the expression of democratic control, that is just a feeble joke."
"Having said that, I feel bound to object in particular to the virtual declaration of war against the workers and the unemployed of the European Union in the form of the objective declared by Mr Noyer, the Vice-President of the ECB, when he speaks, and I quote, of the need to ""reduce rigidities in labour markets"" or even for ""a break with often deeply rooted habits and allegedly acquired rights"" ."
"Well, we know that the rights he is talking about are simply the rights to a job and to a wage which affords a person a decent living."
"These gentlemen of the Central Bank act like the spokesmen for the employers who are effectively in the process of reducing ""rigidities in labour markets"" by axing thousands of jobs, such as Michelin, Renault-Nissan, Alsthom, Rhône-Poulenc, and Hoest Marion Roussel and many others even now, or by propagating the precariousness of jobs by means of wages which cast an increasing proportion of the population into ever greater poverty while the fortunes of major shareholders continue to grow."
"Gentlemen, beware, their attitude will ultimately trigger the reactions they deserve among workers and the unemployed."
"I hope that in all the countries of the European Union these reactions will unite the victims of the policy of employers."
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, we MEPs, as we have stated a number of times this evening, have a unique role to play in relation to the single currency because this Chamber here is the only place in which the people of Europe can have any democratic input into how their new currency is run."
"We must not shy away from addressing the difficult issues which surround Europe' s single currency, because if we do so we will be letting down those people who elected us to this Chamber so recently."
"Mr Duisenberg, in my view, you have a more or less impossible task because you have to set a rate that is suitable not only for the booming economies of Ireland and Spain but will also suit the faltering economy of Germany."
"Still less would it be possible to fix a rate which would also suit the persistently divergent economy of the UK."
"But none of us here doubt the importance of your role because a domestic Euroland government faced with reviving a faltering economy has very few weapons at its disposal."
"It has no power to set interest rates, no power over exchange rates, little power over government spending restricted by the Stability Pact and, if many people in this Parliament had their way, it would have no power over its own tax rates."
"The governments have very few cards left to play with and not for nothing has it been said that the euro could lead to a recipe for stagnation."
"But we should not be surprised at the limitations on the powers that are left to the domestic governments in Euroland because it has never been a secret of those founding fathers of the single currency that what they had in mind was the creation of political union and a united states of Europe."
"I welcome your frankness, Mr Duisenberg, in making clear the very big political leap which has been made by those countries which have already entered Euroland."
"But anyone who denies the existence of this political agenda - which subsumes the single currency - in my view is either deluded or dishonest, because it is a very real agenda."
"We saw that very recently, articulately presented to us by President Prodi when he said that we now face the best opportunity to unite Europe since the fall of the Roman Empire."
"Clearly, Mr Prodi had in mind the replacement of an ancient hegemony with a new economic one."
"But political union may not just be the idle dream of a few federalists."
"When you share a joint bank account with your neighbour you are affected by the actions and the spending decisions of your neighbour."
"You legitimately need some control over their actions."
"There is a very strong argument for saying that the single currency cannot function properly unless there is increased political integration and political union."
"That is one of the many reasons why the British Conservatives are campaigning vigorously to persuade the UK to keep its own currency and to keep the pound and to stay out of the single currency."
"Mr President, Mr Duisenberg, the annual report from the European Central Bank shows that the bank has got off to a brisk start, and the steps taken so far have been on the right track."
"The transition to the third stage of EMU has taken place without problems."
"During its first months of operation, the bank has been able to adapt its working methods to the demands of the present day."
"Nevertheless, much has still to be done to raise the European Central Bank to the position to which it is entitled, though not automatically so."
"In the future we wish to see a strong and independent European Central Bank and not just one alongside our global competitors, Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, but, preferably, edging ahead of them."
"Building up its status and obtaining the confidence of markets will, however, take time, and we here in the European Parliament cannot presume that everything will happen in an instant."
"In discussing the annual report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, we had lively discussions on inter alia the issue of transparency and how it can be gradually increased."
"Although transparency has undeniably increased and, for example, press conferences with the President, held after board meetings, have meant a clear improvement in the bank' s approach, the aim must be to increase transparency further, once the work of the bank becomes established and the teething problems disappear."
"The European Parliament must, as the representative of the European people, have the right to demand that in future, the ECB, like other central banks, should also publicise the arguments both in favour of, and against, its monetary policy decisions."
"Furthermore, the publication of abstracts of board meetings is justifiable, and the justifications for decisions taken must be clearly evident from these abstracts, so that market players can make their own decisions."
"For my own part, I seriously considered my position regarding whether the individual opinions of the members of the board and possible decisions taken by a vote should be made public in the future."
"However, I ended by adopting the majority position of our group, justifying my decision by reflecting how this sort of approach might reduce rather than increase market confidence in the work of the bank in the early stages."
"It could also be just too big a step to take so early on."
"In the long term, however, I hope that transparency is fully realised at every stage, in this regard also."
"Information is power, and the dissemination of information in an open market economy is democracy."
"Market viability can be enhanced through the spread of information."
"The more evenly information is disseminated in a society, the more effectively individual choices steer the economy' s development and guide the invisible hand of the market."
"Finally, I would like to say that I thoroughly support the publication of the reports on the economic situation of the countries in the euro area and the various indicators that go with it."
"The ECB may also comment on this information, but their analysis must, however, be left to national decision-makers."
"We have to remember that, although the euro area has just one monetary policy, we still have eleven different economic policies, for whose coordination the Member States are responsible, within the frameworks determined in the Growth and Stability Pact."
"Mr President, it is a shame that this debate is soon to finish."
"I would very much like to hear Mr Duisenberg answer a number of questions that have been raised."
"I hope there will still be enough time for this."
"I wanted to remind him of his role in the Dutch consultation system in a former life."
"In particular I also want to raise the question that other speakers have raised too, as to what he would think to developing a consultation system of this kind on the European scene."
"I hope that he will take a little time to address this issue before we close."
"As far as his former life in the Netherlands is concerned; the Central Bank of the Netherlands, of which he was President for many years, was at the centre of the field of influence in society in which socio-economic policy was developed, and I believe that we should take our example from this and involve the European Central Bank in a European macroeconomic dialogue."
"As you know, there are plans afoot for dialogue of this kind to take place and there is also due to be a meeting on 8 November."
"It is also established practice in the Netherlands for there to be structured ways in which the Dutch Central Bank participates in the consultation system, for example there is a banking council in which advice is given to the bank and in which both sides of industry also take part. This participation in the consultation system economy is also afforded by the Dutch Central Bank having a seat on the socio-economic council, which is the most important advisory body in the socio-economic field."
"I hope that the macroeconomic consultation between both sides of industry that is soon to take place will be given a far more prominent role."
"The comments that Mr Duisenberg made in his introduction, to the effect that this dialogue ought only to confine itself to the exchange of information, fell rather short of the mark in this respect to my mind."
"I think that in view of his experiences in the Netherlands he ought not to be so wary of taking such responsibilities, and also feel that coordinating and harmonising policy could be of great benefit to further developments."
"I would like to close with a quote that he himself used when he recently attended the opening of new banking premises in the Netherlands."
"The quote was as follows: "" I believe that the future is also the past, only it comes in through a different door"" ."
"He might like to relate this quote to his own circumstances."
"Mr President, I never thought of comparing Mr Duisenberg with the Pope but if we are going to do so here in this Parliament then might I request that Mr Duisenberg' s role is a more independent one, if at all possible."
"The annual report goes into great detail about the seamless way in which the crucial transition to 1999 was effected, a very important moment."
"Another such crucial point in time is on its way, that is to say the day on which Europe' s general public will literally have the new coin in hand."
"I have had several discussions with you, Mr Duisenberg, on how the Member States want to handle the introduction of the euro."
"The closer the first of January gets, the more everyone becomes aware of the difficulties that consumers, particularly the elderly, and the retail trade are to face."
"An ever increasing number of studies state that there are going to be very considerable problems and these are being shouldered by the weakest parties: the consumer and the retail trade."
"It recently became apparent that the Central Bank will not oppose frontloading the general public with coins."
"It is true that the Member States are in agreement about the distribution of coins."
"However, the Central Bank has always maintained to date that regulations and/or laws preclude the frontloading of the general public with banknotes."
"Mr Noyer came to Parliament recently and when I asked him what the main objection was to frontloading coins or banknotes he actually gave the vaguest answer I have ever heard."
"If he ever finds himself penniless then he will have no trouble at all getting into politics."
"But I want a clear answer today."
"I know just how clear you can make yourself."
"What is the main objection?"
"And do not tell me that it would be difficult to explain to people that they could not spend their euros for the first fortnight."
"Any citizen assumed to have an understanding of the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam could not possibly have difficulty comprehending that."
"It is downright insulting to suggest otherwise."
"The Economic Institute of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in the Netherlands, which I am sure you are familiar with, carried out a study and concluded that the retail trade needs to have 100% of its daily turnover available in change, as opposed to the 7% available to it now."
"The situation is so bad because the cash machines, the banknote dispensers will not dispense any of the small five and ten euro notes."
"I hardly need to tell you what kind of an impact that will have on cash flows, the security of check-out operators and shops, bank charges, etc. Every evening proprietors are going to have to convert their whole day' s takings into change again, doing the same for every shop they own."
"The banks will have to face up to their responsibility."
"Mr Duisenberg, the Central Bank needs to come down from its ivory tower and really get to grips with the difficulties facing those ordinary people who are soon going to have to work with the euro."
"Have trial runs carried out if you do not believe me or the studies."
"But consider that the success of the euro will depend on its introduction running smoothly precisely where ordinary people are concerned."
"The discussion continues to focus on how much it will cost the banks."
"But the discussion ought in fact to focus on whether there is going to be chaos or whether things will run smoothly."
"The banks are equipped to deal with large flows of money and security but the corner shop and the local baker are not."
"You too will be assessed not in terms of greater or lesser increases or reductions in the rate of interest but in terms of how the euro will be brought into circulation."
". (ES) Mr President, my intervention will be very brief, and I simply wish to highlight the importance of the presence of Governor Duisenberg in Parliament for the analysis of the first report of the Central Bank."
"It also seems essential to comment on the success of the euro and to congratulate the Bank on its excellent performance during the last year."
"Given that today' s debate is basically between Parliament and the Central Bank and it is not for us to play any other role, I would simply like to point out, in response to the concern of some Members, that we will have the opportunity to debate here the problem of coordinating economic policies, which is within the competence of the Commission."
"And with regard to the specific problem of the external representation of the euro, we are satisfied with the role that the European Central Bank is playing."
"We are not so satisfied with the role of the Commission."
"As I pointed out in my hearings, we will have time to return to a discussion of this issue."
"Once again, my congratulations to the Central Bank."
"Mr President, in my introductory statement I already approached many of the issues which have been again brought forward in Parliament this afternoon."
"So if you allow me, I will try to formulate my answer by grouping together many of the issues that have been raised in Parliament and produce a comprehensive answer, or at least some remarks."
"First of all the issue of transparency."
"Although I realise and I am grateful that the desire to have the votes or minutes published by the Governing Council does not appear in the motion for a resolution which will be voted on tomorrow by your Parliament, in this discussion a lot of attention, much more than I expected, was paid to the phenomenon of transparency, culminating in publishing the vote."
"I would like to emphasise that when you talk about and require transparency you have to indicate precisely what that means."
"What does transparency mean?"
"I would warn against what I might call mixing up transparency with publishing the vote."
"As far as transparency is concerned, which I define as giving to the public or Parliament as much information as possible about developments in the economy, about monetary developments, about the outcome of the deliberations of the Governing Council, I believe - and I said so in my introductory statement - that the European Central Bank can look squarely in the eyes of any central bank in the world."
"For example, there is our publication immediately after the meetings of the Governing Council of the considerations which have played a role in the Governing Council' s ultimate decision whether or not to change interest rates."
"That is done about one hour after the decision has been taken."
"We give the arguments for and against certain decisions there."
"I believe that you will find no central bank in the world which is more transparent than we are."
"The only thing we do not do is we do not publish votes."
"Apart from the fact - and this may be somewhat embarrassing - that we virtually never vote in the Governing Council, so there is nothing to be published, I will not repeat all the arguments against this which I have brought before this Parliament on earlier occasions, but one has to remember that the decisions of the Governing Council of the Eurosystem are made in a collegial way and there is one decision only which emerges."
"The arguments for and against it are published in the press conferences and in the Monthly Bulletin after the meetings have taken place but there is one decision."
"One always has to bear in mind that every word that is spoken by me or any other member of the Governing Council about economic developments and about the decisions which are taken and in what direction sets in motion immediately billions of euros across the world."
"It is always a signal to the market and it takes effect almost simultaneously with the utterance of the opinion."
"On forecasts, Mr President, I do not need to say more than I have already said in my introductory statement."
"There will come a time when we will publish forecasts, either bi-annually or tri-annually."
"I do not yet know the precise form."
"We are actively investigating this question but we simply are not ready yet and we do not have enough data or know the models which ultimately we will use."
"We have not yet reached a degree of stability which would make it responsible for them to be published now but, as I said in my introduction, I am confident that in the course of next year we will publish forecasts."
"To avoid one misunderstanding, it has been asked repeatedly here ""why do you not take an example from the Federal Reserve system which publishes forecasts"" and I believe it is also a consideration behind the motion for a resolution."
"That must be a misunderstanding because what the Federal Reserve system publishes twice a year in its Humphrey-Hawkins testimony for the Senate is a range of figures for a few indicators, the range being the range of the individual forecasts of members of the Federal Open Market Committee coming from the regional Federal Reserve banks."
"That range, the forecast with which they come once every six weeks to Washington, is published."
"Forecasts are also prepared for the FOMC meeting and in particular for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve system, forecasts prepared by the staff of the Board of Governors."
"They are the forecasts which are used to underpin the decisions that the FOMC takes at any particular moment in time."
"Those forecasts are not published."
"And I already made some remarks in my introduction on the relativity of forecasts, even if they are published, for the decision-making process."
"Various Members of this Parliament have questioned whether the ECB places too much emphasis on prices and too little on growth and employment."
"At least that is how I have understood the question; that was the signal that was given to me."
"Firstly, the Treaty of the ECB makes it literally mandatory for the ECB to give primary attention to their primary objective, which is to maintain price stability."
"The Treaty says ""without prejudice to price stability"" , that is only when price stability, I should say, is guaranteed, should the ECB in its policies support the general economic policies of the Community."
"There is another small remark I would like to make, Mr President, but it is important in the context of the motion for a resolution."
"I believe the Treaty language is a little misrepresented."
"In the resolution it says ""providing that this price stability is attained"" ."
"The Treaty says, and not without reason, ""without prejudice to the objective of price stability"" - and that is of great importance in economic terms."
"The wording of the resolution may be interpreted as suggesting that when the current rate of inflation is below 2% then the Eurosystem would be under an obligation to support the general economic policies of the Communities."
"In contrast the wording ""without prejudice"" clarifies, and it is intended to do so, that the Eurosystem is under no obligation to act in this mechanical fashion if it believes that doing so might jeopardise price stability in the future."
"I ask Parliament to take that into account."
"Regarding the suggestion that there is too much emphasis on price stability, the formal answer is that it is our mandate."
"Also, I would like to repeat that we do not overestimate the impact that monetary policy can have - what it can and cannot do."
"It is my firm belief that monetary policy can and will influence the movement of prices over the medium-term but not in the short-term."
"That is why we have a forward-looking strategy."
"The direct impact of monetary policy measures on employment and growth is very limited indeed."
"That is borne out by research which we did at the institution where, as Mrs van den Berg indicated, I previously worked."
"Turning to the current situation, I should like to repeat that the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, which has been made very clear to Parliament, is based on two pillars, both designed to be forward-looking over the medium-term."
"The two pillars are: the reference value for monetary growth, M3, and a broadly-based assessment of a wide range of indicators and their impact on the primary aim of price stability."
"That broadly-based assessment is one that encompasses a wide range of indicators, of course including developments in the real economy, movements in employment and unemployment, an assessment of movement of the exchange rate in so far as it has an impact on price levels in the euro area."
"That is our strategy. It is forward-looking."
"Of course we look at the current developments in inflation also as one of the indicators of what we think is going to happen in the future, but it is certainly not true that we only look at the current inflation rate, as implied in the draft resolution."
"You will understand that I will not join Parliament in the debate on what decisions might be taken in the short-term on interest rates, although that decision has been alluded to by various Members of Parliament."
"In Parliament it has been said by various Members that if interest rates were to be raised that would choke economic growth and the growth of employment."
"But please remember that when you are driving a car very fast and you want it to go forward, but maybe a little slower, you can either step on the brakes or you can lift your foot a little bit from the accelerator."
"There is a difference."
"Raising interest rates in a certain situation might be more akin or related to lifting your foot from the peddle as opposed to braking the momentum of the economy and in that way going slower."
"We all want to go forward."
"Mrs Peijs wanted a very clear answer on frontloading."
"I hope to be as clear as I can on banknotes."
"The Eurosystem, early on, made it clear to the public at large that frontloading over a short period would not be a problem provided it could be ensured that the money frontloaded to banks, for instance, or other organisations is not brought into circulation before 1 January 2000 - into general circulation that is."
"We formulated that by saying that banknotes may be frontloaded provided there are legal or contractual guarantees at the receiving end which ensure they will not be brought into circulation before 1 January."
"There would have to be contracts or legal provisions or contracts with retail organisations or banks."
"Then it would be possible."
"On coins - you will be aware I do not have responsibility for coins, this is a matter for the finance ministers - the big difference is that it is virtually impossible to get that same guarantee as far as coins are concerned because coins are generally put into circulation by the retail sector rather than by the banks."
"To have such a guarantee would be impossible."
"Another large difference is that it is very easy to try to make a counterfeit banknote with modern photocopying techniques which is the reason why the precise features of the banknotes to come will be widely published but only very briefly in advance of their introduction, so as to reduce the danger of counterfeiting and confusing a public which is not yet familiar with the notes."
"It is much more difficult to counterfeit coins."
"I have touched upon all the major issues that have been raised today on banking supervision."
"It is well known that the Treaty gives very little responsibility to the European Central Bank in the area of banking supervision."
"Our task is to promote financial stability and the stability of the financial markets."
"We monitor banking supervision, but this is not one of the tasks of the Central Bank."
"We are fully involved in the further development of rules."
"Mr Goebbels said that the ECB should be: ""a bit less reticent about international exposure in all the various fora"" ."
"The ECB is now fully involved in all discussions in all international fora on the future of what is now called the ""financial architecture"" in the world."
"The ECB is fully involved in all discussions of the G-7, of the G-10, of the OECD."
"We have a permanent representative who is very actively engaged in discussions at the IMF."
"In December there will be the first meeting of this new Group of 20 at the initiative of the G-7 countries, consisting of the G-7 countries and a few emerging market representatives. The ECB will be there."
"We will also participate in that dialogue."
"As Mrs van den Berg has asked, we do participate in the macroeconomic dialogue but just as in the Netherlands, the Central Bank participates in the dialogue but does not agree to a compromise on its policy in order to get a concession in another policy area."
"There will be no ex ante policy coordination but there will be an extensive and, I hope, critical exchange of information of all the partners involved, including the ECB."
"Thank you very much, Mr Duisenberg."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m."
"Assessing the Community' s humanitarian actions and looking to the future"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on assessing the Community' s humanitarian actions and looking to the future."
"Mr President, the Commission has today accepted a report to Parliament and the Council, assessing ECHO."
"The Commission' s assessment is based upon a report by consultants."
"This report has been prepared by professional people."
"I think that this is the correct way to go about things."
"When, in the future, the Commission assesses activities in my own area, this ought to be done on the basis of such modern, professional and open methods."
"The consultants' overall conclusion was positive, and the Commission shares this positive view of ECHO."
"However, we are alert to the fact that there are a number of things which can be improved."
"First of all, cooperation needs to be improved."
"We need to improve our cooperation with the multinational organisations, the UN bodies and the Red Cross organisations."
"The intention is to help the international community respond more effectively and in a better coordinated way in different crises."
"The fact that ECHO is such a big aid organisation means that we also share a more general responsibility for its effectiveness."
"At the same time, it means that we should also make larger demands in cooperation with, among others, the various UN organisations."
"We need to establish a broader and more activity-based approach to individual humanitarian crises."
"This should be done within the framework of the existing regulations."
"Secondly, there is the question of our management strategy."
"Improvements internal to ECHO should also be made."
"We should invest more highly in a concerted handling of the whole project cycle, which includes ensuring effective feedback."
"On this basis, we should to a greater degree be measuring results instead of input."
"There are also points on which we have disagreed with the consultants' proposals."
"We do not, for example, wish to abolish ECHO' s logo."
"European taxpayers are entitled to know where the aid is going to, and there is no reason, either, to conceal from the recipients where the same aid is coming from."
"But ECHO' s visibility and its logo must not be permitted to hamper cooperation with our partners."
"Thirdly, there are the policy considerations."
"In the longer term, the Commission wants to develop a cohesive strategy for the grey area here, that is to say the area between real humanitarian aid and longer-term, more future-oriented development work."
"At present, a lively international debate, in which the Commission is also to be an active participant, is taking place about this so-called transition gap."
"What is more, the Commission' s internal resources are to be mobilised so that they can release the required humanitarian aid in individual situations when the time is ripe."
"The objective is to give ECHO the opportunity to define a meaningful exit strategy in connection with different crises."
"Combining the two portfolios of development and humanitarian aid provides a better opportunity for this, not least on the basis of the fact that both ECHO' s sphere of work and the Commissioner' s responsibility for development policy are global in character."
"The plan is to present a report on this subject in June 2000."
"The Commission will also launch a debate about other important policy areas: conflict prevention, preparedness in advance of crises and catastrophes, and humanitarian aid which is based upon upholding human rights, that is to say which focuses to a greater degree upon the victims' rights as human beings."
"Special groups include women (especially victims of rape), child soldiers, refugees and internally displaced persons."
"In all these areas, a connection with the Commission' s development policy should naturally be guaranteed."
"The plan is to report on these areas in July 2001."
"And, finally, the conclusions."
"ECHO is to continue to retain its non-partisan character in all conflicts."
"This is important for the purpose of securing access to the victims of crises."
"ECHO' s presence in a wide range of countries, each with its own workers who have been sent out, is an important link in an effective policy of humanitarian aid."
"ECHO is an organisation with its own power to act and with motivated staff who are ready to implement the proposed improvements."
"In the midst of all discussion about changes, it is important to state that ECHO' s committed and loyal staff are the most important asset we have to build upon."
"I am looking forward to seeing the results of the changes."
"It is my intention to visit East Timor in the very near future."
"This will be a good opportunity to see some concrete results of ECHO' s work and for me to do what I can to establish fruitful cooperation with all our partners."
"Mr President, I have a question for Mr Nielson regarding bridging the gap which he mentioned. He said there would be further discussion of this."
"Were there any proposals in the expert report as to the form this involvement of development aid would take or even of other development instruments such as PHARE or TACIS, for example, and has it been ascertained whether the problems are in the area of ecological aid and the programme there or in the area of other forms of aid?"
"Could you clarify this?"
"Mr President, there were actually a number of proposals made by the evaluation."
"One of them had to do with ECHO moving more into the area of development cooperation, in a sense staying longer in a post-conflict situation."
"I do not think this is how to do it - we will end up over-stretching the resources very rapidly because new conflicts keep coming up."
"So we need to have a balanced approach, drawing on the resources in our development cooperation in general but making sure that they go in when ECHO goes out."
"It sounds easy but it is not that easy."
"In general it is necessary to combine these things and many are not able to do it."
"A very big problem is that individual countries although good donors do not have the resources to stay a long time in many conflicts."
"This is where the European Union has a special capacity and also special responsibility."
"It is extremely important that we, at a certain point, become very good at managing this transition gap."
"Mr President, I am going to ask three questions on behalf of my Socialist colleagues in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, who are here in spirit but physically are in the Committee itself, voting on the amendments relating to the World Trade Organisation."
"Firstly: can it be deduced from the Commission' s arguments here today that the funding of ECHO for humanitarian aid will mainly continue to be channelled through the programmes of different NGOs, or is any change envisaged in this regard?"
"Secondly: does the Commission intend to support the reform of the regulations which govern humanitarian aid?"
"And, if that is the case, in what respect?"
"Would such a reform be carried out in accordance with the codecision principle which is introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam?"
"Thirdly: can it be deduced from today' s discussion that ECHO will retain its full role of channelling European Union humanitarian aid in crisis situations, or, rather, that the activity of ECHO and humanitarian aid itself will be progressively diluted within the Union' s general policy of cooperation for development?"
"First, we are not planning or expecting any change concerning distribution, as between NGOs and UN organisations and other organisations, driven by our management or policy We respond to appeals and crises and use whichever organisation is able to do a good job in the specific circumstances."
"We do not have a fixed, preconceived idea of who gets what."
"Concerning the NGOs, we have found very few changes to be necessary."
"We know that in practice, in daily operations, we will have to streamline procedures as much as possible but, in general, this has not been seen as a major issue in the whole evaluation process."
"Moving on to the next question, on reforming or changing the regulation, I already made it clear in my opening remarks that we think it is possible to make many important and necessary changes within the existing regulation."
"We will come back to that."
"We are not closing the option of changing the regulation but this will be taken up in a much broader, long-term process - the one I mentioned concerning the policy part of our response."
"For the time being we will work on the basis of the existing regulation."
"We think this gives enough scope for the changes that are needed."
"Regarding the codecision aspect of this, in responding to the evaluation, I have deliberately avoided saying anything concerning that issue."
"How codecision will eventually be hammered out in terms of relations between Parliament, the Council and Member States in decision-making on humanitarian activities is something that needs to be discussed further and perhaps negotiated."
"But I did not want to open up a discussion on that because following up the evaluation is not a problem I have to deal with."
"Concerning the identity of the operation, I distinctly mentioned the logo and the discussion."
"The consultants recommended that we should give up the specific ECHO logo."
"This is one point on which I feel we should not follow their recommendation."
"But we have to strike some kind of balance."
"To put it in a nutshell: visibility is fine, feasibility is better."
"There is, in some cases, a risk that pushing the logo too much creates friction and reduces the willingness to cooperate smoothly on the ground."
"Somewhere we have to find a balance."
"But I did not want to back down as far as visibility is concerned."
"We owe it to our tax-payers, the European public."
"Certainly there is no reason why we should hide from the beneficiaries who it is that is actually helping them."
"Mr President, I want first of all to say that I am here as a representative of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which is meeting now."
"I want to say to Commissioner Nielson that his presentation was music to my ears."
"Three things, in particular, caught my attention."
"First of all, he promises openness and modernity; openness is incredibly important, since ECHO is among the highest-profile organisations of the European Union."
"Secondly, he also promises increased cooperation with the United Nations and the Red Cross; this is also important and has been needed for a long time."
"Thirdly, he anticipates too a more integrated view of humanitarian aid in foreign policy generally, designed to prevent conflict, which I believe is necessary."
"My question is this: is the Commissioner prepared, in anticipation of the report also promised for June 2000, continually to consult in one form or another with Parliament and with any non-governmental organisations concerned?"
"My answer to the question will be ""yes"" ."
"I should very much like to see open debate and open procedure."
"We can use any good ideas, and what we are trying to do with ECHO is precisely to mobilise Europe' s population, too."
"The fact that we are involved as active partners in these different conflicts and crisis situations is also a demonstration to our own citizens in Europe that Europe has a role to play in these places."
"That is why it is also necessary to involve citizens, and that is to say Parliament, and I am therefore very prepared for cooperation with Parliament and with Parliament' s committees when it comes to the next steps we are to take."
"Mr President, involving the NGOs is something which the machinery both of the United Nations and of Europe is intensely concerned with, and this is doubtless something which is necessary."
"But when it is a question of constructing democracies in a number of countries, I also think we ought to be looking at how we can involve the members of the parliaments in these countries."
"We have no tradition at all for doing this through, for example, the UN machinery."
"We still scarcely have any such tradition through the European machinery."
"It is, for example, a fact that the NGOs have direct representation in the United Nations whereas members of the parliaments are only appendages of their governments, and it is only as such that they can offer any input."
"I am very much of the view that we could re-think this machinery and that we ought to be asking ourselves how we can guarantee better parliamentary cooperation with a number of developing countries and also with the Central and East European countries we are supposed to be helping. I am saying this not because the NGOs should not continue to be involved there but because I think it is a rather false picture we are giving of the construction of democracy if we say that it is only NGOs which can be actively involved."
"In fact, parliamentarians can also be involved and, in reality, were in fact originally involved in our own wealthy part of the world before the NGOs came on the scene."
"I very much share Mrs Dybkjær' s point of view."
"The impression has been given that the abbreviation NGOs might almost be read as standing for neogovernmental organisations."
"But when we consider ECHO' s work, we are talking here about situations following wars and crises in which the societies concerned have fallen apart and in which, in general, it is a question of establishing structures in the societies concerned."
"I very much agree that members of the various parliaments are naturally important elements but, if we take countries like Somalia, Sudan and other such places, we are forced to take what there is by way of structures in the so-called civil society and try to help these structures become parts of a civilised society."
"In connection with our efforts as a whole in this area - and not just those involving ECHO and humanitarian aid - a lot of people have asked whether we have not got things the wrong way around in insisting that elections be held quickly."
"Cambodia was one example, Angola another."
"Some people think that, in these cases, we insisted too quickly that elections should be held and the formal structures of democracy created."
"On the other hand, insisting on these things has worked well in many cases, so I agree that we should be pressing for the outward and formal structures of democracy to be established. This is the way in which - as soon as structures of this kind have been established - parliamentarians become the decisive players, in civil society too."
"With regard to the part of the question concerned with the role to be played in what we are doing by members of the parliaments concerned - and that is another way of looking at the question - I want to say that the debate itself, the very dialogue between the Commission and Parliament about the policy we are to pursue, is for me the decisive factor, and it is from there that we get the decisive inspiration."
"Mr President, could I ask the Commissioner whether he considers that this evaluation risks putting structures in place which actually endanger the possibility of us of being able to react in a crisis as quickly and as effectively as he suggests we should? secondly, Commissioner, let us take for instance a case study such as Sierra Leone: You talked about the clear distinction between humanitarian aid and long-term assistance."
"Could you give me your analysis of what stage one part of your work will take over from the other in the case of Sierra Leone?"
"No, to the first part of the question."
"I do not see that anything we are suggesting here would actually endanger our capacity for quick action."
"We are not moving towards creating a rigid system and the special character, the ability to act and the identity of ECHO as such, are all something I find important in order to avoid ECHO, as a humanitarian relief organisation, becoming involved in the very cumbersome decision-making machinery of the Commission in general."
"We are not heading toward the kind of problems that you ask about here."
"Regarding Sierra Leone, it is very difficult to say."
"The main thing is to what extent it is possible to mobilise enough donors; it is not just what we do ourselves."
"There must be a critical mass of donors who are willing and able to make a more long-term effort in a given country, so coordination is extremely important here."
"We have to be able to deliver our share of it and phase out crisis-based ECHO presence, replacing it with the post-conflict presence of a more long-term character of our development resources."
"If others do not participate, it will not work, so part of the answer to what we have to do now is to be more active in the discussion from case to case - within groups of friends of Sierra Leone, to take one example - trying to organise a more coordinated response to moving away from the immediate crisis demands."
"One case that illustrates where we should be careful not to end up is that the UNHCR is still today funding and managing primary education in Rwanda."
"Nobody else is ready to pay for it and that is why they are there."
"They are doing a respectable job but it shows that the international system and who does what becomes distorted if the normal donors do not demonstrate a readiness to play their traditional role."
"This is where we hope to be able to push the international discussion in a better direction than hitherto."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.15 p.m.)"
"Annex - Formal sitting"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my very great pleasure today to welcome Mr Andrés Pastrana, President of the Republic of Colombia here today."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, your visit to the European Parliament comes at a time when the whole population of Columbia has demonstrated loud and clear its desire for an end to civil unrest, and for democracy and respect for human rights."
"We were very touched by this appeal by eleven million Colombians, including your own wife, who last Sunday marched through the streets of many towns in your country."
"Please be aware that the desire for peace expressed by your fellow countrymen addresses us and it is our duty to encourage any initiative which may contribute to peace."
"This massive demonstration coincided with the opening of peace negotiations between your government and the guerrilla movement in Uribe."
"I would like, especially, to pay tribute to your perseverance and to your courage which made it possible to initiate this peace process which, I sincerely hope, will progress and be successful."
"Yes, the European Parliament can stand alongside the Colombians who last Sunday chanted Nunca mas (No more)."
"Mr President, your continent and your country in particular have paid a high toll to violence and political instability."
"This is why I would like to pay tribute, in your presence, to all those who were the victims of their own commitment to democracy."
"There were too many of these female and male politicians, journalists, defenders of human rights and citizens who paid with their lives for their fight for a more just and more humane society."
"Please be aware, Mr President, that we shall support every effort intended to suppressing terrorist campaigns, to controlling paramilitary forces, and to affirming the supremacy of civil authority over military might."
"The European Union will assist you in your peacemaking enterprise, and shall promote the strengthening of relations between the European Union and Colombia."
"The cooperation agreement, of the third generation type, has already made it possible to establish solid links between us."
"I am convinced that these links would be stronger yet if they were to come within the framework of intensified regional cooperation between the Andean Pact countries, a reinforcement which we devoutly wish for because regional stability is achieved primarily, of course, by being on good neighbourly terms."
"Mr President, the European Parliament today hopes to encourage you to continue in your move to establish once and for all the rule of law."
"We thank you for your attendance here, for your visit, and it is now my very great pleasure to give you the floor."
"(Loud applause)"
"Address by Mr Pastrana, President of the Republic of Colombia"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to appear before you, the representatives of a Europe which promotes optimism, which is the most successful example of a genuine political integration this century and which demonstrates that it is indeed possible to return from death to life, from disrespect for human beings to the veneration of their rights, from pessimism to hope: which also demonstrates that peace is possible wherever development, social justice, the defence of the weakest, solidarity and coexistence are established."
"At this moment, and from this hemicycle within the new European Parliament complex, my country has the great privilege of addressing Europe, through the elected representatives of the people of the fifteen countries which currently make up the European Union."
"Colombia, the country which I govern by democratic consent, is struggling with a difficult quest for peace, employment, development and, above all, social justice."
"The sovereign population of Colombia, in the highest vote in history, expressed itself clearly and delivered to me an emphatic mandate."
"A mandate to search for peace in our country."
"It is not my custom to block out the sun with my hands nor to cover my eyes with bandages. The international community is discerning and is watching us attentively."
"We, who are also discerning, also see what is happening in the countries of the world and we know that it is necessary to act now, that there is no time to lose. We know that this is the time for cooperation, not for confrontation nor for intervention."
"Many of our neighbours in Latin America, over the course of time, have found solutions to their conflicts."
"In these processes the European Union has always been present to a significant degree, as a mediator and as a bridge between the various political and social sectors."
"In the negotiation processes in Guatemala and El Salvador, the role of the European Union was fundamental."
"The traditional concern of Europe for peace and human rights, and its marked tradition with regard to negotiation processes provide my country with absolutely essential support: this support is vital."
"And it is also vital that Europe understands the background to the Colombian conflict."
"We cannot allow the discussion of Colombia to be based on words but no action, on the idealisation of conflicts belonging to past decades and even less on press reports which are more concerned with the spectacular nature of the news rather than the reality behind it."
"I can tell this from your questions concerning our conflict and the peace process: ""Why are there still guerrillas in Colombia when they have disappeared from the rest of the continent?"""
"""Is there a civil war in Colombia?"""
"""What does the ""zone of peace mean?"""
"""Who violates human rights in Colombia and what is the commitment of the government to human rights?"""
"""Is the Colombian Plan a military plan?"""
"I have come here today to explain our real situation to you, without denying the brutality of the violence we suffer."
"Nobody could be unaware of the reality of my country."
"Violence has plagued our country for years."
"Many Colombians have died for their cause and many, through kidnap, have lost their liberty."
"The Colombian conflict, under its own steam, has undergone serious changes and, without doubt, the force with which drug-trafficking exploded in Colombia in the Eighties has been the element which has led to the greatest increase in violence."
"This has not only permeated the guerrilla movement, whose finance increasingly comes from charges imposed on coca leaf, but it has also extended the circle of violence to other armed groups and organised criminal groups."
"Faced with this escalation of violence, the Colombian population has said NO MORE."
"Mass demonstrations have taken to the streets, reminding us of the response of the Spanish people to terrorism, to demand NO MORE VIOLENCE."
"Today the people of my country, like never before in their history, are united in the demand for a cessation of the violation of human rights, especially kidnap which should cease to be used as a source of finance by the guerrilla movement and other violent groups."
"In Colombia, there is no civil war."
"Less than 4% of Colombians support the guerrillas."
"During the last two decades, the conflict has changed substantially."
"While the military capability of the violent groups is increasing, largely thanks to drug money, the civil population is asking to be freed from the conflict, since they have realised that it is they who suffer as a result and it is their fundamental rights which are violated day after day."
"Ladies and gentlemen, ours is a unique type of conflict which requires a unique type of solution, and my government is determined and committed to finding this solution."
"The guerrilla conflict has concerned our people for 40 years."
"During this time, several insurgent groups have participated in the conflict."
"But there are also several who have now understood that the best alternative for our country is to abandon violence through a process of political dialogue."
"Six armed groups comprising around 8,000 rebels, have, during the last ten years, laid down their arms in favour of the power of argument."
"Today we are treading the path of negotiating the armed conflict with the FARC, the oldest of the guerrilla groups."
"In little more than a year, through dialogue, we have already agreed an agenda for negotiation which consists of twelve points and last Sunday, in a historic moment for our country, we embarked upon a negotiation process which must lead our country along the path to the construction of a lasting and genuine peace."
"There has also been a lot of speculation about the so-called ""zone of peace"" ."
"The truth is that this is an instrument created by Colombian Law to generate security conditions to assist the dialogue."
"This zone covers only 3% of the national territory and a quarter of 1% of the Colombian population lives there."
"We have not given up our national integrity there and the State is represented by democratically elected Mayors and Councillors."
"We are also moving forward in the search for a solution with the National Liberation Army, the ELN."
"Last week preliminary contacts were started, aimed at reactivating the discussions and I am optimistic that we will soon see significant advances which will allow us to initiate negotiations with this rebel group as well."
"The whole of Colombia and the international community believes in the progress that is possible through a political solution."
"I know that it will not be an easy path to follow and we will certainly continue to encounter difficulties, but we will always remain steadfast in the effort to overcome them."
"Peace processes take time and require patience, a lot of patience."
"Let us remember the cases of El Salvador or Guatemala."
"Let us observe the peace processes in the Middle East and Ireland."
"Neither of them happened overnight, but a negotiated political solution will be seen to have obvious benefits."
"I would like to repeat that I will do everything possible to achieve this peace which is essential to all of us."
"But, as I said a few days ago before the United Nations General Assembly, I do not want peace at any price, but rather a peace which genuinely strengthens democracy, which preserves the territory and allows all of the citizens to enjoy full rights and liberties."
"I believe that a decent and democratic future is not possible without a culture of respect for fundamental rights."
"I know that in the course of the protracted internal conflict in Colombia these rights have suffered serious violations, and this must not continue."
"I am totally committed to the defence of human rights."
"My convictions, my background and the mandate of my people testify to this."
"To this end, I have implemented a broad State policy to combat, within the framework of the law, those armed groups which operate outside that law, to guarantee security, protection, support and freedom of action for the defenders of human rights; to assist people who have been displaced by violence; to adopt legal instruments which protect human rights and strengthen our judicial apparatus."
"To sum up, a group of specific measures aimed at guaranteeing compliance with international humanitarian law."
"The results of the application of this policy are reflected in the notable decrease in the complaints of human rights violations emanating from the public, as recognised in the reports from the intergovernmental bodies and NGOs which operate in this field."
"We have worked hard to bring our legislation up to date."
"Congress is currently debating a law to define and punish enforced abduction, genocide and massacres."
"Furthermore, my government supported the approval of a new Military Penal Code which includes significant advances with regard to the competence of the civil courts to judge the military with regard to crimes such as genocide, enforced abduction and torture and we have signed up to the Statute of the International Criminal Court."
"In addition, a Presidential Decree has been issued to promote respect for non-governmental organisations which operate in the field of human rights."
"I also hope that those organisations can carry out their noble activities for strictly humanitarian purposes, without any political interference."
"Ladies and gentlemen, my government is taking decisive action with regard to the protection of human rights, and in this task we need the support of the international community."
"If the guerrillas or the autodefensas (vigilantes) violate human rights, this fact must be reported and they must be punished."
"If any agent of the State does the same, this is also a crime and must not go unpunished."
"That is to say, any human rights violation must be rejected and the perpetrators punished in accordance with the law."
"Over the ""State motive"" or the justifications bandied about by the perpetrators of violence, the ""human motive"" must always prevail."
"It is also important for Colombia that both Europe and the United States understand the correlation between drug trafficking and violence in Colombia."
"There is no nation in the world which has offered up as many martyrs as Colombia in the fight against drug trafficking."
"This disastrous trade has been and continues to be the principal cause of the worst tragedies of our recent history."
"The economic power of these organisations led to corruption in many areas of our lives."
"Drug trafficking has been the great creator of violence and has led to assassinations of the highest possible human cost to our country."
"Currently, it contributes to the maintenance of the wave of violence which we are suffering by financing the various perpetrators of violence."
"I have said, and I would like to repeat to you today, that drug-trafficking is the foremost and the worst enemy of peace, and peace will not be achieved totally without the eradication of the organisations which carry out this accursed drug trade or without finding alternatives and solutions which are economically and socially sustainable."
"My country, like no other, has carried on its shoulders the burden of the fight against drug trafficking."
"Therefore, I would like to take this exceptional opportunity to invite all the countries of the world community to fully implement the principle of what has been called ""shared responsibility"" , in order to combat the global problem of drugs."
"This principle requires us to confront together the serious global problem of drugs, at every link in the chain; that is to say, production, distribution, consumption, money laundering, the diversion of chemical ingredients and arms sales."
"It also requires us to contribute to lasting solutions in accordance with our own individual capacities."
"We have significant agreements with the European Union which recognise the shared responsibility in this area."
"We have made advances in the promotion of cooperation mechanisms between Europe and the Andean countries, as in the case of the tariff concessions of the Andean GSP, the expansion of which is vital to my country."
"Whilst on this subject, I must also express my satisfaction with the recent conclusion of the Presidency of the European Council at Tampere with regard to the laundering of capital, which mentions the Council decision to ""ensure that specific steps are taken to trace, freeze, seize and confiscate the proceeds of crime"" ."
"We must confiscate the money and property of the drug-traffickers, and their associates, which results from this murderous trade and deny them any possibility of buying chemical ingredients and arms and we must pursue the underworld which launders the money which they obtain."
"Together we must continue to make advances towards complete solutions which cover all the links in the chain."
"And together we will have to give priority to those education and prevention programmes which will bring about a reduction in demand."
"In this struggle, ladies and gentlemen, we need you as partners and allies."
"My country is not asking for much: simply that each member of the world community plays its part in the task, in accordance with the principle of shared responsibility, and that we can all meet the costs of lasting solutions within the bounds of the available possibilities and resources."
"It should also be of great concern to all of us that drug trafficking is causing more and more ecological damage."
"In our country, which is one of the eight richest nations in terms of biodiversity, the illegal cultivation of coca and poppies have destroyed more than a million hectares of jungle, rain forests and mountain areas."
"The pillage of nature is so out of hand that five hectares of forest are destroyed in order to cultivate one hectare of coca or poppy and every year 200,000 gallons of herbicide, 16,000 tonnes of chemical fertiliser and 100,000 gallons of poisons used on these crops contaminate Colombian waters and soil."
"I want to repeat today that there is no doubt that the activities associated with illegal cultivation are spoiling the earth' s natural heritage."
"It is therefore the duty of all of our countries to stop this destruction in order to defend at all costs the human right of future generations to a habitable planet."
"We share Europe' s concerns about global warming, deforestation and the essential conservation of tropical forests."
"We also understand that we must tackle the problem of polluting emissions."
"For this reason we want to propose to Europe an Environmental Alliance between the countries of Europe and Colombia so that we may move forward together in this noble purpose."
"Faced with Colombia' s real situation it is clear that in order to advance in the arduous task of building peace it is necessary to go beyond dialogue and negotiations with rebels."
"It is necessary to find fundamental solutions to our problems."
"We need to construct a new nation where respect for human rights, the application of justice and the reconstruction of our social fabric are the solid foundations which will allow us to build a society in which the factors which create violence are eradicated for good."
"It is for this reason that I am here before those of you who share these ideals, to propose that you deepen your commitments with us and that we strengthen this alliance which is useful to all of us."
"Appropriate cooperation is one of the most effective ways of protecting human rights; cooperation means preventing the preventable; cooperation means opening up the roads to hope."
"To this end I have drawn up the Colombia Plan for peace, prosperity and the strengthening of the State."
"It is not a military plan."
"It is a comprehensive and unified plan aimed at strengthening such basic issues for our country as the search for peace, the reactivation of our economy and the generation of employment, the protection of human rights, the strengthening of justice and the increase in social participation."
"The final result will be the strengthening of our State, as the essential requirement for the achievement of peace and progress."
"We need your participation on all these fronts but principally we need you, your nations and the whole of Europe to invest in peace for the sake of peace, and to open up your markets so that we can create employment for the sake of peace."
"For this reason, Colombia is presenting the international community with an alternative policy for the eradication of illegal crops based on an alternative development which offers the rural population, which is currently involved in illegal cultivation, a permanent escape from their economic and social problems, replacing illegal crops with commercial, mining, agricultural, agro-industrial and service companies, and with the necessary infrastructure so that they may compete adequately in the world' s globalised economy."
"Colombia hopes to finance, jointly with those countries which are in some way involved in the drug chain, the infrastructure of the project and also hopes to involve private capital, both national and foreign, in the economically productive companies so that they may incorporate advances in technology and new capital."
"Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament: I wish you, on behalf of the Colombian people, the greatest success in the enlargement and deepening of European democracy."
"You represent people who have opted for life, peace and the defence of human rights, you constitute the means of expression of those who believe in democracy, freedom and a healthy environment for future generations."
"You are largely responsible for leading the rapprochement with those countries which are building hope for themselves and which are eager for the third millennium to bring genuine successes."
"I am here before the representatives of European democracy, to tell you unequivocally that I have opted for peace, I have offered the guerrilla movement peace with dignity and security."
"In order to live in peace we need a national agreement supported by the international community."
"As a democrat and before democrats I ask you here today: support peace in Colombia."
"To do this would be to invest in humanity and in a vision of a future which brings about development, well-being and social justice."
"Thank you very much."
"(Sustained Applause)"
"Mr President, thank you for the statement you have just made which will remain imprinted in our minds as Europeans, and in our minds as female and male politicians."
"You have presented the difficult situation of your country with great candour and great clarity."
"You emphasised, I noted, the disasters of all sorts caused by drugs trafficking and you appealed to what I shall call our joint responsibility in eradicating this scourge."
"We have clearly heard your message."
"As you know, a few days ago in Tampere, an extraordinary Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union met and decided upon a number of extremely strong measures in this area."
"And then you explained how you intended to progress along the road to peace."
"You very powerfully expressed your wish to lay down, and I quote, ""arms in favour of the power of argument"" ."
"I must say that I greatly admired what you had to say on this subject and I also appreciated the wish you expressed to establish a form of peace which strengthens democracy."
"In this connection, you mentioned a number of very courageous measures which, as you may have observed from the applause of my fellow Members, were greatly appreciated."
"We have heard, Mr President, your wish, your appeal, I would say, for close cooperation between us and your appeal for our assistance in your very courageous undertaking."
"Thank you for choosing the European Parliament as the place to launch this appeal, and may I assure you that this appeal has been heard and understood."
"(Loud applause)"
"(The formal sitting was closed at 1.05 p.m.)"
"Outcome of the European Council of 15/16 October in Tampere"
"The next item is the report of the European Council and the Commission statement on the outcome of the European Council of 15/16 October in Tampere."
"It is my great pleasure to give Mr Lipponen, President-in-Office of the Council, the floor."
"Madam President, Members of the European Parliament, I am very happy to be able to appear before you and speak for the first time in the European Parliament as Finland' s Prime Minister."
"I wish to congratulate you on your election and wish the new Parliament every success in its work."
"When we met recently, the President and I pointed out that we have a new Parliament, a new Commission, a new start and, above all, a new President, meaning that the new institutional arrangement is now, on the whole, a better one."
"I would like to thank the President for the views of Parliament that you presented at the European Council in Tampere, when it began its work."
"I believe that the decisions taken at Tampere correspond well with the expectations that Parliament had of the meeting there."
"The European Council has approved both the policy guidelines and the practical action to help the Union become an area of freedom, security and justice, within the meaning of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The results we achieved at Tampere can, in my opinion, be regarded as successful in many regards in terms of the expectations of the public and the development of the Union."
"Obviously, expectations cannot always be fulfilled in all respects, but it is good to be able to say that the NGOs, such as the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, have praised the results achieved at Tampere."
"Sadako Ogata, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, told me on the telephone, after the meeting, how satisfied the UNHCR is with the outcome of the meeting."
"I assured her that we would continue on a path of good cooperation with the UNHCR in the implementation of the decisions as well."
"The meeting at Tampere was, for many reasons, important for the Union."
"The European Council sped up the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, making it a concrete reality."
"At Tampere, justice and home affairs were raised to the highest political level in cooperation with the Union."
"The meeting took an important step forward towards closer cooperation among the Member States, and it was decided to break down the barriers to cooperation between the police and judicial authorities."
"The Member States of the Union showed determination in bringing the work of the Union closer to the people by tackling commonly shared concerns and deficiencies in Union cooperation."
"At Tampere, the Union strengthened the basis for cooperation in justice and home affairs, of which a respect for the principles of human rights agreements, civil freedoms and rule of law are an essential part."
"The European Council called its results the ten milestones, and I will briefly consider them here."
"At Tampere a step was taken in the direction of a common Union policy on immigration and asylum."
"The European Council emphasised the consideration that asylum and immigration issues are separate, but are still close to one another."
"The first milestone for Tampere is the creation of a comprehensive policy for the union on questions of immigration and asylum."
"What is most important is to have an influence on the reasons behind emigration through contact with the countries concerned."
"The European Council meeting welcomed the work the high level taskforce has done to draft action plans for influencing reasons for emigration."
"This work requires a wide-ranging assortment of Union foreign policy and policy on development cooperation, human rights and trade, and the prevention of conflicts."
"The taskforce' s mandate was extended to the drafting of new action plans."
"We decided to strive towards a common European policy on the asylum system."
"This decision is, I believe, one of the most important of the breakthroughs at Tampere."
"The European Council adopted a very strong position in support of the right to asylum by committing to a full and comprehensive interpretation of the Geneva Convention regarding the European asylum policy."
"The principle of non-refoulement, according to which no one may be sent back into a situation where they might suffer persecution, was again reinforced separately."
"Building a common system will obviously take time."
"The Commission is being asked, however, to draft within one year an announcement on the creation of a common asylum procedure and on a common status for those granted asylum throughout the Union."
"With the implementation of the decisions taken at Tampere we can decisively improve the way the asylum system works, as well as standards of fairness, in Europe."
"An important achievement at Tampere was setting an objective whereby those who have migrated into the Union legally must have rights and obligations comparable with those of Union citizens."
"The legal position in particular of those who have resided in the Union for a longer period of time must be improved, for example, by guaranteeing the right to stay, the right to education and work, and the right to practice a profession."
"The Union must also defend its most important values against intolerance and discrimination."
"This must be something that is today regarded as being very important in the European Parliament as well."
"The European Council emphasises the importance of more effective action to combat racism and xenophobia, and urges Member States to draft national programmes for this purpose."
"Important decisions were taken concerning the control of mass immigration."
"It was decided to take measures to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings."
"There will be tougher penalties for those engaged in human trafficking and other forms of financial exploitation of immigrants, and the Member States will work in closer cooperation with Europol to counter the work of crime networks."
"I would like to stress here that, at the same time, we must safeguard the rights of the victims of crime and, in particular, the position of women and children."
"Border control cooperation, both among the Member States and in cooperation with the applicant countries, will improve through, inter alia, exchange programmes and the transfer of technology."
"In this connection, the importance of the Schengen Convention and the professional control of the external borders are being emphasised in an expanding Union."
"It was also agreed at Tampere to embark on practical action that would allow us to build a European area of justice."
"We decided to create an on-going information system that would be up-to-date and easy to use, enabling the public to obtain information about other Member States' legal systems."
"The Union is to adopt, on the basis of the Commission' s proposal, minimum standards, thereby ensuring there is proper legal aid available in cross-border situations."
"We similarly decided to simplify and speed up legal proceedings relating to consumer, commercial and maintenance demands of slight monetary value."
"The position of the victims of crime will improve with the adoption of minimum standards for the protection of the victims of crime, especially with regard to legal protection and the right to receive damages."
"After a thorough debate on the issue, the Council of Europe approved the mutual recognition of sentences and judicial decisions as a keystone in the development of an area of justice."
"I consider it an excellent achievement that the principle of mutual recognition was endorsed as a basis for both private law and criminal cases."
"An important milestone at Tampere was reached when it was decided to continue with the convergence of civil law and civil process law, for better cooperation and legal protection."
"At Tampere, joint action to make the prevention of crime more effective within the Union was thoroughly discussed."
"The European Council was unanimous in its verdict that persons and organisations that abuse freedoms and violate citizens' rights within the territory of the Union have to be brought under better control and be held responsible for their deeds, through closer cooperation between the authorities."
"It was agreed that the key to fighting crime was better prevention of crime."
"The Member States will draft national crime prevention programmes and establish their mutual cooperation and a comparison of best practice."
"The European Council called for a study into the possibility of financing a programme from Community funds, the primary focus of which would be youth, urban and drugs-related crime, which have been found to be the fastest growing areas of crime in many countries."
"The decisions taken at Tampere will enhance cooperation in Europe between the police and the judicial authorities."
"The European Council decided that joint investigative groups should be set up to counter, initially, trafficking in drugs and humans, as well as terrorism."
"A top-level European taskforce would exchange experiences and aid the planning of operations together with Europol."
"Europol should also be given powers to request Member States to commence, perform and coordinate investigations."
"Action to combat organised crime will also be reinforced with the establishment of a new body - Eurojust."
"Member States, depending on their legal systems, will send state prosecutors, examining magistrates and police officers with similar powers to join this unit."
"In this way we can see to it that Europol' s criminal investigations lead to criminals being convicted and sentenced more effectively."
"A European police academy will be established to train higher-ranking legal officials. This will also be open to officials from states applying for membership."
"The European Council also decided to embark on a programme of legislative convergence in certain areas of national criminal law."
"The purpose is to agree common definitions of crimes, and agree on prosecution and legal consequences."
"This work will initially focus on certain forms of serious cross-border crime such as fraud, trafficking in drugs and human beings - especially the exploitation of women - the sexual abuse of children, high technology crime and environmental crime."
"Finally, the last milestone I have to mention, which I regard as being very important among the decisions taken at Tampere is special action to combat money laundering."
"The importance of this action is underlined by the fact that money laundering has a major role to play in organised crime, and it is closely connected with areas such as trafficking in drugs and human beings, and the illegal trade in weapons."
"I especially want to raise the point that the legal authorities and centres of investigation into money-laundering will be given the right to acquire information, regardless of bank regulations or business secrecy rules, when the information is necessary to conduct an investigation into money laundering."
"Europol' s powers will be extended to money laundering in general, regardless of what type of crime the laundered funds derive from."
"Member States will try to reach a coherent and comprehensive definition of the scope of criminal activity that would constitute a so-called originating crime with regard to money laundering."
"The targets set for cooperation in justice and home affairs can be realised only through comprehensive action."
"That is why the European Council has approved the political guidelines regarding how the Union' s external action must be strengthened in order to achieve the targets for justice and home affairs."
"The results achieved in cooperation with the Baltic Countries are an example of practical regional action to combat organised crime."
"Special attention was paid at Tampere to closer cooperation with the Balkans region."
"Implementing the decisions taken at Tampere will begin immediately, but it will obviously take time."
"Monitoring will be carried out using a method that proved beneficial in the creation of the single market."
"The Commission is drafting a proposal for a scoreboard to monitor the implementation of decisions and adherence to timetables."
"A thorough survey of achievements will be undertaken in the European Council during the Belgian Presidency in December 2001."
"Madam President, if you will allow me I will briefly present the most important aims we still wish to achieve during the Finnish Presidency."
"The most important decision taken at the European Council at Helsinki will affect the future of the whole of Europe."
"At Tampere, I became increasingly convinced that Member States have a very converging opinion of how Union enlargement should be taken forward."
"The political impetus behind the process that has begun must not be lost."
"Finland, as the country holding the presidency, wishes to ensure that all applicant countries are encouraged and supported equally in their efforts to meet the criteria for membership."
"Each applicant country must progress on the basis of their individual conditions."
"We wish to ensure that the better-prepared states can move forward in negotiations faster than the others."
"We would like to point out to the applicant countries that the membership criteria set at Copenhagen must be met before membership is possible."
"I am convinced that, on the basis of the proposals announced by the Commission on 13 October, it will be possible to take decisions at Helsinki that will be based on a comprehensive, credible and consistent policy."
"This is vital to ensure that the enlargement process has a positive impact on European stability."
"But the Union must also reform."
"I discussed this with the President this morning."
"The process by which we try to strengthen Europe cannot be allowed to weaken decision-making in the institutions of the Union and, hence, the Union' s capacity for action."
"I will be presenting a report to the European Council in Helsinki on necessary institutional reforms, which are due to be approved in an Intergovernmental Conference to be held in 2000."
"The Finnish Presidency will comply with the European Council mandate, which means preparing a brief agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Over the next few years, however, we require a broader debate within the Union on what sort of European Union we actually need, in order to be able to respond better to the challenges that lie ahead."
"I do not wish, in this connection, to estimate when the Member States will be ready to take steps in a more ambitious direction and amend the Treaties for the further development of the Union."
"Hurrying the matter is not necessarily of any benefit, but the need for more thorough reform is growing, both with enlargement and the changes in the world outside the Union."
"The development of a common security and defence policy and the Union' s readiness to respond to crises is one of our most important objectives."
"The Union has the potential to develop into a strong global player, as it has at its disposal a vast range of political and financial instruments and resources."
"A common foreign and security policy is presently being reinforced through common strategies."
"In order to become a credible player in maintaining peace and stability, the Union also needs a civil and military capacity for crisis management."
"The report that we will present at the European Council in Helsinki discusses an approach to integrate both civil and military means to solve conflict situations."
"We would like to achieve real progress in the development of security and defence policy and take prompt and decisive steps forward."
"Finally, I have to say that we, as the country to hold the presidency, wish to improve effectiveness and transparency in the work of the Union."
"This is a key question when securing the confidence of the people in the work of the Union."
"During our presidential term we have started to reform the work of the Council."
"We have improved transparency in its work and access to documents, and we are announcing meeting schedules for the Council and working parties, and agendas for meetings of the Council."
"A debate on other proposals for reforms to increase transparency is presently under way."
"The Commission may still issue during the Finnish presidential term a proposal as required under Article 255 for rules on transparency."
"I hope that we can, in this way too, leave a permanent imprint of our presidency on the work of the Union."
"Madam President, I await with interest the opportunity to enter into discussions with the Members of Parliament."
"First of all I should like to say that the Commission shares the presidency' s positive point of view on the outcome of the European Tampere Council."
"We would like to warmly congratulate the Finnish Prime Minister, both for the preparations which preceded the meeting and for the way in which he personally chaired its proceedings."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the conclusions reached in Tampere combine a strong political message on the priority given to the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice with the concern to define priorities which concentrate on those issues which directly affect the daily lives of Europe' s citizens."
"The Heads of State and Government have thus set themselves the obligation to respect the solemn commitment they made in Tampere."
"The Commission, on the basis of dialogue and cooperation with the European Parliament, is prepared to do everything necessary in order to create an area of freedom, security and justice which, above all, achieves balance between its three components: freedom, security and justice."
"The Commission is particularly pleased with this fact. And I would like to emphasise that the steadfast affirmation of the untouchable nature of the Geneva Convention as a basis for constructing a European asylum policy is something that merits our backing and applause."
"We are pleased with the commitment given at the highest level to working in partnership with countries of origin and transit countries in confronting immigration issues. We are pleased with the far greater emphasis given to fighting the trade in human beings than to action against its victims in relation to illegal immigration."
"The Commission backs the clear affirmation of the importance of prevention in the fight against crime, whether it is financial crime, crime in the cities or juvenile crime, and notes that its efforts to give special prominence to the rights of victims of criminal activity have been recognised."
"The Commission agrees with the proactive view of the establishment of a European concept of access to justice as an instrument for people to exercise their right to free movement without obstacles of a legal or administrative nature. It is also necessary that this right to free circulation should now be accompanied by the legislative measures which are necessary for us to be able to achieve it as quickly as possible."
"The Commission is pleased with the establishment of the principle of harmonising, as fully as possible, the rights of citizens originally from third countries, but who have lived for a long time in the Union, with the rights and duties granted to citizens who are nationals of the Union' s Member States. We realise that we will have to move forward with specific proposals in this area."
"Finally, the Commission would like to single out the establishment of the clear priority given to fighting racism, xenophobia, and all forms of discrimination, which are laid down in Article 13 of the Treaty, as being a very positive move."
"Similarly, the Tampere conclusions tackle, in an appropriate way, the strengthening of cooperation between police forces and between judicial authorities in order to protect and preserve the freedoms of Europe' s citizens."
"The conclusions do this in a way which is necessary in order to respond to citizens' legitimate concerns about security and about the judicial guarantee of their rights, as is fitting in a Union which claims to be founded on the principle of the prevalence of rights and of the law."
"I would like to highlight, in this regard, the principle of mutual recognition of decisions and sentences, which all Member States should contribute to by adopting common definitions and penalties against certain criminal activities which transcend borders,."
"This would cover areas such as organised crime, illegal drug trafficking, the trade in human beings, or crimes against children."
"I would also like to highlight the establishment of the EUROJUST network which is, without any doubt, the beginning of the construction of a European Judicial system which will be an instrument of support and monitoring for EUROPOL' s actions in guaranteeing security within the Union and which will also be an instrument for protecting the rights of European citizens."
"The Commission is looking at its own role and proposes to act by responding to the ambitious action plan for fighting money-laundering, which involves changes both in the Union' s position towards the rest of the world, and also at the level of legislation in each Member State."
"Without wishing to criticise the positive results which, to a large extent, have just been highlighted by the President-in-Office of the Council, I cannot help admitting that on some points, the Commission is rather disappointed. The Commission regrets that the European Council has not accepted the idea of a single asylum system which represents, as we see it, something to aim for, but also the urgent necessity of dealing with asylum issues in a collective and coherent way."
"Similarly, I regret the fact that some Member States were reluctant to support the idea of a European refugee fund, even though the Commission made it clear that this fund would not involve any new or additional expenditure. The lessons drawn from Bosnia and Kosovo reinforce our conviction that it is crucial to persist in explaining our aims, which we hope will happen before the end of the current year, specifically in the context of preparing the 2000 budget."
"Tampere did not allow the idea of a European Public Prosecutor to be adopted yet, even one who would be limited to protecting the Community' s financial interests."
"I would like to suggest that the next debate on the Intergovernmental Conference might be a good opportunity to take up this idea of ours once again."
"The Commission believes, however, that Tampere sent out the right message to many different audiences: to our citizens, first of all, that a subject high on their personal agenda is also rising quickly to the top of the Union' s political agenda; to national administrations that there is no turning back and that their own heads of government are committed to making the improvements, including the institutional improvements of the Amsterdam Treaty, work properly; to the criminal world, that the Union is mobilising all its potential to counter their activities which threaten our freedom and our well-being, if not our own democratic regimes; finally, to the outside world, that an internally secure Union does not mean a fortress Union and that our commitments to those in need of protection are sacred."
"There is an enormous task ahead, not least for the Commission, to whom the European Council entrusted numerous tasks, thus showing a gratifying confidence in us. With the help and cooperation of Parliament and the necessary resources to do the job I am confident that we will be able to play the part that has been allocated to us by Tampere."
"We certainly plan to begin by working on how to create the scoreboard requested of us as a way of keeping up the pressure on ourselves, in the first instance, but also on others, as well as ensuring that everything takes place with the fullest possible transparency in the very near future."
"If either you, in Parliament, or we, in the Commission, see any signs of back-sliding we will not hesitate to remind heads of state and government of their message from Tampere."
"When I say ""their message from Tampere"" , it is not only the message in the letter of Tampere but also what we could call the spirit of Tampere."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Prime Minister Lipponen, I agree with the view that the European Council meeting at Tampere may be considered a historic occasion for the reason that, for the first time, the Council discussed the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice in the discussion, and put it at the top of the agenda."
"The issues discussed have great importance in the everyday lives of ordinary people and for companies as well."
"The Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats finds that progress has been made in part, although we are also disappointed with how short the steps are that have been taken."
"The major decision in the creation of the European area of justice was to make the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and sentences the foundation stone for legal cooperation within the Union, both in matters of civil and criminal law."
"A precondition for the continued support, by the people, of the principle of free movement, is that there needs to be better opportunities to obtain justice within the whole area of the Union."
"Improvement in police cooperation in practice and growing support for Europol will boost the investigation and prevention of crime."
"In this connection our group would like to say that legal cooperation must, however, lead the way for cooperation, and it is with satisfaction that it welcomes the cooperation of prosecuting authorities in the Eurojust scheme."
"We are nevertheless disappointed that the decisions of Tampere do not mention a European public prosecutor, whose field ought to have covered the fraudulent dealings behind the Community budget."
"Our group agrees with the view of the Council that the Union and its Member States strengthen transparency of the Union through personal, cultural, political and economic relations with the rest of the world."
"This also relates to the fact that the right to seek asylum should be fully respected."
"We hope that the Council, with its decisions to ultimately create a common asylum-seeking process and a common status for those who have received asylum throughout the Union, has opened up the way for Europe to become a united area in matters of asylum and refugees."
"The meeting in Tampere did not take us quite that far; the resolutions merely refer to a common area."
"Our group will use its opportunities to influence the Community budget for the creation of a basis for a European refugee fund. This is a matter that was only mentioned in the Council' s decisions, in which the Commission was urged to explore the possibility of considering some sort of reserve fund for situations where large groups of refugees are applying for temporary protection."
"The Council' s decisions contain no mention of how the financial burden caused by refugees and asylum seekers should be shared within the Union."
"Although the States of the Union now want to decide themselves ultimately who can settle in their territory, the longer-term aim must be a coherent policy and consequential share of costs."
"Our group welcomes with satisfaction the composition of the institutional assembly that will work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, believing that the strong parliamentarian dimension contained within it reflects the democratic implementation of EU development better than a conventional Intergovernmental Conference."
"We shall participate fully in the work of this institution."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the European Council, although I have made a few critical remarks, we consider the results of the Tampere meeting to be important, and our criticisms are targeted at the fact that the Council should aspire, in future, to yet more ambitious Community objectives."
"The decisions are, however, just words on paper."
"Now, we believe, it is important that the Council and the Commission attend to the implementation of the resolutions quickly."
"When the resolutions are passed back down from on high to the plain greyness of the Councils of the Ministers of the Interior and Justice, they also become run-of-the mill and nothing more happens for three or four years, Tampere will remain in history as the forum of unrealised declarations."
"This is what will happen, although the Council has borrowed a good idea from the world of business, the scoreboard, the actual term being a perfectly balanced scorecard."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, keep the momentum up."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, first of all I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency on the success of Tampere with regard to the opening up of a new stage in the development of European citizenship, dealing with the always difficult balance between liberty and security. This demonstrates that we are not only building a Union based on freedom for goods, services and capital, but also one which will respond to the question of the freedom of settlement and movement of European citizens."
"A step forward has been taken with regard to the fourth liberty of the Treaty of Rome: the access to justice beyond national boundaries, thanks to the mutual recognition of sentences, the possibility of fighting organised crime and money-laundering beyond national boundaries."
"Furthermore there is another important dimension, Madam President, and that is that we are now on the eve of a new wave of enlargement, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said, and we are also witnessing a series of election results which are a clear warning for all of us that certain xenophobic and racist attitudes are arising within the populations of some of our countries."
"Therefore, it is very important, at the moment, that we are capable of sending a message of freedom and progress in the face of this type of defensive reaction which demonstrates that not everything has yet been consolidated."
"And this is especially important in relation to two issues."
"The first is asylum."
"I believe that this is one of the basic freedoms which we have to defend, and to this end, a single system of asylum is very important, and I say this from the point of view of somebody who comes from a country in which political asylum saved the lives of many of those who fought for freedom and allowed them to continue to live in other European countries."
"The second is immigration."
"We have to strive, depending on our own particular situations, for legal immigrants to have the same rights, together with a policy of co-development which will prevent the kind of out-of-hand immigration which we have been witnessing for a long time."
"And to this end, we believe that this is the way to tackle the issue afresh and we also support - as the Parliament' s initiative demonstrates - the creation of a refugee fund, which we believe may be a key element."
"To conclude, Madam President, we understand that the Commission has repeated what it did with regard to the internal market, the scoreboard system and the emulation system."
"This is positive."
"We still advocate that there should be a public prosecutor to fight fraud at a Community level."
"Finally, I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for being here today."
"I regret that the presence of the Council in the Committees of this Parliament has not been too frequent, because that would have helped us to debate and get to know each other better so that we could have moved forward together."
"Madam President, this summit was highly significant and its outcome better, less repressive, than expected."
"We will look back in amazement at how much more progress Europe made on cutting red tape on goods and businesses than it did on people."
"This must now change quickly."
"But Parliament is not yet a full partner and that must be our goal over the next few years."
"It is unacceptable that Europe' s directly elected representatives are, despite the presidency conclusions' stress on democracy, marginalised in the creation of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"May I say how much I believe the voice of Parliament is strengthened by the ability of four groups to agree on the resolution put forward today."
"I can only pick out a few points, but firstly: refugees."
"We welcome the reaffirmation of the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention, and credit is due to the Finnish presidency for this point."
"It is very important that the common EU asylum system - which ought, however, to be a single system and incorporate EU funding - should not be based on the lowest common denominator."
"We must also be very careful not to whip up racist prejudice and we look forward to proposals based on Article 13 to combat racism."
"On individual rights, some progress was made but not enough."
"We very much welcome the reiteration of how important it is to legislate to give legally-resident third country nationals rights as near as possible to those of EU citizens."
"This is now urgent."
"We also need tangible progress on the rights of EU citizens to move freely and reside elsewhere."
"It was a pity nothing was said at Tampere about rights to access information and documents despite transparency being cited as one of the important principles."
"In the area of access to justice we need mutual recognition to be accompanied by common minimum standards and it would have been good to see something about the rights of people to get bail when they are criminal defendants in a state other than their own."
"We look forward to the body preparing the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which it would be appropriate for a representative of this Parliament to chair, producing a document which can confer direct rights on EU citizens and enable them as individuals to enforce their rights in the European Court."
"It is appropriate to give governmental authorities greater cross-border powers to pursue criminals but the use of these powers must be supervised by the European Parliament and the European courts so that civil liberties are entrenched and robustly defended."
"Madam President, as one might suppose, given the lack of transparency regarding the preparatory work, the conclusions of the Tampere Council are, as far as our Group is concerned, still disappointing in terms of their ambition and vague in terms of their conclusions, even in spite of a few interesting advances."
"Generally speaking, it is significant that the Council should have announced a specific timetable for the measures to do with the area of security."
"On the other hand, no clear timetable has been drawn up for the actions to do with an area of freedom."
"Our fear of the establishment of Fortress Europe therefore still remains."
"As far as measures regarding the right of asylum and immigration are concerned, they are still totally vague and not at all mandatory."
"The only good news is the commitment to the observance of the Geneva Convention and further confirmation of the fight against racism."
"Our Group is pleased to see the desire that was shown to grant similar rights to nationals of third countries as well as to European citizens."
"It is concerned, however, at the grey areas which remain on this matter."
"It is indeed vital that this equality in rights should be extended to political rights, to freedom of movement and the right to live together as a family."
"Europe has a duty to offer the same guarantees to all individuals resident on European soil."
"Prime Minister Lipponen' s statement regarding the future of the Charter of Fundamental Rights may also be cause for concern."
"Announcing at this stage that this is to be nothing more than a political declaration is tantamount to wiping out in advance the hard work of the working party."
"The compulsory aspect of this charter is essential with a view to the construction of a Citizens' Europe."
"Finally, while the Council announced that the scope of activities and the mandate of Europol, a necessary instrument in the fight against organised crime, were to be increased, what of democratic and judicial supervision, especially regarding the compilation of files?"
"This omission is the potential source of future irregularities as regards our individual and collective freedoms."
"This omission must be dealt with as a matter of urgency by setting up a Committee on Information Technology and European Freedom."
"Madam President, I do not believe I am the only one to be disappointed by the results of the Tampere summit."
"It is true that it could have been worse, much worse, especially for the citizens of third countries who are in Europe or who need to come here, but that does not change the fact that we have missed a good opportunity to actually start constructing an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Summit' s conclusions seem to be a summary of the preparatory documents which had already been in circulation in Parliament for some time, without any more detail being added."
"There was a long list of good intentions with which we cannot disagree, but I am concerned and perplexed by some of the clearer decisions."
"I will give only one example out of the many I could give - the priority given to cooperation in fighting urban youth crime seems a little odd and out of place, given that, to make any real impact, the States would do better to join forces in order to defeat large-scale organised crime, which increasingly operates on an international basis."
"We will only be able to find out more from the legislative proposals that will be put forward."
"In the meantime, we repeat our concern that what we will actually achieve is an area of internal security fitted with an iron lock to stop the outside world getting in."
"Madam President, I believe that the EU leaders' recent meeting in Tampere in Finland was a very successful one."
"It was the first such meeting since the European Parliament ratified the new College of European Commissioners and the new President, Romano Prodi, has stated many times that he is deeply committed to involving Parliament in more decision-making in the future."
"This new interinstitutional approach within the European Union was certainly in evidence at the Tampere Summit."
"EU leaders had extended an invitation to you, Madam President, to attend the meeting: a recognition of the importance of the European Parliament as an institution."
"I fully agree with the statement issued by the EU leaders when they expressed their deep regret at the failure of the American Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty."
"This treaty is a cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts, and without it, the prospects for progress in nuclear disarmament are considerably reduced."
"The Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty is in the interest of all States worldwide, and the European Union is correct to restate its deep commitment to bringing the treaty into force at the earliest opportunity possible."
"I welcome the restated commitment of President Clinton to ratify this treaty as well as his renewed commitment to the maintenance of the US moratorium on nuclear testing."
"Earlier this year the European Council in Cologne decided to establish a chapter for fundamental rights which will bring together in one comprehensive document all the fundamental rights applicable at European Union level in order to make these rights more visible to its citizens."
"The Cologne Council directed the Finnish government, as the office-holder of the Presidency, to establish the conditions for the implementation of this project in time for the Tampere Summit."
"Madam President, I recently said of the Tampere Summit that we ought not to strive for an unattainable utopia but rather we should set to work in a pragmatic manner on what the Tampere agenda had to offer in the way of concrete possibilities."
"Judging by the reports from the Summit and the Presidency' s findings, the Council has, I am pleased to say, followed this modus operandi."
"There has been criticism to the effect that the outcome has been indeterminate as far as asylum and immigration policy is concerned and some of my colleagues in the European Parliament would probably like Community legislation to be in place already."
"I believe that it is the very caution with which cooperation is being brought about that will have a major bearing on asylum and immigration policy receiving a broad spectrum of support."
"The outcome of the Tampere Summit is pervaded with a positive attitude that is clearly expressive of the desire for practical cooperation."
"Even Parliament seems to have been affected by the positive tone set by the Summit and has maintained this in its resolution."
"The fact that Parliament' s resolution contains any criticism at all can be put down to those who nurture the pipe dream of a federal Europe."
"I do not share this dream."
"What I do want is for the European Union to be one in which the Member States endeavour to draw closer together in those areas that have a European dimension."
"The Council took a positive step in this direction at Tampere."
"Madam President, once again we have received a Council document which fails to combine the announcement of great and noble principles with their implementation."
"In Tampere, not only did the reticence and insignificance of the decisions mean that Europe is not being constructed, but the creation of the Europe that we - and I think the citizens of Europe as well - do not want was announced."
"The much trumpeted area of freedom, security and justice is nothing more than the confirmation of a bureaucratic, repressive view of politics where much is said about security but little about freedom and justice, as demonstrated by the intensive series of Intergovernmental Conferences, Dublin, EUROPOL, EURODAC, EUROJUST and reciprocal assistance on legal matters, none of which are under the democratic control of Parliament, the Commission and the Court of Justice."
"Once again, you have chosen to let bureaucracy determine policies, and not the other way round, as is the case in the major democracies."
"Since you have created the European bureaucracy of the right to asylum with the Dublin Convention and with EURODAC, perhaps one day you will finally decide on a European asylum and immigration policy."
"How can we combat organised crime using the instruments you are proposing?"
"Firstly, the way EUROPOL was established, and its nature as a body which is not covered by democratic and legal control, means that thanks to you it continues to gain new competences, and so EUROPOL has the characteristics of the phenomenon it is intended to combat."
"As for the actions concerning the fight against drugs for the period 2000-2004, the Council is now urging us to rush through the adoption of this document while, as the Commission itself admits, no systematic and rigorous assessment of the presumed results of the previous plan have been carried out."
"Not only is the Commission anxious to state that the objective is far from being achieved, but it is also saying that drug trafficking and abuse is on the up, which means that a large part of the money spent up till now has turned out to be an investment not in the fight against drugs but in the spread of drug abuse."
"And what about freedom?"
"The Council is proposing the implementation of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam in the most minimalist way possible, by proposing that we give a non-institutional body the responsibility for drawing up a Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Council, this is not the Europe we want - an intergovernmental, ademocratic, illiberal Europe which it is the duty of your institution to represent!"
"We, along with Ernesto Rossi and Altiero Spinelli, want the federal United States of Europe of rights, freedom and democracy!"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I should like, on behalf of my Group, to ask and answer three questions."
"The first question is this: was the Tampere Summit an important summit?"
"I should like to say yes to this question on three counts."
"Firstly, because the subject of internal security was brought to heads-of-government level and wrested from the nation-state mentalities of the Ministers for justice and the interior."
"In this connection, I should like to thank former President Jacques Santer and José Maria Aznar, who were at the Pörtschach Summit, and who provided the impetus there for the summit on security in Tampere."
"Secondly, this summit was important because it gave a signal to the citizens of Europe."
"The summit said in effect: we are here for the sake of your security."
"Where the Member States have come to the end of what it is open to them to do, the European Union steps in: in asylum policy, in migration policy, in the fight against organised crime and in cooperation concerning justice."
"Thirdly, this summit was important because, although we may so far have managed to translate economic and monetary union into reality, the special summit took the first step in the direction of a union for security and in the direction of an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe."
"The second question is this: was this summit a success?"
"We still cannot at present answer this question with certainty."
"In 2001, when the initial results will be there to see, we shall be able to say whether it has been a success by then, and we shall be able to say in five years' time whether Tampere was a success."
"What we can state, however, is that there have been many small successes and instances of progress."
"The first and important one is this: it has clearly established goals, responsibilities and deadlines for the first time."
"In other words, we have been placed in a position to monitor how progress actually occurs."
"The second important feature - and the reason why Tampere was a success - is this: it provided for the first time clear distinctions in asylum policy, labour migration policy and the policy for dealing with temporary refugees, which is to say people driven from their homes by war."
"It also provided the first concrete measures for taking action in these particular areas."
"In asylum policy, it is important to issue a clear declaration of belief in the Geneva Convention and to declare our support for rapid, joint procedures, but also to set about tackling abuse."
"In the case of migration policy, it was important to make a clear statement that there exists a commitment to combating abuse and a stated belief in hands-on management and in a country' s capacity to receive and integrate refugees as a basis for management of this kind."
"The first initiatives have been taken to establish sensible measures with a view to receiving temporary refugees."
"A further point concerned the taking of concrete measures in connection with combating organised crime. These included more operational powers for Europol, a European police college or more stringent measures to combat money laundering, and cooperation with the candidate countries, for these are very often the countries where organised crime originates."
"A further point is the cooperation introduced here concerning the matter of justice, for it is only if there is cooperation in this area that organised crime can also be successfully combated."
"This means that the constituent elements of particular criminal offences are to be defined, that substantive criminal law is to be harmonised, that there is to be mutual recognition of court judgements, that EUROJUST is to be set up and that there is to be protection for the victims of crime: all in all, a full range of measures signifying that the summit was a success."
"Let me nonetheless briefly pose the question: what critical comments might be made?"
"Announcing the results of Tampere as the Council has done here is to fundamentally misinterpret the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Cooperation with Parliament also means cooperation in the relevant committee."
"We missed seeing the Ministers for justice and the interior here on the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Little that is concrete has emerged on the subject of labour migration. Nor, unfortunately, has any uniform asylum system emerged, and there has been nothing on how the burden is to be shared."
"Overall, however, I must say that, in spite of all the critical comments which can be made, Tampere is, for the time being, a success."
"It was a first step in the direction of a union for security and it now lets us together set to work in the interests of security and of the citizens of Europe."
"Madam President, there is every reason to congratulate the President-in-Office of the European Council on the very well organised Tampere Summit, which proved even more fruitful than anticipated."
"The country to hold the presidency played an important part in reaching these results."
"An extra challenge to the extraordinary summit conference at Tampere was that justice and home affairs are only now being debated on the EU general agenda."
"The steps taken thus far have, owing to the basis of the agreement, been modest."
"The issues are difficult and lead easily to conflict."
"However, we have to devote our considerable energies to matters that affect the security of our citizens, such as crime prevention, at European Union level."
"Criminal investigations and convictions must take place within the context of a real European area of justice."
"Mutual recognition of sentences and judicial decisions is therefore needed, as is work to harmonise criminal law."
"This is especially needed in the area of fraud."
"It was important that, in the fight against crime, prevention was raised as a Union level issue."
"We have to be concerned about our youth, and invest in youth employment and training."
"The European social model must show more solidarity and, with its help, we must be able to prevent exclusion, encourage spontaneous recovery, and support equal opportunities for all groups of citizens, including immigrants."
"The results of the meeting at Tampere also confirmed that we do not want a 'Fortress Europe' , but want to take responsibility."
"The new comprehensive approach that has been established for issues of immigration and asylum, the European Council' s commitment to the full application of the Geneva Convention as it relates to refugees, and the decision to aspire towards a European asylum system, are steps in the right direction."
"We must realise, however, that our work is just beginning and the biggest challenges still lie ahead."
"It is important to take account of issues relating to the applicant countries as well as regional cooperation in this area."
"Face with these challenges we will need seamless interinstitutional cooperation."
"Furthermore, the citizens of the Member States must be included in the process and we must ensure firmer support from the people than is the case at present in decisions taken at EU level."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate the Council and the Commission on the progress made at Tampere in so many areas and I would like to associate myself with the remarks made earlier by my Liberal Democrat colleague Baroness Ludford."
"In the short time I have available I would like to touch on two issues."
"The first is the position of non-nationals, the many millions of our fellow human beings not citizens of the Union but either legally resident here or being offered asylum."
"I welcome some of the progress that was made at Tampere: for instance, on giving them comparable rights and on the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"If we are talking about creating an area of freedom, security and justice, however, we must recognise that these are the people to whom justice is most regularly denied."
"They are still too often associated with criminals."
"Racist urban youths are a social embarrassment but racist policemen are a major social hazard."
"I welcome legal aid and greater information to citizens on legal systems and I recognise that progress can be made on mutual recognition of judicial decisions."
"Nonetheless, we need common high standards of judicial competence and I hope that we will see more work done in this area."
"We need protection of victims and the right to compensation; but we also need a recognition of the rights of defendants if we are to live in a decent society."
"The second point I would like to touch on is the involvement of citizens."
"The President-in-Office made much of the increased efficiency and transparency that Tampere has brought."
"He talked about this being key if the Union is to win the trust of its citizens."
"He talked of ""opening up"" the Council to public scrutiny and looking at other reforms."
"He hoped that the Finnish presidency would leave a lasting impression on the Union in this regard."
"As chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I would like to suggest to the President-in-Office that more recognition be given to the role of this Parliament in dealing with citizens."
"The European Parliament could have been invited at a working level to many more of the debates surrounding the Tampere summit."
"The presidency could have sent a representative to our committee to come and talk about the results of that summit."
"Does the presidency recognise the legitimacy of the European Parliament or is it somehow running scared of our participation?"
"I have a message for the presidency: relax - come and discuss with us."
"I hope we will be able to prove to you through our work in the body that will draw up the Charter of Fundamental Human and Social Rights that the presidency and Parliament can work very well together."
"I hope that, as we proceed in this area where so often Parliament must work directly with the Council, we will see much more effective cooperation between us."
"I hope we will move from the somewhat stilted process of government by summit to more government at working level."
"Madam President, I can only support what Mr Watson has said in his intervention and make it clear that, despite the poor preparation (since Parliament was genuinely excluded and not kept informed at all by the Finnish Presidency), the outcome is nonetheless welcome."
"We in Parliament must also, of course, express our thanks to Commissioner Vitorino, for his contribution was decisive as far as the outcome was concerned."
"I think that the Finnish Presidency should learn from this that, when one is prepared to cooperate, one can also achieve reasonable results."
"We saw this when the Commission got involved and salvaged a good deal of what there was to be salvaged."
"With this in mind - and in view of the fact that my colleague, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery, of my Group has really already said everything that needs to be said - I should just like to add the following comment. We now have a good outcome."
"There are still outstanding questions, and the years 2000 and 2001 will be the decisive years in which a great deal will finally be undertaken."
"I hope the future Presidencies of the Council will support the Commission and Parliament and keep us informed. In that way, we shall, in the end, be able to translate this positive outcome into action."
"Madam President, a lot of fine words have been written following the summit in Tampere, but the prerequisites of these fine words' becoming a reality and of our living up to the humanitarian principles behind them are that people must actually be able to get into Fortress Europe; that we must seriously begin to pursue a political strategy where policy on asylum can be distinguished from policy on immigration; and that we should begin to pursue a serious policy involving cooperation with UNHCR in solving Europe' s and the world' s refugee problems."
"I think it is time now to begin to see if Europe cannot introduce an immigration policy of its own, and I should like to urge the Council to do some thinking along those lines."
"It is also the case, however, that special situations demand special contributions - and a special fund was necessary to cover the special contribution we have been discussing. It will not then be projects already up and running which will have to pay for special situations, in the way that there is now a risk of Africa' s having to pay for the EU' s contribution in Kosovo."
"I should like to close by saying that I cannot support the idea of a scoreboard in the legal sphere."
"I think this is integration by the back door and a move in the direction of a United States of Europe by the back door."
"It is out of step with the democratic approach to things which I otherwise know from experience that Mr Vitorino is in favour of."
"If we are to go down that path, it must be by the front door."
"Madam President, the Tampere summit has finally decided that we must harmonise asylum and immigration policies, tighten cooperation on investigating crime and really construct a European judicial area."
"Alleanza Nazionale has been backing this in this House for at least eight years and so we are pleased that the Fifteen have begun to take a common position, and we hope that words will be followed by deeds."
"It is clear that without security there can be no social peace, and we must combat crime using strict controls on illegal immigration."
"Immigration is now a phenomenon which affects all European countries and, to prevent this causing imbalances or tensions in our national societies, it must be regulated and controlled in every aspect by common legislation."
"Creating a European judicial area means eliminating the inequalities between the Member States' legal systems and changing Europe' s multi-speed image in this field."
"An area of justice will give form and substance to the third pillar and allow a more intensive fight against organised crime, in all its terrible forms - trafficking of women and children, paedophilia, prostitution of minors, the production and selling of drugs and prostitution."
"These have all been fuelled recently by illegal immigration."
"I think it is difficult to conceive that all of this can happen in the short term if there is no strong signal given out to the national States as well."
"In 1998, in Italy alone, there were 130,000 statute-barred criminal cases, and the magistrates themselves say that the penal code has failed and that the Italian judicial system is bankrupt."
"We need common legislation or we will not be capable of promoting growth in Europe or stopping the spread of crime."
"To this end, we must also address the issue of how to prevent laws on security being in force in one Community country but not in another, given that our borders are open."
"There are in fact legal problems with cross-national borders and which demand cooperation."
"These are predominantly technical problems which we might reasonably set the lawyers to solve."
"However, the ambitions which now dominate, both in the motion for a resolution concerning the Tampere Summit and in the communications from the Commission, go much, much further."
"They go much further because the hidden agenda is not merely to solve technical problems but to establish a number of supranational systems."
"There has been talk of ""creating a union of security"" ."
"This is part of the European Union' s project and of the development of the Union, and it goes much further than is necessary."
"When the discussion turns to legal and home affairs, it is the family silver we are talking about."
"We are at the heart of a nation' s right to make its own decisions."
"We talk about a common policy on crime, refugees and immigration, but the question is: which policy is to be pursued?"
"There are widely different interpretations of crime involving drugs, for example."
"There are many different legal traditions and, where legal policy is concerned, you can talk in terms of repressive and liberal approaches."
"You can do so too on the question of refugees and immigration."
"I would warn against establishing the supranational systems."
"Better to wait a bit and not be too impulsive."
"Madam President, we are all still under the spell of the June elections in which a clear, absolute majority was achieved."
"But for the low turn-out (with people not voting, either because they were not interested in, or did not agree with, the development of the Union), the election was probably a milestone of democracy."
"Whether the conclusions of the Presidency and whether the results of the Tampere Summit will merit the term ""milestone"" remains to be seen."
"By the time of Amsterdam, we had had to acknowledge that the limits had been reached of how far the Member States were prepared to move towards integration."
"Following Amsterdam, there was extensive agreement that the Intergovernmental Conference was no longer a suitable instrument of change."
"This analysis was impressively confirmed by the embarrassingly low turn-out in the election."
"Otherwise, everything is continuing much as before."
"True, the Intergovernmental Conference is to get a face-lift, but the basic problems remain the same."
"There are doubtless some more positive entries on the balance sheet: the Tampere declarations concerning the area of freedom, security and justice; efforts towards a more intensive programme for combating crime; and improved access to justice."
"And also the results we are already seeing of the new policy on asylum and migration."
"Where, however, it was a matter of placing common interests before individual ones - for example, when it came to a fair sharing of the load - no agreement could be reached."
"Our conclusion, then, about Tampere: no doubt some important steps were taken there, but these were hardly milestones."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Tampere has been an important step forward, and I believe that great progress would be achieved by using these initiatives to create a genuine Europe of citizens in the areas of justice and internal affairs."
"You will see, however, that, when it comes to translating these initiatives into practical terms, you will only achieve the relevant goals when the opportunities afforded by the Treaty of Amsterdam are taken to make decisions about these areas using majority voting."
"This subject should therefore, perhaps, be addressed again in advance of the Intergovernmental Conference in Helsinki, for a decision about voting can in fact be made simply by the Council and without an Intergovernmental Conference."
"The tasks of any policy on justice and internal affairs are twofold: to provide the citizen with security against crime, yes, but also against instances of interference by the State."
"In a liberal community, both are tasks forming part of the relevant policy concerning justice and internal affairs."
"Partly in connection with what has been achieved in Tampere, a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be designed."
"I should like to thank the Finnish Presidency of the Council for the way in which it has set this process in motion. What now needs to happen is for the matter to take on a dynamic of its own, leading in the end to obligations on our part and to certain rights for our citizens."
"This process ought not to give rise to revised new catalogues of fundamental rights for the individual Member States but to legal entitlements in respect of action taken by the European institutions and in respect of legislation affecting our citizens."
"I believe we should achieve this in time."
"At the same time, I should like to ask the Presidency of the Council to abide by the bill and give the Commission the chance, however, to submit, in preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference, its own proposal for how working methods might most sensibly be put into practice."
"This is a really effective way of making progress."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, let me make a final remark about the Pack Report which is to be voted on today."
"The European Parliament has no institutional objections to the Report."
"It would like only to display an efficient approach, and there is also the widest possible agreement on this matter."
"With this point of view and in the light of the decision by the European Council concerning the competence of the Agency, agreements should be reached which, in time, achieve reconciliation throughout the Balkans and tie the region into the Stability Pact."
"The Administrative Council should no longer have an advisory role in deciding on individual reconstruction projects."
"In this connection, and with a view to achieving the greatest possible degree of efficiency, there is certainly broad agreement that a reasonable distribution of the workload between Pristina and Thessaloniki should be achieved."
"It would be helpful if you could adopt a position on this matter which might make the decision at 12 o' clock easier for us to take."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I do not know if there will be a spirit of Tampere."
"In any case, I am fairly sure that Tampere will be a significant step on the road to the establishment of a Citizens' Europe, the Europe which we must henceforth fight for with determination."
"In this area of freedom, security and justice which we hope to create, all three elements are important, and Tampere acts on all three of them."
"What is more, Commissioner, in undertaking to draw up this ""scoreboard"" , you are henceforth assuming a considerable responsibility."
"There is a helm which is in your hands; we have great expectations of it."
"On the matter of fundamental rights, the establishment of a forum for Parliament to make its contribution to drawing up a charter is one element, but we shall be debating the basis of this for, as far as we are concerned, this charter must have a direct application, i.e. citizens must be able to appeal to the Court of Justice, and this charter must include the new rights for Europeans in the 21st century."
"On the subject of immigration, by integrating what might be called a co-development strategy, that is to say, by acknowledging that, in order to resolve the question of immigration, the underlying causes of the refugee phenomenon must be tackled in full, I believe that Tampere is a significant milestone."
"It is also a significant step in the recognition of the nationality rights of nationals of third countries. It is an important step."
"We also think that, in this fight, the contributions of the French, Germans and British on the subject of asylum rights and immigration will offer elements which must be taken into account to a greater extent in future."
"In the measures relating to justice, we attach especial importance to the mutual acceptance of verdicts in civil and criminal cases."
"This is an essential point, in our view, for this is underpinned by the reality of a Citizens' Europe in which it will be possible for the rights of the family to also be extended to the rights of couples of different nationalities, and not just to be a cause of problems."
"We therefore invite you, Mr Lipponen, to integrate the second Brussels Convention at the earliest possible juncture, since this is a matter of urgency, and it is a legal entitlement which many families are waiting for."
"Next, and this will be no surprise to you, in this Parliament we attach great importance to the democratic nature of procedures."
"We therefore request that the legislative procedures envisaged by the Treaty of Amsterdam be applied properly."
"We also request that, as regards police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, these matters may be communitised in future."
"Finally, if there is a Tampere spirit, we request that heading 4 of the Amsterdam Treaty may be implemented ahead of schedule."
"We would see that as a pledge of the good faith of all the partners involved."
"Mr President, the Tampere Summit in itself was indeed a milestone in the progress made towards widening cooperation and strengthening intergovernmental solidarity."
"The constructive effort focused above all on the area of security, we could say that from here on the direction is going to be fairly uncertain and it might be a hard and bumpy journey."
"Despite its positive features, therefore, the outcome must be seen, from the point of view of fundamental and human rights, as the victory of a defensive battle."
"We must be particularly vigilant in the next round of preparatory work, which must be done openly."
"The road to Tampere was a very dark one."
"We need more light!"
"Mr President, the Tampere Summit decided that a European Charter of Fundamental Rights must be drawn up."
"The fact that the HCR was consulted on immigration and asylum policy may be seen as a significant sign of progress."
"I am sorry to see that human rights associations, anti-racist organisations and both sides of industry have already been left out of the process of drawing up this charter."
"For my own part, I would like to pay tribute at this point to these men and women."
"Their dedication and their groundwork have made it possible to re-establish a social structure and drive back racism, hatred and contempt on a daily basis."
"Enlisting these human resources would make it possible, when discussing matters of immigration and asylum, to find a way out of a debate which has been cut short."
"Unemployment, lack of security and immigration are too often lumped together."
"It is not acceptable to have people say today that Eurodac is going to be used to record the fingerprints of asylum-seekers and minors, and justifying this on the grounds that it is easier than taking DNA samples is beyond belief."
"Quite the contrary, immigrants must be given equal rights and treated as citizens in their own right."
"This means granting the right to live as a family unit, combating discrimination in accommodation, employment, leisure, and full nationality rights."
"And, in view of the daily round of humiliations inflicted on immigrants, it is only fair to grant them the right to vote."
"Finally, regularisation of the situation of those immigrants without proper documents, and elimination of the double penalty, would amply justify the existence of this Charter."
"There was one extremely important phrase which was used at Tampere, if you will permit me."
"This charter will guarantee, when confronted with outbreaks of extremism...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, the issues discussed at Tampere are obviously of great concern to all decent law-abiding people: asylum, immigration, cross-border crime and not least the death-dealing drug-smuggling activities of the loathsome drug barons."
"Like disease, crime knows no borders."
"Therefore, there can be no good reason for opposing the meetings of Heads of State as has happened at Tampere to discuss these issues."
"However, one has to express a note of caution."
"The suspicion amongst many in the United Kingdom is that these issues and the high-minded pronouncements are yet another power play by stealth on the part of the EU and its institutions."
"We have seen it all before: first the problem, a problem of huge legitimate, public and topical concern, then the meeting and then the solution."
"The central agenda is that whatever the problem, the solution is always the same."
"More power to the EU and its undemocratic institutions."
"The issue of asylum, immigration and cross-border crime and the administration of justice impact on the very fundamental issues of human rights and individual civil liberties."
"What we are considering is vesting even more powers in the hands of the EU and the unelected bureaucrats to take control of our very liberties - the body which brought us the inestimable benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy."
"Both are absolute disasters."
"British fishermen and farmers are now martyrs to the irresistible ambition of the European Union."
"Therefore, before we even think of passing more powers to the European Union, we must take into account its past activities and failures."
"Fishing and farming have been subjected to its most tried and tested policies: policies tested almost to destruction."
"We should forget the theory, fellow delegates."
"Forget the high-minded pronouncements and look at the implications."
"If there were prizes for rhetoric, the EU would be a world-class performer."
"But when it comes to performance, the EU is the bottom of the class for efficiency."
"There is a yawning gap, an unbridgeable gap."
"So, when it comes to the issues of liberty, the EU cannot even sort out fishing or look after our farmers."
"Why should we trust it with our freedom and our security?"
"Much more can be achieved by using existing national institutions and an international organisation...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, General de Gaulle used to say that a fine policy is not a policy which expresses fine sentiments."
"In this respect, the Tampere Council marks a new era in the refusal to accept reality."
"Reading the report of the proceedings of this conference, the special characteristics of the peoples of Europe should actually merge together in a sort of worldwide melting-pot in which migrants have, I quote, ""rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens"" , and ""the legal status of third country nationals should be approximated to that of Member States' nationals"" , all this in application of an alleged principle of non-discrimination."
"All these fine sentiments will clearly only result in increasing the flow of migrants yet further, and this means unemployment and lack of security."
"A realistic immigration policy ought, on the contrary, to involve making the situation of migrants in Europe more difficult by particularly eliminating any social assistance, and this indeed is the policy of the American Congress, by reducing economic aid to countries which encourage immigration, and organising systematic deportation."
"But for that, we should have to make a break with the prevailing ideology, denounce the media who spread this ideology, such as the ARTE television channel, and, in general, stop being afraid of our social and cultural superiority."
"We cannot carry on our shoulders the poverty of the entire world, the inability of some parties to organise themselves and the thirst for revenge on the part of formerly colonised peoples."
"It is natural for groups of men to attempt to dominate others."
"It is up to us, the peoples of Europe, to be the strongest in this fight."
"If we do not fight, then Europe, like any entity which stops fighting, will ultimately be lost in the melee."
"Mr President, the Tampere Council was a significant step forward for European construction."
"It pleases me as a Spaniard that it has given its backing to the impetus which the Spanish Prime Minister, José María Aznar, gave to this Summit."
"The European citizens are very concerned that freedom of movement should not be coupled with the free movement of those people who wish to use it to threaten their security."
"Terrorists, drug traffickers, traders in human beings and other criminals most not be allowed to move around within Europe unhindered by the police or the judiciary."
"It seems to me to be good news in the fight against terrorism, although the resolution of Parliament does not say so, that the formal extradition procedure for people who have been finally sentenced should be removed."
"It also seems to me that the Commission, in accordance with the new Tampere spirit and as the monitor of Community legislating, should ensure that directives to tackle money-laundering are complied with, given that non-compliance with these directives is hindering effective judicial cooperation as, for example, in the case of Gibraltar."
"Furthermore, the will expressed in the Council to tackle illegal immigration networks must come to fruition urgently as a result of decisive and effective police and judicial action."
"The Straits of Gibraltar and the Andalusian coasts are the silent witnesses of the tragic deaths of human beings."
"Not one death more, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Not one death more."
"The President-in-Office of the Council has also referred to the cooperation with countries of origin by means of action plans."
"I hope that, from now on, the Presidency of the Council will give this Parliament more explanations concerning the content of those plans."
"I ask you, Mr Lipponen, for more clarity and transparency in this area."
"We would like to know the timescales for action, the financial framework within which they will operate and the Commission' s responsibility with regard to these plans."
"And finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I cannot understand how the mandate will be extended in order to initiate other plans of action when the recently adopted ones have still not been implemented."
"Mr President, the conclusions of the Tampere Summit seem to me to be a basically positive sign for the citizens of the European Union because they address issues that affect all of us, but also, above all, because they open the door to the development of certain policies which the citizens themselves demand."
"I would like to see Tampere as a starting point, as a door which is opening and which will show us the path which we must travel along during the coming months, since there are some things which I still wonder about and I hope that they will be resolved during this process."
"With regard to fighting crime and the creation of an area of justice, I believe that we have moved forward and that this is positive."
"But I would like to concentrate principally on the question of immigration."
"I believe that it has also been positive to confront the need for a common asylum policy, but we need the funding to sustain it."
"We also need to confront the reality of immigration."
"I hope that, in the coming days, we will receive more information about what the Council intends and how the measures adopted at Tampere will be implemented."
"The action plans approved seem to me to be very interesting."
"This ""interpillar"" policy opens up possibilities which may lead us to a good result, but it also raises many questions as to by who and how these action plans will be developed and whether the Council will ever give us any information concerning the results of the one which has been implemented, that is to say the action plan concerning Iraq."
"The fight against illegal immigration also interests me."
"But I believe that, in order to combat illegal immigration, we must ensure that it is more worthwhile to approach a European Union consulate than a band of traffickers."
"If we want to put an end to the ignominy of deaths on our borders, as Mr Hernández Mollar said, we must offer a genuine common immigration policy, which we did not see at Tampere, offer new initiatives, and allow those people who live in the Union to do so with equal rights."
"Mr President, in spite of all the fine words which we have just heard, it seems clear to me that after the enormous effort that went into Tampere, the results are something of an anti-climax."
"The only resolution adopted was to adopt the resolution to adopt a resolution at a later date in order to resolve the problems we face."
"Yet the situation is urgent."
"While all the States in Tampere were pledging their commitment to human rights, the Belgian government was sending several dozen gypsies back to Slovakia by chartered plane, under military guard."
"In France, due to changes in the legislation, around 70,000 immigrants now find themselves without the proper documents, in an illegal situation."
"In Saint-Denis in the Parisian region, six of them started a hunger strike more than 30 days ago."
"The question remains, how can Member States be forced to respect the rights and the dignity of immigrants and asylum-seekers?"
"In concrete terms, this means freedom of movement, voting rights, the right to live together as a family, abolition of the double penalty, regularisation of the situation of immigrants without proper documents, and an end to racist discrimination."
"The Tampere approach is, thus, a poor one."
"Rather than harmonising the repressive laws in this Europe which more and more resembles a fortress, let us establish real status and real rights for immigrants and asylum-seekers throughout the Community."
"Mr President, everyone, especially lawyers like myself, is in favour of justice and civil rights."
"Any member or aspiring member of the EU should already have in place systems to protect their citizens based on their own common law, precedent and legislation."
"The third pillar is a vital repository of national competences arrived at through historic development, reflecting different cultural and social histories of the nations."
"Its demolition in my view is very sad and a big mistake, just at the time when it could be needed most."
"As for the proposals on immigration and asylum, I was the minister in the UK until 1997 dealing with these issues."
"From my experiences there, I now believe that the uncontrolled movement of people in global terms over the next 20 to 30 years, whether it be based on economic issues or climatic issues, represents a massive challenge to good order and democracy."
"I am certainly in favour of free movement in the EU where legal status exists, but what of the applicant states and their borders - they will have to take over protection of the EU under Schengen?"
"Are we really happy about those arrangements and does Tampere really address them?"
"What do our German friends think?"
"What do the ordinary electors in Yorkshire or in Brentwood in the United Kingdom think?"
"The granting of asylum is a precious gift not to be abused, as is unfortunately the case too often."
"The United Nations Convention in 1951 was clear: it should be applied to the letter but not replaced or surrounded with new regulations which, in my view, could cause even more confusion."
"Sometimes, in order to be generous, in order to show good sense, it is essential for us also to be firm."
"I regret that Tampere does not address the issues with sufficient firmness."
"Mr President, without a shadow of a doubt, Tampere is a significant step forward on the path towards full European integration and I would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency for its great contribution."
"Tampere proved that the Union has the political will to carve out joint policies on issues which indirectly affect our daily lives, policies which will, for example, make citizens feel more secure through effectively stepping up the fight against organised crime, particularly in the area of drug trafficking, money laundering and the trafficking of human beings through judicial cooperation and mutual recognition of judgements."
"Personally, I would like to see a common European family law and further efforts to combat racism, nationalism and xenophobia."
"The protection of the fundamental human rights of every person, without exception, who lives in the European Union is a sine qua non for the creation of a common area of freedom and justice."
"It was very encouraging to hear special reference to the Greek-Italian memorandum on strengthening cooperation in the Adriatic and Ionian Seas in order to combat organised crime."
"However, the Council remained quite diffident when it came to endorsing the common European Asylum System and Fund for immigrants proposed by the European Parliament and the Commission, as opposed to simply approximating rules and procedures."
"In addition, the Union seems unable to formulate a strategy to combat the social causes of immigration and to provide aid to the countries of origin so as to reduce pressure on the European Union."
"Finally, Mr President, please allow me to express my reservations on one question in particular."
"Do you believe that the Tampere meeting has set in motion a five-year process to enhance the democratic and political make-up of the Union or to transform it into a fortress which is unassailable to all the victims of persecution around the world?"
"I believe that only in December 2001, with the interim assessment and with hindsight, will we be able to judge the direction which it has actually taken."
"Mr President, laying the foundations for the construction of a European area of freedom, security and justice was the goal of the European Council of Tampere, an important goal because it affects the values which are at the heart of our western civilisation."
"We are therefore waiting impatiently for the good will declarations to be followed by real, concrete policies."
"For example, the need to establish a joint policy on immigration and asylum is now commonly felt by the peoples of Europe."
"We must aim for an open, secure European Union which will establish partnerships with the migrants' countries of origin and draw up joint development policies with these countries and those that migrants pass through."
"To start with, we need a common European asylum system with the basic conditions for receiving migrants and, later, we need a uniform statute for asylum seekers."
"I am worried that, along with joint legislation, there is a lack of effective solidarity measures between the Member States for times when we need to address emergency situations, as in the case of the huge influx of Albania and Balkan citizens into Italy following the political crisis in those countries."
"Think of the Mediterranean in general, and the Adriatic in particular which forms an external border of the Union and not just Italy."
"The invitation to the Commission to assess the possibility of a budgetary reserve for this is significant but it is still not enough - the entire European Union should take responsibility for the extraordinary influx of non-Community immigrants with a strong act of solidarity towards the most affected countries, Italy in particular."
"The act of solidarity and improved control of migration flows are important instruments in the fight against organised crime and, in particular, against trafficking in human beings."
"The issue of women and children who are exploited and set up as prostitutes and the relationship of this world with drug trafficking, apart from being important matters affecting public safety, are, from a human point of view, tragic and distressing and require specific intervention on our part."
"All of these actions and others as well, which relate to the security of European Union citizens, must be carried out in full compliance with the fundamental rights of those living in the Union, because the keystone of the future area of freedom and security is in fact those indispensable fundamental rights."
"Mr President, if the Tampere Summit achieved one thing, then it was the fact that the Member States were reminded that they once signed something called the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"I have to be honest with you; it was vital that this should happen for we needed to give form to the aforementioned area of freedom, security and justice."
"Of course Parliament wanted more far-reaching European commitments to come out of the Tampere Summit but I have to say that since these important issues are now on the European agenda all the same, along with a scoreboard, a clearly-defined task for the European Commission and thus also a role for the European Parliament, then that is a very good thing and I would like to congratulate the Presidency on this, but also the European Commission in particular."
"However I would like to raise two critical objections in connection with the outcome of the summit; first and foremost with regard to the rights of the citizens of Europe."
"It is a good thing that it was at last resolved at the summit that all citizens of the European Union must be accorded equal rights, and that includes those who are non-nationals of the Member States."
"Citizenship of a Member State must not be founded on exclusion and discrimination though."
"And so it is also my hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the Council will assign the European Commission the task of establishing what the rights of citizens from third countries are, and that the Commission will interpret these in the broadest sense, respecting the non-discriminatory principle, also when it comes to voting rights, to the right to live as part of a family and to the right to freedom of movement, notwithstanding the fact that nothing was said on this at the summit."
"Secondly, the policy on asylum and migration appears to me to still be lacking in balance."
"For one thing there are intergovernmental measures which can be implemented immediately through the action plans but which are primarily geared towards the protection of migrants, and for another there are tasks for the European Commission, common asylum policy, protection of asylum seekers."
"On behalf of my group, I would like to urge that the principles of the Geneva Convention find full expression in all its aspects in the two aspects of the migration policy and that the Commission and Parliament become fully involved in all said aspects."
"Mr President, the purpose of the Tampere Summit was to specify the measures which are required for creating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Among the Commission' s tasks was that of establishing a table of results as a model for comparing the extent to which the relevant measures had been implemented."
"This is a good initiative which will also clarify the areas within which the Commission should be the first to take action."
"It is, however, only an evaluative instrument and can only go so far towards achieving the goal of a European Union governed by the rule of law."
"As well as strengthening fundamental rights, the table of results can provide legal convergence rules with legal objectives and guarantees."
"If an area is to be designated an area of justice, the rule of law is required to operate there."
"If it is going to be possible to measure how far the Member States have progressed, criteria must be established and effective methods of measurement devised."
"It is about being able to compare legal systems and bring about improvements."
"If differences are to be made clear and voluntary harmonisation achieved by means of group pressure, comparisons ought to be illustrated in the form of a table of results open to all."
"This is how the driving force can be produced to push ahead with extending throughout the European Union that dependable area of justice which is the prerequisite of citizens' being able to move about freely, securely and safely."
"The principle of mutual recognition, accepted in Tampere, must, however, in future, be supplemented by a degree of harmonisation within the field of criminal law as well."
"Initiatives were also taken at the summit to strengthen the position of the victims of crime and to ensure that citizens have access to the judicial system."
"I should like to have seen the Member States urged to introduce national funds for the victims of crime so as to be able to guarantee that the latter receive support in terms of financial prerequisites which are similar throughout the Union."
"Victims ought to receive aid, economic, psychological and social support through State, voluntary and individual contributions throughout the entire European Union."
"I want to end by expressing special thanks to the Commission and to Commissioner Vitorino for their constructive contributions at the summit."
"Mr President, the big news from the Tampere Summit is that apparently there is the political will to produce common European policy."
"The political role of the Commission and of this Commissioner will be strengthened as a result."
"Some essential fundamental principles were also reaffirmed such as the right to seek asylum and the fight to combat racism and discrimination."
"It goes without saying that this is all to the good."
"But it is still a matter of first seeing then believing."
"The decisions taken still need to be given substance and some policy options have not made it."
"The proposed common European asylum system still falls a long way short of the idea of integrated European policy."
"The notion of spreading the burden between the Member States is still taboo."
"A European approach to migration as such is not a realistic proposition at this stage."
"We are talking in terms of a policy of determent at the very most."
"And it remains to be seen how exactly the Council proposes to improve the rights of people from third countries."
"The Commission should take the lead in drawing up a further agenda and Parliament must be enabled to play its rightful role where all of these issues are concerned."
"Cooperation in the fields of criminal and civil law establishes the principle of mutual recognition as the crux of the strategy."
"That may sound modest but it is probably a sensible choice in view of the disbelief and repugnance that this development still seems to evoke amongst the professional circles that lawyers move in."
"A great deal of work still remains to be done here to get the message across."
"In this context, setting up EUROJUST is a bold initiative."
"Hence it is all the more a pity that the parliamentary control aspect has been swept under the carpet."
"On a final note: the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Now that a decision has been taken on the composition of the forum that is to compile the Charter, it is high time that we determined what the status of this document is to be."
"So far, the Council has left this matter up in the air."
"If this Charter is to have any added value then it must become binding law to which every EU citizen can appeal."
"To that end, it will have to be incorporated into the Treaties."
"Mr President, on 3 April of last year, this House thankfully approved by a large majority my report on internal security and on extending the European Union to the East and issued an order to establish a European Academy for Internal Security."
"I am very happy and grateful that, in Tampere, the Council gave concrete expression to this order by establishing the European Police College."
"I am also delighted that, on Monday in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Vitorino gave notice that the Commission would soon be submitting a study concerning the way in which this project might be specifically put into practice, for I believe in fact that, when our police are trained together in the European spirit and when, as specified in the order, the police in the candidate countries are involved right from the beginning - and this idea too is traceable back to the proposal by this House - then we shall be taking an important, concrete step towards a Europe of justice and internal security."
"I should be very grateful if this College could be located in the border area between the EU and the candidate countries, for example in East Bavaria."
"Here, there are already a lot of examples of practical cooperation in the sphere of policing, and these might be useful in connection with this project."
"I should like to address a second issue."
"I am of the view that the Council has done well to set the course for a common policy on asylum and refugees but, unlike many members, I am not so unhappy about the fact that we still have some way to go in that direction, for a number of quite important elements are still missing."
"Above all, I should like here to criticise the fact that, now as before, no specific sharing of the burden between individual countries has been arrived at. It even looks as though any such personal distribution of the burden has receded into the far distance."
"I am of the view, however, that, without such a sharing of the load, a common policy on asylum and refugees would be something which might be likened to a large roof erected only with a single supporting wall somewhere on the perimeter."
"A roof of this kind would inevitably tumble down."
"I consider a common asylum policy to which there is no definite key for sharing the load to be completely unthinkable."
"We therefore ought to use the time we have here and do some further, specific work on this matter."
"Mr President, we can either accept and rejoice in the outcome of the Tampere Summit or else consider it to be defective."
"However we may categorise the result, the Tampere Summit was, and is, important."
"It is important because it signifies a step towards a common European area of justice."
"The direction is the correct one."
"But with the great goal of the common area of justice in front of us, Tampere is just a small step on a long road."
"The people of Europe expect more."
"They expect larger and, above all, courageous steps in quick succession."
"I am convinced that they are also entitled to these."
"The citizens of Europe can certainly demand that the law in every individual Member State should offer them the same level of safety, protection and security."
"They can expect not to be taken to the cleaners in a neighbouring country with the help of another legal system which is alien to them."
"Summits of varying degrees of solemnity do not alone do justice to these entitlements."
"Just as peace is not created simply by not going to war, so too is a common European area of justice not created just by a handful of governments expressing their good will."
"Reliable rules for cooperation must also follow a willingness to cooperate on issues of justice."
"The Council and the governments alone cannot create these."
"Parliament must help them."
"The Council should know that, in the interests of the people whom we represent as Members of the European Parliament, we are prepared to do this and will in fact do it."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, on 15 and 16 October, in Tampere, important steps were taken towards the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice within the European Union."
"Contrary to the idea that our Union should be of an exclusively or mainly economic nature, the Council, following a course of action that Parliament has now been defending for a long time, turned to our citizens, to their freedom of movement, to their security and to the recognition of their right to justice, rights which must be granted not only to citizens of the Union but to all those who, for a variety of reasons find themselves in our territory on a regular basis."
"Various political priorities and guidelines were agreed on, and the Commission will have to put forward a ""scoreboard"" proposal, that is, a panel which will assess the progress that has been made and whether we have met the terms laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, by the Vienna action plan and by the conclusions of this European Council itself, a pragmatic initiative which promises good results and which relied on the commitment of Commissioner António Vitorino, whom we should congratulate for this too."
"It is true that there will be greater cooperation and that there were some areas in which it was easy to reach agreement, such as in the case of creating EUROJUST which should become operational towards the end of 2001, or in the strengthening of EUROPOL' s role or even in the creation of a European Police Academy."
"But, we should recognise that, on the whole, compatibility, convergence and the approximation of practices in the 15 Member States were given preference over the harmonisation and standardisation which could and should have taken place."
"In this way, the emphasis was placed on convergence and on common rules on asylum procedure, on the creation - albeit in vague terms - of a financial instrument for situations in which the temporary protection of refugees is required, on closer judicial cooperation, on recognising judicial decisions etc. The principles have been laid down and are on the whole positive ones."
"What we are now waiting for are the decisions and the initiatives which will allow us to give real substance to what was laid down."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as the last to Parliamentarian to speak, there is one thing that comes to mind: you have spoken of the Tampere spirit and I believe that there is also a Tampere signal."
"It is a strong signal that Europe is no longer just a market and that the European citizen is no longer just a consumer or a worker; that the citizens, in all their forms, with all their worries, with all their needs, with all their demands, are at the centre of European construction."
"And it seems important, bearing in mind everything that has been said here, to point out an issue which, in my opinion, symbolises this setting for the citizen."
"At Tampere, a quasi-constitutional transformation has taken place, because the Council has given the Commission a mandate to establish, on their proposal, common rules on admission and residence, on small claims and many other issues."
"In this way we are moving from a shared right of initiative to a right of initiative which is wholly in the hands of the Commission."
"It seems to me that this, from the point of view of European construction, is enormously important."
"In the final seconds of this debate I would like to highlight judicial construction and the fact that the citizens, in addition to security, the police and the fight against crime, wish to know that justice is on their side, in any part of Europe, and that they will find justice before any judge."
"This is another of the great messages of Tampere."
"Commissioner, you have said that a lot of things were left undone in Tampere and it is true."
"But there is - as the French say - du pain sur la planche."
"You have at least fifteen enormously important mandates to perform."
"We in this Parliament hope that those proposals will be on the table very soon."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you for your speeches; they have been very constructive."
"I would like to take up your valuable time, first to move on to some general comments, and then to reply to your points in detail, and finally speak about the future, and about implementation and monitoring."
"In my opinion, the last speech, by Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, was very important, as it put forward the notion that we should be setting ambitious targets."
"On the other hand, Mr Holmes, in his speech, was concerned that the harmonisation of legislation and administrative practices would advance too hastily."
"The problem for Tampere was that the issue of justice and home affairs is, all in all, a very conservative area."
"On the one hand, there is the worry that national practices will have to change too quickly."
"On the other hand, we have a real need for the convergence of legislation, inter alia, in the fight against crime and the enhancement of police cooperation."
"For example, we do not have in our legislation any coherent definition of what organised crime is."
"The method we use here is the single market method, where we look pragmatically at how progress is to be made, using problems as the point of departure."
"The mutual recognition of sentences is one line of action, and the other is that we examine the need for the harmonisation of legislation."
"First, I will speak of Eurojust and the European prosecuting authority."
"Eurojust itself aims, not just at networking among the prosecuting authorities, but also at achieving a situation where investigations and action can be initiated in investigation teams."
"The question of a prosecuting authority of benefit to the Community was raised in the final stages by the Commission."
"It is quite another question, as it would be expressly concerned with crimes committed within the territory of the Community, in which the Community has a financial interest."
"This has quite a lot to do with the issues that were discussed mainly last spring, but they can certainly be returned to once more."
"Regarding Europol, worry has been expressed here concerning Europol surveillance."
"I think that is very justifiable, as this must be monitored as Europol' s mandate or, to be precise, its competences, expand."
"However, Europol' s basic operational model and nature were not altered at Tampere."
"Europol and its officers did not acquire independent competences, but will work more closely with the Member States, providing aid and support."
"This must be monitored closely."
"Some speeches focused attention on the status of nationals of third countries."
"At Tampere the term ""comparable"" status was used."
"This means that we shall go as far as possible in the direction of full citizens' rights but, for example, there is perhaps a certain unwillingness to grant voting rights in parliamentary elections."
"Instead, the right to vote in local elections is a good example of the sort of European practice we should be hoping for."
"The question of a refugee fund, of the share of the burden, gave rise to some discussion, and we agreed that we should return to the question of a fund."
"We must clarify our concept of what we are trying to do."
"What we mean here is that, when masses of refugees suddenly arrive seeking temporary protection, we should support those countries that are the target of such large-scale migration."
"The request is entirely legitimate, and financial aid may also come into it, but the matter will take more preparatory work."
"Speaking of the share of the burden, we might say that in the situation in Kosovo we saw that we were not prepared."
"We should be able to agree policies to build solidarity among the Member States."
"We perhaps do not have to go as far as an automatic share of quotas, but we are in need of better practices when it comes to solidarity."
"Obviously, we have to work in cooperation with the UNHCR, as in the Kosovo situation."
"The capacity for action by the international community in these situations must, on the whole, be improved."
"I want to return once more to the question of organised crime, which Mr Di Lello Finuoli referred to in his speech."
"At Tampere we in fact agreed some very far-reaching aims. Money laundering came within the scope of Europol' s mandate."
"In my opinion, the work will be enhanced on a very broad front when the prosecution authorities are involved."
"Now I would like to speak on certain other matters that have been raised here."
"Firstly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights: will it be a political act or a draft for a new constitution."
"As the country to hold the presidency of the European Council, we shall take the matter further on the basis of what was decided at Cologne, i.e. that it is a political act. But that will not prevent us from raising the question at some stage that the Union needs some sort of constitution, into which fundamental rights should be written."
"This is a matter of processes."
"At Tampere resolutions were made on the working party' s mandate and composition, and it will assemble for the first time during the Finnish Presidency."
"I hope that it will acquire a prestigious chairman."
"The question of an Intergovernmental Conference was raised, for example by Mr Brock."
"I would like to emphasise that this is a matter for the presidency."
"We were charged with the task at the Cologne Summit."
"Obviously, we will work on the basis of the Commission' s proposal, but I hope that it will not be forgotten here in Parliament that such an institution as the Council and its presidency do exist."
"Mr Brock raised the issue of the situation in Kosovo and the Stability Pact."
"They were discussed on the evening before the meeting at Tampere."
"The President of the Republic of Finland, Martti Ahtisaari, spoke on the subject, considering it necessary that the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, the Secretary-General of NATO, Javier Solana, and Balkans representative, Bodo Hombach, should now work together more effectively to safeguard both the implementation of the Stability Pact and, obviously, the progress in practical matters, such as cooperation between Pristina and Thessaloniki."
"The country to hold the presidency is therefore monitoring this issue very closely."
"As for the Obnova regulation, the Council will carefully look into Parliament' s draft amendments."
"I discussed this this morning with President Fontaine."
"The purpose is to clear the matter up immediately, as the European Parliament has adopted its opinion, and the Council will already be initiating discussions at the end of this week about how the amendments proposed by the European Parliament might be taken account of when making the final decision on Obnova."
"I hope this will also be one of those issues that will be settled during the Finnish presidential term, signifying that we have, as it were, got beyond this problem of the institutions, and that is what our citizens actually expect."
"Moving on to how the European Parliament participates in decision-making, and what has happened in this matter, I accept the criticism, as the representative of the country to hold the presidency."
"I would, however, like to point out that in the part-session in September, three of our Ministers were here to report on the Tampere meeting. They were the Minister for the Interior, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs."
"A fourth was present too: our Coreper representative."
"Generally, what was achieved at Tampere is founded on our adherence to transparency, and we did not, for example, at the last moment produce any surprises for governments or Parliament."
"Everything was known; our draft agenda was available to all."
"In the future, the European Parliament will participate in decision making, and this will obviously be rooted in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The conclusions of Tampere will improve further the European Parliament' s practical opportunities for involvement and monitoring."
"The conclusions of Tampere show a commitment at the highest political level to an assurance of much-needed transparency and to the practice of regular supplies of information conveyed to the European Parliament."
"I have already told the ministers that if something is unsatisfactory, they have to come here."
"The constructive and active nature of the conclusions of Tampere will provide Parliament with better opportunities to participate in the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"In other words, the aims and means have now been more clearly defined, and it will be easier to take part in their implementation."
"For this, that adopted proposal provides an important aid."
"I would like to thank Mr Suominen for the advice on terminology. It was, if I remember correctly, a 'balanced score card' , which we have to achieve."
"That will also facilitate the work of Parliament."
"Regarding transparency, may I be so bold as to remind everyone that in the Treaty of Amsterdam it was Finland that proposed a change to the paradigm."
"Until then, it was a principle in the Union that documents were not generally public, although there were exceptions."
"We proposed that the opposite principle should be adopted, that documents should be public, although there might be some exceptions."
"Now the question is whether all the institutions, within the framework of their own responsibility, will put this principle into practice and whether the Commission will actually make proposals for acts on these issues."
"Then I would speak finally about implementation, which was something Mr Suominen and others drew attention to."
"The Council on justice and home affairs will initiate the implementation of the Tampere resolutions on Friday of this week."
"As the country to hold the presidency, we have drafted a certain sort of agenda for that meeting, which comprises all the action required of the conclusions of Tampere, which is to say, what needs to be done, who is to do it, and according to what timetable."
"I hope that we will succeed with this model of working, so that it will also facilitate the work of Parliament."
"I would like to thank the President, the Bureau and those who have spoken for their very kind words, but also for their criticism, as we simply cannot be complacent in the wake of the Tampere meeting. We have to really take the decisions reached there seriously and start work accordingly."
"Thank you very much Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Lastly, I am going to hand the floor to Mr Vitorino, who is to speak on behalf of the European Commission."
"The debate is overrunning somewhat."
"I would ask the Commissioner to restrict his speaking time a little if at all possible."
"There will be plenty more opportunities for us to enter into debate with you."
"I hand the floor to Mr Vitorino."
"Mr President, I do not consider your warning to be a constraint on my fundamental freedom of speech, I do assure you."
"I would simply like to thank you, on behalf of the Commission, for all the contributions you have made in this debate."
"I must assure you, ladies and gentlemen, and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi in particular, that the Commission is well aware of its own responsibility as regards the application of the Tampere conclusions."
"I must stress that the Commission could never have fulfilled its role if it had not been able to count on the support of the Finnish Presidency, particularly the Prime Minister, Mr Lipponen, whom I must thank once more for his cooperation and his work to make Tampere a success, and also on the support, critical and vigilant as always, of the European Parliament."
"The Commission is now indeed counting on the critical and vigilant support of the European Parliament in order to prepare the ""scoreboard"" ."
"In fact, the ""scoreboard"" is not just an instrument for legislative programming, it is also an instrument intended to strengthen the transparency and accountability of all European institutions with regard to the citizens, because it is the citizens who are in control in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It is not just a control panel, it is also an instrument for evaluating the actual results achieved in terms of actual progress in the application of the Tampere conclusions."
"The progress achieved will not be the concern of just the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, but also the Member States, insofar as some ""scoreboard"" tasks will be entrusted to them in application of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Finally, Mr President, I wish to stress the importance, for the Commission, of the decisions regarding the drawing up of the Charter of Fundamental Rights which were taken at Tampere and which will be followed up in Helsinki."
"As the political and philosophical foundation of the area of freedom, security and justice I propose to consider all matters related not only to the fundamental rights of the citizens of the Members States of the Union, but also the rights of third country nationals legally resident on a long-term basis within the Union."
"As for rights relating to the fight against discrimination, based on Article 13 of the Treaty, they will be discussed during the debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"At this time, a clear sign must be given so that the process of drawing up the Charter and the Intergovernmental Conference of the Union, which are due to take place at the same time, both express movement in the same direction, with a view to guaranteeing the conditions for enlargement and strengthening the foundations of the rule of law in our Union."
"Before handing over to my fellow Commissioner, Michel Barnier, who is going to present the objectives of the Intergovernmental Conference, I would once again like to thank the Parliament for the support given to the Commission in this project, the Tampere project, the spirit of Tampere, the letter of Tampere, but most of all the project of the citizens of this shared Union of ours."
"(Loud applause)"
"I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2), to conclude the present statement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 p.m."
"Report on the IGC"
"The next item is the Commission' s statement on the report by the high-level working group regarding the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I now hand the floor to Mr Barnier, who will speak on behalf of the Commission."
"Mr President, Members of Parliament, for the Commission, the debate which we are having right now is of great interest but is also limited."
"The limitation, which you will all understand and respect, is that at the time of this debate neither the Commission nor the European Parliament have established in a precise and detailed fashion their position and their proposals for the next institutional talks which are due to commence at the beginning of next year."
"Today, then, the matter in hand, a considerable one, is to assess and gauge the state of mind in which we, together with you, are going to approach these talks."
"I am therefore going to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, or rather reaffirm, the state of mind shared by President Prodi and the College of Commissioners, and I shall be extremely attentive to what you have to tell me, either on behalf of your political Groups or as individuals."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in asking three respected and experienced individuals to comment freely and express their ideas, the Commission wished, without further ado, to initiate and shed light on the debate."
"In so doing, I am certain that we are fulfilling our role in the precise spirit of the first clause of Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union."
"The first objective has been achieved."
"The debate has been initiated."
"It must take place here, it must take place within the Member States, within the national parliaments."
"I shall contribute to it along with all the people interested in building Europe, and there are more of them than you might think, working as closely as possible with the citizens."
"I would like, Mr President, to express our gratitude to Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, to President von Weizsäcker and Lord Simon for the high quality of their contributions, and to thank you too, in this place, for your welcome and for your careful consideration of their report, particularly within your Committee on Constitutional Affairs, run and chaired by Mr Napolitano."
"The primary merit of the Dehaene report lies in establishing what is at stake and giving a real political perspective to institutional reform."
"I shall return to this point in a moment."
"A number of lessons may be learnt from it as of now: firstly, regarding the timetable, secondly, regarding the scope of the reforms which must be implemented successfully and, finally, regarding the way in which these talks must be prepared."
"On the subject of the timetable first of all, ladies and gentlemen, let me express this conviction of mine. This reform is the last opportunity to implement real reform before the greater enlargement of the Union, before the States and the peoples of Europe come together in a great political and economic community."
"The prospect of greater enlargement is no longer a mere hypothesis, it is not a remote possibility."
"The Commission decided, on 13 October, that we must prepare for this with the same degree of seriousness, but more quickly."
"This is why it is necessary for this Intergovernmental Conference to be completed effectively before the end of the year 2000."
"This tighter deadline makes success essential."
"But the question is, ladies and gentlemen, does this deadline necessarily make a mini Intergovernmental Conference essential?"
"We do not think so."
"This reform, which is necessary, as we must all realise deep down, is not only and not primarily a matter of time, it is primarily a matter of political will, of clear-sightedness regarding our own way of operating at the moment and its inadequacies; it is a matter of courage, the collective courage that we may or may not have to give priority, this time, to the Union, to give priority to a long-term vision which, as we know, even if it is difficult, goes beyond short-term caution and short-term interests."
"Considering the time limits for the talks, and the time limits for ratification by each of the Member States, now is the time to wish to achieve and to actually achieve a real reform."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am not talking about a definitive reform of the European institutions, but of a reform that is far-reaching enough to prevent the institutions being deadlocked or choked, a reform far-reaching enough, as a Member of Parliament said the other day, to enable further development in future."
"It is a mistake to believe, let me emphasise this strongly, that it will be possible at a later stage, with eighteen, twenty or twenty-seven Members, to carry out the reform which we did not manage to achieve at Amsterdam and which we were not willing to carry through now."
"As regards the scope of this reform, we have discussed the level of ambition for this Intergovernmental Conference, and this is the frame of mind of the Commission."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, should surprise no one, since the great project of enlargement, as I said moments ago, will be even faster and even wider than we imagined at Amsterdam."
"I repeat therefore: the Commission and the European Parliament are fulfilling their role by wishing to take this conference forward and by recommending that reforms be undertaken now so that the Union may integrate a great number of States."
"It is not, ladies and gentlemen, a matter of challenging the Cologne conclusions."
"The primary obligation of this Intergovernmental Conference will be to deal with the matters which were still outstanding after Amsterdam, and deal with them properly; deal with them, I must emphasise, ambitiously, because it is perfectly possible, let me tell you from experience, to deal with these three subjects with a greater or lesser degree of ambition."
"All three of these matters, the number of Commissioners within an enlarged Union, the new weighting of votes, the scope of qualified majority voting, are extremely problematic, but necessary, subject areas."
"Our feeling, let me tell you, is that it will not be so hard to deal with them if they are included in a political perspective."
"This is why the list of questions mentioned in the Dehaene report seems perfectly admissible to us."
"Not one of the ideas put forward may be deemed superfluous."
"It is not unnecessary to work on the reorganisation of the Treaty to make it more readable, more accessible to citizens and in order to imagine one day the simpler amendment of common policies, as opposed to the fundamental principles of the Union."
"It is not unnecessary to seek to improve the system of strengthened cooperation, without however taking the slightest risk, I am absolutely sure, of the acquis communautaire becoming ""unravelled"" in some way or other."
"It is not unnecessary to hope that it may be possible, by the end of the year 2000, in the new Treaty, to draw the conclusions affecting the institutions of the decisions which may be taken in the meantime, in the spirit of Cologne, for the security and the defence of the continent of Europe."
"It is not unnecessary, ladies and gentlemen, to work on the other institutional questions which arise with enlargement. For example, the matter of the legal personality of the Union."
"For example, the matter of the operation of the Court of Justice, or even the matter of more concerted European action in the fight against fraud."
"I am saying this in the aftermath to the Tampere Council, which you have just discussed with my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino."
"On all these matters, and on others too perhaps, the Commission will be pleased to hear your reactions and your suggestions."
"Finally, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a brief word about preparations for the talks."
"The intentions of the Portuguese and then the French presidency, the intentions of the Finnish presidency, before the Helsinki meeting, are essential for the Intergovernmental Conference to be able to proceed on a firm foundation and to go ahead, may I say, as early as possible, by the beginning of the year 2000."
"As for us, we are making serious preparations, and this is the least that can be expected of the Commission."
"Within the College of Commissioners, as of 10 November, we shall be debating the form and the broad lines of our formal report which is to be published before the start of these talks."
"In any case, ladies and gentlemen, this formal report will be a comprehensive, forceful policy document, constructed and structured so as to be of use in the talks, to facilitate and, we hope, expedite them."
"Recalling the fine quality throughout the entire period of the run-up to Amsterdam, of the contributions made by the two representatives of the European Parliament, Elisabeth Guigou and Elmar Brok, I would also like to say that I think it generally useful for Parliament to be able to have a say and to be involved, ideally, in these forthcoming talks."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude with this observation. Between caution and recklessness, between realism and utopianism, there is, we are convinced, a place for and a path towards the real reform of our institutions, for the more efficient and more democratic operation of the Union, not to delay enlargement, but to make a success of it."
"Mr President, my group welcomes the publication of the Dehaene, Lord Simon and von Weizsäcker report because it makes the case clearly, and makes it well, to have an IGC that is not confined to the so-called ""three Amsterdam leftovers"" ."
"We must address wider issues."
"This IGC, though, will not be so much about broadening the field of responsibility or the competences of the European Union; it will be about structural reform, institutional reform, reform that will make the Union more open, more efficient, more democratic and more transparent."
"Above all, the IGC will make it capable of functioning and carrying out its responsibilities when it is composed of more than 20 Member States."
"The three Amsterdam leftovers will be part of the package but they will not be alone."
"We are winning the argument to have a wider agenda."
"But even those three leftovers, as Mr Barnier underlined, are not subjects which are easy to handle."
"For instance, extending the field of qualified majority voting will immediately provoke assorted Eurosceptics and others to say in their Member States that their country is giving up the veto and giving up sovereignty."
"Indeed, it is the position of one of the largest component parties of the EPP that there should not be an extension of qualified majority voting."
"Yet if they pause to think for one minute they would soon realise that their own country, every country, probably loses more from the vetoes cast by other countries than they gain in using their own in many areas of European Union responsibility."
"However, change must come not just for the three Amsterdam leftovers; extension of qualified majority voting, the size of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council."
"Change is necessary for the Court."
"How will it function if it is going to be composed of nearly 30 members?"
"Change is necessary as regards the size of this Parliament if we are to respect the limit of 700 members laid down in the Treaties at our own request."
"Something needs to be done to take further the conclusions reached by our Member States that the WEU should now be integrated and its functions, or part of its functions, transferred to the European Union."
"There is the question of codification and simplification of the Treaties, an issue that this Parliament was first to highlight in the run-up to the Amsterdam negotiations; a task started by Amsterdam but far from complete and which, too, is a point underlined and highlighted in the Dehaene report."
"In adding new issues like those to the IGC we are not necessarily making it more difficult."
"Having a wider package might make it easier to reach agreement and easier to ratify in our Member States but I can say, on behalf of my group, that we are willing to have Parliament work closely with the Commission in the spirit that Mr Barnier has just indicated, so that together we can put a balanced package of proposals on the table of the IGC that he, and our representatives to all the meetings of the IGC, can defend: a package that will make the Union fit to work when it has more than 20 Member States."
"Mr President, I welcome the report for pointing us at the central question which is the method for revision of the treaties in the future."
"We must realise that it will be virtually impossible - and certainly it will be impracticable - to forge agreement between 25 or 30 states upon essential questions of sovereignty."
"So, the key reform is Article 48 for treaty change."
"We must entrench the constituent articles of the treaty and we need a softer, lighter system for changing the treaty in regard to policy chapters."
"The first reform will calm citizens' fears of creeping sovereignty transfers and the second should encourage citizens to engage more obviously with the political choices that we face in Brussels and in Strasbourg."
"The second reform that is essential is to remove the national veto from the clauses of reinforced cooperation; and the third will be to grant citizens the right of direct approach to the European Court."
"Commissioner Barnier, the Dehaene report contains positive and negative points, like almost everything in life."
"I would like to add that the main ideas have been advanced by the European Parliament for decades, so it does not seem particularly original."
"I would like to make the most of my short speaking time to invite you and President Prodi to reflect on the risks we are running in only talking to the governments and trying to convince them alone, especially the most reluctant ones, and always trying to combine realism and credibility in proposals which are often ambiguous and moderate."
"In my view, it is worrying that even the Wise Men, who no longer have any obligations to anyone, consider trying to reach a compromise as a priority and that they want to play a part which is not theirs."
"I hope that in the proposal that you put to us, the Commission and yourself will have the courage to aim higher and that you will be able to justify the need to establish a constitutional section in the founding texts of the European Union with something more inspiring than the mere reorganisation of the confused texts of the Treaties."
"I am sorry that President Dehaene could not find this courage."
"I also hope that the Commission will be able to free itself of the inefficient and anachronistic pillar structure and clearly refute the extremely odd idea which the Wise Men put forward, that Parliament' s power of codecision is legitimised only under the first pillar."
"The courage to seek alliances and a consensus outside the palaces of power, among the people, and in this Parliament, is a challenge that the Commission must accept."
"If it does not, we will all lose."
"Mr President, President of the Commission Prodi was quite right when he spoke before this House of an error of historical proportions if the Intergovernmental Conference were to be reduced to dealing with the so-called Amsterdam leftovers."
"No, what the citizens of the European Union rightly expect is true democracy, transparency and efficient decision-making."
"What is necessary, above all, is the courage to critically examine the policies of the Union so far."
"The need for a socially just Europe remains highly topical."
"We need a reform of the Union which finally places the struggle against mass unemployment and poverty at the centre of policy."
"The reform should also entail having the courage to change Article 4 of the EC Treaty which, in classically neo-liberal manner, defines the Union as an open market economy with free competition."
"The same applies to Article 105 of the EC Treaty so that the European Central Bank might have the contractually established political task of using its monetary policy to promote growth and employment."
"Our citizens must be involved in the debate about the content and objectives of the reform."
"They must have the opportunity, through referenda, to themselves deliver their own judgement on the results of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I have noted with interest the proposals of Messrs Dehaene, von Weizsäcker and Simon."
"A number of these I personally consider to be definitely worth discussing, for example the proposals to simplify the Treaties or the proposal that qualified majority voting in the Council and the involvement of Parliament in decision-making ought to be the rule in future."
"As a Member of the European Parliament representing a large Member State, I attach the greatest importance, of course, to the fact that the rights of small States should not be restricted."
"One thing, though, I want finally to say loud and clear here. My Group decisively rejects the integration of the Western European Union into the Union."
"We want to see a civilian Europe characterised by solidarity."
"We do not want a military union appearing in future, armed to the teeth, as a Euro policeman on the stage of international politics."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group considers the Dehaene report on the institutional implications of enlargement to be unsatisfactory in terms of both its method and the greater part of its conclusions."
"Firstly, its method."
"The Cologne Council, last June, refused to appoint a limited working party to prepare the work of revising the Treaty."
"It did want discussions to be more open from the outset."
"And what did we find?"
"The Commission, piqued at not having been able to control the debate completely, hastened to appoint a limited working party on its own account, which was immediately described as a Committee of Wise Men even though its members are no wiser than most people here today."
"All this in order to attempt to force the Council to retain the conference agenda which the Commission wanted."
"It is not surprising, in such conditions, to see that the Dehaene report, basically, is seeking to strengthen the powers of the Commission and circumvent the rights of the States."
"First of all, by a strange coincidence, this text concludes that, from the very beginning of the Intergovernmental Conference, the Commission will have to submit a complete draft Treaty to the Council."
"It is simply a continuation of the same old method of forcing decisions through."
"In the same spirit, the working party puts forward the old federalist proposal of making qualified majority voting the general rule in the Council."
"This proposal, combined with maintaining the Commission' s monopoly of initiative, would ultimately end, as we know, in a considerable strengthening of the Commission' s powers and a concomitant reduction in the rights of States."
"For that matter, it is quite interesting to note that the system of majority voting is presented in the report, in a fine example of European Newspeak, as, I quote, ""leading to consensus"" , whereas, obviously, the opposite is true."
"Majority rule obliges the minority to give way, especially the smaller States, whereas the requirement for unanimity makes it necessary to negotiate until a consensus is obtained."
"Again, in the same spirit of circumventing State power, the Dehaene report proposes that the Treaty may, in some cases, be modified by a simple Council decision, and even on the basis of a decision taken by qualified majority alone."
"This is absolutely unacceptable, since it stands in absolute contradiction to our concept of a Europe which respects its nations."
"Apart from the usual federalist clichés, the report does, however, tentatively sketch out one new idea, the idea of the institutional flexibility required in an enlarged Europe."
"It acknowledges what we have always said, that the cases of strengthened cooperation outlined by the Treaty of Amsterdam go in no way towards resolving the twofold problem of increasing heterogeneity and the absolute impossibility of giving up sovereign powers in favour of procedures for decision by qualified majority and, what is more, in a Europe comprising thirty or more States."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, is the real subject that must be included on the agenda of the IGC, and a second subject, ""how to restore national control in Europe"" should be added to the first, since it too posits the free exercise of national sovereignty."
"Mr President, the as yet unofficial Dehaene report is on the right track."
"Of course, on reading the report, one notices that it makes no mention of the visions, the goals or the challenges facing Europe on the eve of the 21st century. Nevertheless, it does, at least, give some broad guidelines on a number of institutional issues which must be addressed."
"Despite Commissioner Barnier' s very interesting comments, we have yet to see how many and which of those proposals we shall adopt and what needs to be added for the European Union to prepare itself properly for the future."
"Mr Barnier' s comments about the Commission presenting a text which will be ""global et fort"" are quite significant."
"We, therefore, await the contents of this text."
"In any case, from the European Parliament' s point of view, we must press for the text to include a systematic approach to all aspects of the European Union, so that the new Intergovernmental Conference can address in turn all the issues and problems which concern us at present using the Aristotelian logic that politics is the art of the possible."
"Mr President, I see the report of the Wise Men as being a big step forward and I expressly agree with Commissioner Barnier that comprehensive reform of the European Union must now be implemented and should not be postponed until after the enlargement of the Union."
"That would be disastrous and fatal because what the 15 States cannot settle among themselves, 20 or 25 States most certainly will not be able to."
"Now is the last chance to reform the Union in such a way that it functions properly, is understood by the citizens and is capable of being expanded."
"I am pleased that the Treaties are to be redesigned."
"None of our citizens understands the Treaties of Maastricht or of Amsterdam."
"It is unreasonable to expect any citizen of the Union to read these texts."
"The texts must now successfully be divided up into their genuinely constitutional and their more technical elements."
"This distinction needs to be made, as it is in our Member States' own fundamental laws or constitutions."
"A word about the reform of the institutions."
"The Dehaene Group has concentrated very much upon the reform of the Commission."
"In my view, it is the Council which should be at the centre of the reform."
"The Commission will function on the basis of what is done now."
"Parliament has carried through reforms and is functioning."
"The institution which is not functioning is the Council."
"It is the Council which forms a barrier within the Union."
"In Parliament, we shall therefore also be concentrating on making demands for the reform of the Council. The rules must somehow be laid down for this dual role it has as both a legislative and an executive body, and certainly in a Union of 20 or 25 Member States."
"I hope, Commissioner Barnier, that the Commission can come up with a concrete proposal for altering the Treaty, which we shall then discuss."
"Mr President, Commissioner Barnier, the clear message regarding change which the electorate sent out on 13 June is something which we EU politicians must take very seriously indeed."
"We must act in accordance with this message and work for change."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is one very good opportunity for doing just that."
"There is a lot to be inspired by in the Report of the Wise Men, and we ought to use the Intergovernmental Conference to carry out a proper examination of the Treaties."
"We need to simplify, open up, clarify and review all of the European Union' s tasks and bring about an order in which the EU concentrates on fewer things, that is to say the genuinely cross-border problems."
"The EU' s citizens need a democratic constitution which lists the powers that can be exercised, and in such a way that accountabilities are clear and that the principle of subsidiarity is of proper significance."
"With these ambitions on the eve of the Intergovernmental Conference, I believe that we can succeed in both of the EU' s major tasks: to create a larger Union which functions democratically and to win back some of the confidence our citizens have lost in the European Union, as well as the legitimacy they lent to the enterprise."
"Mr President, for the cool and collected, the year 2000 is of course a year like any other, but it is not only romantics who, at the beginning of a new century, cannot escape a certain magic inspiring them to rise above the daily round of business and approach their own future in a creative spirit."
"I very much regret, Commissioner Barnier, that the preparatory work for the Intergovernmental Conference contains no trace of that turn-of-the-century magic and of an ability to entertain new visions."
"I also regret that, quite unlike the panegyrics delivered in this House, the deliberations of the Committee of Wise Men revealed no such visionary courage either."
"When it came to the whys and wherefores of reforming the European institutions, reference was made to the technocratic concepts of increased efficiency and the ability to act, but not so much as a glance was directed towards the very urgent and necessary matter of establishing a European democracy."
"The Committee of Wise Men wastes not a word of criticism on the second and third pillars of this democratic no-man' s land of intergovernmental cooperation. Nor does it hazard any proposal to include this area among those which are to be subject to democratic reform."
"Nor is any thought wasted on the Intergovernmental Conference as a method, which we now all know is in no position to bring the European idea any closer to fruition."
"Involving Parliament is, in truth, not one of its concerns."
"Nor does the report of the Committee of Wise Men contain a single mention of the social dimension of the European Union, which is a prerequisite of a European democracy."
"On the question of foreign and security policy, the report wastes a lot of time on developing security policy, as well as policies for governments and heads of state, and forgets in the process that security policy is a function of foreign policy."
"Mr President, if the Dehaene Group' s report is to be summarised in the course of one minute, which is what I shall try to do now, it might be said to contain what Swedish supporters of the EU promised would never happen."
"If the Group' s proposals were implemented, the EU would take a decisive step towards being transformed into a State in its own right."
"The remaining right of veto is to be taken away and the influence of small countries reduced; the President of the Commission is to become a sort of Prime Minister in an ever more powerful European Commission, and the EU is to become a military union."
"What is especially negative is the fact that the Group proposes that the Member States' power over changes to the Treaty is to be drastically reduced."
"Where large parts of the present Treaty are concerned, the Group wants it to be possible for changes to be made without these being approved by the Member States' parliaments and without any requirement of unanimity."
"It is a proposal which is directed specifically against the opportunities which Member States and their populations have to wield democratic influence on the EU' s development."
"Mr President, what must the next Intergovernmental Conference do?"
"It must prepare the Union for a Europe of 27 Member States."
"Therefore, the wider the scope of institutional reform, the wider the scope of enlargement will be."
"What must it do?"
"It must maintain the institutional equilibrium, which has allowed the advance of European construction over the last forty years."
"What must it mean?"
"It must not mean new competences for the European Union."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam did this already."
"And neither should it mean changing the nature of the Union."
"In this context, I wish to say that the report carried out by Mr Dehaene is very correct in many areas, but it contains something that worries me very considerably."
"If we consider it in its entirety, Mr Dehaene' s report intends, on the one hand, to extend qualified majority voting and, at the same time, the constitutionalisation of the Treaties and their division into two parts, one subject to a very strict procedure, which requires unanimity for reform, and the other subject to majority voting."
"And to this add making strengthened cooperation more flexible."
"What worries me - I address this to the Commission, which has to carry out a report on it - is that the combination of these three factors - the extension of the qualified majority, the subjecting of legislation to differing types of revisions and making strengthened cooperation more flexible - leads to a Europe à la carte, a Europe where every Member State chooses what it wants to be."
"And I wish to say, Mr President, that that is not the European Union which many of us have fought for and in which many of us believe."
"The Dehaene Group' s plans are, by its own admission, very ambitious, but these plans are only ambitious in relation to the current situation and existing opposition."
"However, the proposals fall short with respect to the requirements of a Union numbering more than thirty Member States."
"If the Union was to have twice as many Member States as it has now, the decision-making process would completely run aground unless drastic changes were to be put forward, and they would have to be far more drastic than those that are now on the table."
"Inevitably, the competences of the Commission, as guardian of common European interests would be extended at the expense of the competences of the national governments represented in the Council."
"This would demand far greater democratic legitimacy on the part of the Commission than is presently the case, and it would be necessary in the long term for all Commissioners to be directly elected."
"Of course our Parliament would also need to be accorded the authority due to it."
"What has a revolutionary ring to it now will soon seem very realistic."
"Mr President, there is one dog that has not yet barked in this debate, and I should just like to draw attention to the radical failure of the Dehaene report to deal adequately - mentioning it only in passing - with the regional aspect of government in Europe."
"Subsidiarity here seems to be a concept which gets lip service but not real action and it certainly needs redefining in the Treaty."
"The autonomous regions and nations internal to the Union states of the European Union, like Spain or the United Kingdom or Belgium, must obtain effective standing in our system."
"Reform in the Council would be one prerequisite."
"It could properly differentiate its executive and legislative roles and in the latter begin to approximate itself to a territorial chamber."
"The Committee of the Regions as at present constituted is both toothless and not in any sense fairly representative."
"Are Members here aware that Luxembourg has six members in the Committee of the Regions and Scotland four?"
"I am not familiar with the differences between east and west Luxembourg but I know a little about the internal differences of Scotland, and the principle of representation as it exists is absurd."
"A committee that was supposed to enable regions and internal nations to counterbalance the states is dominated by the state system."
"New members will arrive here with enlargement in this Parliament, many of them representing former member nations of union states."
"Think of Slovenia, think of Estonia."
"They are small states but their representation will automatically exceed that of the Basque country, that of Flanders, that of Scotland, that of Wales."
"The principles of representation in Europe, as applied to its nations and regions need to be re-examined, and I am very sad that the Dehaene report has said practically nothing about this."
"Mr President, less than one year after the historic success of monetary union, we find the European Union in a strange position."
"It is running and running, but no longer knows where it is running to or how it is going to get there."
"The European currency is not yet in circulation, and yet in Cologne in June there was mention of a European army, and in Tampere in September of a European criminal justice system, a Charter of fundamental rights is being prepared and finally, above all, the Commission is inviting the European Council to accept the prospect of a Europe expanding as far as Asia Minor, up to the western borders of Iraq and Iran."
"This is not just enlargement, it is explosion."
"Some people, including us UDF members within the PPE, are in favour of the new developments in Europe."
"Others among us are doubtful and even hostile."
"But I believe that we are all unanimous in considering that it is time for the political leaders to regain control of the machine and to dare finally to discuss the objective of the geographical dimension and the way forward for political union in Europe, as we did for economic and monetary union in Europe."
"How far is Europe going to go?"
"How far, in terms of geography?"
"This has never been debated either here in Parliament, or in the Council or the Commission."
"How far is Europe going to go, in terms of jurisdiction?"
"A Europe of thirty Member States will no longer be able to operate in the same way as the Europe of twelve Member States."
"On the one hand, it will need a far more efficient decision-making system, one that is of a political and no longer diplomatic order."
"On the other hand, there will be far fewer matters of common interest and there will be much greater demand for decentralisation."
"How far do we want to go?"
"With what partners and by what route?"
"These are the questions which must be answered before giving instructions to the legal experts on matters like ""the future weighting of the vote for the beautiful island of Malta"" ."
"Mr President, beforehand there were rumours circulating that the high level working party was intending to propose an onion skin model for Europe, a sort of system of concentric circles."
"It is a pity that the report contains no 'onions' , as institutional differentiation would seem to be the only realistic solution for a Union that is expanding fast."
"In the future Europe must comprise three institutional circles."
"The outer circle would be the European Council, whose intergovernmental institutions could be utilised better than they are at present by giving them new jobs to do."
"The second circle would be the European Union, which would develop as an association of states in the future."
"This would mean the decentralisation of decision making and would require intergovernmental cooperation to be strengthened."
"This sort of EU association could easily and rapidly expand."
"The inner circle would be the Federation of Europe, made up of an integrated group of EU states that had progressed the furthest: those that belong to NATO and the euro area."
"The EU would thus become an association of states, the core of which would be a federation."
"Mr President, the Dehaene-report unmistakably has the advantage of clarity and testifies to creativity and vigour, to pragmatism and ambition."
"We do not have 101 recipes for making an Intergovernmental Conference' s work rapid and efficient."
"If there is a desire to avoid a new tour de force in legal high technology, an inextricable tangle, then one way or another it will always be necessary to refer back to the substance of this crystal-clear report."
"It does not have to be Mr Dehaene' s swansong."
"But if we fail to embrace the crucial importance of post-Amsterdam Treaty developments then we run the risk of rendering Europe powerless."
"The ball is now in the court of the Member States and the Commission."
"As far as we are concerned, and let this be made very clear, reforming the Union is, in any case, still a conditio sine qua non for enlargement."
"First deepening, and only then enlargement."
"After all, we should say ""no"" to a Europe that is becoming increasingly rich in members but increasingly impoverished in terms of support, efficiency and soul."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage, in view of the restrictions of your agenda, I shall limit myself to a brief comment."
"As regards today' s debate, the rules of the game were clear."
"This debate was of great interest to the Commission but it was also somewhat limited since neither the Commission nor yourselves had yet defined precise positions and proposals."
"It was therefore an exchange of views on the basis of the Dehaene report which President Prodi had intended specifically to initiate and shed light on this debate."
"I have listened to all the speakers, Mr President, with a great deal of attention and I thank them for their attention and for their own contributions."
"We are going to take these questions, these suggestions, and even these occasional criticisms or fears into account in the few days which remain before 10 November."
"This is the day on which the Commission is to establish its initial position on policy, and then we shall have a debate on the Commission' s first policy document."
"After this, we shall again have a great deal of work to do between 10 November and the start of the talks, since the Commission will then have to submit a document which I have myself described as a forceful and comprehensive policy document, designed to be of use to the negotiators and to facilitate the talks."
"During this period we shall have to work in close liaison with the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and with the Parliament."
"I therefore wish, Mr President, by way of conclusion, to thank the European Parliament for this initial exchange of views on the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and on the ambitions we should have in approaching this conference."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place in a few moments."
"Votes"
"Mr President, I am taking the floor to invoke the Rules of Procedure."
"I would just like to confirm that the Radical Members present will not be taking part in the vote this time either."
"This is because, despite the good will of numerous, individual Members - whom I thank - this institution has not found a solution regarding the non-attached Members, a situation which is intolerable from an administrative and financial point of view, but even more so from the point of view of Parliamentary privileges - we have no powers of amendment or resolution."
"Mr President, we have been democratically elected just like you and we represent two and a half million European citizens, and yet, during the last part-session, in order to table an amendment we were forced to beg and sell it to another parliamentary group."
"Frankly, this is intolerable!"
"We are taking this matter to Court and I think that we will win."
"Mr President, a month has already passed and the rapporteur of the amendment has only just been appointed."
"We are quite familiar with the slow machinery of this Parliament, where the average time for a report to come from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to this House is twenty-one months."
"Now, in these coming twenty-one months, we will not be reduced to a button-pressing machine and vote when you allow us to, voting on resolutions which we did not even have the chance of putting to your vote."
"I hope that many Members will hear the call to uphold Members' dignity and privileges and support those who have been elected just like you and who, just like you, want to defend Parliament' s dignity."
"We are against groups and your bureaucracies!"
"We are Members of Parliament and we represent European citizens with the same legitimacy that you represent yours!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I hope we are not going to have our votes delayed every month by a diatribe about the position of the radicals and other non-attached Members."
"The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has now appointed a rapporteur."
"If there was a delay in appointing a rapporteur it is because the representative of the radicals at the meeting of the coordinators to agree a rapporteur asked for it to be postponed."
"It was at their request that it was postponed in the first place."
"It is the height of hypocrisy to come here and accuse the Committee on Constitutional Affairs of taking its time on it."
"Meanwhile, as regards the tabling of amendments you have exactly the same right as every other Member to table amendments with 32 signatures."
"If you cannot even get 32 signatures to support a position then it is not worth wasting the time of plenary voting on that position."
"I now have a list of Members wishing to speak."
"I will give the floor to Mr Madelin in the interests of political balance but I would ask all the other speakers to withdraw so that we can proceed to the vote."
"Mr President, without wishing to prolong the debate further, I believe that one problem has arisen which requires a solution if we are not to face the same problem over and over again."
"Certainly, the operation of a democracy requires rules, but the honour of a democracy lies in the attention it devotes to the protection of its minorities, and I would want us all to have the same rights within this House."
"Thank you, let us now move on to the vote."
"Report (A5-0013/1999) by Mrs Pack, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on a proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 1628/1996 relating to aid for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in particular through the setting-up of the European Agency for Reconstruction (COM(1999) 312 - C5-0062/1999 - 1999/0132(CNS))"
"Mr President, this morning we heard in the debate on Tampere that the Presidency of the Council has finally consented officially to take note of our report and to give serious consideration to the demands contained therein."
"Whatever this means, I take the fact seriously and hope that, as from Friday, the Presidency will enter the general debate so that we might obtain a functioning Agency for Reconstruction in Thessaloniki, together with a Stability Pact, and that our proposals regarding the functioning of the Agency in Kosovo might really be given serious consideration."
"I must now, before the debate, quite sincerely ask the new Commission to take this first opportunity it has had to express its opinion on what Parliament has said on this matter."
"I would ask you, Chris Patten, to take the floor."
"Mr President, I should like, because it is not unimportant, to refer to a linguistic ambiguity in Amendment 1 and simply have this put on record."
"In clause 2, point 16 of the German version, it says: ""Es bedarf keiner gesetzlichen ..."
"Rahmenbedingungen für Signaturen, die ausschließlich in geschlossenen ..."""
"The word ""geschlossenen"" must be taken out."
"This is a printing error."
"In the same way, further on in the same clause it reads ""einer begrenzten Anzahl ..."""
"Instead of ""begrenzt"" , it should read ""bestimmt"" , that is to say ""einer bestimmten Anzahl"" or, in English, ""defined"" ."
"May I also point out that I am asking for Amendment 6 not to be accepted, because otherwise this important directive would not come into force."
"Does the Commission wish to comment?"
"Mr President, we have no problem with any of the amendments."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0029/1999) by Mr Ferri, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on speedometers for two- and three-wheel motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 92/61/EEC on the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (6884/171999 - C5-0029/1999 - 1998/0163(COD))"
"Mr President, without wishing to hold the debate up any more, once again we have had no problems with accepting all of the amendments."
"We did have a problem with amendment 5, but you yourself have just said that it was unacceptable."
"Mr President, I would only like to say that this is a missed opportunity, in my modest opinion, because Amendment No 5 touches on an important aspect of the relations between the Commission and the Council, in particular the issue of commitology."
"The previous legislation has been revoked and therefore we must urgently take positions on the amendment procedures of the various regulations we are adopting, especially on some important and delicate matters, that is, whether the opinion of the Commission or the Council should prevail."
"They have two different points of view, regardless of whether an advisory committee is selected - which we chose - that put more emphasis on the Commission, or a regulatory committee which put more emphasis on the Council."
"I think that we should have been able to vote on this amendment because, especially in a fairly delicate area like road safety, and therefore the protection of citizens, it could have been very useful."
"I would, however, like to urge the Commission - I do not know whether Commissioner Liikanen is present, but, in any case, we have already discussed it in the general debate - to move quickly if it is to present a legislative framework covering all the subjects, so that an issue which is very sensitive from an institutional point of view can be addressed in an organised, thorough way."
"Thank you."
"Amendment No 5 had to be ruled inadmissible because it was not compatible with the rules for second readings."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0028/1999) by Mr Miller, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive relating to cableway installations designed to carry persons (14248/3/1998 - C5-COD 1994/0011)"
"President."
"Would the Commissioner like to comment?"
"Mr President, I can tell you immediately that we approve the amendments."
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Report (A5-0035/1999) by Mr Huhne, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the annual report for 1998 of the European Central Bank (C4-0211/1999)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on Tampere"
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)"
"Madam President, I have been waiting patiently - or even impatiently - for quite a long time now because I wanted to raise this point before the vote on the Ombudsman."
"Could you explain why, when we have a very expensive and sophisticated system of electronic voting, we had to go through - and I choose my words carefully - the organised chaos of the previous vote."
"We have a system here which has three buttons to vote for candidate A or candidate B or abstain; this affords the perfect opportunity for secrecy, and I know we have used it before in similar circumstances."
"It would be less time-consuming and less expensive surely to have used that rather than go through the procedure we have just gone through. Could you explain why that decision was taken."
"Whilst I am on my feet, Madam President, I would like to refer back to earlier this morning when you were in the chair."
"You will be aware - because I noticed a distinctly presidential frown - that a Member' s mobile phone went off during the speech of, I think it was, the Prime Minister of Finland."
"This was a gross discourtesy to the Prime Minister of Finland, and I felt the discourtesy was exacerbated by the fact that the Member then proceeded to answer the phone and continue with the conversation."
"What action can we take to eliminate this in future?"
"Thirdly, as I am on my feet and I have your ear, can you do anything about the fact that the some of the huissiers at the entrance are smoking on duty."
"I think it gives an extraordinarily poor impression of this Parliament."
"Mr President, on behalf of our group I just wanted to explain why we voted against the report."
"The European group of liberals and democrats always felt that the Agency for Reconstruction in Kosovo should be based in Pristina and only in Pristina and should not, in some way or other, be linked with or part of, or work in tandem with, some other agency in Thessaloniki."
"We believe that this is the only logical position and it is also the only position that is in the interests of the Kosovars themselves."
"In view of the fact that the original text from the Commission is very clear in this respect and Mrs Pack' s amendment adding the Thessaloniki aspect is superfluous, our group has opted to vote against the report."
"What I do want to make clear is that our group does support this Parliament' s position when it comes to improving the efficiency of the agency' s management and the procedures, and of course when it comes to making the agency subject to OLAF' s supervision; indeed how could it be otherwise for I penned these amendments myself."
"Consequently, we are particularly pleased that the Commission is to adopt many of these amendments."
"The specific answers that Mr Patten has just given this Parliament are, however, in stark contrast with the overwhelming silence on the part of the Council."
"The Council has systematically refused to enter into constructive dialogue with this Parliament about the content of the report. We consider this attitude unacceptable and, as far as that is concerned, we are particularly keen to support the position adopted by Mrs Pack, who endeavoured to delay this report up until the very last moment."
"I would just like to clearly point out - sadly the Council is not present - that Parliament will, of course, have the last word on this matter under the terms of Budget 2000."
"To sum up, Madam President, as a group we were faced with what was in fact a difficult dilemma in that we had to decide whether to vote for a report that went some of the way towards accommodating our concerns but not on that one essential point, namely Pristina."
"That is why we opted for clarity and consistency at the end of the day and voted against the report."
"Palacio Vallelersundi Report (A5-0037/1999)"
"- (DE) The position of the non-attached Members on the content of the first two decisions of Parliament regarding the Statute for Members has not changed."
"In order, however, to put an end to the present inactivity on this issue, we have - against the background of recent negotiations with the Council - agreed to the confirmation of these decisions."
"The Members of the PvdA (labour party) Euro-delegation have voted for an amendment that procedurally establishes the resolutions of the European Parliament of 3 December 1998 and 5 May 1999, the subject of which is the statute for the Members of Parliament."
"The PvdA delegation does not consider this vote to be a reflection of how it views the content of the resolutions of 3 December 1998 and 5 May 1999."
"It regards the vote as no more than a procedural affair that is a necessary to allow the negotiations with the Council to proceed on the statute for the Members of Parliament that has yet to come into force."
"It is important for the amendment to convey explicitly Parliament' s willingness to negotiate with the Council in order to obtain its approval for a statute for the Members of Parliament."
"This will entail a willingness on the part of the European Parliament to reach compromises with the Council."
"The PvdA delegation and others in the European Parliament have worked hard in the past to cultivate this willingness to compromise on the part of the European Parliament and will continue to do so."
"Finally, the PvdA delegation remains committed to the idea of a new statute for the Members of the European Parliament coming into force around the turn of the year."
"I voted for the PSE amendment to paragraph 2 in the vote."
"In approving this amendment we are opening the door to resuming discussions with the Council on the future statute for the Members of the European Parliament, in the hope that this statute will at last be brought in with all possible speed."
"As far as I am concerned, this vote in no way signifies approbation of the resolution of 5 May 1999 on the Statute for Members."
"I still believe that with this draft statute the majority of the Members of Parliament failed to give the voters a clear signal that they want to renounce the excessive privileges and remuneration entitlements."
"That is why, on 5 May last, I voted against the aforementioned resolution together with my socialist party colleagues in the PSE group of this Parliament."
"The SP will also continue to be a zealous advocate in the new European Parliament of a fair and just statute with a transparent remuneration system on the basis of costs incurred, and is therefore also able to identify with the proposals that the Council has drawn up on this matter."
"The socialist party believes that this statute should be approved as quickly as possible."
"It must form the basis for far-reaching reforms within the European Parliament so that our institution too is in a position to win back the trust of the citizens of the European Union."
"The demands we make of the Council and the Commission we must also be prepared to ask of ourselves."
"Recommendation for second reading of the Lechner report (A5-0034/1999)"
"It is not the first time and certainly not the last time that I am making a statement regarding the stakes related to the development of electronic commerce services."
"Indeed I think that, while one should be delighted that trade is facilitated by developments in information technology, it is nonetheless necessary to remain as vigilant as possible and ensure that there is a fair balance between the interests of the service providers and consumer protection."
"We must take new data into consideration: electronic communications and transactions are becoming more developed and more widespread."
"Sectorial products and services are generating a rapidly expanding world market. Its growth is expected to exceed 100% by the year 2001."
"This means that regulations to control this new market must be adopted as quickly as possible."
"Indeed, while it is generating new possibilities for firms of all sorts to make profits, it is, at the same time, creating a certain lack of security for consumers."
"It is therefore imperative to perfect standards for security and for the legal recognition of electronic signatures and authentication services (authentication of the origin and integrity of data)."
"This is what the directive we are discussing today proposes."
"At the time of the first reading, the European Parliament proposed several amendments."
"We were pleased to note that many of them were adopted in the common position."
"This must also apply to the amendments proposed today."
"This directive must form an initial step in the development of a European framework in the field of electronic commerce, while bearing in mind that we cannot afford to wait long before having worldwide discussions on this subject."
"With the proposal for a directive, the commercial use of electronic signatures takes a step forward, but there is still a long way to go."
"The basic problems of electronic signatures, such as how reliable and flexible the system is, and clarifying how responsibilities relate to one another, call for more development work in the future also."
"Many states and organisations over recent years have developed digital signature systems and rules on them."
"In addition to the EU draft directive, the International Chamber of Commerce and the OECD have made recommendations on this issue."
"An important recommendation has been made on an organisation to promote global electronic commerce, Global Information Infrastructure."
"In my opinion, as we develop a European frame of reference for electronic signatures, the European Union must also constantly work on the international level, so that the legal framework of the system can be strengthened."
"It would be to the European Union' s benefit to establish an international organisation."
"The development of cooperation must not, however, lead to an increase in regulation."
"Systems of protection must be allowed to develop freely and become as effective as possible with the help of market forces, and they must at the same time ensure that the confidence of consumers in the opportunities presented by electronic signatures remains firm."
"There is no doubt that electronic commerce is going to be one of the boom areas of the future, providing consumers feel that they can use the system with confidence."
"Two problems are presently holding back the development of e-commerce: the difficulty in verifying the identity of users and consumers and the uncertainty surrounding the extent to which on-line transactions are legally binding."
"I welcome the fact that the proposed Directive gives legal force to digital signatures (provided they are authenticated) and so gives them the same legal force as documents signed in ink."
"Increased security for e-commerce in the EU should boost consumer confidence and help the citizens of the EU to benefit from this area of activity with greater peace of mind and security."
"I wholeheartedly welcome this sensible step to tackle one of the key problems hindering the potential boom in e-commerce across Europe, namely the difficulty in verifying the identity of users and consumers."
"This latest EU initiative, complementing others at the national level, will help create the right regulatory framework enabling European businesses to be at the cutting edge in developing electronic commercial services."
"In short, this e-commerce initiative makes A grade business sense."
"British business is already at the forefront in realising the potential of e-commerce in Europe."
"More than 13 million people now have Internet access in Britain and revenue from e-commerce is expected to top GBP 10 billion next year."
"The Labour Government is likewise at the forefront in creating the right environment for e-commerce to thrive."
"We are introducing a bill, hailed as a model across Europe, to modernise contract law to take account of e-commerce."
"We are improving educational standards, encouraging life-long learning and striving to ensure that our schools are on-line."
"Indeed, by 2002 we will have connected every school in Britain to the Internet."
"We will also be opening a network of IT learning centres, or 'e-libr@ries' , right across the country."
"The great towns and cities of my own region, the North West of England, were built on the back of an earlier great economic revolution, the Industrial Revolution."
"What iron was to the 19th century, information technology will be to the 21st."
"And, just as the railways were the communications network that drove the Industrial Revolution, so the Internet will drive the new Knowledge Revolution."
"I want the north-west to regain its position at the forefront of technological progress."
"Through such far-sighted yet practical policies, I believe we can release the natural industriousness and imagination of the people of the north-west and once more turn the region into a powerhouse of economic prosperity for Britain, Europe and the world."
"Recommendation for second reading of the Miller report (A5-0028/1999)"
"Huhne report (A5-0035/1999)"
"I voted against the European Parliament resolution on the 1998 annual report of the European Central Bank (ECB), since it approves this report, which itself is aligned with the prospect of transition to a completely unified European monetary system."
"Indeed, like the economists of the Association for the Monetary Independence of France (Association pour l'indépendance monétaire de la France), I think that this is not a desirable objective, and that on 1 January 2002 it will be necessary to retain national currencies alongside the euro which will serve as a common currency."
"Moreover, the European Parliament resolution discusses at length the technical measures to improve the transparency of the ECB."
"This is an apparently laudable objective, but one that is impossible to achieve."
"The European Parliament has indeed just proved this by getting into an imbroglio which it has not been able to get out of."
"Actually, the initial text of the resolution required that the way that the various members of the Governing Council had voted should be made public following each decision on monetary policy."
"Mr Duisenberg, the president of the ECB, asserted that he did not agree with this idea, for all sorts of reasons, each one worse than the last."
"In particular, he stated that making voting public would be an incentive to exert undue pressure on the members of the Governing Council."
"Professor Buiter, a member of the Bank of England' s monetary policy committee, rightly replied that if the votes were to remain secret then this pressure would be applied in secret, and that would be even worse."
"The European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs eventually withdrew the relevant section of the draft resolution so as not to get into trouble with Mr Duisenberg, and the European Parliament has just backed up this withdrawal."
"The matter is more serious than it first appears."
"In the first place, it demonstrates the timidity, nay subservience, of the European Parliament in its supervisory capacity."
"In the second place, it must be recalled that open voting is accepted in all great central banks throughout the world, particularly in the United States and Japan."
"Why should the European Central Bank be the exception to the rule?"
"Why should it play the card of less transparency?"
"The answer is simple."
"The central banks which I have just mentioned all work within a single nation, while the European Central Bank works with several different nations and several different peoples."
"By virtue of these differing circumstances, it is far more afraid than the other banks that particular Member States may exploit its internal conflicts."
"And to stave off this danger, it is forced to be that much less transparent."
"So, it' s all connected."
"Because it has jurisdiction over an area that is too diverse, the European Central Bank must distance itself even further from social reality."
"In so doing, in the short term it may calm things down on this or that vote, but in the long term it is ultimately condemning itself by cutting itself off from the peoples of Europe."
"Understandably, in these conditions, I cannot give my approval to either the European Parliament resolution or the annual report of the ECB for 1998."
"As a former member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I read attentively the first annual report of the European Bank whose work I try to monitor closely."
"This is the reason why I cannot but approve the action of the rapporteur in deploring the lack of transparency in the ECB."
"Some progress has certainly been achieved, but this falls a long way short in comparison to the information made available by other central banks."
"Considering its high degree of autonomy, it is essential for the ECB to ensure a high level of transparency regarding decision-making on monetary policy."
"This would provide a guarantee of its credibility."
"I find it deplorable, for example, that Mr Duisenberg is opposed to the publication of detailed minutes of meetings, even though this is common practice in many central banks."
"I support the proposal of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs requesting that brief reports of the meetings of the Governing Council should be made available to the EP, outlining the arguments ""for"" or ""against"" the decisions taken and the reasons for these decisions."
"I think it essential, furthermore, that, in order to promote effective collaboration between the ECB and the EP, the ECB President should be willing to brief Parliament regarding any significant decision on monetary policy."
"I shall also insist on one requirement which the EP expressed with regard to the ECB."
"The Bank must endeavour to consider monetary policy in terms of sustainable growth and employment."
"The objective of price stability is not an end in itself; monetary policy must contribute to growth and the creation of jobs."
"I am taking advantage of this opportunity to express my views on the ECB to mention a problem which I feel strongly about, and which I have had to denounce on several occasions, the bank charges which some banks add to euro transactions."
"These problems are far from being resolved and they are still affecting European citizens within the euro area."
"An initiative must be taken as quickly as possible to put an end to these practices which have been denounced on many occasions by the European Parliament and the European Commission."
"The European Central Bank, in spite of having a financial role in European policies and the economy, operates independently of the Council, of the European Parliament and of national parliaments, which is unacceptable."
"Regrettably, this is an example of the lack of democratic control on the part of these institutions."
"By taking the fulfilment of the Stability Pact and of the respective criteria for nominal convergence as a basis, and making price stability the main priority, the ECB' s monetary guidelines come to be crucial for national and European policies in a huge variety of economic and social areas, including in the Financial Perspective of the European Union and of the Member States."
"Thus it is vital that the ECB finds another means of intervention, that there is effective democratic control over the way it operates, that priority is given in European policies to resolving the economic and social problems of the European Union and of its Member States, giving particular prominence to the policies of growth and job creation."
"That is the reasoning behind my vote."
"I welcome this first annual report by the Governor of the European Central Bank, Mr Duisenberg."
"He has earned our praise for the successful establishment of the ECB and the smooth introduction of the euro."
"To MEPs such as myself, the ECB' s annual and monthly publications have proved to be invaluable and of a consistently high standard."
"I regret, however, that the ECB does not follow the high standards of transparency and openness set by the Bank of England."
"The Bank of England was granted operational independence in May 1997 in one of the first acts of the incoming Labour Government."
"Minutes of meetings of its Monetary Policy Committee, including voting records and reasoning, are now published after about six weeks."
"This boosts market confidence in its decisions and is a great example of open government."
"It can surely be no coincidence that, since the Labour Government' s brave decision in May 1997, Britain has enjoyed a previously unknown period of economic stability and been praised by the OECD."
"It can also be no coincidence that the Labour Government' s decision was criticised at the time by the boom-and-bust Conservatives, who have a record second to none when it comes to economic instability and incompetence."
"I would like to see the ECB follow a policy of openness and transparency similar to the Bank of England."
"Such openness should include the publication of minutes of its Governing Council with the reasoning behind decisions taken, particularly over interest rates."
"It would be perverse for Britain to go from a position of transparency to one of relative secrecy."
"Therefore, if Britain is ever going to embrace the euro, the ECB must also embrace greater openness."
"European Council at Tampere on 15 and 16 October"
"Madame President, the Tampere Council which has just taken place, dedicated to the so-called European area ""of freedom, security and justice"" , did make a few good technical decisions to strengthen cooperation in the fight against crime and in favour of judicial coordination, for example by means of the wider use of mutual recognition of legal judgements in civil and criminal law, as you yourself, Madam President, indeed recommended in your introductory speech."
"More generally however, particularly when it dealt with the subject of immigration, the Council became bogged down in two contradictions which indeed both suggest either its lack of political courage or the mutual paralysis of its members, it is not very clear which."
"The first contradiction: whereas, in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the means were proudly established to make immigration matters totally Community-controlled, the Tampere Council suddenly becomes more cautious."
"It is as if the heads of state and government, who are always willing, in treaties, to sign up to great European principles that do not commit you to anything, were suddenly appalled at the practical consequences of this new text."
"The difference in tone is so marked that it is hard to believe that these same people signed both the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere conclusions with an interval of six months."
"The contradiction becomes frankly laughable in the case of the French Government which, in the Amsterdam Treaty, signed in favour of the financial and physical distribution of refugees among the states of the Union, and which now recoils at the consequences of its own signature."
"The second contradiction: the Tampere Council propounds its purely formal intention to control the flows of migrants and to combat illegal immigration at source, but, at the same time, staunchly proclaims, on several occasions, that legal immigrants must be given, I quote, ""a set of uniform rights which are as near as possible to those enjoyed by EU citizens"" , and that as a priority a policy of integration must be set up to enable them to stay."
"This is absurd."
"Obviously, the more rights you give legal immigrants, the more immigrants you are going to attract, including illegal immigrants hoping that their situation will one day be regularised."
"How much more time will it take for the Council and the Commission to see, in this matter too, the catastrophic practical consequences of the principles they publicly maintain?"
"Madam President, thank you and thank you to the services who, I realise, I am delaying from enjoying their lunch."
"I want to emphasise my support for a European police training college and for increasing the competences for Europol provided, of course, there is full democratic control over their activities."
"I have talked to the public a lot about this subject and I find that they would welcome a much greater ability to act against international crime and organised crime which increasingly crosses our frontiers."
"There are over 100 separate police forces in the European Union, over 50 in my own Member State."
"Their separateness weakens their ability to deal with increasing and unquantified amounts of crime across Europe."
"So I predict the need for a capability for our police to operate across frontiers is going to become increasingly obvious and increasingly urgent."
"The Tampere special Summit, whilst focusing on immigration and asylum policy for the first time, also seriously raised the issue of trafficking in humans which has been steadily growing over the past five years."
"No European city is without refugees, primarily women, who have been illegally trafficked for the purpose of prostitution."
"The Parliament resolution does not make reference to this, but I would like to put on record that concurrent to trafficking in adults, there is growing trafficking in children for prostitution and paedophile activities."
"It is disgraceful that the affluent West has now added trade in human flesh to its consumer excesses."
"The main objective of the Tampere European Council was to provide continuity and to plan the establishment of the ""area of freedom, security and justice"" which was laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, with the intention of seeking greater coordination or even common policies in the areas of immigration, asylum and visa policy."
"In our opinion, this, and taking into account the importance of the area of public freedoms, justice and security, demands that the Council' s unanimous decision-making procedure be assured, with respect to the sovereignty of Member States."
"This Area, which has come to the fore in line with progress in dismantling the EU' s so-called ""internal borders"" and with the strengthening of its ""external borders"" , must not transform the EU into a fortress."
"In spite of the concern to establish principles relating to respect for rights, freedoms and guarantees in this particularly sensitive area, and that measures leading to cooperation are necessary, for example in the fight against organised crime and money-laundering, the traffic in drugs and weapons and the trade in human beings, it is worth highlighting the fact that we will have to be particularly attentive to the coherence and the implications of the policies and measures that are actually adopted."
"I have voted for amendment 2 from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance because I consider that citizens of third countries resident within the EU ought to have the same rights as EU citizens when it comes to freedom of movement."
"However, I am not a supporter of a common EU policy on the issuing of passports. Instead, I consider that each EU country should be able freely to exercise control over its own policy in this area."
"I sincerely hope that the Tampere Summit marked a step away from Fortress Europe, as claimed by the EU Presidency."
"The confirmation of the Geneva Refugee Convention ""in its full and wide interpretation"" is an important victory for the Greens and many non-governmental organisations."
"I regret, however, that for most asylum-seekers, the only way to get into the Union is still an illegal one."
"The new approach towards combating illegal immigration in the countries of origin bears a risk, since the cooperation could lead to a sort of repression."
"The Union must tackle the problem at its roots to truly improve human rights and economic conditions of people living in those countries."
"Our Group welcomes the increased efforts to fight money-laundering and trafficking of human beings."
"But we insist that increased powers for Europol must be accompanied by equally increased democratic safeguards at Union level to ensure respect for civil rights. This includes control by the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice."
"The Greens think that the status of third-country nationals needs to be further improved beyond the Tampere proposals."
"Fair treatment includes not just the right of access to social services or education, but also the right to vote and free movement in the EU."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights must include new and binding rights for EU citizens if it is not to become a mere political declaration."
"Mr President, most of my constituents were probably not aware that an important meeting of EU Governments took place in Tampere last week on justice and home affairs."
"This is probably because the agreements reached make such common sense and are of such obvious benefit to ordinary Britons that not even the extremist Europhobic Tories could find anything to complain and make a fuss about."
"EU Governments agreed to create a common area of justice to tackle the common problem of organised crime, especially drug smuggling and human trafficking."
"There will now be greater cross-border police cooperation, including - at Britain' s suggestion - a new Police Chiefs' Task Force and a European police college."
"There will also be greater cross-border judicial cooperation, including mutual recognition of court decisions in all EU countries."
"Fast track extradition will be introduced, which may even help bring ex-dictators to justice."
"In addition, measures were agreed at Tampere to make it easier for ordinary people to travel, live and work across Europe."
"Long-term British residents from non-EU countries, from the Commonwealth for example, will now receive guaranteed equal access to education, health care and other benefits on the Continent."
"Furthermore, Britons facing legal difficulties abroad will now have easier access to justice, including access to legal aid and translation services and simplified procedures governing compensation and debt claims."
"Among other measures, Governments also agreed common rules on providing refuge to those in need of political asylum and to draw up a Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Charter will, for the first time, set out all the fundamental rights enjoyed by EU citizens on one piece of paper."
"A milestone instrument, it will complement the European Convention on Human Rights now being incorporated by the Labour Government into UK law."
"With all these measures, I will no longer be stuck for advice when constituents, facing legal problems abroad, call me asking for help."
"Britons will now have the same statutory rights on the Continent as all other EU citizens."
"For so long relegated to second class under the Tories, Britons are now first class citizens under Labour."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)"
"Announcement of the result of the election of the Ombudsman"
"I shall now announce the result of the ballot for the election of the Ombudsman, as agreed."
"A total of 557 members voted. There were 32 blank or spoiled ballot papers."
"The number of votes cast was 525. The absolute majority is 263 votes."
"The votes cast were as follows:"
"Mr Anastassopoulos: 256 votes"
"Mr Söderman: 269 votes"
"Mr Söderman obtained the absolute majority of the votes cast and is thus elected Ombudsman."
"May I congratulate him on his election, and wish him every success in the performance of his mandate."
"(Loud applause)"
"Restructuring of firms"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Michelin case has once again brought the key issue of the restructuring of industry to the fore."
"We are living in a time of radical changes to industry and to companies in general - changes which have come about for a number of reasons, the main one being the complex phenomenon of globalisation."
"The deregulation of the capital markets, the abolition of economic borders, changes in various models as a result of high technology and the information society and global competition are all factors which often precipitate drastic changes and restructuring in industrial production."
"What is certain is that this restructuring can be predicted and effected in many ways."
"The Michelin profit figures, together with the announcement that it is to shed 7,500 jobs over the next three years, has created considerable disquiet with which I sympathise."
"This disquiet does not relate solely to this particular company, but to what is happening and what will happen from now on in all small and large businesses in Europe."
"It would be quite realistic of me to say that no restructuring can be a smooth operation without its problems."
"However, restructuring can either be ""intelligent"" , in other words, it can take account of the social and economic cost, or it can be short-sighted by taking account of the economic cost today and paying the social cost at a much later date. Any company which fails to take account of the social dimension will have to suffer the negative consequences."
"Our goal is most certainly ""intelligent restructuring"" and there are three distinctive factors which many companies already take into account. In the past, we have witnessed cases throughout the European Union which adopted both methods of restructuring."
"Intelligent restructuring consists primarily of a plan to address the issue of the employability of the persons concerned."
"Clearly, this is both a right and an obligation of the company itself."
"Companies should draw up strategic plans which, first and foremost, address the issue of the employability of the persons concerned."
"Secondly, there is no excuse for failing to give adequate notice to employees, for not giving them detailed information and for not consulting them on alternative forms of restructuring which could be just as effective but at a lower social cost."
"The institutional framework to date in the European Union has consisted of two directives: the Directive on collective redundancies and the European Works Council Directive."
"These two directives constitute a minimal framework of specifications within which a company wishing to restructure can operate."
"As regards today' s discussion, there has been no proof to date that the company in question has contravened any of the rules."
"We have plenty of time ahead of us to monitor its next moves."
"It is, however, quite clear, and so it appears in today' s case, that with the changes that are taking place around us, the way in which we deal with these changes will also need to be changed."
"In other words, existing rules may well need to be improved and amended or new rules may be needed."
"That is why, in November 1998, the European Commission submitted a directive on information and consultation of workers."
"This directive has, to date, been endorsed by Parliament, and I believe that today' s discussion on Michelin will spur us into further action in support of this directive."
"However, what is certain is that, at present, legislation alone or this particular piece of legislation cannot address the major problem of the restructuring of industry when European industry can only compete within its own borders. European industry must engage in and be able to successfully withstand global competition."
"In previous cases, such as that of Renault, the Commission had entrusted experts to approach the issue of restructuring from the job losses perspective."
"The Gillenhammer report, which is well-known to Parliament, contains relevant proposals which we could follow."
"The first is that of the Observatory."
"In January, we will have the final proposal for the Observatory, which I would like to discuss with Parliament in order to decide whether or not there should be an Observatory for small and medium-sized businesses to keep them informed of imminent changes. It will be connected at national level to the local Observatories so that firms are better equipped to deal with changing times."
"My next point concerns social dialogue."
"Social partners bear the responsibility for social dialogue and they could initiate special action plans within the context of the social responsibility incumbent upon all of us."
"The first action is to address the employability of workers. This is not only a matter of national policy; it also concerns the workers and the company itself."
"Companies are responsible for maintaining the employability of their workers and workers are responsible for participating in continuing training and for updating and developing their abilities and skills."
"Negotiations between companies and workers on lifelong learning mechanisms is one of the most serious issues of social dialogue."
"At the beginning of November, I shall be having my first official meeting with the European social partners and one of the key issues under discussion will be precisely this."
"Finally, and again I am borrowing ideas and proposals from the Gillenhammer report, I intend to send a letter to every company in Europe with over 1,000 employees, asking them to draft a voluntary report entitled ""managing change"" ; this kind of benchmarking between these large companies will help us to make provision for restructuring without creating acute or major social problems."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I feel it is important to touch on a number of measures which have been taken so far at European Union level in connection with the restructuring of firms."
"I would like to mention very briefly the decision taken just a few days ago to implement the draft on risk capital and high risk capital investments approved by the Commission last week; this will be a very important tool, particularly for small businesses."
"Measures include promoting cross-border innovation, promoting the mobility of wage-earners by transferring their rights and pensions, special training programmes and, of course, the exceptionally high amount, in the order of EUR 24 billion over the next 7 years, to be channelled to Objective 3 via the Structural Funds, to which all the countries belong."
"Objective 3, the Structural Funds programmes and, of course the employment strategy can be used to structure national and associated policies at European level on employability, entrepreneurship and the adaptability of firms and workers."
"We have before us today a special case which is not a model worth following."
"This is a special case whereby there have been two announcements made by the same company; one announcing mass redundancies and the other announcing huge profits."
"Quite clearly, the European Union will and, in fact, must make every effort at every level to support free competition and create a free and healthy competitive area in which European companies can operate."
"It is also clear that Europe must primarily support what it has been proud of for centuries - the European social model."
"There must be no victims in the restructuring and modernisation of firms."
"As I said earlier, restructuring is not a smooth operation but it can be both foreseen and managed, and true, it may indeed cost us provisionally but there must be no victims."
"I believe that the proposals on a legislative level, and more importantly proposals resulting from the cooperation between the social partners are a good starting point from which to address these pressing issues of our time."
"Mr President, we are talking about restructuring today."
"I want to start by offering the Commissioner my sincere congratulations."
"I believe that today is the first time she has been involved in a debate on social affairs."
"I think that we will see a lot more of her here on a variety of different occasions."
"But this particular debate is in fact bringing out something that is fairly essential in all debates on social and employment affairs, namely restructuring and globalisation"
"I think that it is a good thing in itself that we should discuss this subject again in this new Parliament."
"It is clear that restructuring is taking place on a continuous basis."
"That is sometimes forgotten."
"People tend only to consider restructuring if there are job losses."
"Of course jobs are often created as well but much less is said about that."
"This debate has taken something of a strange course."
"That is why I would just like to make a comment about a resolution that is evidently still in circulation and is still in my name."
"It is a resolution that was submitted in connection with the original subject of the debate: the Michelin affair."
"The Presidents decided not to include this subject in today' s agenda but to talk about restructuring in general."
"I believe that was a very sensible decision on the part of the Bureau."
"But my first resolution had to do with the original subject and that is why the PPE has replaced this resolution with the Menrad resolution, which has therefore become the official PPE resolution."
"Ultimately we also succeeded in producing a compromise resolution, which replaces a number of group resolutions."
"The only point, and we must not beat about the bush here of course, is that it was the Michelin affair that gave rise to this debate."
"I do not intend to talk about this a great deal myself."
"I believe that it is not the place of Parliament to involve itself in decisions concerning individual companies."
"My group is firmly convinced of this; all the more so since there has been no mention of government funding in this concrete decision and the decision is also being dealt with in its entirety on the territory of the Republic of France."
"The French government, which as we all know, consists of socialists, greens and communists, has not intervened in this affair."
"It would therefore be extraordinarily odd if we were the ones to do so."
"That is another reason for not getting involved here."
"But our fundamental position is that as a general rule we ought not to do so, particularly now that we have a European Works Council whose responsibility it is to solve these types of problem."
"I would like to add that consultation and information are things that can make it much easier to resolve restructuring problems."
"Far and away the largest section of my group is absolutely convinced of this."
"This was also evident from the figures."
"It is much easier to solve problems if there has been extensive consultation."
"The Commissioner said the same."
"But if there is an instrument, and the European Community is fortunate enough to have such an instrument, then surely it makes no sense at all to start talking about each specific case at European level."
"We must leave that to the consultation system within the company concerned."
"Even if a national government feels that it has to intervene, that is a matter for that particular national government."
"It is certainly not for the European Parliament to raise this but that does not alter the fact that a debate of this kind always has its place of course."
"Lastly, I have a brief question for the Commissioner."
"I have not heard government assistance mentioned."
"That has always been something that has played an important part in debates on restructuring, as in the case of the Hoover debate amongst others."
"Might the Commissioner be prepared to say something more on this issue?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, as the representative of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I wish to begin my contribution to this debate on the restructuring of firms by repeating the message of the Michelin employees, a message which I understood to consist of a thrice-repeated ""no"" , whatever Mr Pronk might say."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, in a balanced and prosperous Europe, it is no longer acceptable to have a firm announce a 17% increase in profits while at the same time making 7,500 employees redundant."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a moral situation where the share price of this firm can increase by 12% following this announcement, thus creating added value for shareholders without creating any sort of additional wealth, quite the contrary."
"No, ladies and gentlemen, employees can no longer be content with the incomplete and twisted, if not actually false, information issued by the Michelin bosses in attempting to justify their decision."
"By the way, this new and serious scandal which shook the media and the political milieu in France, demonstrates, if proof were needed, the urgent need for strong and appropriate action in Europe to finally reconcile economic performance and social guarantees, growth and employment, freedom to do business and the defence of wages."
"The European Socialists are demanding such measures and this is why they have drawn up, among other things, a number of proposals."
"Firstly, a direct link between public aid and agreements, including a reduction of working hours, with financial penalties for firms which do not respect their commitments even though they may have received public monies."
"The Socialists are also asking for a report on the application of the European Directive on collective redundancies, to be accompanied by proposals for improvements intended just to make it effective in defending jobs and employees."
"The European Socialists are insistent, finally, that the European Directive on the establishment of a European Works Council should be reviewed, so that employees can receive proper information, in the normal course of things and at the right time, and so that there can be real consultation, which presupposes that employees are given adequate resources in terms of time and independent experts."
"Without these minimum measures and some others, accompanied by concrete measures against the relocation of firms within the European Union and other measures against social dumping outside the Union, the European social model, so dear to some of our politicians, including those on the right wing, will never be anything but empty words, and this will contribute to exacerbating the anti-European feeling pervading our countries and many employees."
"As is often said, progress is worth nothing unless it is shared, and for us this means that, in a world of constant change, we should stop placing the main burden of effort and sacrifice on employees in order then to let the most wealthy and most powerful be the first to benefit from the positive results of this effort and sacrifice."
"It is more than time for action at Council and Commission level, and I would even go so far as to say, in conclusion, that this is of course a matter on which the consistency of our societies, industrial peace, the very survival of the European ideal, but also, of course, the interests of enterprise as a whole and thus of the soundness of the European economy, depend."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in view of the fact that the market is becoming ever more global in character, it is more important than ever for companies to optimise their competitiveness."
"For this reason it is sometimes inevitable that companies will have to reorganise or introduce painful measures such as transferring or replacing employees, or if the worst comes to the worst, making them redundant."
"As my group sees it, neither the European Parliament nor the European Commission have the authority to intervene in the operational management of European companies."
"Companies ought to be free to take management decisions which will lead to growth and thus to more jobs being created."
"That is what Europe needs."
"It goes without saying that my group believes that the restructuring of companies must take place following thorough and timely consultation with the works council."
"The right of employees to consultation and information as laid down in various European directives should be respected."
"In addition we should also see to it that measures taken at national and European level improve the economic climate in Europe."
"After all, inappropriate social or economic commitments for companies lead to more unemployment instead of more jobs"
"Finally, I would like to say, Mr President, that a number of companies in France have also reached the conclusion that there is a need for reorganisation."
"Better late than never because all companies must be primed for the 21st century."
"That will be good for Europe and will guarantee jobs in the long term."
"Commissioner, Mr President, the Commissioner' s statement was more concerned with SMEs than with the concerns of the Michelin employees represented here."
"I was born in Clermont Ferrand and live there still, Michelin' s birthplace and headquarters, and it is for this reason, amongst others, that they have been my guests here on several occasions."
"The concomitant announcements of the axing of 7,500 jobs, the enormous increase in its profits, and the closure of the Wolbert-Michelin factory at Soissons, described as a PR mistake by the company' s directors, show to what extent cynicism and lack of respect are the driving forces behind this multinational' s industrial strategy."
"Other identical examples are still fresh in our memory, Renault Vilvorde, the French banking system and the large distribution companies, and let us not forget Daewoo."
"All these companies who implement redundancy plans year after year have benefited from European and national subsidies without at any time being held accountable for the way in which they use those funds."
"I think that our institution is duty-bound to be involved with the concerns of millions of Europeans who live in unemployment or in the fear of becoming unemployed."
"We must therefore be firm and clear on three points. We must work out whether the allocation of sums to large companies will result, above all else, in guaranteeing the permanence of jobs."
"On the eve of the opening of the WTO negotiations, we must remind everyone that any business strategy, including that of multinationals, must take the human figures into account, in the same way as the economic and financial figures, so that millions of European employees may keep their jobs and their dignity."
"Finally, at a time when a European-wide Michelin works committee has just come into being, Community legislation must be amended so that employees, or their representatives, who are concerned at the plans for collective redundancy on economic grounds can take their case to the competent local court, without waiting for the redundancy to be announced, and challenge the grounds for the decision."
"This is the thinking behind the resolution that we are proposing and it is only if these conditions are met that Europe will maintain its political role whilst facilitating the truly sustainable economic development of businesses and protecting the rights of employees who are, let us never forget, the Union' s lifeblood."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted that we have been able to hold this debate in the European Parliament on the tidal wave of company restructuring that we are witnessing and the massive job losses that accompany it."
"My Group had expressed its desire to do so at the time of the ""Michelin"" affair."
"In other words, and this has just been reiterated, the simultaneous announcement made by the management of this huge company to financial analysts of achieving substantial profits on the one hand, and the decision to shed 7,500 jobs in Europe on the other."
"Although this initiative was immediately welcomed by the stock exchange, where its share value immediately rose, it also caused great indignation in large sectors of public opinion, particularly in France but also in other countries, as I have seen myself."
"To some extent, the cynicism of the ""Michelin"" method has had the effect of increasing tenfold the phenomenon of rejection which this modern capitalist strategy is itself bringing about, the strategy known as ""share-holder value"" , the creation of value for the shareholder which consists of subordinating everything, especially employment costs which in their eyes are intolerable, to the bulimic demands of the shareholders who finance business."
"Michelin is unfortunately far from being the exception in this area."
"Its provocative announcement fits into the context of a veritable gangrene which we cannot allow to develop without reacting to it, unless we ourselves renounce any control over economic and social development and, as a result, the ambition to promote a European Social Model in the midst of globalisation."
"The same applies to Olivetti which, having found the capital necessary for its lucrative take-over bid for Telecom Italia, arranged to shed 13,000 jobs. The same applies to Alcatel which, in order to regain the confidence of its financial shareholders, at the same time announced a net profit of FRF 15 billion, that is EUR 2.3 billion, and 12,000 job losses."
"The same thing applies to the banking sector where the arrival of the euro gave a veritable boost to the mergers and acquisitions which eat up jobs and which shifted the emphasis of banking towards financial and even speculative activities. The sad record is held by Renault which is gratifying its shareholders with its swingeing job cuts at Nissan even if it means exporting the most horrendous image of Europe to Japan whilst, as an indirect result, shedding several thousand jobs within the European Union itself."
"But what can we do?"
"Governments have some responsibility in this area, particularly in the reform of the laws on so-called ""economic"" redundancies."
"In no case should a flourishing business shed staff, let alone make employees redundant."
"Then there is the responsibility of the European Union."
"In January last year, our Parliament amended the Directive on informing and consulting workers."
"We are still waiting for the Commission to adopt these amendments."
"But I think that today we must go further."
"To give some examples, a six-month delay for any restructuring plan should be imposed on businesses in order to allow an independent assessment by the unions."
"If the company has received public funds, as has already been said, including European funds, non-compliance with the rules as laid down should entail the funds being paid back."
"By the same token, in the Directive on European works councils, the role of these councils as well as the protection of the staff delegates should be appreciably strengthened."
"It is therefore up to the Commission to submit two revised proposals for a directive to us as quickly as possible."
"Finally, on the eve of the opening of the WTO negotiations, I want to stress the need for Europe to state its political desires, including those related to industrial policy, focusing on ""employment, wealth creation and regional development"" ."
"In the face of new technologies and the information revolution, there is room for a new concept of productivity, based not on the rationing of social expenditure but on the promotion of human abilities."
"Contrary to the current tendency to deregulate everything, the European Union can, if it wants, provide itself with instruments which will allow it to promote just such a policy, from the taxation of speculative transactions to the establishment of selective credit which will stimulate job creation and discourage mass redundancies."
"For its part, my Group will be addressing the main European trade union organisations in order to exchange views and, if needs be, initiate a European petition which will allow our fellow citizens to weigh up the forthcoming decisions."
"There has been a Vilvorde effect, the scope of which everyone remembers but which has not been reflected in new rules."
"We hope that the Michelin effect will instead result in concrete changes."
"I think that this is the standard against which our fellow citizens, faced with the kind of restructuring we are debating today, will judge the real extent of our solidarity."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Diamantopoulou for her speech."
"For my Group, the Union for a Europe of Nations, the context of this matter is rather delicate because there is the danger, on the one hand, of setting the premises for restricted competition and, on the other hand, limiting the actions of the Member States in this field, and this conflicts with the principle of subsidiarity."
"So a real principle that would justify the Union' s intervention here is the possibility of social discomfort that the restructuring of firms could cause within the Community and within the Member States as a whole. It is, moreover, a principle which is already provided for by the Treaty of Rome of 1957."
"And this is to prevent future Union policies intended to increase cohesion and social integration being rendered, even only partly, useless."
"Given the hope that the Union will have a joint economic policy and, possibly, a joint industrial policy, in our opinion it seems appropriate in the meantime for the Union to give its opinion, especially on those restructurings which the Member States have been or are involved in, financially or otherwise."
"Moreover, we must stress the requirement for the Union to subject its interventions in this area to more stringent control and some checking mechanisms, both as regards the involvement with - and in any case, the information given to - trade union representatives, and also as regards the actual positive results - not just economic but also social results - of the interventions themselves."
"Union aid to firms has not always resulted in stable growth in the firms or protection of their employment levels."
"In these cases, we have to ask for a broad sanction to be implemented until the amounts committed by the Union itself have been completely reimbursed."
"This principle must also be applied in the event that aid is given to a non-Community firm, when it is considered that a cooperation agreement with the firm' s country - if one does not already exist - might not only better formulate and integrate the Union' s interventions regarding that country, but in this desirable event it could facilitate the implementation of the above-mentioned sanction."
"Mr President, the arrogant and rabble-rousing European political class has found the ideal scapegoat to carry the blame for its own base economic behaviour."
"Those on the left who are today denouncing the redundancies at Michelin have given massive approval to the ultraliberal economic policies of the European Union, as defined in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties."
"You actively support globalisation but you scream at the top of your voices when European companies try to adapt to the damaging regulations that you yourselves laid down, as well as to the economic environment that you are imposing on them."
"Have the courage then, to face up to reality."
"The Michelin employees are not the victims of the Michelin management, they are the your victims, created by you, the merchants of globalisation, in the same way that employees in the banking sector, in the insurance sector, in the car industry and so many others whose companies merge, relocate or restructure just to survive are also your victims."
"Your globalised economy means the globalisation of unemployment and it will ensure that society as a whole goes backwards."
"Socialist or Liberal governments and the European Commission, also under the sway of the dogma of globalisation, are jointly responsible for this situation."
"They have constantly deceived and manipulated the workers of Europe."
"They are capitulating at the height of the campaign, before the negotiations of the Millennium Round even open, refusing to fight effectively against social dumping, refusing to force through a necessary social clause and abandoning the principle of Community preference."
"So, in favouring the free circulation of capital throughout the world, in seeking to liberalise investments even further, European governments are transforming Anglo-Saxon pension funds into the real masters of the economic and financial markets."
"Tomorrow, these stateless multinationals will be the uncontrolled masters of the economy, but also of the new world order that you pray for."
"The only possible policy for the full employment of the European workforce is to win back the internal market, to protect it against unfair competition, to reject this criminal and antisocial globalisation, and to re-establish the necessary rule of Community preference."
"In short, it is to produce European, in Europe, with Europeans."
"Mr President, right at the outset I would like to say to Mr Helmer and others that people on this side of the House are not in the business of shackling or hampering the decision-making capabilities of businesses."
"What we would like to do is to encourage them to look after their investors."
"But when I talk about investors I am not just talking about shareholders."
"I also mean the thousand of workers in companies like Michelin who invested their time, energy, knowledge, skills, their hopes and aspirations, and those of their families, in the company they have worked for for many years."
"I mean the investment of the communities that underpin and sustain them."
"I mean, as well, all of us here and out there in the rest of the European Union as taxpayers."
"Public money, directly or indirectly, is involved in these enterprises; regional, national and European money and, as Mr Nobilia said a short while ago, it should not come without strings attached."
"A good company will look after its workforce."
"It will work in partnership with its workforce and it will encourage involvement, partnership and innovation."
"A good company will not treat its workforce or the community housing it as factors of production to be disposed of lightly in a global game of profit and loss."
"We in this House have become accustomed to the idea of externalities in environmental policy, with the bill for the costs of dirty practices being picked up not by the enterprise in question, but by society more broadly."
"Perhaps we need to think in similar terms when it comes to the social responsibilities of enterprises like Michelin."
"Otherwise the danger is that the main burden will only be upon the shareholders."
"We clearly have an imbalance within the European Union."
"On the one hand, considerable freedom for companies to restructure and move but very few rights for the workers involved."
"Even where we have rights in European legislation, rights for example to be consulted well in advance about decisions on collective redundancies or other major changes affecting livelihoods, the law is not being properly observed or applied."
"We need to revisit that."
"We have a number of outstanding issues to tackle at European level."
"We need to review and improve the law on individual and collective dismissals and on works councils."
"We need a general framework on information and consultation and we also need a review of the law on transfers, mergers and take-overs - not involved here but in the banking and insurance sector for example."
"The 12% rise in the share value of Michelin in the days following the announcement shows what a cynical and deliberate manipulation of the stock market was involved here."
"I find that totally reprehensible and I hope all right-thinking people in this House will feel the same."
"Finally, on a point of order, genuinely a point of order."
"Mr President, I would draw this to your attention."
"I signed a resolution, a compromise text, along with others, two days ago."
"That resolution contained in the final paragraph a reference to Michelin."
"The resolution which has now been circulated to be voted upon tomorrow no longer contains that reference."
"Someone in the sessional services has removed it without any reference back to those of us who signed it."
"That is a very serious matter indeed and I hope you will investigate it fully and report back to this House."
"Thank you very much, Mr Hughes."
"I will be very happy to look into what has happened and we will inform you accordingly."
"Mr President, we will be very interested in the conclusions of the enquiry that you are going to lead because we are also signatories to this resolution and we made the same observations."
"What we have all been saying for a while is that, in fact, the goal being pursued by a growing number of companies who are restructuring is to provide their shareholders with more and more guarantees, and to ensure ever greater profitability for their financial investments."
"That is why the management of the Michelin Group simultaneously announced the axing of 7,500 jobs and fantastic profits."
"That is why, as you pointed out, announcements of redundancy plans are always followed by a rise in the share prices of the companies concerned."
"This violent expression of scorn for employees and their lives fundamentally contradicts our stated objectives in favour of employment, social and regional cohesion, and the European Social Model."
"What do you expect the employees who are being made redundant from the Wolbert-Michelin factory at Soissons to think of these objectives and our determination to take them forward?"
"The social desperation that these decisions generate is inevitably transformed into political desperation and this political desperation is a permanent threat to democracy."
"That is why the European Union must make its actions match its words and must uphold its commitments to employment and to the right to live in dignity."
"How can it do so now, at the moment, when it is confronted with the brutal, unilateral decisions of huge companies?"
"First of all, the European Union must unequivocally condemn this type of decision and support the employees concerned."
"No, Mr Pronk, huge companies do not have the authority of divine right for their decisions."
"It is the responsibility of politicians to intervene and to say what they think of these decisions."
"The European Union must also acknowledge the end of a magical formula that all the European Institutions keep trotting out, according to which growth plus competition would necessarily equal employment and development."
"This is wrong and has been proved to be so!"
"We will have to draw conclusions from such a statement, in order to bring ourselves to reconsider the foundations of our European employment strategy and of our economic guidelines."
"We must provide for increasing the power of employees and their representatives in order to strengthen their right to contest the basis for the economic reasons behind their redundancy, which we shall call the Wolbert-Michelin amendment and which we shall submit for your vote tomorrow."
"It is not acceptable for the definition and the management of the general interest to be hijacked by the economic decision-makers."
"Neither by bowing down to shareholders nor by injecting authoritarian nationalist populism..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I share many of your views, but my obligation is to obey the Rules of Procedure and the timetable."
"You will understand this."
"Even those of us on the left must obey the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, I must use this debate to protest at the scandalous decision by Michelin to go ahead with 7,500 redundancies when it is experiencing increased profits."
"I am of course equally disgusted by the plans for lay-offs by Renault-Nissan, by Alsthom, by Rhône-Poulenc, Hoechst Marion Roussel and many other companies."
"What they have in common is the fact that they are all making considerable profits and are nevertheless sacking workers, or making them redundant, the consequences of which are almost as serious, for every job axed means one more unemployed person."
"Companies behaving in this way, their customers and their major shareholders are the people mainly responsible for the seriousness of unemployment and for the physical, and even moral poverty that this creates."
"We think that redundancies by all companies who are making profits should be prohibited, subject to requisition."
"Favouring the enrichment of a handful of major shareholders whilst forcing tens of thousands of men and women into unemployment and into poverty is a criminal attitude, and I choose my words carefully."
"Company profits are the result of the work of all its employees; those profits should be used to maintain existing jobs as a matter of priority, and to create new ones, by sharing out the work without reducing wages."
"Mr President, we are all aware that redundancies involve human tragedies, and it is perhaps a good thing that the European governments, which draw their inspiration from the European social model, are taking greater responsibility for these."
"However, today' s debate has become absurd, given that we are talking about restructuring firms and what should be acceptable profits and what should not, in the great liberal Europe."
"I think that, if many of the opinions we have heard today were to prevail, we would be building a Europe of poverty and unemployment and not a Europe of employment and wealth."
"What is the point in saying that Michelin' s profits have increased by 17%, without saying whether that is more or less than the profits of Bridgestone, Goodyear or other competitors, and without saying that Michelin is a company with a turnover of 106 dollars per employee, as compared to Goodyear' s 141 dollars per employee. Then there is Renault, in which if I am not mistaken, the French Government is a major shareholder, that went to Japan, bought a company there - Nissan - but to keep it open found itself forced to make 21,000 workers redundant, but as they are Japanese, do we really care?"
"I think that, instead, we should bring into question the European social model which is the social model of the Europe of unemployment and taxes, the Europe where trade unions have enormous power, stifle economic growth and prevent millions of unemployed Italians, French and Germans and millions of immigrants finding work, in order to protect situations which are often nothing more than situations of privilege."
"Yesterday, Parliament asked President Duisenberg to subordinate monetary policy to the need for growth in a Europe which does not know how to reform itself, how to reform its economies or to liberalise the markets, especially the job market."
"If this is the Europe we are building, we are hypocrites because we are building a Europe where unemployment will reign and companies will close."
"But when there are no more firms, maybe there will not even be any tears left to shed."
"Mr President, the European Union must have a competitive industry, one that creates wealth and thus jobs."
"This means that within the Union, we must arrive at a real coordination of fiscal policies and at a definition of comparable social norms for everyone, so that we no longer experience the distortions of competition that are still too marked today."
"This also means that we must prepare our companies to support globalisation and to adapt to it."
"We might wish that this globalisation did not exist, but it does."
"It is up to us to manage it in such a way that its negative aspects can be avoided."
"In this context, we find ourselves facing the difficult problem of relocation."
"The problem is difficult because obviously it eliminates jobs in Europe, difficult because the people vilifying relocations today are the same people who are, at the same time, demanding that Europe should multiply its investment in developing countries and should make it as easy as possible for products made in those countries to enter European Union territory."
"As far as the Michelin affair is concerned, since everyone is talking about it, despite our all saying that it is not the subject under discussion, on the day the Michelin redundancies were announced, Pirelli was doing the same thing, on just the same scale, but nobody is talking about that."
"Michelin today consists of 82 production plants, 48 of which are in Europe."
"I would be very interested to know how many car manufacturers, including those in public ownership, or tyre manufacturers, including those in semi-public ownership, still have such a major presence in Europe today and have not already quietly relocated, sometimes with the assistance of governments, including left-wing governments."
"Today, we should tell it like it is."
"Michelin has, it is true, reduced the number of its jobs by 25,000 in twenty years but, I would like to remind some people, these are 25,000 job losses due to levels of productivity which are comparable in all sectors of industry, and particularly in the car and tyre industries."
"These are 25,000 job losses, only 186 of which have been redundancies."
"So for goodness' sake, let us stop trying to find scapegoats for the way industry or restructuring is evolving."
"People are telling us to just look at the profits being made on the stock markets. Well, excuse me."
"Do look at the profits made on the stock market, but look at all the profits for all businesses for last year or the last two years, and let me remind Mr Wurtz that he, or rather his friends, are members of a government which does nothing to stop profits being made on the stock market."
"Mr President, we are here once again - this is not the first time, unfortunately - to discuss a very serious problem: the redundancies of thousands of workers due to the unilateral choices of a firm."
"And the Michelin case, which I do not want to talk about in detail because other speakers have already done so, gives us the opportunity for this debate."
"In many Member States - as recent history reminds us - there have been cases of restructuring: indeed, history is full of cases of restructuring, relocations and firm closures - Mr Wurtz reminded us of some - which not only reduce employment, but jeopardise the economic and social cohesion of affected areas, create a climate of social insecurity among workers and create a climate which certainly does not encourage development and growth."
"The requirement for greater competitiveness of firms, especially in the era of globalisation of the economy must, however, be able to combine the necessary flexibility within companies with the security of workers."
"These processes, these phenomena which are becoming increasingly more frequent, must be regulated using the instruments available and these must be improved."
"Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whom I would like to thank for the clarity of her statement, spoke of intelligent restructuring."
"The existing instruments for prevention and management of the phenomena must be used both at national and European level, because job losses, Mr Pronk, concern Europe."
"They do not only concern individual countries, but all of us."
"In particular, the case we are discussing today should give the Commission the chance to pledge today, before the European Parliament, that it will make an assessment, a revision of the Directive on redundancies and the closure of companies to make it more effective in terms of protecting jobs."
"Moreover, we need to speed up the re-examination of the Works Council Directive, strengthening information processes and consultation in particular but, I would add, we must also include in that directive the fundamental issue of sanctions."
"Rules must be obeyed, and those who do not obey them must pay the price."
"Mr President, I am pleased that this debate is taking place here today because the Parliament must be permanently attentive to the citizen' s needs and be the pioneer in the construction of Europe and, in order to fulfil this double objective, the development of the European social dimension seems fundamental."
"The resolution which were are now debating is a mixture of styles, of individual contributions, whose result is an extraordinarily unequal combination."
"But some of the reflections, especially those expressed by Mr Pronk, seem to me to be particularly important."
"But, allow me to say that those of us who believe that only competitive companies can create employment, and that only by creating employment can the European social model be preserved, have emerged the winners."
"And those who believe, by means of public intervention, in a type of arbitrary inventiveness, have emerged the losers."
"But, having said that, those of us who believe in the market and belong to this side of the Hemicycle, far from the autarchic temptations of some parts of this Assembly, believe that the principle of social compensation must counter-balance the principle of a functioning market."
"Therefore, I am especially pleased that our resolution opts for social dialogue as a method for resolving conflicts."
"I am also pleased that it opts to implement the Social Charter, the Social Protocol, by means of specific measures."
"I am also glad that it refers to the need to review this fiscal set-up, which tempts companies to relocate to areas where there is a more favourable tax system."
"And finally, I am happy that employment should be a fundamental principle, a principle which underpins all policies, especially with regard to public aid."
"However, to those on the other side of the House, I would say that those people who tried to throw the textile machines into the rivers of Manchester, in order to save jobs, were wrong because we live in an era which is infinitely better than the one which they wanted to preserve."
"Mr President, I believe that the gentleman who spoke before me is right about one point."
"If it were in fact the case that the market could regulate itself, then we should not today be speaking about Michelin."
"It is also a spectacular mistake, Mr Pronk, to believe that this is not an issue for this House."
"We spoke here a number of years ago about Renault, too, and also quite rightly."
"7,500 jobs are being destroyed, and that is an especially negative record for a company to set here."
"Secondly, we must talk about this matter here because employees in Europe expect us, the European Union, to direct the process of globalisation and to regulate necessary modernisation and companies' adjustments to the market in intelligent ways, that is to say in ways which take the social contract into account."
"The European Union has a number of directives for doing this which, however, are being applied all too cautiously here."
"It seems to me to be symptomatic of Michelin' s policy as a company that it is only at the end of this year that it has established a European Works Committee."
"There will be further economic changes in the EU but, for us Social Democrats, it should go without saying that employees and their unions are to be included in this process, that they are to be informed of developments in good time and that their proposals are to be examined seriously."
"If, Commissioner, you will be sharpening the tools available to the EU, we shall most certainly support you and accompany you in the process."
"I should like to express my thanks to those of Michelin' s employees who are here today."
"I should also like to have seen that kind of commitment from the owners."
"A rise in profits for the first six months of over 17% is really excellent, but these profits ought to be invested by the companies in new products, new environmentally friendly production methods and, above all, in employee training too."
"That would be a contribution to social peace, and the share markets would then have every good reason to see an increase in value."
"Mr President, with regard to the restructuring of companies we have been referring to, I would emphasise the statement made in the four Groups' joint motion for a resolution which has been mentioned."
"Global players in Europe have no choice other than to lay themselves open to competition in world markets."
"In the opinion of the Group of the European People' s Party, instances of rejection on social grounds are simply to be avoided."
"None of this is a completely new phenomenon."
"When I first entered Parliament ten years ago, I was approached by works committees from a cable fibre factory in my constituency."
"Their company had just been taken over by a large group in France."
"The employees were hoping first of all to have more secure jobs now."
"More by chance than by anything else, they learned that the distant head office of the French concern wanted to close the factory it had taken over within three months."
"It is when sore points like this come up that the Directive on European Works Councils comes in."
"This has been predominantly successful."
"We should also let it be known here, as a success story and positive message, that 600 new European Works Councils have been created in the last couple of years."
"It is still often the case, though, that not enough information is provided soon enough."
"An amendment to the Directive would definitely be appropriate here, Commissioner."
"Finally, we must also insist that all companies and groups fulfil their now legally accepted duties to offer information and consultation and that there must be consequences if they do not do so."
"I close with the observation by the Christian Democrat Minister of Labour under whose chairmanship the Directive on European Works Councils was adopted."
"Lack of information results in uncertainty, mistrust and, in the end, only anxiety."
"Information and consultation mean transparency, which creates trust and does away with losses due to friction in European companies."
"Employers and employees are then winners in equal parts."
"Mr President, Commissioner, by this stage of the debate many things have been said."
"This allows us to take up some of the ideas again by way of a conclusion."
"This resolution on restructuring in industry has arisen today because one company, Michelin, decided to make 7,500 people redundant."
"Of course the situation is tragic, but it is interesting to note today that we are able to talk about restructuring in industry not from a purely economic point of view, but raising the human issues that it involves."
"I think that it is quite right to link this resolution to Michelin' s situation."
"To axe 7,500 jobs today, when neither a company' s financial or industrial output allow us to attribute these redundancies to some kind of crisis, is quite unacceptable from the legal point of view alone."
"From the human point of view, this situation is not only unacceptable; it is indecent and immoral."
"The fact that a simple PR exercise allows a company' s share value to rise by 12% whilst no extra value has been created, no extra tyre has been manufactured or sold, giving the impression that huge sums of money could simply appear spontaneously as a result of the financial markets alone, shows utter contempt for human labour."
"While shareholders are selling their stock and making a gain, men and women are finding out that they will be the only ones to suffer from the situation."
"This is the heavy price that European employees must pay so that a few investors can maximise their return."
"In the measures that have been proposed, Commissioner, you talked about social costs and the way we should take them into account in the long term."
"It is obviously essential, as a matter of urgency, that this measure is complemented by strengthening the directives on collective redundancies and European Company statutes."
"It is also essential to envisage new forms of social redistribution, financed by the shareholders of prosperous companies that make employees redundant with the sole aim of increasing the price of their shares."
"Finally we are waiting for an explanation which will enable us to find out if we will be able to vote on this compromise resolution, omitting the word Michelin."
"In any case, this debate has clearly shown the political division in this House which does not disappear even in supposedly ""compromise"" resolutions."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to express my real and genuine sympathy to all those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own as a result of corporate restructuring."
"I say that with real feeling and authority because I have been in that position myself."
"I have been unemployed and it is no fun."
"But the best way to promote job security is for companies to be successful."
"The best way for companies to be successful is for them to be competitive in the global market."
"To disagree with some people opposite, it may not look good in the newspapers but the best time - indeed the only time - to make restructuring plans is when you are strong."
"If you wait until you are weak, you have to take much greater action and lay off more people."
"That is very much a fact of life."
"Companies clearly have many responsibilities but their primary responsibility is to survive as an employer and to take the necessary steps in order to do that - and I do not believe it is for us in this House to lecture them on the best way to do it or to comment upon whether that restructuring is ""intelligent"" or not."
"Rather it is for us and indeed for governments to see what we can do to help, as far as is possible, avoid the problem in the first place."
"That means looking to see where we can reduce the burden of unnecessary regulation which adds costs to business and to see how far we can reduce the non-wage costs on business which, in turn, encourage companies to shed labour as the best way of saving large sums of money."
"That is the real issue which we should be debating today."
"Finally I would say that all too often government intervention can get in the way and make companies less competitive."
"We must make sure for the credibility of this House that we do not fall into the same trap."
"Mr President, Commissioner, competitiveness is theme number 1 in Europe."
"Every company, every entrepreneur, is of course out principally to create a monopoly."
"The entrepreneur himself or company itself would like to have a monopoly."
"Suppliers and customers are naturally opposed to this so that, here too, there is pressure in the direction of a market economy."
"I believe - and this is what makes it so interesting - that the market economy is there in the first place for the benefit of the consumer and therefore stands in the way of monopolists."
"The consumer creates jobs through his decision to purchase products and services which are of use to him."
"I believe that this triangle of success we have, with the company on the one side with its owners and shareholders, the employees on the second side and the consumers on the third side just has to be successful."
"Everyone must gain some advantage."
"We must see to it that there is a win-win situation here and that everyone benefits when products and services are offered which are bought by consumers."
"What we need as a priority here is a development initiative."
"We must ensure that we see electronic commerce and many other technologies introduced quickly and efficiently."
"We need a dramatically strengthened and improved infrastructure."
"In very many areas in this regard, we are still limping along behind."
"Finally, research too."
"We are discussing minimum amounts for research here. Having new and efficient products, however, is precisely what the consumer values."
"This is where we also need a new culture at European level. In the European social partnership - and here I should like to support Hans-Peter Martin - we need new emphases which permit a win-win situation arising for all three types of participant: namely for companies, employees and consumers."
"In Europe too, then, we shall have the chance to live in prosperity in the future."
"If today we consider the enlargement of the European Union, then prosperity is one of the central and most important questions in connection with enlargement as well."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner to ensure that, where the European budget too is concerned, we have a situation in which more money is put into budget lines which promote jobs."
"First of all, I would like to comment on the issue raised, i.e. whether we are actually discussing the case of one company in particular and whether or not we are, in fact, justified in doing so."
"Quite clearly, the Michelin issue is an issue which is at the heart of the preoccupations of the European Union at this time; that is, the issue of competitiveness on the one hand and social cohesion on the other."
"Comparisons have been made with other countries and other continents by way of example."
"I believe that we have a lot to learn from the United States of America on the issue of monetary policy and on the issue of the use of high technology and the fast functions at that level. However, there is, of course, a significant difference in Europe: the cultural, social and historical model of Europe is based on stringent social forces and on the balance between society and the economy."
"It was said that Europe will have to create an environment for our companies."
"However, we should also have a corresponding environment for our citizens and the two must be created at the same time."
"It is clear from the extremely productive debate which has ensued that this preoccupation applies to both sides."
"The means may differ but it is clear that both sides have the same preoccupation."
"Can the European Union intervene?"
"I think the answer must be ""yes"" because the market does not operate according to natural laws, it is not a natural phenomenon."
"It calls for intervention by the political powers."
"And we, the European Parliament and the Commission, form part of the political powers of Europe."
"At the European Union level, therefore, there should be three levels of intervention."
"The first level is in the area of legislation and institutional intervention."
"There have already been proposals from the European Parliament on the two directives you mentioned, the Directive on the European Works Council and the Directive on collective redundancies."
"The initial assessment of these two directives shows that they work well, but at present amendments tabled by Parliament are being processed and in January 2000 we will be able to begin discussions on these two directives."
"The second directive, concerning information and consultation of workers, has, as you are aware, already been tabled for discussion at the Council of Ministers."
"I believe that it would not be wise at this stage, since we are working on promoting the directive, to begin amending it."
"It is, however, certain that this will be one of the areas in which the European Parliament will be playing a pivotal role."
"Again in the area of institutional and legislative intervention, interesting proposals have been made to shift the tax burden away from labour costs, away from the taxation of workers, and on to environmental factors and the directives on employment have provided an initial incentive to move in this direction."
"I consider that at this level, we can, within a general framework of either broad economic guidelines or broad employment guidelines, learn a lot at national level, i.e. we could have a form of benchmarking, an exchange of information and successful models already in place at national levels to address this major problem of restructuring which faces us on all levels."
"Banking was mentioned, and this is one of the problems which will face us, but of course, Europe has vast experience and a history of restructuring, beginning with the textile factories and shipyards, through to the industries of today."
"The second level is that of institutional operations."
"I would like to refer here to social dialogue, an issue which a number of MEPs have already raised."
"Please allow me to refer to an extract from the recent document by UNICE, the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe."
"The document concerns the issue of liberating the workforce of Europe and includes the opinions of companies on European social policy beyond 2000."
"It states that European companies regard themselves as an integral part of society which means that they operate in a socially responsible way. It mentions that European companies view profit as their main goal, but not their sole reason for existing and they prefer to take a long-term approach to strategic decisions and investments."
"In addition, they are prepared to accept their responsibilities and one of the main challenges which they face is the complexity of the demands made on them by the various social factors (workers, consumers, capital investors, public authorities, environmentalists and other interest groups)."
"Therefore, when one side of industry - the side faced with global competition and which, we all agree, should be supported and protected since we have a strong interest in European companies being able to compete at a global level - begins to voice its concerns over society and maintaining social equilibrium, we have a very strong argument for developing and supporting social dialogue."
"Please allow me to make one political remark: these positions are based neither on charitable perceptions nor on socialist ideas."
"They are based on the completely realistic assessment that, without social cohesion in Europe, which is an area of powerful social forces, social conflict will arise. In turn, this social conflict will have negative repercussions on economic stability, i.e. the environment which competition and companies need in order to develop."
"Enhancing social dialogue is, in my view, of fundamental importance."
"Yesterday saw the beginning of the technical element of the first form of macroeconomic dialogue in Europe."
"The political element of this dialogue will begin on 8 November and for the first time social partners expressing their social concerns on the issue of employment, banks outlining their monetary policy, and the Member States, which are the political forces in Europe, will sit at the same table."
"Supporting and promoting social dialogue is not only essential but it is also a prerequisite on a more microeconomic level for every form of restructuring within firms."
"This brings me onto my third issue: actions and policies."
"At a European level, we have, and for the first time this is being enforced, a European Employment strategy, with 22 directives which have been incorporated into the Member States' employment plans. As I mentioned earlier, substantial funding is also available."
"These broad guidelines and the funding of many of these policies include a lot of the proposals we have heard here, such as special tax relief for workers and for small and medium-sized businesses, financial assistance for the education or further education of those workers facing either redundancy or restructuring, social packages to support the social network in cases of major restructuring, continuing training and providing workers with new skills and qualifications so that they can respond to restructuring."
"Naturally, at a time when changes are taking place at such alarming rates, enough can never be done."
"Plans drawn up yesterday will never suffice for today."
"I would like to mention the issue of state aid and how we can combine state aid with company profits."
"History shows us that companies cannot operate under laws which prescribe employee numbers or profit margins."
"But the political forces can clearly intervene in how those profits are invested and in how much is invested in high technology, the environment or in manpower in ways which were mentioned earlier."
"Such guidelines can be imposed and can be adhered to."
"Therefore, at a time of such rapid change, there will have to be scope for modification and reorientation of these guidelines on a daily basis."
"There has already been exceptional cooperation and exchanges of views at this level within Europe."
"I would like to assure you that constant communication between the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Works Councils will steadily pilot the Commission towards further and, as far as possible, more flexible and fundamental intervention in this area."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your intervention and your closing words concerning dialogue with the Parliament."
"I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2), to conclude the present statement."
"I have taken a careful note of Mr Hughes' intervention and we will ascertain whether any paragraphs have disappeared from the motion for a resolution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m."
"Nuclear testing"
"The next item is the statements by the Commission and the Council on the failure by the US Senate to ratify the treaty imposing a wholesale ban on nuclear testing."
"Mr Sasi has the floor on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, the European Union has pushed for the speediest possible implementation of the Test Ban Treaty."
"All EU countries, whose ratification is needed to bring the treaty into force, have complied - including France and Great Britain, which have nuclear weapons."
"The EU believes that the CTBT is an important step in the promotion of non-proliferation and the decommissioning of weapons, and its entry into force will be to the benefit of all countries."
"This being the case, the European Union deplores the decision taken on 13 October in the American Senate not to ratify the Test Ban Treaty."
"The decision reflects badly on the multilateral attempts that have been made to promote non-proliferation and decommissioning."
"The disappointment felt as a result of the decision was expressed, while it was still fresh in everybody' s mind, in the statement presented by the country to hold the presidency of the European Union on 13 October."
"There was also a resolution on the banning of nuclear testing passed at the Tampere Summit."
"We have also emphasised European Union support for the Test Ban Treaty in political dialogue between the EU and the United States."
"In assessing the significance of what has happened, we should point out that President Clinton still assures us that he is doing his best to have the United States ratify the Treaty as soon as possible."
"President Clinton has stated that the United States will, in the future, refrain from carrying out nuclear test explosions."
"International credibility regarding the nuclear test ban is strong."
"There is a long history of trying to ban nuclear testing, stretching back to the 1950s."
"As a result of hard negotiations, a general session of the United Nations approved the Test Ban Treaty in September 1996."
"155 countries have now signed the treaty and 51 have ratified it."
"Of the 44 countries that use nuclear technology, and whose ratification is, under Article XIV of the treaty, a condition of the entry into force of the Test Ban Treaty, in all 26 have ratified it."
"A strong international reaction to the nuclear test explosions carried out by India and Pakistan last year showed that nuclear testing - no matter who is responsible - will meet with clear global condemnation."
"In July 1999 the European Union adopted a common position, whose purpose it was to strengthen EU cooperation in international efforts to bring the CTBT into force."
"On the basis of the common position, the EU actively participated in the conference held this year on 6 - 8 October in Vienna according to Article XIV of the treaty."
"In addition, the EU has been involved in bilateral discussions to promote the entry into force of the treaty with all those countries that have not yet signed or ratified it, but whose ratification is vital for the treaty to come into force."
"These efforts to promote the treaty' s entry into force must continue, with the relevant objectives very much in mind."
"The EU is appealing to all countries, and especially those, and this includes the United States, whose ratification is a condition of the treaty coming into force, to become associated with the treaty as soon as possible."
"The European Union considers the Non-Proliferation Treaty to be a major tool of international security that offers a set of global frameworks for the promotion of both non-proliferation and the decommissioning of weapons."
"The Test Ban Treaty supports this system of non-proliferation."
"The European Union is preparing to play a constructive role in the study conference with regard to the Non-Proliferation Treaty to be held in April - May of the year 2000."
"The Test Ban Treaty is unique in nature."
"It prevents all nuclear tests in whatever place, including so-called peaceful nuclear explosions, which were the subject of a heated theoretical debate when the Non-Proliferation Treaty came into being in the 1960s."
"Compliance with the Test Ban Treaty will be monitored by means of a comprehensive system of verification, whose main element is a worldwide monitoring system consisting of 321 technical survey stations."
"The verification system also contains legal provisions that enables on-the-spot checks to be carried out when there is reason to suspect that there has been a breach of the treaty."
"The verification system is effective and makes it possible to check that the treaty is being complied with to a highly reliable degree."
"The system will support the maintenance of relationships built on trust among the parties to the treaty."
"Members of the European Parliament, the European Union will play an active part in the preparatory work being done in Vienna to create an organisation for the implementation of the treaty and a verification system for it."
"The Union supports the efforts on the part of the CTBTO Preparations Commission to establish a verification system in good time and with the degree of efficiency the treaty requires."
"The Commission shares the disappointment that has just been expressed by the presidency of the Council that the United States Senate rejected ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
"The Treaty, as honourable Members will know, is the result of decades of hard work, decades of determined work to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, starting with the Non-Proliferation Treaty in the late 1960s."
"It constitutes a key element in the international strategy to control, reduce and ultimately to eliminate the risk of nuclear conflict."
"Its ratification by the present nuclear powers is essential for our efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries."
"The European Union, as the presidency has pointed out, has been and remains fully committed to these objectives."
"We have worked hard for the earliest possible entry into force of the Treaty."
"All 15 Member States, bar one, have already ratified the Treaty and work is under way in the 15th state to complete the procedures there."
"I know that the American administration shares our objectives."
"President Clinton and his team worked hard to obtain Congressional approval for ratification of the Treaty."
"They understood, as well as we do, how important it is for us to take the lead together in order to obtain the 44 ratifications which are necessary for the entry into force of the Treaty."
"It is therefore all the more regrettable that the Senate voted against ratification."
"They seem to have done so for internal American reasons as much as on the basis of any assessment of the value of this Treaty for United States' and international security."
"I believe - and this is reflected in the motion put before us today - that they made a very grave mistake."
"In refusing to give their agreement to the Treaty they offer encouragement to the very states which we wanted to draw into the commitments set out in the Treaty and whose ratification is a condition for its entry into force."
"What message has been sent to Russia and China?"
"How will this vote help to persuade countries like India and Pakistan to ratify the Treaty?"
"This regrettable vote may even offer encouragement to other countries in their nuclear aspirations and make them cross the threshold by testing their own nuclear devices."
"Any such nuclear tests at this stage might undo all the work which has gone into the Treaty."
"They would undermine international support and confidence in the multilateral arms control efforts."
"More seriously, they might trigger reciprocal actions in other countries through testing or through the strengthening of their nuclear programmes."
"The Senate refusal to agree to ratify the Treaty is a setback but it is not the end of the road."
"We must now, more than ever, show our commitment to the Treaty and redouble our efforts to promote its early entry into force."
"This is essential in order to maintain the international momentum in favour of continued arms limitation and a stronger global non-proliferation regime."
"The Commission has consistently supported an ambitious European Union policy on non-proliferation issues."
"Wherever possible, we have complemented CFSP initiatives in this area with action falling within Community competence."
"Under the Euratom Treaty, for example, we have contributed to the development and strengthening of an efficient nuclear safeguard system in Europe, including the Russian Federation."
"Activities in this field are supported by financial allocations under the PHARE and TACIS programmes."
"We are currently considering extending these activities to other areas such as safeguards on chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction."
"The common strategy on Russia also contains specific provisions on non-proliferation."
"In this context we are examining the scope of cooperation with the United States on the expanded threat reduction initiative."
"Accession to the Treaty is also a crucial element in our policy towards South Asia, as the presidency made clear."
"Following the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan the Commission has participated in the international taskforce set up to develop confidence and security-building measures and to engage these countries in constructive discussions on regional non-proliferation and arms control."
"Over the years remarkable progress has been made in international arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament, through both bilateral and multilateral efforts."
"In the multilateral context the ratification of the Treaty and the review of the non-proliferation treaty next year will be crucial to reconfirming earlier commitments and building a platform for further progress."
"To achieve this we need to work with the United States and other leading partners."
"The leading role played by the United States has been essential in developing the global non-proliferation regime."
"I hope we can encourage our American friends to take up that role again."
"We should do everything we can to convince Congress of the importance of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for ourselves, for the United States and for the international non-proliferation efforts."
"I can assure you that the Commission will continue to bring its contribution to this objective."
"I also believe that all honourable Members have a particular role to play in this respect."
"I would hope that you would use every opportunity to explain and underline to your colleagues in the Senate why they should reconsider their vote on the Treaty and how a renewed commitment to international non-proliferation and arms control will promote American security interests, as well as broader international security and stability."
"In that marvellous newspaper the International Herald Tribune, there is today a shortened version of a speech given the other day to the Council on Foreign Relations by the President' s national security adviser Sandy Berger."
"American opponents of treaties like the one we are debating today neglected the fact, he pointed out, that the United States has already stopped testing and that the Treaty helped freeze the global development of nuclear weapons when America enjoys an enormous strategic advantage."
"I hope that, to borrow an unattractively appropriate phrase, the fall-out from this lamentable political decision can be contained."
"I know that is what the American administration wants."
"It is what we all want."
"American senators and congressmen should face up to the responsibilities of their country' s global position."
"It places a high premium on bi-partisanship in foreign policy in general and in nuclear policy in particular."
"Failure to recognise that condemns us all to live in a much less safe world."
"Mr President, Mr Sasi, Commissioner, you have just reminded us, in great detail, of the importance of this Treaty Ban, the basic aim of which is to strengthen the measures of the non-proliferation treaty and, in conjunction with this, aims to keep the development of nuclear weapons under control, thereby limiting the proliferation of these weapons and of the technology necessary for developing them."
"As you pointed out, the treaty was established three years ago and was signed straight away by the five nuclear powers which are the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council."
"But, in order for it to come into force, it must be ratified by forty-four specifically designated States amongst which there are the states that actually have nuclear capability, and the nuclear powers, but also those States known as ""threshold States"" , which are States that, because they have nuclear reactors in the civilian sector, are capable of developing military technology."
"On 13 October, this treaty was defeated in the American Senate, which rejected it by 51 votes to 48 and one abstention."
"This shows that the margin was very narrow and that it may therefore be useful - and it certainly will be useful - for our Parliament to make its voice heard after those of the Heads of government who, in Tampere, lamented the attitude of the American Senate, pointing out that it represented a timely signal to those who might be tempted to equip themselves with nuclear weapons."
"Among the arguments put forward in the United States, some people thought that it was not yet time to stop nuclear testing at a time when North Korea is making efforts to develop its own weapons, and as China is continuing to build up its arsenal."
"Others questioned the validity of simulation and felt that in order to ensure the long-term credibility of nuclear deterrence, they should not prohibit themselves going ahead with testing."
"Finally, others questioned the application of this treaty which, it must be admitted, will be difficult to control even when the 381 monitoring stations that the Representative of the Council told us about have actually been deployed."
"There is no guarantee in the short term that they have the necessary means to detect weak nuclear explosions in an environment which does not always make it possible to tell them apart from earthquakes."
"All of that is of little consequence, however, in terms of the geopolitical challenge that confront us, consisting of monitoring as efficiently as possible the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction."
"I am pleased that Commissioner Patten mentioned the fact that the threat does not come from nuclear weapons alone."
"Having dedicated my life to the use of weapons, I know that force is in itself neutral, and that it is the way it is used that can be good or bad."
"The advent of nuclear weapons has at least had the merit of forcing political leaders to take stock of the risks that their jobs may entail."
"It was probably the balance of terror throughout the forty years of the cold war which allowed us to avoid a third world war."
"The strategy of deterrence may therefore have its merits."
"If we do not manage to ban the proliferation of these weapons, we run the risk that they will end up falling into irresponsible hands."
"This is why, aware of this risk, I am approving the resolution which will be submitted tomorrow for Parliament' s approval."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, my group had requested the inclusion of this point in the agenda."
"Allow me first of all to welcome the fact that there is virtual unanimity between the Council, the Commission and, hopefully, the Parliament, concerning such a crucial issue at a time when we have to take decisive steps in the development of the common foreign and security policy."
"Since we are always so self-critical, I believe that we should welcome this step."
"And, having said this, I believe that rather than debating amongst ourselves, what we have to do is address the American Senate, and especially its Republican majority, because this is not a debate against the United States, but a debate in which we specifically support President Clinton."
"What we profoundly criticise is that attitude of the Republican majority in the Senate which corresponds more to the former doctrine of the ""clear destiny"" of the United States, much more than to the moral, as well as military, leadership which they currently hold."
"I must confess - with some experience of relations between this Parliament and the Congress of the United States - that in the Congress of the United States we have many friends and connections but that we have at no time been able to timetable a positive debate with Senator Helms, who does not even seem to have an American passport and who considers, not only with regard to this issue but also with regard to many others, that it is his job to impose his laws on the world."
"Think also of the slow and delayed attitude of the United States with regard to UN funding."
"We have to point out to our American friends and partners the risk involved in this decision, because it encourages States such as Pakistan and India - with the risk of all-out war - to continue with their nuclear tests."
"It disturbs our relations with Russia and creates a situation which encourages those States which are on the threshold of having a nuclear capability to start again."
"I believe that this a blatant display of total irresponsibility."
"And in the Union, where we have all ratified the Test Ban Treaty, we have political and moral arguments to address to our American partners so that we can remind them that they have a serious responsibility to try to stabilise the world and that they can rely on our help if it is really possible to cooperate with them."
"This type of unilateral measure, which ignores the lessons of history, which puts a dramatic halt to the process which has taken many years and still needs to be promoted, is the exact opposite of what we should be doing."
"Mr President, I hope that our colleagues in the Delegation for Relations with the United States will remind our American friends of this as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Commissioner Chris Patten for his clear and powerful speech, and I should also like to thank Mr Barón Crespo for emphasising that it is not the United States we are criticising today."
"Rather, it is a number of specific politicians in the American Senate."
"We are friends of the United States."
"We admire the United States' contribution to freedom and peace in the world."
"We have supported the United States' and NATO' s nuclear strategy, including their attempts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"And that is why, in this situation, we must have a serious word with our friends in the American Senate."
"It is completely irresponsible to use ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty as a political football in an internal political dispute between the Republican Congress and the Democratic President."
"How are we to be able to press Russia and China and India and Pakistan to ratify the treaty when our most important ally will not do so?"
"We protested - I think Mr Morillon can remember this - when France carried out its nuclear tests in the Pacific."
"We protested because this damaged attempts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"We need now to criticise the majority in the American Senate."
"We urge that the matter be taken up again."
"We hope due note is taken of the fact that the American Senate is today facing a barrage of criticism."
"It is well deserved."
"I hope that it leads to the issue being taken up again quickly."
"Mr President, first of all I should like say on behalf of my group that we are very disappointed at the failure to include in the resolution a call for all European Member States and EU applicant Member States to give their full support for the new agenda coalition resolution which is now on the table of the 55th United Nations General Assembly."
"This resolution which, incidentally, is supported by the European Parliament and by my own country, Ireland, sets forth a new way of thinking for effective measures to forward the cause of a nuclear-free world."
"The American decision is deplorable and it sends out a very dangerous signal to the rest of the world as regards nuclear disarmament."
"The recent case in Scotland which has re-endorsed the International Court' s ruling that nuclear weapons are illegal is also interesting and has to be taken on board."
"We also have to look at NATO where there needs to be a review because, as far as I can see, the US has demonstrated quite clearly its contempt for the whole issue of nuclear disarmament at an international level."
"These are issues which have to be taken on board."
"Finally, the European Union should look again at its policy of supporting NATO and the Western European Union."
"Both military organisations are committed to nuclear weapons, weapons that the International Court has deemed illegal."
"We are supporting illegal weapons and we really have to look at this."
"Mr President, in voting against the Test Ban Treaty the American Senate has been irresponsible, and at the same time has become responsible for putting the world at serious risk of a nuclear holocaust."
"Senator Jesse James pompously said that the Treaty is dead and buried."
"He is known for his fundamentalism, but he did not realise, or perhaps he realised full well, that the signing of the Treaty was the first step towards the concrete realisation of the hope that what the United States did with the nuclear holocausts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would never be repeated."
"What a sad prospect for our century!"
"In fact, in the country which wishes to set itself up as a moral and strategic leader, groups seem to prevail which, for the sake of profits and military and nuclear supremacy, are not afraid of destroying themselves too."
"Actually, maybe we should not be surprised."
"These groups are the same ones which continue to inflict the death penalty and not pay the amounts due to the United Nations, thereby contributing to the loss of legitimacy and functionality of a structure which was founded on the principle of peoples' right to be free from war."
"What the Senate has done is sheer madness and, as Commissioner Patten was saying, it may not even have been done for strategic reasons but because of internal struggles, which makes the matter worse and even more shameful."
"Above all, as we have seen, this is encouraging other countries which already have nuclear capabilities, not to ratify the Treaty, and inciting even more countries to arm themselves with nuclear weapons."
"We have seen that Russia did not waste any time, and the day before yesterday it tested a Steel RS 18 intercontinental ballistic missile."
"What the Japanese Minister is doing is also worrying."
"And China, which has carried out 45 nuclear tests, had assured us it wanted ratification to be accelerated."
"Now all of these things are certainly in doubt."
"Several times, Parliament has come out in favour of an end to nuclear weapons."
"We must work hard to ensure that those countries which have not yet ratified the Treaty do so as soon as possible."
"Here are just a few examples - China, Russia, India and Israel, which is still holding Mr Mordekaivanour as a conscientious objector in prison."
"We must also put a stop to Nuclear Sharing, as laid down in articles 1 and 2 of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which states that no State in possession of nuclear weapons can, directly or indirectly, transfer weapons to another country."
"On the contrary, we have seen that large quantities of nuclear weapons have been brought to NATO bases, against the wishes of the local population who have chosen to live in nuclear-free areas."
"The European Union is certainly active in consolidating the path to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons."
"I do not want to lose confidence that it is possible to make this world more rational, and that it will stop producing what could destroy it."
"I am convinced that peace movements against nuclear weapons, which achieved so much in the seventies and eighties, could take up their activities again in cooperation with us and our Parliament, so that we can truly live in a nuclear-free world."
"Mr President, the previous speaker mentioned Senator Jesse James."
"My recollection is that he was a gunfighter."
"We are actually referring to Senator Jesse Helms who normally shoots from the hip, but not with a gun."
"I should like to make three points in this debate."
"Firstly, we all agree about stressing the dangers of nuclear proliferation."
"The Commission was right in its statement to highlight the need for a lead from the United States in dealing with countries like Russia, China, Pakistan and India, who are waiting for this lead."
"They do not have it now."
"We will have to try to do what we can to make sure the Senate recognises where reality is."
"Therefore we are right today to strongly criticise the action which the US Senate has taken on the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
"Secondly, it is interesting that in the previous debate we had on this issue of globalisation we recognised, whether we liked it or not, that economic forces were global, new technologies were global."
"And yet here we have a US Senate, a legislature, which wishes to resist the global environment in which it lives."
"Perhaps it is because they have fears of difficulties in verification and that the ban could allow countries such as North Korea and Iraq to conduct low-level tests, or perhaps they fear that by permanently halting testing the US could suffer a deterioration of its nuclear stock-pile and deterrent."
"The Commissioner says there was an article in the Herald Tribune from Sandy Berger, but was that the real answer to the question of why Republicans in the Senate voted to condemn the Treaty this time round?"
"There is a second article in the Herald Tribune today on exactly the same page where Mr Crystal, who is editor of the Weekly Standard, says: ""Republicans will argue that American security cannot be safeguarded by international conventions."
"Instead they will ask Americans to face this increasingly dangerous world without illusions."
"They will argue that American dominance can be sustained for many decades to come, not by arms control agreements but by augmenting America' s power and therefore its ability to lead."""
"I contend that we will have, as other speakers have said, the absolute right and need to argue with our Congressional colleagues, particularly those in the Senate."
"As a member of the Delegation for relations with the United States, I will be doing precisely that as soon as possible."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Patten, I should like to use the term which President Clinton used to characterise the behaviour of the Senate."
"He called this irresponsible."
"This irresponsibility has dealt a severe blow to all international efforts towards non-proliferation and puts nuclear disarmament into a state of severe crisis."
"It seems that much more important to me at this time for the EU to take the initiative in this area."
"I welcome the initiative of President Jacques Chirac, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Prime Minister Tony Blair who, in an open letter to the American public, canvassed in favour of ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
"That was not enough."
"We know that."
"Therefore, we must do a lot more."
"We must think in concrete terms and we must take action."
"I am a little disappointed, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that you have only told us what we have read in the newspapers anyway."
"I congratulate Commissioner Patten on the very concrete steps which he has presented here."
"Commissioner, I should like to urge you to collate these steps in a kind of action catalogue forming part of a report for the European Parliament. In that way, we can become active, take initiatives or make further proposals to the Council."
"I should finally again like to support what the European Parliament decided on 18 November of last year when it supported the eight States' declarations of 9 June 1998 concerning the new agenda coalition for the rapid, definitive and complete elimination of nuclear weapons."
"Demand this, and the European Parliament ought to renew its support."
"Mr President, last week in Greenock, on the western seaboard of this Union, three brave women Angela Zetter, Ellen Moxley and Bodil Ulla Roder stood trial on a charge of criminal damage."
"They had acted to impede the Trident missile system based on the Clyde."
"Their aim was to prevent what they consider a grave crime under international law."
"The judge, Sheriff Gimblett directed the jury to acquit them on the ground that the prosecution had not proved they acted with any criminal intent."
"Her judgement can be appealed."
"If he appeals, the Lord Advocate of Scotland will have to contend in our highest appeal court for the lawfulness of a defence policy based on weapons of mass destruction."
"The doctrine of double-effect has no application to weapons which, in their intrinsic design are designed to cause mass destruction."
"The courage and judicial independence of Sheriff Gimblett - the courage of Angela Zetter and her companions stand in sharp contrast with the petulant failure of the United States Senate to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty."
"Like most of my countrymen I am deeply hostile to the use of Scottish waters for Trident."
"I am proud to represent here a party, the Scottish National Party, which opposes this absolutely."
"I am glad that the entire Green EFA Group is in solidarity with us on this point."
"Unsurprisingly, we deplore the Senate' s action."
"Mr President, the recent decision of the US Senate to reject ratification of the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty has set an unpleasant precedent for the efforts by the people of the world to create lasting peace and stability."
"At a particularly eventful and critical time in the international arena, rejection by the one and only de facto superpower has raised a fundamental issue; that is, the need to reaffirm the political will of the civilised world to monitor effectively the production and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Without a doubt, modern democratic societies enjoy an order of peace, security, growth and prosperity."
"However, new forms of political and social instability can indeed threaten the cohesion of our liberal societies, for example as a result of organised terrorism."
"Terrorism today is regaining strength at all levels and is keeping up to date with new technological developments in both weaponry and communications systems."
"According to available statistics, there may be, at some point in the future, means of mass destruction which will be used to hit specific political targets anywhere in the world."
"Such a prospect, Mr President, should remain just a prospect."
"Only by introducing concerted, joint preventative measures to monitor the development, availability and use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction can we prevent this from happening."
"We are under no illusion that limiting nuclear weapons and banning their development will, undoubtedly, discourage some states from acquiring any in the future."
"We have all seen what has been happening between India and Pakistan."
"Very often, differences between warring neighbouring countries or even upsetting a geopolitical equilibrium which one state feels is not in its interest is reason enough for some to resort to the nuclear option."
"It is, however, important in all cases that there are clear and binding expressions of political will, both internationally and on the part of those who can guarantee world peace and stability, that the non-proliferation of nuclear arsenals is a high and non-negotiable priority."
"We would like to believe, Mr President, that the decision by the American Senate is but a temporary diversion from the moral obligation which the superpower has towards public opinion worldwide, i.e. as a country which should lead the way in its policies to reduce nuclear danger."
"Mr President, this Parliament was always squarely behind any endeavours to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world - the French President will have some vivid memories of this- both when it came to the START Treaties and the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty, which I am glad to say was extended not so long ago."
"Very many states renounce nuclear weapons voluntarily."
"The major nuclear powers have scaled down their arsenals by a considerable amount, but that does not mean that we can rest content though."
"The START process is faltering and too many countries reserve the right to develop a nuclear capability."
"This is increasing tension in some parts of the world."
"Some time ago a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was signed."
"An important step forwards."
"The treaty was and is the expression of an ambition to eradicate nuclear weapons in the long term."
"The US was one of the countries that promoted the ban and it is extremely sad that it is precisely the US, or rather the majority in the Senate, that have now declined to ratify the treaty."
"The Non-Proliferation Treaty more or less signifies the acceptance of five nuclear powers."
"The non-nuclear states went along with it on condition that the nuclear powers would do everything to reduce their nuclear capability."
"A ban on nuclear testing was and continues to be an essential part of this."
"This commitment is an important feature of the non-proliferation process and constitutes its moral basis to some extent."
"That is another reason why the step taken by the American Senate is so serious."
"The credibility of the non-proliferation process is thereby impaired."
"The Senate points to the fact that countries such as Iraq could pose a nuclear threat in the future."
"The US therefore claims that it must continue to be in a position to have an up to date nuclear arsenal at its disposal and that nuclear tests may be necessary to this end."
"Quite apart from the significance of this line of argument in political and military terms, it is important to recognise that it is an expression of American provincialism which leaves no room for a reciprocal international approach, in which countries such as Iraq are countered with international embargoes coupled with sanctions."
"We believe that the EU will have to be quite forceful in fostering this approach."
"Mr President, the American Senate' s refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty or CTBT is a setback for disarmament which I most particularly regret."
"This behaviour by the US Senate is in conflict with the final declaration of the CTBT Conference which, as the President-in-Office of the Council has mentioned, sat in Vienna from 6 to 8 October and emphasised the importance of a comprehensive, verifiable ban on nuclear testing, as well as urging all States to sign and ratify this Agreement quickly."
"Viewed with political realism, the fact that this has not happened in the USA is not of very great importance because, of 155 countries, only 51 have so far ratified the Treaty and, of 44 key States, only 41 have signed it."
"However, this Treaty' s coming into force in the USA would have put regional nuclear powers under pressure to enter into the Treaty - countries such as India and Pakistan, which are in the process of building up their regional balance of terror, or North Korea or Iran, Iraq or Israel."
"Not all of these countries are equally unpredictable, but the proliferation of nuclear weapons has, unfortunately, not declined but increased since the existence of the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Through the failure of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in the United States, fresh impetus will be given to the suspicion on the part of Third World nuclear powers and countries on the threshold of becoming nuclear powers that the Non-Proliferation Treaty primarily serves to maintain the large nations' nuclear status and discriminates against small countries."
"The fact that a non-nuclear power like Austria has signed and ratified the Test Ban Treaty is no doubt laudable but will have no direct effects upon regional nuclear powers."
"What we want to see and must now strive that much more to achieve is a step-by-step approach to the final goal of nuclear disarmament."
"A ban on nuclear testing is part and parcel of this process, to the same extent as the continuation of the START process and the verifiable reduction in fissionable material."
"Mr President, I do not need to go over the issues which have been very succinctly summarised by Mr Patten in particular - except I would re-emphasise the danger that this action by the Senate may give the wrong message to the hawks in the Russian Duma who have so far failed to respond to nuclear disarmament initiatives."
"I would also mention the impact this has on the Non-Proliferation Treaty which is due to be reviewed next year because that is based on the premise that existing nuclear powers work towards disarmament."
"That premise must now be called into question."
"And all this despite the fact that the Test Ban Treaty would have frozen forever US nuclear superiority."
"That is the stupidity of this."
"But this is actually about a broader issue."
"This is really about domestic US politics."
"If, for example, we look at the history of western policy towards former Yugoslavia, we see the effectiveness of that ebbed and flowed with the ebb and flow of US domestic politics."
"I would ask Commissioner Patten, if he is still listening, whether or not he agrees with me that this reinforces the need for an effective European Foreign Security Policy and European Defence Policy where we would be capable of taking autonomous action - not to be independent, but rather to protect our security from being blown around constantly in the winds of US domestic policies and US presidential elections."
"Mr President, ""The land shall be built with law"" - a dictum which should also apply internationally."
"When it comes to nuclear weapons, there are two central treaties: on the one hand, the Non-Proliferation Treaty in which the nuclear powers have undertaken to reduce the size of their nuclear arsenals in return for other countries' not acquiring nuclear weapons; and, on the other hand, the Test Ban Treaty which is incredibly important because the purpose of the tests is to develop nuclear weapons."
"It is an enormously dangerous signal which the American Senate has sent out to the world community."
"In this way, the process of nuclear disarmament, which is so extraordinarily important, may be brought to a standstill."
"Let me say that it is not the case that nuclear weapons are only dangerous when they are used; instead, their mere existence is a source of danger."
"The four-star general, Lee Butler, who was responsible for American strategic nuclear weapons and who has had his finger on the button for many years, is entirely convinced that the very existence of nuclear weapons, which can be triggered not only through political decisions but also through technical mistakes, is a very serious matter."
"It is important that the European Union should clearly speak its mind to the United States and demand that the present Treaty in fact be ratified."
"Mr President, I am very satisfied that the debate here in Parliament has shown complete unanimity, and it is good that the Commission, Parliament and the Council have very clearly emphasised the support of the European Union for the Test Ban Treaty."
"It is also good that our Member States have comprehensively ratified the treaty."
"It is unfortunate that the American Senate has given the totally wrong signal in this issue, and especially the wrong signal to those countries that might still feel tempted to carry out nuclear testing."
"I assure you that, for our part, this issue will be raised continually in political dialogue between the European Union and the United States."
"But as you know, the US administration is not a problem here: we, and especially you, the Members of Parliament, must target your special efforts at the American Senate, for it to support this treaty."
"Mr President, I was interested to hear during the course of this short but important debate, the views of the honourable Member, Mr MacCormick."
"He and I have known one another for 35 years which may surprise honourable Members because we both look much younger than that."
"But I think that I can honestly say that our respective views on nuclear weapons have not changed in three and a half decades which is an argument, I guess, for consistency through life."
"One rather more serious point."
"I think that most speakers have made the extremely important distinction between the United States and the United States Administration, on the one hand, and the United States Senate, and in particular its Republican majority, on the other, a point made by Mr Baron, Mr Haarder, Mr Elles and by other speakers."
"It is important for us to make that distinction and to recognise that it is the Senate and the Members of Congress as a whole on whom we need to put some pressure."
"One thing we have to argue with them, and it was reflected in the article from which the honourable Member, Mr Elles, quoted, is that unilateralism today as advocated by some Republicans, but not all Republicans to be fair to Senator Logan, is a policy, to borrow from Irish history of ""ourselves alone"" that would be as disastrous for the world as it was after the First World War."
"I think, we have a lot of persuading to do."
"The honourable and gallant Member, General Morillon, mentioned the vote in the Senate and that it had been lost by 51 to 48."
"Actually, it is more serious than that because it requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate to ratify a treaty, so we are still almost 20 votes short of that ratification figure."
"In any event, I can assure Parliament that the Commission will want to join honourable Members in trying to persuade Senators to think again."
"It is in our interest, it is in their interest and it is in the whole world' s interest."
"Mr President, I asked Mr Patten a direct question."
"I wondered whether he was going to give me an answer?"
"Was the honourable Member referring to the question whether we recognised that the American action argued very strongly the case for us developing a common foreign and security policy?"
"I totally agree with him on that issue."
"But perhaps I could go a stage further and say that what would be really damaging for the European Union would be if, having asserted the case for a common foreign and security policy, having argued the case for a European security and defence initiative, we were then to fall way short of our rhetoric in what we actually did."
"Because in those circumstances we would have had the worst possible effect on American public opinion as well as on our own."
"It would be the sort of action that would encourage the very unilateralist sentiments in the United States that he and I both deplore."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I have received five motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 35(2) to conclude the present statement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow morning."
"EC-Russia summit in Helsinki"
"The next item is the statement of the Council on the EU-Russia Summit in Helsinki."
"Mr Sasi has asked the presidency to inform the Assembly that he must leave at 6.00 p.m. due to unavoidable commitments."
"You have the floor, Mr Sasi."
"Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, the summit conference held by the EU and Russia took place in what is a historic building, as far as Russia is concerned, the Assembly House of the Estates in Helsinki."
"The Assembly House of the Estates was the first Parliament building constructed for the purpose in the Russian Empire."
"It was there that three of the four estates of the Finnish autonomous grand duchy used to assemble."
"On the agenda at the meeting, there were four main items: firstly, EU/Russian relations, including the current situation in the EU and Russia; secondly, the northern dimension; thirdly, cooperation in the fight against crime; and, fourthly, current international affairs, in which the focus was on the forthcoming OSCE Summit and the situation in the west Balkans."
"The most positive result of the summit was Russia' s EU strategy."
"This strategy reflects the greater importance of the EU in Russia."
"The strategy is now being analysed."
"In my speech I will focus on Russia' s internal situation, in particular, the situation in Chechnya."
"In addition, I will speak about the EU' s common foreign policy, the fight against crime and the northern dimension."
"Prime Minister Putin said the Russian economy was growing in most areas."
"He said foreign trade was having a positive impact on the economy."
"There was more effective collection of taxes, and the rouble had steadied in value."
"Next year' s budget will be based on a growth rate of 1.5%."
"According to Mr Putin, Russia has a growing market economy, based on the principles of the rule of law."
"One of the problems of economic activity, however, is that bartering still plays too large a part in commerce."
"The bank system must also be improved."
"Furthermore, central and regional budgetary relations have to be redefined, and Russia' s still very closed economy opened up."
"Mr Putin gave a lengthy account of the situation in Chechnya."
"He said that, despite speculation, a state of emergency would not be declared for the whole country on account of the situation in the northern Caucasus."
"He said the government would not be provoked, and democratic elections would be held in due course."
"He also stressed that the government would continue to fight against terrorism in Chechnya."
"Russia has created a security zone and is feeding the 100,000 people who have left the region."
"Mr Putin' s tone was on the whole tough when he spoke on this subject."
"Prime Minister Putin was self-critical and admitted the Russian government had made a mistake, in that it had not handled the situation well with regard to Russia' s nearly 20 million strong Muslim population."
"Dialogue with moderate Muslim leaders had also been neglected."
"This had created a space for fundamentalism."
"The humanitarian situation in the region is growing worse all the time."
"It is good that the UN humanitarian evaluation expedition is able to travel to Ingushetia to investigate the situation."
"Representing the country to hold the presidency, Prime Minister Lipponen, and the President of the Commission, Romano Prodi, were urging Russia to initiate action to de-escalate the crisis."
"Both firmly stressed that a political solution had to be found for the conflict."
"Military action could not solve political problems or remedy the desperate economic situation in the region."
"In the opinion of the EU, the solution also requires dialogue with the Chechen leaders."
"The Union totally condemns such disproportionate use of force, of which civilians become the victims."
"Prime Minister Lipponen furthermore stated this to the press on his visit to Parliament earlier today."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on the whole our impression was that the Russian government unfortunately did not seem to have any clear plan for a lasting political solution to the situation in Chechnya."
"After this there was a short debate on the EU' s common foreign and security policy."
"Prime Minister Lipponen and High Representative Javier Solana gave a presentation to the Russian delegation on the development of the common foreign and security policy."
"Mr Lipponen said the presidency was drafting an EU report on crisis management and peacekeeping capabilities for the European Council in Helsinki."
"Mr Solana added that special consideration was being given to how Europeans could work together in the implementation of the Petersberg Tasks."
"Regarding the fight against crime, it was stated that the European Council at Tampere had been fruitful."
"Regional cooperation is important in the fight against cross-border crime, and Russia is a key partner in cooperation."
"The Union is drafting an action programme to counter organised crime, which will be debated in the seminar on organised crime to be held by the EU and Russia in Helsinki."
"The action programme should be ready at the start of 2000."
"Mr Putin also underlined the importance of fighting against organised crime."
"He mentioned drugs, money laundering, corruption and terrorism as the main areas of concern."
"He said the Duma had just adopted a convention for the extradition of criminals."
"A convention on money laundering would also soon be ratified."
"Mr Putin stressed that it was important to move from words to deeds."
"TACIS aid would also be needed in the area of combating crime."
"Russia would also like to increase cooperation in issues relating to the prevention of the trade in human beings."
"Trade in human beings is practised in the northern Caucasus, among other areas."
"Workers belonging to the Red Cross and other relief organisations have been captured."
"Drug smuggling, according to Mr Putin, was a special problem in Central Asia which, broadly speaking, if you included Afghanistan and Iran, had overtaken Latin America as the most important drugs manufacturing centre in the world."
"The added problem for Russia is that its borders with Central Asia are open."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words about the northern dimension, whose aim it is to increase well-being, strengthen security and prevent environmental pollution, nuclear risks and the dangers of organised cross-border crime."
"All this will also play an essential part in cooperation between the EU and Russia."
"Prime Minister Putin said that Russia wanted to play an active part in this work."
"It is important for Russia that the region is comprehensively developed."
"Mr Sasi has admirably summarised the results of last week' s European Union/Russia summit."
"As Parliament would expect, the summit was inevitably dominated by straight talking on Chechnya with the European Union, as the presidency indicated, pressing for de-escalation, for a return to political dialogue, for proportionality in the use of force to deal with terrorism and a solution to the humanitarian crisis."
"I would like to say a word about that and then concentrate briefly on two other issues that loomed large in our discussions: implementation of the partnership and cooperation agreement and European Union enlargement and the northern dimension."
"Firstly, the Commission very much shares the deep concern of all Member States about the present situation in Chechnya."
"One of the immediate priorities, particularly as winter approaches, is to ensure humanitarian assistance for the tens of thousands of people displaced by the conflict."
"The Commission has decided in principle that ECHO could make available straight away EUR 1.2 million to help relieve the situation in Ingushetia and Dagestan."
"The Russians are open in principle to offers of humanitarian aid but we have still some way to go in discussions with them before European Union aid can be distributed."
"Before we can go ahead we need further assurances from the Russian authorities on the security arrangements for international aid workers on the ground."
"There is too much recent history for us to avoid that important issue."
"We have also been pressing them to arrange for aid agencies to visit the area to assess the needs on the ground and I hope that this mission will now take place in the coming days."
"Secondly, the Commission broadly welcomed progress on implementation of the partnership and cooperation agreement."
"Although naturally the summit did not go into the detail, there was a clear awareness of the importance of a strategic European Union/Russia partnership whatever the present difficulties."
"In this context, the economic cooperation initiatives that we have launched with Russia are, in general, developing well."
"For example, we are making significant progress in ensuring better protection of intellectual property rights."
"We have launched a major programme providing young Russian managers with periods of practical training in firms in the European Union."
"Cooperation between experts is advancing in a number of other areas including the environment, coping with the millennium bug in Russia and the more efficient use of energy."
"By contrast bilateral trade relations and investment are not developing as well as the Commission would like."
"The European Union is rightly extending export opportunities for Russian companies in EU markets to boost the Russian economy."
"But there is unfortunately less progress in the other direction."
"We have repeatedly asked the Russian authorities to address the obstacles which stand in the way of European Union companies' expansion in Russian markets."
"These include excessive certification and testing requirements, as well as specific concerns like the continued charges on international airlines to fly over Siberia."
"The decline in European Union exports to Russia since the financial crisis of August last year underlines the need for action in these areas."
"Minister Sasi indicated some of the things which are necessary in order to improve conditions for direct foreign investment."
"Thirdly, Prime Minister Putin welcomed European Union enlargement as a force for political stability in Europe."
"The Russians are understandably taking a very close interest in the enlargement process and the European Union is ready to engage in a serious dialogue with them in the partnership and cooperation agreement framework."
"However, the Commission has always made clear that it would not be appropriate to set up a special mechanism or some form of trilateral consultations with the applicant countries as requested by Russia on various occasions."
"In response to Russian worries about the economic impact of enlargement, President Prodi stressed the benefits in terms of lower tariffs and improved access to the markets of applicant countries."
"The benefits will be even greater if Russia can bring her technical norms and standards closer to those in the European Union, helping her to gain access more easily to the expanded commercial opportunities of the enlarged single market."
"A fundamental principle for the Commission is that enlargement should not create new dividing lines in Europe."
"At the summit, Prime Minister Putin was very positive about the northern dimension."
"He said that he not only wanted cross-border zones but large areas of north-west Russia to be covered."
"We agreed that detailed proposals should be discussed at the Helsinki Conference in November."
"Kaliningrad, as a future enclave inside the European Union, represents a particular challenge within the northern dimension."
"Partner countries to the northern dimension, including the European Union applicant countries neighbouring Kaliningrad, show increasing interest in cooperating on the issues raised by its unique situation."
"Already through Tacis and other European Union financial instruments the Commission is supporting the process of economic transition in Kaliningrad."
"It was not an occasion on which we had a complete meeting of minds."
"How in the circumstances could it have been?"
"But for all that I think it was a useful meeting and I very much hope that the Russian Prime Minister will reflect on all that we said, particularly perhaps on the northern Caucasus."
"Mr President, the summit in Helsinki took place against a very serious background."
"According to information from Moscow, the Red Cross is now, in anticipation of the winter, preparing new deliveries of aid for people in need throughout the Russian polar region."
"At the same time, the World Bank and the UNDP are talking of growing poverty, increasing social maladjustment and record youth unemployment in Russia."
"The fact that social destitution constitutes fertile ground for populists and extremists and for ethnic and religious conflicts is something we can see right now with appalling clarity in Chechnya and neighbouring regions where warlords and criminal clans are feathering their nests at the expense of the civilian population."
"There seems to be no end to the blood bath in Chechnya."
"Close on 200,000 innocent people have been forced to flee, and Dagestan is being ever more destabilised."
"It may be that our best intentions where Russia is concerned will in fact run into a lot of difficulties and be threatened by on-going crisis. In other words, ""our best laid schemes might go agley"" ."
"No-one within the EU is recommending an independent Chechnya."
"We cannot accept terrorist acts, but nor can we accept a military solution to this crisis."
"We demand that Russia initiate negotiations with Chechnya' s elected President without unrealistic prior conditions and that the aid which the EU has also promised should actually get through."
"Yesterday, Prime Minister Putin got the Duma to approve an appropriation of a billion dollars for the war effort in Chechnya."
"My question to the Council and the Commission is this: will you see to it that Russian aggression in Chechnya is not partly financed from international sources?"
"Mr President, with the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, the West began from the principle that the Russian Federation would be given unreserved support for her regional unity."
"Presumably, the Russian leaders also received some sort of promise regarding this when they were making their contribution to the peaceful dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union."
"This has also been the West' s common position in its attitude to events in Chechnya."
"The Russian leadership, however, apparently fears it is losing those regions whose population is mainly made up of ethnic and religious minorities."
"Military withdrawal from Chechnya was seen as a dangerous precedent."
"The events of Dagestan gave cause to presume that the disease is spreading."
"The Russian leadership' s worry concerning their country' s regional unity is doubtless well-founded."
"They should, however, realise that a country' s sovereignty cannot be secured through military force."
"The only realistic way forward is for the minority peoples living in the southern parts of Russia to be satisfied with their circumstances and feel that belonging to the Russian Federation benefits them."
"Military might is necessary, but it should be used only to keep terrorism under control."
"The West must clearly condemn the excessive use of military force in Chechnya - more clearly than what was the case at the Helsinki Summit meeting."
"We must influence the Russian government so that it would try to solve its country' s internal problems both through political means and by promoting economic and social development."
"EU and Western credibility and capacity for action generally is unfortunately made weaker in this matter by the recent war waged in Yugoslavia on humanitarian grounds."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Sasi has just reconfirmed the unfortunate idea that the European Union is examining the events of Chechnya as a Russian internal matter alone."
"However, Russia is in breach of many human rights agreements."
"For example, the European Council' s agreements strictly prohibit countries from murdering and bombing their own nationals."
"The OSCE agreements also demonstrated clearly that countries are committed to the notion that violations of human rights can never constitute the internal affairs of a state."
"In addition, Russia' s centralised power is oppressing a national minority."
"We might even suspect that ethnic cleansing is taking place there, with Russia trying to create Chechen-free buffer zones."
"Our group' s position is that our wishes and cabinet discussions are not enough: financial aid for Russia should be restricted to humanitarian and environmental aid."
"My colleague, Mr Schori, gave an account just now of the latest information on how Russia is, in fact, strengthening its military budget."
"Does the European Union want, for example, to be involved, through a pact of partnership and cooperation, in increasing Russian military expenditure, which will be used to punish Chechnya in the future?"
"Mr President, we must totally condemn the acts of terror that have been targeted at the Russian people, and which have resulted in a large number of civilian victims."
"If, and only if, these acts of terror are the work of Chechnya, then they are the wrong way to go about things on the international level."
"But at the same time we must also condemn Russian action against the civil population of Chechnya and the acts of terror perpetrated against civilians there."
"Unfortunately, the European Union and the countries of NATO have given an example of how to act in this connection; in the war in Yugoslavia, they showed how conflicts can be resolved."
"They can be resolved in the EU and NATO through violence, precision bombing raids and attacks on independent countries, all of which runs counter to the decisions of the international community."
"This way of solving problems is the wrong one."
"We should be developing international means of peacefully resolving problems between countries and safeguarding people' s freedom and human rights."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there is no doubt that constructive cooperation between Russia and the CIS States, on the one hand, and Europe on the other, is one of the most important prerequisites for peace for the 21st century."
"Cooperation of this kind is presently threatened by the war in Chechnya and by other regional conflicts."
"I believe, however, that the war in Chechnya should not be seen either as a purely regional conflict or as a purely religious dispute."
"That would be to play down the situation and also to underestimate it."
"It is also quite clearly a question of geo-strategical manoeuvrings for access to the oil and gas reserves in the Caucasus and around the Caspian Sea."
"Here, European, American, Chinese, Russian and other economic interests collide."
"A small spark in this area can lead to an explosion."
"And, as of today, a new crisis has evolved, namely in Armenia."
"A few hours ago, Prime Minister Sarkisjan and President of the Parliament Demirtschjan were murdered."
"Mr President, unfortunately, I have to leave for a meeting with the President of the European Parliament, and, for that reason, I would like to say now that, as Mr Patten of the Commission said in his excellent speech, the Union will not accept terrorism, but neither can we in any event accept the disproportionate use of force. In no circumstances is it acceptable."
"We wish to achieve a solution through dialogue, and that will require talks between the leaders of Russia and Chechnya."
"We will arrange for still closer dialogue between the EU and Russia."
"In these discussions we will express our frustration with the Russian action in Chechnya."
"As was pointed out in the discussions, it is clear that the continued crisis is increasing pressure to put Union cooperation with Russia on ice."
"If the situation does not improve, it will be even harder for the Council to counter this pressure."
"We have also noted the growth in the proportion of military expenditure in the Russian budget, and we have asked how Russia intends to finance this."
"It has been said that, with increased tax revenues and economic growth, there may well be more funds at their disposal."
"But, as has been claimed, the longer the war goes on, the more negative the attitude will become to any kind of aid to Russia."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, relations with the Russian Federation are very important."
"All of us in this House agree about that, and it has been said again and again through a multiplicity of decisions."
"Against this background, I naturally welcome the fact that the partnership agreement has now been translated into concrete fact, that there are regular consultations and that every possible question is being discussed and, in that way, positive results even achieved."
"I also welcome the fact that the new Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana, has declared that, from his point of view, policy towards Russia has first priority."
"It is certainly only right that that too should be the case."
"So much for the good news."
"Now for the bad news."
"I do not want to conceal the fact - and I have in fact been involved with policy towards Russia for a number of years now - that there are aspects of it which are hugely frustrating."
"In connection with Russia, the same themes appear over and over again on the agenda, whatever the Committee concerned and irrespective of whether it is a question of the fight against crime, economic reforms or sensible legislation in Russia concerning, for example, banking or taxes. And nowhere can any effective progress be seen."
"That is frustrating."
"It is just as apparent that, now as before, a large part of the flow of aid to Russia (I need only mention the letters IMF or International Monetary Fund) disappears into a bottomless pit."
"It is regrettable that we cannot achieve any real progress on this issue."
"Just as frustrating is what is happening at the moment in Chechnya and being conveyed to our television screens."
"I do not want to say anything more at all just now about the infringements of human rights because quite a lot has already been said about these at the last plenary part-session."
"They are alarming, and we must condemn them and address the issue."
"But I believe too that what is now being done in Russia to solve the problem is really no solution."
"Mr Putin may perhaps have some short-term successes in the area of domestic politics, but he will not in the end solve the problem of minorities within Russia and the problem of a certain necessary decolonisation."
"The Russian government would be well advised to look at examples partly to be found in their own country - I mention only Tatarstan - and to try to find other political solutions instead of doing what they are doing at the moment where, in the end, any success will be outweighed by the damage done."
"This must be said because one must be honest with partners and also tell them the truth."
"Mr President, I can only agree with Mr Lehne."
"Cooperation between the European Union and the Russian Federation is of enormous importance, and important matters were discussed at the summit, too."
"I really cannot, however, to be honest, share the optimistic account Mr Sasi has just given of present circumstances and future development within the Russian Federation."
"When I examine the Joint Declaration of the Summit on Chechnya - the most important matter at the moment in our cooperation with Russia - I see that it says that the European Union and the Russian Federation exchanged viewpoints about the situation in the North Caucasus."
"In fact, that really cannot be all there is to say."
"Any cooperation with Russia is at present overshadowed by the war in Chechnya."
"There are already 180 000 refugees in Ingushetia and Dagestan."
"Aid organisations cannot work there."
"Thousands of refugees are no longer permitted to leave the country, and the Russian government is not prepared to talk."
"We need a political solution."
"I am of the view that the European Union must attach more weight to discussions."
"We have an interest in cooperating with Russia."
"Naturally, we need Russia, for example in Kosovo."
"But Russia in turn needs us, that is to say it needs the European Union."
"I think that consideration might be given to whether, in negotiations, the following might be said: we must consider whether, if no political solution is sought and found in Chechnya, we ought in fact to block credits or cancel aid - other than forms of humanitarian aid - for Russia."
"(Applause)"
"In the European Parliament, we did not ratify the partnership agreement in the case of the first war in Chechnya."
"Now, at a summit which has become significantly more explosive politically, we are still only talking about exchanging opinions."
"In its efforts to achieve greater weight for its foreign policy, the European Union should not permit this."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, to follow on seamlessly, may I thank you, Constanze Krehl, for finally being so courageous and for saying these things so clearly."
"Throughout Europe, this summit has been a gigantic disappointment. Nor can there really be any beating about the bush as the Presidency has just done."
"In fact, the EU has failed downright and has not used the possibilities open to it."
"Why are we again accepting a brutal war by Russia against its own people? Why do we simply pass on to the existing agenda?"
"That is really not what meetings at the highest level are there for."
"They are not there for the purpose of exchanging civilities."
"They are there for calling a spade a spade. I must say that the report by the Finnish Presidency is a mockery of the facts, however they are described."
"The truth is that villagers are being bombarded and refugees surrounded, and these are startling infringements of international laws."
"This is not just an internal matter for Russia that can simply be brushed aside."
"We have the partnership and cooperation agreement, we have the human rights clauses and, therefore, we have the opportunity to threaten economic sanctions and press for the bombardments to cease."
"Without this, no international aid can arrive there, Mr Patten; that is no doubt clear."
"I therefore expect the Presidency and the Commission to get together now and to develop a strategy in the framework of the Joint Foreign and Security Policy which threatens the use of these economic tools and compels Russia to end this war."
"Mr President, by now it is crystal clear that most colleagues in this House share my conviction that the tragedy of Chechnya could have been avoided if the European Union had shown a firm attitude towards the Russian aggression."
"Instead, we have witnessed in recent days a most deplorable sight with the Russian Foreign Minister in Madrid and with the Russian Prime Minister in Tampere."
"Mr Sasi mentioned the particular significance for the Finnish people of the place where the meeting was held in Helsinki."
"Finland is now an independent country."
"How can the European Union deny this very right to the Chechen people?"
"Can we stand any longer the imperialistic policy of Russia towards small nations like Chechnya?"
"A few minutes ago Mr Patten mentioned Kaliningrad and I recall the historical shelter of the people of Kaliningrad, formerly Königsberg."
"Can we accept that only these particular countries are well protected?"
"Mr President, when Russian colonial troops conquered Chechnya in the last century, Finland had already been under Russian control for a long time."
"It was with great bravery that the Finnish people found their way to freedom, and I should therefore have expected the Finnish Presidency of the Council to show more understanding for the sufferings of the oppressed Chechen people."
"I must say quite clearly that the European Union' s strategy towards Russia has failed."
"Not only because the Russian State and economy are in a deeper crisis than they were just a few years ago; and not only because the present Russian leadership is already conducting its second brutal colonial war against Chechnya, which is about oil interests and which we are paying for."
"It is also the case that at present a particularly brutal form of election campaign is being developed."
"We are contributing to this bloody election campaign with summit meetings and with money which is being frittered away in this war."
"Without western money, Russia would in fact be unable to finance this war by no later than the end of the month."
"It is therefore we who are financing this murder of the civilian population in Chechnya."
"We must therefore get down to business here as well, and make it clear to the Russians that we are no longer prepared to do this."
"I should like to be quite clear in my opinion that the European Union must change its policy here, that it must come out unambiguously on the side of the Chechen people."
"For this, the OSCE, the Ceasefire Agreement of 1996 and also Russia' s membership of the Council of Europe can also offer levers, together with our Cooperation Agreement with Russia."
"We only have to use these tools and should not just say what the present Russian leadership wants to hear."
"Mr Putin, a secret service man who distinguished himself in the last war in Chechnya, has constantly been quoted today."
"It has been said - almost emotionally - that he does not plan to declare a state of emergency."
"Why not?"
"Because his popularity since the beginning of the war in Chechnya has increased sevenfold."
"Why then is he not going to be holding any elections?"
"In fact, he is already conducting an election campaign by means of this war, and only if his popularity were to decline would scenarios like that have to be reconsidered. That is why we need to change our tune quickly and find clear words in which to express our point of view."
"Mr President, it would indeed appear that the Chechen war in Russia is also part of an election campaign, although there may be many other reasons for it."
"The Russian action there seems to be taking the form of actual persecution of the civil population. This is to be condemned once and for all, and this will lead to a situation before long in which we have to cease providing aid to Russia."
"The cessation of this aid will obviously affect the poorest and those who need help most, it has to be remembered."
"I am looking for a way out."
"Could we imagine a conference being organised for the whole Caucasus issue, as there are military operations going on there within the territories of at least five states, and not just in Chechnya, about which my colleagues have spoken?"
"The example of Armenia - the murder of the Prime Minister a few hours ago today - is again a deplorable indication of that."
"The other possibility is that Russia turns the main weight of its attention from the south to the north, which is much richer in natural resources than the south, with no conflicts or dangers."
"This again would be one way of finding a way out of the difficulty."
"Is the Commissioner ready to support this sort of northern dimension action?"
"Mr President, in the Caucasus States the Russians are pursuing the policy which they vehemently rebuked others for pursuing in Kosovo."
"Recently, Prime Minister Putin' s 2000 budget was approved but only because he has earmarked an additional billion dollars for the army in Chechnya, which means arms for Chechnya against the vote of the old Communists."
"With less than two months to go to the vote, Putin is not going to upset the Russian Parliament, which is against him, with proposals for a political solution instead of a military one."
"Putin, moreover, accepts the military aid, but says that it must be distributed by the Russians without international control - an absurd request given all the thieves and enemies around."
"Putin is pushing the war on for pre-electoral reasons and not because he fears Islam or any other even more foolish reasons."
"However, documents where a rational desire to cooperate with westerners is expressed are useful to him, such as the Helsinki document of 22 October."
"We know that a week ago the debate was very bitter, while the resulting document, loaded with clichés singing the praises of cooperation, obviously does not express the feeling of that debate and the Russians are taking advantage of it."
"I would also invite the Ministers not to use the term ""terrorists"" when referring to the Chechen guerrillas."
"Indeed, we have had to change our minds all too often, as in the end terrorists have become fighters for national rights."
"I think that proper political dealings with Moscow will only be able to start again in January, after the elections, and maybe not even before August."
"The debate has been dominated by concerns about the North Caucasus."
"But there are, as Mr Paasilinna pointed out, grounds for concern about the situation in the South Caucasus as well."
"The honourable Member pointed to the alarming reports of the shooting in the Armenian parliament today and the reported assassination of the Prime Minister."
"We await confirmation of that tragic news, but it appears the news is probably accurate."
"I saw the Armenian Foreign Minister recently to discuss his concerns about the stability of the Southern Caucasus and, as well, to hear some of the concerns that he was expressing about Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus."
"I should like to say on this occasion that the Commission wants to reiterate its support for the Armenian Government in its efforts to find a rapid and peaceful solution to the situation in the Caucasus."
"What has happened today is deeply troubling."
"This debate has focused on Chechnya, which was the subject of some very straight talking in Helsinki with some Members understandably asserting that the European Union should have done something more than it has done already."
"I think it is perhaps an inevitable consequence of a debate like that, that there was not absolute clarity on what it was that we should have done."
"I want to reiterate some points that were made earlier by the presidency."
"The communiqué, as the honourable Member pointed out, referred to the fact that we had exchanged views on the situation in the Northern Caucasus."
"The communiqué did not say any more than that for a very good reason: we could not put in the communiqué that we had agreed on anything regarding the Northern Caucasus."
"What the European Union asserted strongly was: first of all, that whatever the concerns about Chechen terrorism - which are understandable - there is a powerful case for proportionality in dealing with that problem; secondly, we argued passionately for de-escalation and political dialogue."
"The problem, if you appear to undermine and destroy the authority of any moderate leaders in Chechnya, is this: who do you then talk to?"
"Who do you then have a political dialogue with?"
"That is a point that we put very strongly to Prime Minister Putin, both during the official discussions and over lunch when Chechnya completely dominated the discussion."
"We argued very strongly for the aid assessment mission to be allowed into Ingushetia as rapidly as possible."
"I spoke last week to the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance at the UN."
"I spoke last week to Mrs Ogata in the UNHCR."
"I read, as honourable Members will have done, the reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross on the humanitarian crisis which gets worse day by day in the Northern Caucasus."
"The ICRC suggested last week that over one third of the population of Grozny had left already."
"So we pressed the Russians to recognise that there must be an early visit by aid organisations to the region so we know what the situation is and how we can best contribute to the humanitarian problem."
"I hope that the honourable Member who suggested that we should perhaps consider cutting off any humanitarian assistance will have second thoughts about that."
"I have been a development minister providing humanitarian assistance on a national basis to countries torn apart by war."
"I have never believed that cutting off assistance to those who are affected by war, who are affected by the political decisions taken by their rulers, was a very good way of responding to crisis."
"Let me just add a word about the funding of the military campaign which, in my judgement - not a judgement which appears to be supported by the Russian Prime Minister - is bound to have an effect on the recovery over the last months of the Russian economy."
"Some Members suggested that we should cut off financial assistance to the Russian Federation because that assistance might be used to sustain the military campaign."
"I should just like to remind Members of Parliament, who are probably more familiar with some of the details of these issues than even I am, that we are not the provider of direct financial assistance to the Russian authorities."
"That is not how Tacis works."
"We are not an international financial institution providing financial assistance for the reconstruction - we hope - of the Russian economy."
"People should be clear that what we are doing is not sustaining Russian military campaigns in Chechnya or anywhere else."
"But when you start talking about cutting off programmes of assistance to Russia you have to face up to some of the consequences."
"An issue about which I feel passionately is the successful negotiation of the multilateral nuclear environment programme, the attempt to ensure that Western donors can provide technical and financial assistance for the storage and disposal of nuclear waste in north-west Russia, including all those terrifying, rusting nuclear submarines and the other nuclear garbage."
"It is very important for all of us that we make a programme like that succeed."
"I hope we can push on with talks about programmes like that even while we talk firmly and strongly to the Russians about the tragedy in the Northern Caucasus in Chechnya."
"One point that we made to Russian officials, to the Prime Minister, was that we were talking strongly on these issues, not as enemies but as people who wanted a cooperative relationship with Russia."
"We were talking strongly because we were reflecting the opinions of our public in the European Union: the sort of opinions reflected in speech after speech in this Chamber today."
"So what this debate has done is to underline the argument that we were putting to Mr Putin and others."
"It is an argument which I hope they will take very seriously over the coming days and weeks."
"There must be a return to negotiation, difficult though that may seem to Russian leaders."
"There must be a return to negotiation otherwise I fear that we will see disaster loaded upon disaster."
"In those circumstances I do not think that anyone' s opinion poll ratings are going to hold up for very long."
"Thank you, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Culture 2000 programme"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0026/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation (Culture 2000 programme) [13328/2/1998 - C5-0023/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)] (rapporteur: Mr Graça Moura)."
"Mr President, the CULTURE 2000 programme, as a single instrument, will be replacing the ARIANE, KALEIDOSCOPE and RAPHAEL programmes which gave outstanding service to the cause of European culture and whose success has been universally acknowledged."
"Thanks to the activities that were developed within the respective frameworks, access to a vast range of cultural products and values has been provided for many European citizens who would not otherwise have had this opportunity."
"As a single financing and programming instrument for cooperation, CULTURE 2000 declares a range of objectives which aim to provide a response, more of a response and a better one, to such needs, and this, then, is able to represent a decisive step in the direction of a European cultural policy that is worthy of this name."
"By this I mean an instrument which will permit repeated, interactive and fruitful contact between the cultures of the various Member countries in such a way that the variety of areas looked at and the multidisciplinary nature of the events become an ever more vitalising element in the very soil of European identity without threatening pluralism and the essential diversity of these cultures."
"Although all the participants in the various phases of the process bore these concerns in mind, it became clear that the attitudes of the Council and the Commission on the one hand and of this Parliament on the other were not completely attuned with one another."
"But although we have come a long way, we should nevertheless mention some of the main areas of disagreement."
"These are, of course, the budgetary question, the question of a supposedly excessive fragmentation or disintegration of the Union' s actions, which is considered likely to reduce its visibility and, as a result, the question of an option in the sense of there being privileged lines which would support initiatives of a greater scale and of a more spectacular kind."
"The participation of agents and operators had been foreseen for this, which would involve a greater number of countries as a minimum which, as we see it, would carry a serious risk of hypertrophy in some networks of cultural operators. This would give them an excessive concentration of means and powers and, as a result, threaten the normal functioning and even the very existence of many others."
"Consistent with the Mouskouri report which this Parliament was right to adopt, the recommendation to which I am honoured to put my name, maintained its aim of seeing the budgetary appropriation strengthened, from the EUR 167 million initially provided, and raised it to 250 million."
"There is no doubt that both the Council and the Commission are sensitive to the great needs that are being experienced in all the sectors covered by the programme, nor that there is much good will in the sense of trying to find satisfactory solutions."
"Moving now to other points of disagreement, I will say that experience shows that the greater the number of States participating, the greater the risk of each initial project losing its own character."
"Now, in principle, each initial project corresponds to needs experienced specifically by a given group of citizens."
"On the other hand, it seems obvious that there are great imbalances as a result of extremely varied conditions of time, method and place, in terms of the opportunity for access to the enjoyment of cultural values that the citizens of various European countries possess."
"This aspect tends to become even more complex with the perspective of enlargement which has, to a large extent, been prepared and anticipated at exactly the level of cultural contacts."
"This is why the possibility was foreseen of supporting medium- and even small-scale actions so that the greatest possible number of European citizens benefit, who will, as a result, be able to become more directly involved."
"Visibility will not count for much unless it relates intimately to life and to what culture has to offer."
"In this respect, more concessions were made, and a minimum number of three was accepted for States involved in the joint organisation of specific projects and of five for States involved in the large-scale cultural cooperation agreements. Attempts were also made to find a way towards making the framework mechanisms more flexible."
"There was also the intention to stimulate the emergence of new synergies and of new thrusts for creativity without wanting to favour a sector-based approach to action."
"It is becoming a matter of urgency that we move ahead."
"There are countless cultural operators and agents who will be deprived of any kind of means for the action that they are developing, which will be of inestimable value if this dossier is not concluded before the end of the year so that we can allow the programme to come into force at the beginning of next year."
"The figures calculated for conciliation will make this possible, as we know, moreover, that this conciliation will be conducted in parallel with the conciliation relating to the YOUTH programme, although it will be completely autonomous in relation to this programme."
"We all know that our cultural coordinates are related to our sense of identity as Europeans. We also know that fundamental action linked to cultural life in its multiple forms is an indispensable factor for the strengthening of an awareness of European identity."
"Until this dimension is fully achieved, political union itself will have feet of clay. Culture on its own can be one of its strongest foundations."
"In order to achieve this, there will have to be greater participation on the part of the citizens, and greater access to culture."
"I shall close my speech with the hope that this Parliament' s actions will make an important contribution to achieving this."
"Mr President, I wanted to sincerely thank our colleague, Mr Graça Moura, for taking over this report and really being content to take forward what we had already decided in the last legislative period and which was the work of Nana Mouskouri, whose warm greetings I am to pass on to you today."
"She is very happy that things are finally moving forward."
"The model of society which forms the basis of this report by Mr Graça Moura is a deeply humanitarian one."
"Culture plays an important role in this model, and partly for the purpose of facilitating respect on the part of our citizens for each other' s different cultures, as well as for national and regional traditions."
"This new programme sets out the framework for the European Union' s cultural policy for the next few years."
"It must be added that a genuine policy on culture and education is needed today more than ever, since it is the actual basis of European politics."
"Above all, however, it gives a human face to the distant and bureaucratic politics of Europe and puts the citizen in the centre of activity and debate, as is also happening with the ""Youth"" programme and with the ""Socrates"" education programme."
"The European Union should not just be a question of figures and statistics, for example. Only the genuine participation of its citizens makes it a living whole."
"When we see that the European Union has precisely 167 million ecus left for cultural policy, we naturally regard this as a ridiculous sum."
"As insiders, we know of course that what we are doing in terms of cultural policy is not confined to the area covered by this sum."
"We are also working in the cultural sphere when it comes to the areas covered by the regional funds."
"However, EUR 167 million is too small a sum."
"Even EUR 250 million would not be enough in view of the scale of the work which awaits us."
"I consider that the cultural sphere, to which we have the task of giving a higher profile, requires a much larger sum of money."
"But that is how it is everywhere in the European Union."
"Everyone gets up on their soapbox and says that Europe must be given a soul."
"That is a wonderful catchword."
"Everyone hides behind it but, unfortunately, not a lot of money is spent on it."
"I believe it is the same in every country."
"This cultural programme can basically make only a small contribution to realising this desire that neighbours should be made genuinely aware of each other' s respective cultures."
"In the form in which we now have the report, extensive parts of the former Commission' s proposal have been changed."
"We have responded more to the will of our citizens and have been that much less inclined to go in for big events."
"I know that this is also the attitude of the new Commissioner."
"I hope that the quality of the projects which we are now to have will make up for the lack of financial resources."
"Mr President, this is a serious and rigorous report."
"And Mr Graça Moura deserves the congratulations of the Socialist Group, which I pass on to him with pleasure."
"Culture 2000, for the reasons which have just been expressed, is an extraordinarily important programme."
"The joint position of the Council has not yet accepted the Parliament' s criteria and the rapporteur, reasonably, has retained in this second reading the ones which he considers to be essential."
"Firstly I must highlight funding."
"We do not understand, given the margin within the Financial Perspective, why a third of the resources which we considered minimums have been cut."
"On the other hand, we agree with the Council on the need for the activities of Culture 2000 to be visible to the public, but the best way to achieve this is through small and medium scale events, in diverse locations and close to the citizens, rather than events on a grand scale."
"The Council confuses public reaction with media reaction and forgets that in the latter case the reaction is almost always ephemeral."
"The Council, or rather, a small part of it, has ignored the spirit and the letter of the Treaties and specifically Article 151."
"It is still afraid of expressions such as ""European Policy"" and ""European Cultural Area"" etc. and prefers to carry on speaking of ""partnership"" ."
"Legislating and taking action in the field of culture and education directly shapes the European soul which has so often been elusive."
"The system of knowledge, the human emotions which only the Arts and Letters can produce, in other words, our culture, are deeply based on what the Europeans have in common and therefore form the basis of European citizenship."
"I hope that the steadfastness of this Parliament, on the one hand, and the help of the new Commissioner on the other, together finally with the understanding of the Council, will all come to act together to this end."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to congratulate Mr Graça Moura on his outstanding work."
"The liberal group warmly endorses the amendments that he has submitted."
"As far as the level of the Budget is concerned, the liberal group too feels that the Council' s efforts fall short of the mark."
"There are a few points that I would like to emphasise."
"Firstly, the cultural networks."
"The Council' s text literally states that financed projects must operate with the aid of networks."
"According to this text cultural networks ought only to be able to make claims of the Framework Programme on culture for individual projects."
"However, they should also be able to receive support for some of their recurring expenses."
"For if there is money available for the project, but not for keeping the network' s office running, then there will be no support for the project and the experience gained will be wasted."
"My second point is that the programme now takes full account of the importance of reading and translation."
"However, I am rather concerned as to whether the money will be distributed effectively."
"There must be proportional representation as far as promotion, translation and cultural exchanges are concerned, and these must not compete with each other."
"The literary translation establishments, which play an important part in making our cultural heritage accessible, are particularly at risk."
"That is why I intend to see to it that they continue to receive some of the money."
"My final point, Mr President, is that I was not happy with the budgetary procedure."
"The members of the Committee on Culture have a better understanding than the Committee on Budgets as to how the money should be distributed amongst cultural and educational institutions."
"Let the Committee on Budgets establish the framework and the specialised committee get down to work on the priorities as regards content and the financial interpretation thereof."
"I await with interest the discussion that the budget rapporteur has announced which will take place on the way in which the financial resources in chapter A 30 of the budget for 2001 are allocated."
"Mr President, I just wanted to make a few general points in connection with cultural matters."
"Although everyone appears to agree that culture is important in theory, in practice the situation is often quite different in Europe."
"Europe seems to be more interested in agriculture than culture."
"They only differ by four letters but that certainly makes a very big difference at the budgetary level."
"Any MEP with cultural sensitivities is still moved to read the European Council' s declarations of love when it comes to cultural matters."
"But this emotion soon gives way to disillusionment when the words are not followed by deeds, particularly where budgets are concerned."
"For there is nothing that the European Union spends so little on as culture and savings even have to be made in the little that we do spend, notwithstanding the fact that everyone always agrees that promoting culture is probably the only way to make the EU popular with its citizens."
"I therefore think that it would be particularly misguided of this Parliament not to follow the rapporteur' s recommendations, for you cannot keep saying that you think it is a shame that an ever-decreasing number of people vote in European elections, or that you regret that every inquiry shows that the EU appears to be ever more distant from the people of Europe, only to go making cutbacks in projects whose precise intention it is to bring the EU closer to the people."
"We certainly feel that we ought not to finance large-scale, expensive projects, but rather small-scale projects that the people of Europe can identify with and which could make a tremendous contribution at the socio-economic level in terms of job opportunities."
"Now that we are talking about the Europe of the next century, a new, wider Europe, an enlarged Europe, would it not perhaps be useful to pursue a bold cultural policy at long last, for culture is not something that should be talked about in the way that all the other ""important"" matters are discussed."
"Now that everything appears to be discussed in economic terms, perhaps it is time for us to start showing more interest in what are, after all, the origins of Europe, notably our culture."
"Mr President, I would first like to point out how important Mr Graça Moura' s report is."
"The construction of a cultural Europe is now proving to be just as great a necessity as the construction of a political Europe, which has until now been an economic and monetary Europe."
"Whether we are aiming for a cultural policy or promoting cultural activities, the findings are the same. The budget allocated to the ""Culture 2000"" programme is ridiculously small."
"Is it acceptable that the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport has been given EUR 167.33 million per year when it is asking for EUR 250 million?"
"Community expenditure on culture stands at 0.003%."
"Is it really appropriate to welcome the adoption of such a budget?"
"Mrs Reding herself, in the September hearings spoke of cultural action in a way that suggested it was being recognised belatedly."
"Let us find a way of making up the lost time that is obvious to everyone, with an adapted budget."
"The rapporteur also stresses the link between culture and citizenship."
"I think in fact that greater balance is necessary between the budgets allocated to ambitious cultural events and the targeted projects."
"The construction of European citizenship will come about as a result of the involvement of individuals, not only of institutions"
"In view of this reticence where budgets are concerned, I would like to make a concluding observation."
"What can we say about a Europe which is proud, and rightly so, to defend its cultural diversity at the forthcoming WTO negotiations if we are not capable of giving real support to this cultural expression?"
"I would not like the budget for culture to become inversely proportional to our cultural ambitions."
"Mr President, it is very important that we have finally succeeded in including explicit references to culture in the Treaty."
"Indeed, at this delicate stage for the European Union, while we begin to enlarge eastwards, while all the economic and financial changes linked to the creation of the single currency are already underway, we must not forget the value of culture, the specificity and diversity of European culture, its enhancement and its diffusion."
"Culture, which also means history, languages and traditions, must remain a fundamental and indispensable bond for European citizens."
"We must therefore welcome the new Culture 2000 programme, but reiterate some considerations which, moreover, most of my fellow Members have already done."
"Firstly, we need to encourage and stimulate the European citizens and European associations and small businesses in this sector to make as much use as possible of this programme, but avoid concentrating the meagre funds on only a few large events, to the advantage of a few privileged networks which, in the long run, as past experience has taught us, end up monopolising these funds."
"Secondly, in any case, we would need to make an effort to increase the funds laid down for this programme."
"To conclude, Europe must not forget that investing in culture does not mean simply preserving a great legacy and our identity as Europeans, but also the creation of many new jobs."
"Mr President, I think that the European citizens are currently in great need of this."
"Mr President, I wish to support the Culture 2000 programme and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Vasco Graça Moura, for having enriched the text as a whole with new contributions aimed, on the one hand, at achieving greater participation of countries and beneficiaries and, on the other, at emphasising the need to diversify the grants, as well as recommendations in defence of the deconcentration of activities and great cultural events."
"In this same respect, I wish to communicate to the Commission my concern about the development and subsequent implementation of the programmes, in all their fields."
"The success of Culture 2000 will depend largely on its capacity to implement new working methods and to bring these offers of cooperation closer to a citizens' Europe."
"It is important that the Commission itself and the Member States achieve greater efficiency in communication, expand their advice and information services and cooperate in the task of guiding and advising possible beneficiaries."
"The announcements of grants must be published with sufficient notice and must reach all points of Europe, allowing applicants sufficient time to find partners and seek supplementary aid."
"If we intend culture to be active at a grassroots level and for the majority of individuals to be involved in it, it is necessary for the European Union to come closer to them and for the details of the grants to be published in the sections of the media with the widest audience."
"On the other hand, I believe there is a consensus amongst all of us who have been involved and all the parties that small-scale creative elements should be supported."
"At the same time, it would be appropriate to favour, through the selection criteria, the proposals of individuals and groups, since it is necessary to compensate for the tendency of institutions to become the protagonists in terms of cultural production."
"Although it is easier to operate through the procedures of agencies and institutions, the basic purpose of the programme will be to break this barrier and favour culture at the grassroots of society, given that their function is not to create an official culture."
"On the other hand, Mrs Reding, I would like to offer you my full support with regard to funding: I am conscious that pressure must be exerted on Mr Prodi and the College of Commissioners and I know that you will strive earnestly to achieve this improvement."
"Mr President, I would like to touch on one aspect of cultural diversity needing support: minority languages."
"Europe should take pride in its linguistic diversity."
"The European Union has done much to promote its wealth of cultures and I congratulate Commissioner Reding on her work in this regard."
"Many in this new Parliament might not remember that in May 1998 budget lines for minority languages were frozen because they had no legal basis."
"Will the Commission now guarantee that a legal basis for these projects is introduced?"
"The situation of 1998 cannot be allowed to arise again."
"Lesser-used languages must be granted the funding they deserve, otherwise excellent innovative projects - drama, the translating of literature following the end of the Ariane project - the teaching of languages and so on will all suffer."
"As a Welsh speaker, I have seen the significant benefits of European funding but also the threat to many excellent projects when financial support is withdrawn."
"As the budget has already been frozen for 16 months it is unlikely that any schemes under the Culture 2000 programme will come into being until 2001."
"It is crucial therefore that the Commission uses its preparatory measures to ensure that current projects do not now suffer."
"Languages are more than mere words."
"They are the vehicles by which the cultures of Europe are expressed and celebrated also."
"Let us hope that Commissioner Reding' s words become reality and that every language is respected and promoted regardless of the numbers who speak it."
"Mr President, last Tuesday we received Mr Pastrana, the President of Colombia, in this Hemicycle, and all welcomed his proposed peace plan."
"In Europe we also have on-going political conflicts which result from cultural differences."
"Two of them have also taken a violent form: Northern Ireland and the Basque Country."
"I wish to state here my support not only for Colombia and other countries but also for the current peace processes in these two regions, which are part of Europe."
"I call on the Council, the Commission and this Parliament to ensure that the mechanisms of the Culture 2000 programme, as well as the other programmes available, are also used to support these peace initiatives."
"We should opt for events such as the European Culture Capital and the Month of Culture taking place in Northern Ireland or the Basque Country, since this new political framework for Europe may offer valid solutions to these two conflicts."
"In these areas we need to promote the values of tolerance and respect for cultural diversity and the freedom of peoples to decide their future and promote co-existence, solidarity and a sense of justice and peace."
"This is what we should opt for."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to warmly congratulate your rapporteur on his excellent work, and the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport for the support it has given to the rapporteur."
"I would like to tell you how much the Commission appreciates the fact that the rapporteur for the ""Culture 2000"" programme is one of today' s major poets."
"I would like to tell you, although this is perhaps only anecdotal, that one of Mr Graça Moura' s books is to be translated into Swedish this year thanks to the Ariane programme."
"That just shows that European culture does travel!"
"Your rapporteur has submitted a very constructive report, based on an in-depth analysis of the needs of cultural cooperation."
"The report clearly shows, if it were still necessary, Parliament' s commitment to this programme and to the cultures of Europe."
"The ""Culture 2000"" programme is the first framework-programme for culture."
"It will enable us to develop a common cultural area designed to encourage creativity, cooperation and exchanges, one which will safeguard the heritage and history of the European peoples, generate a greater understanding of them, and which will encourage cultures to flourish."
"You have stressed, both in your speeches and even, previously, during our brief encounters in the corridors of Parliament, the positive aspects and the things which can be improved in the day-to-day running of this programme."
"I have taken careful note of the problems relating to the breakdown of funds, the implementation of specific programmes and the treatment of languages."
"I would like to thank you above all, though, for the speed with which you have worked."
"This is in the interests of our citizens because, as you know, the conciliation procedure between Parliament and the Council must begin quickly so that our citizens will be able to feel the benefits of our ""Culture 2000"" programme in the year 2000."
"I am aware of Parliament' s expectations and I want to say quite clearly that I share them."
"This is why the Commission can accept most of the amendments introduced by Parliament."
"These are amendments 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 14."
"I am not now going to repeat the content of these amendments, as you know them better than I do."
"I would just like to say that, in principle, the Commission accepts amendment 4 on commitology, on condition that there is a simple cross-reference in the text to the management procedure laid down by the decision of the Council on 28 June 1999, which sets out the conditions for exercising the competences for implementation granted to the Commission."
"I would also like to make an observation on amendment 12: The Commission accepts this amendment although we would like to maintain a certain degree of flexibility in order to be able, in the conciliation phase, to bring the positions of the Council and Parliament more into line on this specific point."
"I propose to partially accept amendments 7, 11 and 13."
"Amendment 7, on integrated action within the transnational cultural cooperation agreements, consists of two parts."
"The first concerns the role of the committee and, more specifically, the obligation of the managers of projects that we have financed, to submit a report of the action it has undertaken directly to the committee, because supervision is the task of the Commission, which must also take responsibility for the management of the programme."
"Secondly, there is the part that envisages specifying ""heritage specialists"" ."
"The Commission cannot accept the use of this very general term, which would make the list of the programme' s potential beneficiaries much longer, with practical consequences that are impossible to foresee."
"This does not mean, of course, that we do not accept the preservation of our heritage, quite the opposite. This has been well provided for in the Parliament amendments which we have accepted."
"I have just one observation regarding that part of amendment 7 which the Commission has accepted, and this concerns terminology."
"We should actually use the terms ""Member or Associate States"" . This is quite a small correction."
"We can accept amendment 11 relating to the role of information by means of cultural contact points on condition that their regional activities, which can be conducted as a complement to their national role, are done so on the basis of the measures in force in the various Member States and that they do not involve any increase in the Community' s overall financial contribution."
"The Commission will obviously discuss with the Member States the breakdown of this aid between the national and regional levels."
"The Commission accepts amendment 13 which proposes criteria relating to the distribution of the budget among the main cultural fields, whilst raising from 9% to 11% the percentage in favour of activities in the books and reading sector whose annual subsidy would decrease slightly in relation to the Ariane project."
"This will certainly please your rapporteur."
"I have listened carefully to all your demands for the budget."
"I agree with you wholeheartedly, but we cannot ignore the Realpolitik and, as you well know, the budgetary authorities do not always share our views."
"I am therefore forced to maintain my original position on amendment 3 and cannot accept the proposal seeking to raise the budget from EUR 167 million to EUR 250 million."
"The three institutions are in fact committed to respecting the budgetary programme and only the budgetary authorities can implement a modification."
"Of course, if such a modification were to be implemented, the Commission would be delighted, but given the current state of affairs, I feel compelled to refuse this amendment."
"Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that we are able to vote for ""Culture 2000"" today."
"This will be a new starting point for our citizens who expect us, in addition to taking economic action, to make the people, the culture, the roots and the diversity that contribute to the richness of Europe our central concern."
"It is from this perspective, and in the hope that we will be able to make rapid progress in the direction our citizens wish, that I ask you to vote for this report."
"Thank you, Mrs Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Youth programme"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0038/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council decision establishing the Youth Community action programme [13175/1/1999 - C5-0022/1999 - 1998/0197(COD)] (rapporteur: Mrs Gröner)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on 28 August 1998, the Commission submitted a proposal for an order by the European Parliament and the Council to introduce the Community action programme, ""Youth"" for the period 2000-2004. The programme was passed on to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport as the Committee in overall charge."
"The existing youth programmes, ""Youth for Europe III"" and ""European Voluntary Service"" were combined in the Commission' s proposal and their objectives given more concentrated form."
"Our Committee has worked very quickly and efficiently and, on 28 October 1998, it unanimously adopted the de Coene report with 61 amendments."
"The plenary sitting accepted this report on a first reading on 5 November."
"We wanted to give equal status to the European Voluntary Service and ""Youth for Europe"" ."
"The proposed amendments were to bring the programme closer to young people and so to the European Union."
"Our emphases were, and are, on increasing the budget resources for the programme - the Commission had proposed EUR 600 million and ourselves EUR 800 million - in order to double the number of young people who are being targeted."
"Through our amendments, we wanted to help simplify the structures, improve communication with the target group, make the implementation procedures transparent, increase the participation of disadvantaged groups, spread information about the programme more broadly in order to improve access to it and, finally, make the age limits for participants more flexible in order, through the commitology, to find horizontal solutions."
"The proposed programme was then blocked in the Council until, under the German Presidency, it resulted in a Common Position' s being adopted on 28 June, based on a proposed five-year programme involving EUR 350 million."
"That corresponds to an expenditure of less than EUR 0.20 per citizen per year for the youth exchange programme and is in the region of a per mill of the overall budget."
"I cannot imagine a European family without young people, nor any programme which neglects significant sections of the young population."
"The European Parliament therefore welcomes the fact that the Common Position in the form of a number of amendments is being passed to ourselves."
"We have been able, through the programme, to implement respect for human rights and also to combat racism and xenophobia."
"We have created a situation in which attention has been given to removing discrimination in such a way as to promote equality of opportunity between girls and boys and, in implementing these measures in cooperation with the Commission, the approach is user-friendly and youth oriented."
"We have succeeded in guaranteeing that the European Voluntary Service does not take the place of any potential or existing paid employment."
"If now, with the unanimous support of Committee 13, I am bringing in further amendments, these relate first and foremost again to funding, duration and prevailing upon Member States to remove obstacles to gaining access to the programme."
"As the very first priority, social protection and access to medical care for young people must be ensured."
"Regulations could be laid down in this area, as they have been for student exchanges."
"It is also a question of introducing a structure for gathering information about young people and for setting up an Internet website for ""Youth in Europe"" and ""Youth for Europe"" in order, on an interactive basis, to reach new strata of young Europeans."
"In order to be able to address young citizens directly, the importance of this programme, which is to commence at the beginning of next year, must be clear to everyone involved in the process."
"The ""Socrates"" and ""Leonardo"" programmes have shown that a seven-year programme can be more effective than a programme which runs for just a few years."
"I therefore recommend that a period of seven years be proposed here and that the financial framework for implementing this programme be set at EUR 980 million."
"I propose a mid-term review for the middle of the seven-year period, together with an evaluation and reassessment of the youth programme."
"A prerequisite for the success of the programme is a method of disseminating information which is not only directed at the initiated."
"We must succeed in getting young people enthusiastic about Europe and helping, for example, to foster in them an appetite for Europe and to mitigate their social or financial problems or the effects of living on the periphery of things."
"Age limits ought not to be rigidly adhered."
"The potency and the wealth of Europe lie in its diversity."
"I again appeal to the Member States to make commitments regarding social protection and medical care."
"We respect the principle of subsidiarity but, in this area, the responsibility of the Member States must also have an effect."
"It is now a matter of ensuring that deeds follow the fine words spoken at summits."
"Informal contacts with the Presidency of the Council and with the Commission provide hope of agreement here, for young people and their associations expect not bureaucratic but pragmatic action from the European institutions, as well as cooperation between the latter."
"As an elected Parliament, we bear a responsibility."
"As rapporteur, I shall do everything humanly possible to find a sustainable compromise, and I urge the Council to approach us, above all when the budget comes round."
"Europe' s future begins with the youth of today."
"That must be the message on 1 January when, hopefully, the new programme can come into effect."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for her work."
"As a reminder, I should like again quite briefly to sketch out the new action programme in the youth field for the period 2000 to 2007."
"The action programme sets out to contribute to the realisation of a European sphere of education which promotes lifelong learning and facilitates the unrestricted exercise of citizens' rights."
"By means of this action programme, the various programmes in the youth field which there have been so far ought to be brought together in concentrated form, as the rapporteur has just said."
"Although the new action programme is to take the various programmes there have been so far and bring them together in concentrated form, no single programme is to be preferred."
"Parliament has already approached the Commission to see to it that the relationship of the one programme to another is well-balanced, thereby guaranteeing a better distribution of financial resources."
"In this way, the new action programme will, in some ways, be easier to take an overview of and also, therefore, more citizen-friendly than the numerous youth programmes that are all too scattered."
"A further advantage for citizens is the considerable decentralisation of the youth programme which therefore also enables young people to take part in the programmes in their home areas."
"I think this is very important because it also provides an opportunity for contact with Europe for young people in whom an interest in this area has not been inculcated at home."
"The earlier young people get together with people of other nationalities in Europe, the sooner they will take an active part in the integration of Europe."
"The youth action programme also promotes the integration of Europe in a further sense by including the applicant countries in the East, Cyprus, Malta and Turkey."
"In this way, young people have the opportunity to become aware of the cultural diversity, not only of those States which are already members of the European Community, but also of those which are still on the borders of this Community but large groups of whose populations already live in various Member States."
"This state of affairs in turn has a positive effect upon the struggle for the respect of human rights and against racism, exaggerated nationalism and anti-Semitism."
"In this way, young people actively contribute to the construction and integration of Europe."
"By contributing to programmes with participants from various Member States, young people discover the real Europe in its social and cultural diversity and become alert to new surroundings, something which greatly increases the incentive to learn a foreign language."
"For a programme of seven years' duration, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport requires an overall financial package of EUR 980 million."
"However, the Council is only prepared to approve exactly half of the amount we requested."
"I believe that I do not have to repeat yet again here that this sum is in fact spread over seven years, meaning an annual amount of EUR 140 million."
"As Mrs Gröner has already quite rightly said, this money is not being invested just anywhere but in the future of Europe, a future which lies with the youth of Europe."
"The education of European youth is not an area in which money-saving measures are to be taken."
"It is therefore important that Parliament should agree to the programme with a large majority so that we can enter into negotiations with the Council with definite backing."
"Mr President, the Youth programme has been one of the most successful programmes in getting people from different nationalities to work together and learn from each other."
"If I can take Scotland, which I represent, as an example, there have been hundreds of Youth programmes benefiting thousands of Scots."
"For example, in Fort William in the Highlands of Scotland, a Youth group interested in outdoor projects developed a cross-country ski programme with Slovakian counterparts."
"In Dundee an exchange of views and experiences has developed with a Spanish project concerning the current problems being experienced by young people."
"In West Lothian a project has been developed on street work with a partnership from Munich."
"In fact only yesterday a group from the Lothians were here listening to a debate in this Chamber."
"To end my list of examples: a link between Larkhall in Lanarkshire and a French programme where young people have contributed to the construction of a cycle path in the south of Scotland."
"From youth work to cross-country skiing, from cycle paths to street work, the issues are as diverse as the participants."
"And if this is just a small number of examples of how the Youth programme has worked in Scotland, just think what an impact the Youth programme has had across the EU and the potential of what it can achieve in the future."
"However, funding for the Youth programme is not just critical, it is paramount."
"Young people like myself are the Europeans of the present and the future."
"We are the first generation to relate to a European identity as well as our own national ones."
"If these very institutions which we are members of are to have relevance today as well as tomorrow, funding of the Youth programme is essential."
"I encourage Members to go back to their constituencies and to speak to the organisers, participants and beneficiaries of this work, the work which brings the basic ideas of the European ideal to local communities: the ideal of people from different nationalities working together for the benefit of the common good."
"Please support this report and support the work of young people in Europe."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Gröner on her excellent and also particularly succinct work."
"I see cross-border youth exchange programmes as a good opportunity for young people to get to know each other' s cultures, at the same time making a contribution to the edifice of Europe."
"They enable young people to gain greater awareness of the differences in their surroundings and make it possible for mutual trust to grow, which lessens fear of anything that is unfamiliar."
"This increases people' s tolerance and their willingness to cooperate and show solidarity."
"In short, democracy is strengthened and that is what Europe needs."
"Money is needed for this, on a large scale even, in view of the importance of the programme."
"But the liberal group feels nonetheless that this programme too must stay within the financial framework."
"Secondly, I would just like to emphasise here how important it is to have good communication with young people."
"The communication medium par excellence is, of course, the Internet."
"That is why an Internet site ""Youth for Europe"" is an absolute must."
"Young people will then be able to read about all kinds of European and national activities in the field of education, training, sport, media, leisure, and so on and so forth."
"The possibilities are there, use them."
"In this way young people will become well informed by doing something which is very appealing to them, that is surfing the digital highway."
"I expect it to be a website that is challenging, innovative and highly accessible."
"On a final note, the programme must be set up soon."
"Mrs Gröner was right not to submit too many amendments so as to enable agreement with the Council to be reached quickly."
"Consequently, the vast majority of the liberal group intends to support her in all aspects of her work, in which it has every confidence."
"Mr President, the strengthening of the European Union cannot be achieved solely through the euro."
"Our young people must feel integrated, not separated by borders, and have a more open, free mentality."
"In short, they must gain that ability to adapt and that speed in cultural exchange, training and professional experience which are increasingly necessary elements in the society of the next millennium."
"""Youth"" is a programme which will be able to achieve these aims. Above all, it allows the least well-off and most disadvantaged young people to have experiences of other countries which could prove decisive when they enter the job market."
"It is therefore a priority to ensure, as highlighted by the rapporteur, a greater diffusion of the programme and to make sure that, in future, Community actions like this one will not remain a privilege for a minority because of a lack of information."
"I fully agree with criticisms that the Council has not been willing to increase the budget, which is necessary for equal opportunities of access to the programme."
"Moreover, it is incredible that full protection of the participants cannot be ensured as far as social protection and medical assistance is concerned."
"To conclude, I would like to emphasise that in a society which is leaning towards telematics networks and the Internet, and which increasingly invests in their use, for communication, information and services, it is almost ridiculous that the Council has not accepted the amendments on the creation of an Internet site dedicated entirely to young people."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Gröner for her excellent report."
"As regards an analysis of the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people, I believe it is essential to include an analysis of the role of the family or lack of family in the young person' s development."
"In the Council of Europe report on Coherent and Integrated Family Policies it states: ""Families play a primary role in socialisation because they communicate the values, standards, customs and behaviour of the social group to which their children belong."
"Presumably a lack of family structure will also affect the child' s socialisation."""
"Whether a child is raised within or without a family, both circumstances will have a profound effect upon that child' s social development."
"Therefore reference to the role of the family should be, I believe, included in the European Community Youth Programme, which hopes to analyse the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people."
"Mr President, I should like to remind this House that in Agenda 2000 we give a high priority to youth education and training but this priority is not reflected within the budget allocation to the Youth Action Programme."
"Yet this programme is about investing in our future, investing in young people who will become, as we have heard today, the Europeans of tomorrow."
"Through these action programmes we will change young lives, offering hope and options where before there were none."
"In my region, the West Midlands of England, thousands of young people have benefited."
"I want more to benefit, not fewer."
"Finally, it is rather apt, following Mrs Scallon, that I say this: let us remind ourselves in this House that these young people will become the generation that finally rid our continent of racism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia and the other discriminations which shame us all!"
"It is our duty to support this report and to support the youth programmes."
"And I would point out to Mrs Scallon that the term ""Family"" has been used politically to exclude more people than it has ever been used to include."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"Mr President, Commission Representative, Mrs Angelilli commented that we are just speaking of the euro, although there are many other important issues here."
"I would like to say to her that the birth of the euro is a very important thing for us young people too."
"The Community' s Youth Action programme is one of the most important programmes targeted at the citizens of the European Union."
"It has been a success both in the operational sense and with regard to its publicity value."
"Although Parliament also decides the framework and main policies of the programme, it is important to remember that the successful implementation of programmes can only be carried out at national level."
"In the implementation of the Youth programme the Member States must allow for sufficient leeway and provide the necessary support."
"The Youth programme, despite its success, is not ready or complete."
"The programme' s application procedure has to be further clarified and be made more user-friendly, which is what has already been said here."
"The problems of youth programmes often originate in the fact that there is an attempt to reach as large a target group as possible with different sector programmes."
"In this way we try to make it possible for people who are as young as possible to take advantage of the programmes."
"Experience, however, has shown that a target group that is too heterogeneous increases the amount of administrative work required to assess applications and might even adversely affect the chances of certain special groups to use the programmes."
"Youth programme evaluation must clearly be improved."
"We have to make more use of the ideas of national players in the implementation of programmes."
"Programme evaluation should also pay attention to the programme' s cost-effectiveness."
"For example, the group meeting sector programme is considerably cheaper than the European voluntary service and, furthermore, a greater number of young people derive benefit from the group meeting."
"Sport has been included as an added dimension to the Youth programme."
"This is an important step forward."
"Before the programme is implemented, we must, however, be clear about what sort of sports the Youth programme funds may be spent on."
"Funds must be targeted mainly at emphasising the educational dimension of sport."
"Programme resources can easily be used up in mere sporting events unless restrictions are imposed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have been elected to the European Parliament as leader of the Italian Pensioners' Party."
"An hour ago, someone in my Group said: ""Fatuzzo, you must have bumped your head - you are from the Pensioners' Party and are speaking about the youth programme!"" ."
"Yes, two days ago I did indeed have a slight accident, but that is not why I am talking about the youth programme."
"I am speaking about it because I want people to know that in Italy, the Pensioners' Party and the pensioners - and I think all Europe' s elderly people too - agree with this youth programme, and are in favour of young people meeting each other, learning languages, going from Ireland to Italy, to Portugal, to Finland."
"This programme is extremely important because it brings Europe to young people."
"However, I also tried replacing the word ""young"" with ""elderly"" in the programme we are discussing today and I saw a wonderful project appearing, which would be worthwhile too, because it is true, as Mr Taylor said, that this is the first generation who have a European identity and, as Mrs Gröner said, that the future of Europe starts with the young."
"But the elderly who constructed Europe - do we think about them sometimes?"
"Well, I am taking the adoption of this youth programme as a starting point to say: ""Build, let us build together a programme for cultural exchange among the elderly too!"" ."
"Maybe we will not spend a billion in seven years, given the age of the elderly, but seven billion in one year."
"It is not very much, but it certainly is positive."
"Mr President, a short comment."
"I should like to point out that the English text has been changed."
"In amendment 12, a portion of the proposal withdrawn by Mrs Scallon has found its way back into the German version."
"Spiritual undertakings ought to be included in the investigation of activities."
"This runs the risk of our suddenly also having sects for young people included in the programme."
"This part of the amendment had been withdrawn at the Committee stage."
"I would ask you to check the language versions for which the English text provides the basis."
"Mr President, I should like wholeheartedly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, on her efforts and on the energy with which she has moved this project forward."
"I should also like to thank the Members of the Committee, for it is them we have to thank for the fact that we can today vote on a project which will in fact be available to young people very quickly."
"Speed was required, and speed was what we got."
"Please accept my sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission."
"I must also highlight the very positive attitude of the Finnish Presidency, which has also done its best to ensure that work progresses, and I think that the cooperation established between the two institutions in order to take the negotiation forwards as quickly as possible is quite exemplary."
"As the point has been raised, I would like to inform you, on the subject of information on the ""Youth"" programmes, that the Eurodesk network, a combination of Internet sites and youth advisory services, is available in all the countries of the Union and in all its languages."
"This is a first step towards achieving what Parliament is requesting and I shall say, for the sake of the anecdote, that it is a programme that was developed on the basis of a Scottish project."
"This shows that the things that work well in the regions are taken up by the Commission."
"I would also like to tell you that the Commission is receptive to the conclusions of the report that your Parliament has produced."
"I am therefore able to accept almost all of the amendments."
"The 13 amendments tabled by Mrs Gröner will be totally or partially accepted at second reading."
"We rejected certain parts of amendments for what are basically institutional reasons."
"This is the case, for example, regarding the interinstitutional declaration on the significance of the sums deemed necessary, amendment 9 part 3."
"One aspect of the amendment may also concern implementation. I am thinking here of amendment 12, part 2."
"Concerning finances, I have listened very closely to what you have said and I agree with you."
"As you know, in the initial proposal, and in accordance with the priorities established in Agenda 2000, the Commission proposes a financial package of EUR 600 million over a period of five years."
"Given that I agree with your amendment to extend the period from five to seven years, we will of course have to review the sum provided by the budget accordingly."
"I think, like your rapporteur, that in order to maintain consistency between the programmes on education, training and youth, we must extend the length of the period from five to seven years."
"I have indeed just confirmed this."
"I also consider it essential to find a solution to the obstacles that remain in the area of youth mobility, whilst of course respecting each State' s own competences."
"This is why we are able to accept amendments 2, 3 and 6."
"Besides, some amendments provide useful clarification for the text of the Council' s common proposal and we feel able to accept these too."
"These are amendments 1, 4, 5, 9 part 2, 10, 11, 12 part 1, as well as amendment 13, tabled by Mrs Gröner and Mrs Scallon."
"It goes without saying that article 7 concerning the programming committee will have to take into account the new decision on commitology."
"We are thus able to accept, in principle, amendments 7 and 8, as long as the appropriate wording can be found of course."
"In order to follow up this report, I am intending to propose to the Commission that we adopt a modified proposal on the basis of the amendments that we can accept."
"We will present this modified proposal to the Commission before the Council meeting due to take place on 23 November in order to assist the Ministers for Youth in reaching a decision."
"As you well know, ladies and gentlemen, we still have a small battle to fight, but I remain confident in the objectives and stakes of the ""Youth"" programmes, and I have no doubts that these objectives will be accepted just as completely by the Council and by the Member States."
"I must tell you how delighted I have been to note the enthusiasm that has been expressed here, the enthusiasm with which young and not so young Members have committed themselves to ensuring that the youth of our continent may, in future - even more so than in the past, because everyone was also in agreement in pointing out that the ""Youth"" programme has already given a great deal to millions of young people - build on what has already been well done."
"Young people are our present. Together with us they are building the future."
"They are building their future."
"With this programme we will be giving them a helping hand. I thank you, on behalf of the young people of Europe, for having contributed towards giving them this helping hand."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"European Audiovisual Observatory"
"The next item is the report (A5-0024/1999) by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the proposal for a Council decision concerning Community participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory (COM(1999) 111 - C5-0019/1999 - 1999/0066(CNS))."
"Mr President, I would start by saying that in a letter of 6 July 1999 the Council consulted Parliament pursuant to Article 157, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning Community participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory."
"At the sitting of 23 July, the President of Parliament proposed that the Committee, chaired by myself, should examine the subject, and in its meeting of 27 July, the Committee on Culture and Youth appointed me rapporteur."
"During the meetings of 22 September and 11 and 12 October, the Committee considered the proposal and the draft report, which it adopted unanimously."
"The European Audiovisual Observatory, Mr President, is a very important public service body, which aims to gather and disseminate information on the audiovisual industry: cinema, television, video etc."
"As a whole, its members include at least 34 European States and the Commission of the European Union. With regard to its network of partners, correspondents and various organisms, its mission cannot be confused - this is an important and fundamental fact, which the Committee discussed at length - with Eurostat' s mission and its tasks in this sector."
"They are two different things."
"While the Community body aims for a harmonised, systematic collection of general statistics from various States, with the public and administrations as its main clients, who therefore provide it with work, the observatory has more specific and focused objectives, according to the market and the statistical requirements of firms and professionals."
"Moreover, its sphere of competence is broader: it extends into the legal sector, to specialist information, and its mandate, which covers the 34 States - and I stress this once again - is broader than that of Eurostat."
"The two institutions must not be too far opposed, or rather, they must not and cannot be opposed as they are in regular contact, have also established their modus operandi and have come to an agreement on the way their activities are to be carried out."
"On the other hand, the Court of Justice' s ruling of 12 May 1998 concerning the legal bases called for a better defined framework with respect to the past because of the previous confusion."
"The new line concerns the preparatory measures of the audiovisual sector."
"It does not refer to former Article 130(3) regarding industrial development and the decisions on the basis of which a Eureka programme was founded for the audiovisual sector."
"A category seeking to create an infrastructure of statistical information has been envisaged."
"This should allow payment of the Community' s contribution to the budget of the European Observatory of Strasbourg for 1999, that is for the current year."
"The delay has certainly hindered and is still hindering the functioning of the institution. And I think - and moreover, this is the opinion of the entire Committee - that its functioning is important and fundamental for the European Commission and for the 34 Member States which are members and which continue to be active members in the observatory."
"On the other hand, I believe we will have the chance to cooperate on these issues with the excellent Commissioner, Mrs Reding, and I take this opportunity to greet her and thank her for her willingness on the matter."
"Mr President, having the honour to chair the Committee on Culture, naturally I also represent its position."
"As I said at the beginning, the final vote was unanimous and of the three amendments, two were adopted unanimously and one was adopted by a majority."
"On a personal note, however, I would like to say that I did not agree with the third amendment, in the sense that the decision we are about to adopt and that the Commission has already brought forward should have expired in the original text on the last day of the last month of the fifth year, while the Commission has shortened the time period to three years."
"I repeat that, personally, I have some doubts because I think that we are making a distinction between Eurostat and the observatory which will maybe not lead to cooperation, although that has been decided on recently."
"On the other hand, the justified concern which was worrying Mr Perry - he is a signatory of the amendment - that over the next few years Parliament would have to control the expenditure and budget of the observatory, will still be valid when we change the five year period, that is when we give the observatory the chance to plan the valuable functions that it has in a broader and more organised way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am new to this Parliament."
"Allow me to make a comment: debates about cultural policy - a handful of people are present who are, however, by and large like-minded."
"I believe we have an almighty struggle ahead of us."
"And because there are so few of us, we must also stick together here."
"Turning now to the Observatory."
"As rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy that was asked for an opinion, I naturally speak in favour of the Community' s participating in the European Audiovisual Observatory."
"I also concur with the Commission' s proposal that the period of this involvement should be set at five years."
"As already mentioned, the Observatory counts 34 European countries as members and therefore almost anticipates the forthcoming enlargement of the EU as well. It does not just confine itself to market research and to gathering statistics and does not therefore only juggle with figures."
"Instead, it offers qualitative analyses and goes so far as to provide legal information. It is, above all, especially important to have information about the resources available to particular branches of industry."
"Information of this kind is of course important when overseeing, evaluating and formulating Community programmes in the audiovisual sector, and it is of decisive importance to industry itself and especially to small and medium-sized businesses."
"This is where my only criticism comes in."
"According to my researches, it is, in many Member States, precisely the small and medium-sized businesses which know anything from not enough to nothing at all about the Observatory."
"And yet it is they which would find using this service of great importance."
"Respective contacts were challenged and questioned about this matter at various levels, and I am pleased that, at my suggestion, the Commission has made a really good proposal, namely to include a clearly visible link on its home page."
"I hope that this proposal is also soon translated into action."
"In view of the forthcoming negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, during which the audiovisual sector will also be discussed, it is becoming ever clearer how important it is for reliable information about markets in Europe to be available not only to political decision-makers such as the Community bodies, the governments of the Member States and the social and economic decision-makers of the Member States and regions, but also to researchers, universities and the media."
"Mr President, I am sure I speak for more or less everybody in the Chamber this afternoon when I say that we believe culture does not get enough money."
"The question is what do the Members who are not here think?"
"What they would all agree is that we must make sure that we get value for the limited amount of money that we have to spend on culture."
"I really need to be convinced that we are getting value for money out of the audiovisual observatory."
"That is why I tabled, and supported, Amendment No 3 that was put forward by the Committee on Culture, restricting our commitment to three years."
"It could be extended, but our commitment is for three years."
"My reasoning is threefold: what substantive evidence do we have that the audiovisual observatory is doing the job that we want?"
"Let me quote Mrs Dührkop Dührkop in her report on this."
"She said that Parliament' s own audiovisual services had a negative perception of the quality and usefulness of the paid services provided by the observatory."
"We are running a EUR 6 billion deficit with the United States."
"Clearly we are getting something wrong and we need to get that put right."
"Secondly, I would say that we are financing statistical services from too many angles. The observatory itself: EUR 215,000;"
"Eurostat: EUR 250,000;"
"That is almost EUR 1 million we are spending on statistics alone."
"The observatory is used to perform those tasks that Eurostat cannot."
"We should be asking Eurostat and the Commission if they could sort it out, to give us the information we want so that we can try and get better value for this money."
"If I can say that in under two minutes, it is not unreasonable to expect the Commission and Eurostat to get their act together in three years."
"Mr President, Commissioner, audiovisual production has an important role in preserving and developing the cultures of European countries and Europe' s cultural diversity."
"The importance of national cultures is being emphasised with globalisation."
"The audiovisual sector is one of the most global of cultural sectors."
"While audiovisual production is big business, the cultural dimension also plays a major part in it."
"Neither must we forget the sector' s impact on employment."
"The total number of jobs in the cultural sector in Europe is more then three million."
"A considerable number of these are in the audiovisual sector."
"Although the sector may be run by large consortiums, we have to remember that its new jobs are created primarily for SMEs."
"The work of the Audiovisual Observatory is important for these SMEs."
"We must safeguard the development of SMEs in the audiovisual sector."
"They mean greater competitiveness and more diversified production for Europe' s audiovisual sector."
"There are actually 34 European states, plus the European Commission, that are members of the observatory."
"In other words, states that are only now applying for membership of the Union are also included in the collaboration within its framework."
"The Audiovisual Observatory will improve the operating prerequisites of European companies in this rapidly developing area."
"The collation and dissemination of information particularly helps SMEs to cooperate and, hence, develop."
"For that reason, it is important that the operating prerequisites of the observatory are safeguarded."
"It is unfortunate that, as a result of a vote taken by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, it is being proposed that financing for the observatory should be safeguarded for just three years, going against the position of the rapporteur, the chairman of the committee, Mr Gargani, among others."
"I am very happy that Mr Gargani made his opinion clearly known here in this plenary session."
"It is true that Parliament must be careful with taxpayers' money."
"At the same time, however, it must be remembered that savings should not be made in the wrong areas."
"It is better to support SMEs through services and not, for example, through business aid that distorts competition."
"Mr Chairman, we are often accused here in Parliament, and sometimes justifiably so, of spending taxpayers' money too freely."
"In discussing this motion, we can demonstrate that we also have some aptitude for effecting savings and making matters more efficient."
"The European Audiovisual Observatory prepares statistics for businesses in the audiovisual industry, work which Eurostat and the various national offices for statistics also attend to, so that there is a certain degree of overlap between these organisations' work and that of the Observatory."
"This cannot be rational or expedient, and we should like it to be investigated whether closer cooperation between Eurostat and the various national offices might, in the long term, render the Observatory' s work superfluous."
"Even if the Community' s contribution only constitutes 12% of the Observatory' s budget, it is money all the same, and we believe that there is money to be saved."
"But, when the main content of this motion is ""only"" about reducing the period of support from 5 to 3 years, then there is also time to investigate whether Eurostat and the national offices of statistics can cover the need we have for statistics and statistical information."
"Mr Gargani, the Italian Radicals would have liked to have amended, intervened in and had the chance to speak about this as well as all the other reports."
"They cannot do this because, as Emma Bonino reiterated this morning, we are not allowed to carry out that parliamentary activity which is part of the very mandate of a European Member of Parliament."
"Therefore, Mr President, we have not tabled, or rather we have not been able to table amendments, or participate in the vote on the report."
"We are sorry about this, because it is an important subject and besides, in Italy, we have had a lot of experience with the European Audiovisual Observatory."
"It was precisely us radicals who were perhaps the first to independent create an audiovisual monitoring centre that monitors the frequency of appearances, for example political appearances, in various television programmes, news programmes and media."
"It would be important, and this was the amendment we would have liked to have tabled, for there to be, for example, among the Observatory' s duties, with a view to European integration, which must increasingly become political integration, integration of societies and political behaviour and integration of information at European level, monitoring of the various television channels across Europe for the appearance of parliamentary political activity of national political groups and European politics, which could thus take the observatory as a reference point."
"President Gargani, this is an idea I am putting to you as, I repeat, I am unable to set it down in a parliamentary act, which we are not allowed to do as things stand."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the first place, I would like to offer some background information which seems to me to be useful, although some of it has already been mentioned."
"The European Audiovisual Observatory, as has been said, was set up in 1992, under the initial auspices of the Audiovisual Eureka programme."
"At that time it was laid down - and I quote - that ""the aim of the Observatory will be to improve the transfer of information within the audiovisual industry and promote a clearer vision of the market, as well as greater transparency."
"Specifically the task of the Observatory will consist of collecting and processing information and statistics relating to the audiovisual sector"" ."
"Furthermore, in 1997, the European Council commented on the Observatory by saying: ""Its services must be directed principally towards the needs of the professionals in the industry"" ."
"Therefore, on this basis, Commissioner and Mr President, I wish to ask both the Commission and the Observatory itself to remain faithful to this founding principle."
"Although it is not the case with the Observatory, there currently exists a tendency towards the easy option."
"Let me explain: it is a reality that many structures and organisations end up tied to their public funding body, and this situation tends to take them away from their objective, which in this case is public service and assistance for professionals in the audiovisual sector."
"Many people have not heard of the Observatory."
"For this reason, I believe it to be appropriate, on the one hand, that the Observatory makes a greater effort to attract the interest of professionals, substantially reducing their increasing dependency on the request for their services on the part of the Commission."
"In that way their resources would be increased through the provision of services to professionals and greater autonomy would be achieved."
"This requires objectives and efforts."
"On the other hand, it would be suitable for the Commission to obtain, from external specialists, a periodic review of the efficiency and acceptance of the Observatory' s services amongst professionals, for example, by means of surveys."
"Mr President, whoever would like to know what use the Audiovisual Observatory is, needs only to cast a glance at the contents page of any issue of the legal journal, IRIS, for example the issue for September 1999."
"Here, there is a report about a resolution to enact a Directive from the European Commission requiring Member States to ensure that no telecommunications company of relevance to the market should be able to operate its cable television network through the same legal entity. Another report is about the plan for a comprehensive French draft law concerning the information society which is to govern, among other things, questions about the free use of codings, about confidentiality in data transfers, about copyright protection and about necessary regulatory authorities."
"A third report concerns the latest judgements of the European Court of Human Rights through which 13 complaints against Turkey were heard and in eleven of which the Court agreed with the appellants and recognised violations of the law concerning free expression."
"All this amounts to far more than just collating statistical material, and I think it makes it clear why this institution is important."
"This impressively casts some light upon the objectives with which the founding of the Observatory was originally justified, namely those of surveying the market and promoting transparency there, as well as collecting and processing information and statistics concerning the audiovisual sector."
"Industry and related areas, and also the European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament, have since reaped the benefits of the Observatory' s services in many different ways."
"It has not, however, had any binding legal basis, and this is now to be created on the basis of Article 130a, paragraph 3 of the EC Treaty and with reference to the fact that, as a provider of information, it is mainly to contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of the audiovisual industry by improving the flow of information."
"The transparency which is to be produced in this way is an indispensable prerequisite for political action on Europe' s road to the information society, even if this is not perhaps to the liking of those who want to throw open the doors to unbridled market forces."
"I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has come out in favour of a five-year period of applicability."
"This view is shared by my Group."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"His work was thorough and fast."
"Thank you, President Gargani."
"As Members of Parliament know, the observatory is a public institution with the task of collecting economic and legal information from various international sources and to upgrade it by assembling it in an organised and comprehensive way."
"The observatory disseminates such information via periodical publications as has been discussed in the Chamber."
"These tasks are fulfilled effectively by the observatory and the return on our participation in terms of support for the audiovisual industry and the Union is positive."
"Moreover, I would like to stress that were Community participation in the observatory to be discontinued, the Commission would be obliged to collect the same information from different sources - in most cases on a commercial basis."
"This would not only be time-consuming but certainly more expensive than the amounts envisaged for the yearly contributions."
"I understand that consultation of the observatory publications, notably the year book and the legal newsletter, Iris, is common practice in the services of the Commission dealing with audiovisual issues."
"Moreover, the observatory' s advice has been sought on several occasions and in several areas in the context of on-going contacts when specific information was needed."
"I wish to mention the fields of employment, film financing schemes, international trade statistics, statistical methodologies, market trends and so forth."
"For the future the Commission envisages extending the activities carried out by the observatory, notably in two specific areas: implementing a statistical information structure under Eurostat and preparing for the GATT 2000 negotiations."
"The active participation of the Commission for the next five years in the observatory will allow it to optimise the complementarity of the tasks carried out by Eurostat and the observatory itself."
"The aim is to create, at the end of a five-year period, a harmonised official EU set of statistics for the audiovisual sector."
"I would like to stress that the activities of the observatory and Eurostat do not overlap in terms of period covered, geographical scope or output and could be usefully coordinated in order to achieve a clear view of the complex reality in the audiovisual sector."
"The Commission services are best placed to carry out this task."
"With your understanding, Mr President, I do not intend to go into Parliament' s amendments in detail, but I am happy to tell you that the Commission shares the concern about the need for small and medium-sized enterprises to be successful and so accepts the amendment relating to such enterprises."
"Concerning the other two amendments: the Commission understands Parliament' s concerns but cannot accept the amendments as they are drafted."
"Nevertheless, the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that the observatory work is widely accessible."
"To conclude, I would just like to say one thing."
"Within the framework of the budgetary procedure, even if we opt for a period of five years, Parliament every year has the opportunity to make amendments and to determine payments, i.e. to impose sanctions if it should prove necessary."
"Parliament thus has complete control."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"Turkish participation in Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0023/1999), drawn up by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision amending the basic Decision relating to the Socrates programme to include Turkey among the beneficiary countries (8076/1/1999 - C5-0024/1999 - 1996/0130(COD)), and the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision amending the basic Decision relating to the third phase of the Youth for Europe programme to include Turkey among the beneficiary countries (8077/1/1999 - C5-0025/1999 - 1996/0131(COD))."
"Mr President, the idea of including Turkey among the beneficiary countries of the Youth and SOCRATES programmes goes back to 1996."
"The Commission' s proposal was made on 14 May 1996 and is in line with the objective of extending the large cultural market to Turkey too."
"This happened despite the obstacles put forward, in particular, the human rights situation in Turkey and the Cyprus issue."
"Despite these difficulties, and despite the fresh wave of problems we have had recently, this idea led Parliament to extend the decision to include Turkey at its sitting of 25 February and, in the last few days, the Commission has also decided the same thing."
"I think that this is a very significant decision."
"It is significant because, despite Turkey being a country which has had some difficulties in this area - I confess, Mr President, that in the committee we heard about this problem, this difficulty in getting the idea accepted within Europe, the Europe which is so open to culture, as the various speakers have been saying all afternoon in their speeches on the four somewhat interconnected measures. I think that this decision means we can describe Europe in its entirety, as a body of States which regards new countries with an open mentality and great dignity, and offers them wide possibilities to develop in the areas of freedom and culture."
"I think that in adopting a measure of this kind, Parliament is giving a warm welcome to Turkish young people who, by renouncing their forefathers' mistakes, can now look to Europe as a place of great freedom, as a union of States, where culture, its dissemination and solidarity among young people are important, fundamental elements."
"I would ask for this measure to be adopted unanimously, as it was in the Committee, and despite the delay in the 1999 programmes, for it to be implemented on time in 2000, which is now very near."
"Mr President, my thanks to Mr Gargani for bringing forward this report and to Members of the previous Parliament who also put some work into ensuring that it comes before us tonight."
"Of course it is not an issue without contention."
"There are largely two approaches to dealing with this sort of issue."
"The first is to say that we are letting people off the hook without allowing them to fulfil their obligations."
"The second - and a view to which I subscribe - is that we are actually allowing the power of cultural activities to cut across people' s differences and to change people' s lives."
"While there are serious issues that are not entirely resolved here, if we want to have a healthy European future and a healthy European project, we depend on such initiatives to take this forward."
"These initiatives are vital to changing people' s attitudes."
"If we look at change and coexistence as our goal, then we need to look no further than Northern Ireland where we have brought people together through European funds and dramatically changed the landscape of conflict."
"It is this that can be achieved from this sort of initiative, and this that will help Europe, its borders and its beneficiaries to put forward an agenda of change."
"I echo Mr Gargani in saying that all of the issues that have been discussed around the Chamber tonight seek to ensure that culture is seen as a priority; that it is not just, for instance, the euro or jobs and employment that will bring a successful European project together."
"Cultural change will ultimately concretise the ideals and ideas that we all have in promoting our future together."
"Mr President, as we know, Turkey' s relations with the European Union have been the cause of many opinions being expressed lately."
"It is self-evident that the EU cannot initiate real negotiations for accession to the European Union with a country which does not fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"Respect for human rights and minorities is the basis of European cooperation, and countries which do not understand this are not welcome in the Union."
"But is the EU for that reason to turn its back on Turkey in as many contexts as possible?"
"There are Members of this Parliament who think so."
"I do not share that attitude."
"If we, in the EU, have the opportunity to improve democratic conditions in Turkey, we should seize it."
"We have such an opportunity now with the recommendation concerning Turkey' s participation in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes."
"At the Conference of Presidents 14 days ago, Mr Prodi attached just such importance to the EU' s working for a situation in which Turkey respects the Copenhagen criteria and said that the EU ought to initiate a closer political dialogue with Turkey."
"I view the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes as natural links in this closer political dialogue, a dialogue which will have great importance for the development of democracy in Turkey."
"In a democratic society, legislation and institutions should naturally be democratic but, in order for them to be so, the citizens of the country concerned must think and act like democrats."
"That does not come automatically."
"We can see this in the history of Europe."
"Contact and exchange with democratic countries, especially between young people, provide the most fertile soil for democracy in countries which do not have real democratic traditions."
"The Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes increase young students' opportunities for exchange and for moving between one country and another. They also help raise levels of education."
"The programmes will further the process of democratisation in Turkey and help ensure that, in time, the country can become an integral part of our partnership."
"Mr President, all democratic parliamentarians ought to be able to vote for this recommendation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Italian delegation from Alleanza Nazionale is fully in favour of Turkey being included among the beneficiary countries of the Youth and SOCRATES programmes."
"This is not just a deserved tribute to culture, but it is also an objective political assessment which springs, in particular, from the knowledge that we have a State - Turkey - as an interlocutor, which is still a long way from fully upholding human rights and the principles of freedom and democracy which the European Unions is based on."
"And it is for this precise reason that we must stimulate and encourage full involvement of the young people of that country in a sound policy of exchanges, mobility and meeting the other young people of Europe."
"Youth has always been the first to long for novelty, change and growth - even cultural growth - of a country."
"The young are an extremely efficient means of transmitting sound values, characterised by democracy."
"The European Parliament has already done well at first reading - and here I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Gargani - in saying that it will allow Turkey to take part in the exchanges envisaged by the two programmes."
"Besides, to deny this chance would mean increasing the isolation of that Mediterranean State from a Europe which has to seek dialogue, especially with those, as in this case, young people, who cannot be expected to take the blame for something that is not their fault, but which is the fault of a government which we still have our reservations about."
"Therefore, allowing Turkey access to the SOCRATES and Youth programmes does not confer legitimacy on a State that has not yet shown concrete evidence of maturity with regard to the rights of minorities, but it does contribute to helping young people to accelerate the slow and difficult process of achieving this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the extension of the Socrates and Youth programmes is a clear signal sent by the Union to Turkey, to those in Turkey who want Europe and who need Europe."
"This programme targets young people and does so with good reason: young people are the sap which will nourish the whole tree and it is through young people that democracy and human rights may be enabled to take root in that country."
"We must also ensure that the young Turkish people who join us are representative."
"It is up to the Commission then - we are counting on you Mrs Reding - to be extremely vigilant in ensuring that all young Turks, regardless of sex or ethnic background, are eligible under this programme."
"The substance of amendment 5, if not its wording, has been adopted by the Council."
"It demands absolute respect for minority rights."
"It is almost impossible, or at least extremely difficult, to approach this debate without mentioning Turkey' s possible accession to the Union."
"Turkey is an Associate Country and we demand more, much more than this from an Associate."
"As a result of the inflexible way it has dealt with the Kurdish question in particular, but with other matters too, Turkey has sent a very negative signal to Europe."
"Ankara is still a long way from meeting the Copenhagen criteria."
"Through this programme, we are staking our hopes on Turkey' s young people. It is up to the young people to act as a link between us."
"Mr President, I have carefully listened to MEPs state their positions."
"The Commission is convinced that Turkey' s participation in programmes directed primarily at young people, such as exchange and encounter programmes, which strengthen society, democracy and respect for human rights, will foster friendship and understanding between peoples and cultures."
"At first reading, the Commission accepted the amendments tabled by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and for which I must thank the rapporteur, intended to encourage the implementation of preparatory action."
"Indeed, the Turkish structures which are to run the new generation of Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes would not be able to get their work under way without prior training or technical assistance."
"It is also clear that we will not be practising any sort of elitism but will be helping those parts of society that most need help, including minorities."
"Although decisions on Turkey' s eligibility under current proposals do not allow that country to actually participate immediately in the programmes, they will allow the European Union to send a positive signal to Turkish society at large and to express once again its desire to develop cooperation in different areas with Turkey."
"You are quite right. If Turkey does change, it will change through its young people and because its young people have changed."
"Thank you, Commissioner Reding."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.10 p.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that I do not need to tell you how shocked we all were at what took place last night in Armenia."
"I think you have probably all heard the reports."
"I am of course referring to the murder of the Prime Minister and of eight members of parliament."
"By now the terrorists have been arrested and the hostages released, but of course, considering the serious nature of these events, and if you agree, I shall express our solidarity and sympathy, on your behalf, towards the people of Armenia and I shall do so by sending a letter to the President of the Republic of Armenia."
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, during the conclusion of my contribution in the debate on company restructuring yesterday I pointed out to the Vice-President presiding at the time that there was an anomaly in the joint resolution which we will vote on later today."
"The resolution which I signed on behalf of my group on Tuesday included in the final paragraph a reference to Michelin."
"The text has now been distributed and while the English and Spanish versions include that reference to Michelin it appears to have been removed from the other language versions."
"One explanation I have had from the Sessional Services is that someone from the EPP Group had been in touch to say that point had been withdrawn."
"Madam President, the authors of the resolution, the signatories of the joint resolution, were not consulted."
"As far as I and the other signatories are concerned, that reference should remain in at the vote today."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Madam President, there is a great deal of confusion surrounding this issue because an error has crept into the final signed version."
"The negotiated version of the resolution did not contain any reference to Michelin."
"I am quite sure of this."
"There are quite a few versions, however."
"So either the English version is the correct one or else the other versions are."
"Whichever way, we are dealing with different versions."
"I would therefore suggest that a vote be taken on this issue in Brussels after the Strasbourg part-session."
"This seems to be the best way forward to me."
"Madam President, I do not wish to drag this out and frustrate Members waiting to get on with the vote on the budget."
"The test should be very simple."
"All you need do is ask for the version with the signatures of the various signatories from the different groups that combined in this joint resolution."
"If the reference to Michelin is there, that is the text we should vote on today."
"I would oppose a deferral until Brussels."
"Madam President, I too would like to say something on the matter as I dealt with this resolution on behalf of the liberal group."
"Right from the word go, it was decided to omit the word ""Michelin"" from the resolution because it would otherwise be impossible to reach a joint resolution."
"The word ""Michelin"" does not appear in any of the language versions, apart from the English."
"I would therefore ask you to keep the German or French versions as they are and take a vote on them."
"This, in my opinion, is unacceptable behaviour in politics: if we agree on certain issues, then I hope that the socialists too can subscribe to these."
"Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, we shall very carefully examine the question of which version is the authoritative one."
"Madam President, I would like to address this point, not because I have followed previous events over the last few days particularly carefully."
"I am not such a great expert as the previous speaker or Mr Pronk."
"But there is one thing that I would like to stress and make perfectly plain. This is that agreements which are made, also in the Conference of Presidents, must be respected."
"I very clearly remember discussing in the Conference of Presidents, as my neighbours here on the right, Pat Cox, Mrs Hautala, Mr Barón Crespo and others will recall, whether we should mention Michelin or discuss globalisation and the restructuring of firms in a general way."
"The Conference of Presidents came to the unanimous conclusion that we should not discuss Michelin specifically, but instead speak generally about the restructuring of firms in connection with globalisation."
"That was the unanimous decision."
"When the word ""Michelin"" suddenly appears in the versions in one or two languages, then I wonder who did this."
"This does not follow the agreed rules of the game."
"I resolutely refuse to accept terms which have not been discussed being inserted into texts."
"My group absolutely refuses to approve this!"
"I would ask all Groups to uphold the principles of fairness and mutual arrangements in this House."
"(Loud applause from the right)"
"Madam President, we do not wish to re-open a debate which was concluded yesterday."
"I would merely like to clarify one point."
"There was not a unanimous opinion at the Conference of Presidents in favour of removing the reference to Michelin in the debate."
"There was a majority consensus, which we had to bow to, naturally, that the word Michelin should not be included in the wording."
"As far as I am concerned, I spoke at the Conference of Presidents to say that, of course, everyone would be free to speak in the debate as they saw fit and that, for my own part, I considered Michelin to be at the very centre of this debate on the restructuring of firms."
"On that basis, I do not see what objection there could be to Groups discussing a text considering that the Michelin question should be included in the resolution."
"I would like furthermore to specify that my group did not sign this compromise which it did not, in any case, consider satisfactory."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think we can drag this debate on for much longer."
"We have a perfectly clear idea of the situation."
"Indeed, I must say, having chaired this Conference of Presidents, that my recollection of events tallies with what has just been said."
"Madam President, I wish to make a comment about this resolution."
"As far as we are concerned, the matter is very simple: we put our signature to a document which specifically mentioned Michelin, and so for us the compromise is clear on this point."
"If there were to be some ambiguity or if the word Michelin were not to be included in contradiction to the text we approved by signing, then obviously this signature would no longer be valid."
"Very well."
"That is quite clear."
"We understand your point."
"Madam President, in fact, it was I who made the proposal to turn an urgency procedure into a more general debate on globalisation, which was accepted by the Conference of Presidents."
"And I also made a proposal to remove the name of the company, to whom we are giving publicity, which appears in the title in parentheses."
"And that was the right thing to do, but here we are dealing with a different question, that is to say, a motion for a resolution was tabled which included, in its final point, a question almost of courtesy, and that was that the resolution was to be sent to the president of this company, and what has happened is that the transaction resolution which was presented, carried that name."
"And the question is very simple: those who are against this point being included in the resolution may ask for a separate vote."
"But what is not correct is that a motion for a resolution should be modified, once it is under way, in the corresponding body of Parliament, without the knowledge of the signatories."
"And this extends to another problem which has arisen in relation to the fisheries agreement, to which there has been a modification without the knowledge of the signatories."
"And I therefore ask the President for there to be rigorous control in the records in relation to the non-authorised modification of proposals, which I regard as a problem insofar as it concerns the modification and falsification of a Parliamentary public document."
"Mr Barón Crespo, you are quite right."
"In fact, Mrs Miguélez Ramos should have asked my permission to speak on the subject of the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"I checked with the Sessional Services."
"Apparently there was a technical error, so I am told, and the text on which we are to vote tomorrow, Friday, will be duly amended."
"So, things should be quite clear."
"I apologise, but all this was due to the technical error."
"I think, indeed, that in future we must ensure that mistakes of this sort do not recur, because they are really very prejudicial."
"Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the adoption of the Minutes in order to point out that, even today, in the case of Mr Turco, we shall not be participating in the vote in the way we announced."
"As regards the actual Minutes, on page 7, at the point where the report of Mrs Bonino' s speech is given, and where it is noted that Mr Corbett and Mr Madelin spoke, I think that the Minutes should be a more accurate reflection of the statements made by the speakers. Mr Madelin, in particular, spoke in favour of this proposal."
"I think it would be logical if this was indicated in the Minutes."
"The verbatim report of the debates will give the exact content of the statements made by Mr Madelin."
"Madam President, I would like to announce that, as of this morning, I am joining the Radical Group' s fight for an independent technical group."
"To improve the overall situation of Parliament and the non-attached Group, I too am joining the Radicals' endeavours - I will therefore not be taking part in the vote on the Minutes or the other votes, and I declare that, like them, I am on strike."
"Madam President, I am not now referring to the Minutes, but I would like to turn all my colleagues' attention to a certain tragic event that took place yesterday in Yerevan, Armenia."
"I would ask you to consider whether we could hold a minute' s silence as that country' s President of the Parliament and Prime Minister was killed in an armed attack."
"In addition, sixty people were injured in the attack, which was targeted at a democratic parliament."
"I would ask you to consider holding a moment' s silence as a result of this incident, which we, as Members of Parliament, can in no way endorse."
"On the contrary, we must do all we can to restore parliamentary peace there."
"Mrs Hautala, I am extremely sorry that you were not present at the beginning of this sitting because, as you might expect, I did mention this tragedy and I said that I shall send, on your behalf, naturally, my condolences and sympathy to the people of Armenia."
"We are all on the same wavelength on this matter."
"(The Minutes were adopted)"
"Madam President, at the start of the sitting you not only reported events in Armenia, but also informed us that you would be sending a message to Armenia."
"As the president of the delegation for cooperation between the European Union and Armenia, I would like to thank you most sincerely for that."
"We are all horrified at the tragic events which occurred last night in the Armenian Parliament."
"Not only the head of government, but also the president of the parliament and several other politicians were murdered."
"We must ask ourselves whether peaceful development is now possible in Armenia."
"The raid has plunged the new Republic of Armenia, located in direct proximity to Chechnya, into a state of emergency, the effects of which cannot yet be predicted."
"I think you all share my hope that the recently won independence of Armenia will not thereby be threatened once again."
"Madam President, with regard to the question of fishing which was mentioned previously by Mr Barón Crespo, you said that there had been a technical error."
"In my capacity as President of the Committee on Fisheries, I would like to ask you, since this a very important and serious question, to explain this technical error and tell me what it consists of."
"And also, I would ask you to inform the political groups who have signed this motion for a resolution so that they may know exactly what has occurred: whether it was a technical error on the part of those who presented it or whether it was a technical error on the part of those who allowed it."
"And I would also like, Madam President, to tell you that the motion for a resolution will be debated this afternoon and I understand that, in accordance with Rule 37(3), the vote should take place following the debate, that is, this afternoon and not tomorrow, as you have said."
"Could you please clarify this point?"
"Madam President, yesterday I wrote to you to report certain facts which I believe deserve consideration in this Parliament."
"According to information received from the services of the sitting of Tuesday 26 October, an unidentified person approached those services to withdraw a motion for a resolution which had been presented by the PPE, PSE and UEN groups, as well as the motion for a resolution presented by the ELDR group, without the consent nor the agreement of any of the signatories and, what is more serious, these motions for resolutions were replaced with a supposed joint motion for a resolution, without signatures, which contained, in addition to a whole series of names of MEPs which had been added, those of some of the signatories of the first motion for a resolution."
"Madam President, I had to find out about these facts through a journalist who rang from Spain."
"Madam President, I am not going to describe the behaviour of these MEPs who can name themselves as co-authors without having added a dot or a comma to the text of the resolution."
"This is an action which speaks for itself and is an example of active parliamentary manoeuvring, if you will permit the irony."
"My question, Madam President, has to do with the procedure."
"Does the procedure followed in this Parliament allow these things to happen?"
"Because personally, I would have loved to have been a co-signatory of the text of the Spanish Constitution and through this procedure, Madam President, I could have been precisely that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think we can prolong this discussion any further."
"I can assure you, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, that I shall take action to ensure that this type of unacceptable occurrence does not recur."
"We must be clear on this point."
"Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, you have had your answer."
"The three proposals that were made initially have been reinstated and these are the ones we shall be voting on."
"There has been, in discreet terms, a technical error, actually some sort of tampering, and, indeed, this is something that must not happen again."
"Madam President, I wish to speak in order to support strongly the two speeches which have just been made."
"Our group co-signed this compromise resolution."
"It is absolutely unacceptable for such compromise resolutions to be modified without the knowledge of their authors."
"I therefore request you, Madam, to take extremely strong action against what has just happened, which is perfectly deplorable."
"Absolutely."
"You can rely on me."
"I have just said so, and I believe that we are in perfect agreement."
"Madam President, I imagine that this problem will have arisen because ten MEPs, who form part of the Greens/ALE Group, aware of the joint resolution of three parliamentary groups, had the idea of supporting it in the belief that we were exercising our right as individual MEPs."
"To this end, we ten MEPs delivered a letter to the registry, saying that we supported this resolution, which we believed to be a joint resolution of the PPE, the PSE and the UEN, and that was that."
"We are unaware of any other problem."
"We simply thought that the resolution was so good that we supported it, and we still support it."
"Anything else is pure confusion and we do not understand it and, anyway, we do not understand why something as normal as a minority group of MEPs supporting the majority groups, should be presented in such a problematic light."
"If you do not want us to support you, let us know and next time we will not do it."
"(Applause from the Greens/EFA Group)"
"Madam President, I echo your regrets, and I also work on the assumption that errors of this type must not recur in future."
"I signed the PPE resolution myself and was, naturally, more than astonished, not to say horrified, at the subsequent actions."
"At this point in time I also have to say that, unfortunately, this is not the first such occurrence."
"I have experienced something similar in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Something must be done here, immediately and as a matter of urgency."
"Madam President, I would just like to ask my fellow Members whether they are not wondering if we are being completely ridiculous about all this, for the simple reason that it is possible to have the opinions we have on globalisation, and on Michelin, whether on the right or on the left."
"But it would be absolutely out of order to draw up a resolution on globalisation in Europe, today, without mentioning Michelin."
"The people who agree with Michelin should have the courage to say so, and those who do not agree with Michelin and with the layoffs should be able to say so, but let us not beat about the bush for hours on end. That is completely ridiculous."
"Votes"
"I must point out that we are proceeding to votes in blocks, taking into account the requests for individual votes by split voting and by roll call."
"Members new to the House will see that this is rather complicated, but we shall try to make things as simple as possible, with the active support of the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, to whom I hereby give the floor."
"Bourlanges (PPE), general rapporteur."
"(FR) Madam President, may I assure the new Members, they are not going to get another speech."
"As Mr Napolitano would say, making a speech is something completely different from what I am about to do now."
"Madam President, I would just like, as a preliminary comment to the voting, to make a statement regarding some technical points."
"I must point out to the staff of the Sessional Services that purely technical or linguistic errors have been found in a number of amendments."
"The necessary corrections will have to be made so that they reflect the voting of the Committee on Budgets."
"This involves the following amendments: Amendment Nos 409, 471, 520, 621, 612, 565, 637 and 459."
"I can assure my fellow Members that there is not one jot of a political problem relating to these technical corrections."
"Thank you. I hope that the services responsible for the Minutes will be able to make the necessary changes."
"Mr Bourlanges, I can confirm this, and I can tell you that the linguistic services have already been made aware of these problems, and will make the necessary corrections."
"Relating to Amendment No 460"
"Madam President, a number of amendments with regard to the re-structuring of administrative expenditure and the technical assistance offices will now follow."
"The question is whether this should be dealt with here, i.e. after a discussion in the Committee on Budgets, or whether it should be discussed as part of an extensive debate about the re-structuring of the Commission as a whole in all the relevant committees."
"We are concerned that a whole spate of amendments will not actually benefit the management of the Commission."
"My group will therefore vote against this amendment but many subsequent amendments will also contain this particular issue."
"I therefore want to point out that, as of today, we will only vote on the additional points in those amendments and that our vote, as far as this aspect is concerned, will remain unchanged throughout the voting procedure, because otherwise, I would have lumbered you with more than twenty split votes."
"Relating to Chapter B1-400 President."
"We shall now move on to chapter B1-400 which requires a majority of 314 votes."
"I shall immediately give the floor to the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges, who, I believe, wishes to make a compromise proposal."
"Madam President, the compromise proposal is not mine exactly since, as the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, I am obviously bound by the previous vote of the Committee on Budgets."
"Having said that, we held a consultative meeting with the coordinators of the various Groups and a compromise was arrived at between the coordinators regarding the amendments to sub-section B1-4."
"This compromise involves a change to the amounts of the amendments adopted by the Commission on Budgets."
"It makes it possible to cover all the lines in sub-section B1­4."
"If this amendment were to be voted in, the request for a separate vote introduced by Mr Walter, the coordinator of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and others, would then have to be withdrawn."
"So, if this compromise is adopted, we should still have to vote on the heading for line B1­4050, amendment 507, with a favourable opinion from the Committee on Budgets and in a split vote requested by the Group of the Greens, as well as the heading for line B1­406 on Amendment No 69, this time with a vote by roll call."
"Thus, the compromise amendment concerns lines B1­400, B1­401, B1­402, B1­4030, B1­404, B1­4050, B1­406, B1­4070, B1­408 and concerns a total amount of EUR 115 million, or, more precisely, it deducts EUR 115 million from the margin."
"This, then, is the content of the oral amendment."
"I believe that we must vote on this and then, if it is adopted, obviously the whole section will be finalised in the way I have just described."
"Thank you."
"I cannot be associated with it in my official capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets."
"I shall be voting on this amendment in a personal capacity."
"This may seem rather complicated for the uninitiated among us, but it really is quite simple at the end of the day."
"It must also seem rather complicated for the visitors present."
"Before going on, I would like to welcome a very important delegation from the French Senate, headed by its President, Mr Christian Poncelet, who do us the honour of visiting Parliament."
"(Loud applause)"
"We are delighted to welcome you to the European Parliament."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like to thank the coordinators of all Groups in the Committee on Budgets for the fact that this compromise has been achieved."
"I must acknowledge the generous nature of the general rapporteur, who was himself of another opinion."
"That is understandable, and I also know that the Committee chairman was in favour of another view, but we should pay tribute to the hard work of all the representatives of the Committee on Budgets here."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development supports this view."
"Madam President, I have attempted to listen very carefully to the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges."
"From what I can gather, Amendment No 69 on budget line B1-406 has been incorporated into this oral amendment."
"This Amendment No 69 was drafted by a number of Flemish and Wallonian colleagues of mine."
"What I have as yet failed to understand is what is to remain of this amendment if it is included in the overall compromise."
"I would very much welcome clarification on this matter."
"Yes, that is correct, Mrs Staes."
"We still have to vote on the heading for line B1-4050, Amendment No 507 and the heading for line B1-406 on Amendment No 69."
"Amendment 69 did not present a problem for the coordinators in terms of the amount."
"The heading did, however, present a problem and, as you so rightly say, we shall be voting on it separately."
"Relating to Amendment No 65"
"Madam President, Amendment No 65, introduced by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, has now been included in the compromise amendment in a somewhat altered form, but it has been included, so that plant and animal genetic resources have received their own title."
"The Council still has to approve this."
"Something in the compromise was deferred so we do not have to vote on it now."
"We therefore withdraw our amendment."
"Madam President, I would just like to make a policy guidance suggestion regarding all the amendments to Category 3."
"Following our discussions in the Committee on Budgets and consultations with all the relevant committees, we arrived at proposals which are generally satisfactory to all parties concerned, but the price to be paid for this is that we are working right up to the limits of the margin permitted."
"Now, the interinstitutional agreement, which is our Bible, stipulates that in our votes on the budget, right through the procedure, we must keep within the ceiling limits."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, you are of course free to vote as you wish, according to your own judgement, but you should be aware that as soon as you vote for an amendment on expenditure in excess of what has been agreed I would say ""around"" rather than by the Committee on Budgets, you risk putting us in a very delicate position with regard to the margin."
"I wanted to make this perfectly clear so that everyone can be aware of the responsibility they have."
"Thank you, Mr Bourlanges."
"So, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, would the President of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development please tell me if he will withdraw this amendment?"
"I see that he will."
"Relating to Amendment No 430"
"Madam President, may I ask how it is that there is a change to the voting order?"
"We have Amendment No 430 on the European Year of Languages as the next amendment to be voted on."
"Could someone, either Mr Bourlanges or yourself, give us some information on this?"
"That is because it is still the amendment of the Committee on Budgets which we are going to vote on."
"This is the custom. It is perhaps not justified but, like any custom, one must take care before challenging them!"
"Madam President, following on from what Mr Bourlanges said, with the last amendment we voted we have now actually gone past the margin for Category 3 which means that any amendments which are not in line with the Committee on Budgets' recommendations are going to give us serious problems."
"We already have a problem."
"We have now gone above the margin."
"It is ludicrous to keep voting like this."
"I would ask you to respect the rapporteur' s recommendations on Category 3."
"Relating to the fifth framework programme Bourlanges (PPE), general rapporteur."
"(FR) Madam President, the amendments relating to the fifth framework programme for research have had to be changed following a compromise which was reached yesterday with the Commission. This was a compromise which was difficult to reach, and I have to thank Mrs Schreyer for having ensured that it was achieved."
"This compromise met with the approval not only of the Committee on Budgets, but also that of the committee responsible, with the particular support of Mrs McNally, its rapporteur, whom I must thank for her cooperation."
"In terms of procedure, this means that amendments 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653 and 654 must be voted on separately."
"Moreover, one line for administrative expenses has been created for each programme and the amounts for the various key measures will be entered in the remarks."
"So, the compromise arrived at is a very simple one."
"It was a question of whether to create one line per key measure, as had been envisaged by the Committee on Budgets, or to maintain a single overall line for research, as the executive committee wished, in exchange for guarantees that information would be provided on the transfers of funds between key measures within this line."
"Since these assurances were given by Mrs Schreyer, we can therefore vote on the compromise according to the procedural conditions which I have just described."
"Relating to Amendment No 394"
"Madam President, a number of Members present today will be confused as to what has actually gone on concerning this European Women' s Lobby amendment."
"Amendment No 394 was tabled by a colleague of mine, Mrs Scallon."
"A number of us would like to vote for her amendment but, because of what has gone on in the coordinators' meetings, we have no idea how to do so."
"I would very much appreciate your advice on how we can support the original Amendment No 394."
"Madam President, I think that there is no way that we can proceed to a vote on this amendment as it has not been re-introduced after being subject to a vote or, I might say, a transformation within the Committee on Budgets."
"Thus we have an amendment from the Committee on Budgets which, I must say, was voted on in a state of some confusion, and which represents a hybrid entity since it has the European Women's Lobby' s title and the content of Mrs Scallon' s amendment."
"Well, it will not have escaped you that in some respects the positions of the European Women' s Lobby and Mrs Scallon are not identical, but this is the amendment which the Committee on Budgets has voted on."
"I can understand people voting against it."
"I am supposed to be supporting it, but I find it somewhat incoherent."
"If Parliament votes against it, then we will then have to vote for or against the amendment of the European Women' s Lobby."
"Procedure does not allow for Mrs Scallon' s amendment to be reintroduced into the cycle since there is no compromise basis for an oral amendment to be submitted."
"I simply think that the problems that have arisen on this occasion will certainly be examined by the Committee on Budgets, within the working party specifically set up by chairman Wynn to deal with the subject of this institution' s policy on subsidies as a whole."
"I wish to reassure my fellow Member on that point, but, in my opinion, we can vote only on the two amendments which have been submitted: the Committee on Budgets' amendment and the amendment reintroduced by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Following the vote on Amendment No 443"
"Madam President, now that Parliament has voted down Amendment No 443, we have solved the problem."
"In other words, it is the European Women' s Lobby which remains and which gets the 600,000."
"It remains both in the nomenclature and in the remarks."
"It was precisely that which each and every one of the Women' s Committee intended, and that is why we can withdraw Amendment No 10."
"We are therefore withdrawing the proposal in Amendment No 10 because we have achieved precisely what we wanted to achieve with this vote."
"Madam President, draft Amendment No 503 concerning promotions is in this voting group."
"I would like to propose that the remarks be removed."
"Only the numbers remain, as the Council of Ministers has already dealt with the remarks."
"The remarks are therefore unnecessary, and just the numbers should remain."
"Report (A5-0030/1999) by Mr Bourlanges, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2000 - Section III Commission (C5-0300/1999)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"The resolution has been adopted, and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bourlanges very warmly, as well as everyone who helped to make it a success."
"Mr President, I wanted to say that, unlike Mr Bourlanges, I voted against this resolution and did not abstain."

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0036/1999) by Mr Napolitano, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendments to the Rules of Procedure following the interinstitutional agreement of 25 May 1999 on the internal investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)"
"President."
"I have received a request from the PPE Group for a referral to committee."
"Mr President, this is a matter which requires a broad majority, which we hope to ensure."
"But in the report, as it now stands before us, there are still some points of uncertainty with reference to two matters."
"Firstly, there is no clear definition of members and elected representatives."
"This is worth clarifying."
"Secondly, there is uncertainty and a procedure, which we consider incorrect, stating that, in the event of errors in Parliament, officials should report back to other officials."
"We, on the other hand, are of the opinion that, if there are irregularities, officials must report back to the President of the Parliament."
"We must come back to these matters again."
"We therefore request that the report be referred back to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The Committee could call an extraordinary meeting in the course of the next week and, if necessary, in Brussels on Thursday of next week we could then finally proceed to the vote, making it possible to gain the broad support of the whole House, if the requisite clarifications have been made."
"But, failing this referral to Committee, today unfortunately we are not in a position to give this report our approval, to our great regret."
"With the intention of achieving a broad consensus on this important question, we therefore demand that the report be referred back to Committee."
"Mr President, I will speak against the proposal, by Mr Poettering, to refer this report back to Committee."
"In fact, it is an interinstitutional agreement which was signed by the previous President of this Parliament."
"The political persuasion of the President does not matter. It was Mr Gil-Robles, the President of our Parliament."
"And Parliament was in agreement."
"And we have to honour our own acts."
"I, today, have just found out about two new reasons to re-examine this report and it surprises me, because in fact it deals with something else, of another political approach, and I would welcome its being done clearly."
"From the point of view, not of my political group, but of the previous Parliament, of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which unanimously approved this report, there is really no lack of clarity."
"And, furthermore, with regard to the possible lack of clarity between MEPs and officials, I must say that the Bureau of the Parliament which you, Mr President, form part of, clearly adopted amendment instructions last Monday for this regulation in accordance with their competences."
"Therefore, there is no lack of clarity."
"Furthermore, we have been subject to a summons by the Council for the last month because we have not honoured our word."
"Therefore, there is no lack of clarity here."
"Here there is a political will to create a conflict with the Council and not to respect our word."
"My group therefore radically opposes this proposal."
"Mr President, it is not a matter of being obstructive here."
"It is not a matter of obstructing the work of OLAF, or not facilitating it."
"We all want OLAF to be able to commence its work properly as soon as possible and work effectively for the benefit of the European Union."
"But this proposal contains considerable legal weaknesses which require further consultation."
"Articles 2 and 4 of the Annex to the Rules of Procedure contain conditions which are clearly in contradiction of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities, which concern the status of elected representatives and which also, incidentally, lay down the rules governing the question of immunity aside from what is stated in the relevant regulations of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities."
"I am therefore convinced that this needs revising in the interests of the case, and would therefore like to request that we adopt Mr Poettering' s suggestion."
"Mr President, as both rapporteur and Chairman of the Committee, I must say that I am very surprised."
"The request is completely unexpected."
"In this House, on Monday, we discussed the report I tabled on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which adopted it unanimously. Also, two influential Members, representatives of the Group of the European People' s Party - the ones who spoke on behalf of the Group - spoke clearly in favour of the report on Monday."
"Now we are told, no less, that there are serious legal gaps."
"I, naturally, respect the legal background of the Member who spoke, but I am also surprised by the fact that these serious gaps were not regarded as such by the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - who, in terms of legal knowledge, are deemed second to none."
"What I mean is, the Committee cannot, under any circumstances, go any further than it has done already, as the inclusion of this Interinstitutional Agreement in the Rules of Procedure does require technical adjustments, but these must not call into question the agreement negotiated and signed on behalf of Parliament."
"Therefore, may I say that as far as we are concerned, it makes no sense to refer the report to the Committee."
"(Parliament rejected the request for a referral to committee)"
"Mr President, I believe that is not quite correct."
"We have rejected."
"We have not had the necessary majority to accept placing in the Rules of Procedure themselves a reference to the Annex, but we still have to take a decision as to whether we want to annex to our Rules of Procedure the interinstitutional agreement itself."
"There are many interinstitutional agreements that are annexed to the Rules of Procedure without having the optional extra of a particular reference in the Rules of Procedure themselves to the text annexed."
"The remaining part of the report of the committee can be taken - that only requires a simple majority - to annex the Interinstitutional Agreement to the Rules of Procedure."
"That is perfectly in order."
"Mr President, this is a very serious situation."
"Without wanting, of course, to call into question the authority of the Committee Chairman who has just spoken, I would find it wise, in the light of a request made by the largest group, to proceed more cautiously because, clearly, the absolute majority required makes the vote at the very least difficult, as we have seen."
"In my opinion Mr Corbett' s point is not acceptable."
"We are dealing with an amendment to the Rules of Procedure and the seriousness of this vote necessitates the decision that you were just making."
"I think that this is the wisest thing to do."
"It is clear that this amendment to the Rules of Procedure is an essential element for the reference of a text which, having the importance of the Rules of Procedure, can only be adopted by an absolute majority."
"Mr President, you are absolutely right that to amend the Rules of Procedure requires an absolute majority of Members of the House."
"We have just decided not to amend the Rules of Procedure and therefore, not to add this new Rule."
"However, the rest of this report comes under Rule 186 of the Rules of Procedure which specifies that by a simple majority we are allowed to decide to add an item to the Annexes of the Rules."
"It specifically refers to interinstitutional agreements; it even categorises them."
"It is up to this House to decide - as for every other interinstitutional agreement - by a simple majority whether to add this as an Annex to our Rules of Procedure, without changing the Rules of Procedure."
"We did not actually need the reference in the Rules of Procedure."
"That was an optional extra which we have decided to dispense with."
"We can still decide whether to add this interinstitutional agreement to the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, the first part of your ruling is absolutely right."
"It is clear that a Rule change requires a qualified majority."
"But Mr Corbett has a very strong point."
"All we are doing now with the remainder of this text is annexing the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement to the modus vivendi of this Parliament."
"I ask the House to think very carefully about what they are doing here."
"We are now in a position that the interinstitutional agreement has been implemented as far as it affects the Commission."
"It has been implemented as far as it affects the Council."
"By a decision of Parliament' s Bureau it has been implemented as it affects Parliament' s staff."
"The only people left are Members of the European Parliament."
"Do we really want people to be saying that Members of the European Parliament are scared about the OLAF regulations applying to them?"
"Let us not put ourselves in that position!"
"(Loud applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see, this is quite a difficult situation."
"I now give the floor to Mr Nassauer too, because he has requested it, but I invite you to reflect on the fact that, in a situation such as this, it is difficult to press ahead using majority votes - we really should take into account this very delicate situation which must be addressed, if possible, with a broad consensus across this House."
"Mr President, the matter of the Annex to the Rules of Procedure will most certainly be determined by a simple majority."
"But the addition of an Annex to the Rules of Procedure is quite clearly an amendment to the actual Rules of Procedure and, as such, requires an absolute majority."
"We can never amend the actual Rules of Procedure by means of an Annex."
"That is perfectly clear."
"We have just decided, may I remind you, that the common regulation contained in the interinstitutional agreement, with the necessary measures to facilitate the trouble-free conduct of OLAF inquiries in accordance with the Parliament resolution, which is appended as an Annex to the Rules of Procedure, is applicable within Parliament."
"This resolution did not achieve the necessary majority."
"It cannot therefore claim validity on the basis of the Rules of Procedure."
"I believe we would be well advised to refer this matter back to the competent committee for consultation now and discontinue the debate on the Rules of Procedure here."
"Mr President, in the name of the principle of transparency, I must make one observation on the course of events."
"Namely, last Thursday, at the President' s meeting, two compromises were made among the leaders of the groups."
"The first was that to which Mr Poettering referred this morning, which is to say that there is no mention of the name of Michelin in the resolution on the relocation of companies."
"On this I agree with Mr Barón Crespo in an earlier discussion."
"However, we made another agreement as well."
"As certain groups feared the delicate nature of this report, we decided that a debate should be organised on it on Monday and a vote on it on Thursday."
"In this way the groups had a whole week to debate the sensitive points in this proposal."
"I do not understand why the chairmen of certain groups refer to the agreements in other connections, but in some cases these agreements do not mean anything."
"I think we should have discussed the matter according to the normal order of events and voted on it today, with no undue incident."
"Mr President, I shall speak with right on my side."
"Personally, I believe that we are making a mistake, largely due to the way the original regulations of OLAF were put together, but that is another question."
"Here we must have a very clear idea about why this Parliament requires an absolute majority for questions which affect MEPs."
"You have given the reason, Mr President: because we are looking for a broad consensus."
"We cannot hide behind a technical question that there are agreements which are not incorporated in the regulations."
"This is a matter which must remain outside the regulations and therefore the logical and reasonable thing - and rules, when the law is the law and not just formal texts, must be reasonable - should be that this be supported by an absolute majority in this Parliament."
"Any other approach would fundamentally contravene the very essence of the parliamentary Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, the internal self-regulation of Parliament is one of the fundamental bulwarks of its independence."
"Anything which affects Parliament' s right to self-regulation affects a core element which allows it, or rather enables it, to perform its sovereign functions as the people' s representative."
"This is found in the constitutional history of all parliaments."
"This is the reason why specific precautions are introduced to prevent this sovereignty being limited in any way."
"If we take an impulsive, majority decision on a matter of this kind and interpret the annexes without taking into account how these agreements affect fundamental issues, we will in some way contravene the basic rationale, the objective of the legislation we are addressing."
"Mr President, I do not dispute the fact that the Rules of Procedure form the backbone of our sittings."
"Neither do I dispute the fact that an amendment to the Rules of Procedure is to be approved."
"But it was clear this week, having discussed this amendment extensively, that leading members from all groups were in favour of amending these Rules of Procedure now."
"It completely staggers me to think that political rearguard action has led to a situation where the largest group of this Parliament is now prepared to give out negative vibes to the outside world."
"We warned against this happening only this week."
"We said: please do not hide behind formal objections."
"Nobody has been able to prove that the formal objections will remain a reality after this amendment is adopted."
"Rumour now has it that there is no majority for this amendment itself."
"Well, I can tell you this much: we are repeating the same mistake we made in May."
"We gave bad vibes then too, namely that, despite all agreements, there continues to be a majority here in favour of maintaining a privileged situation."
"As far as I am concerned, these agreements are sacred."
"I do hope that we can approve this amendment."
"Mr President, I agree absolutely with what David Martin had to say, and it would be a disgrace if we do not vote today."
"But, at this stage, I do not wish to discuss content, I would just like to ensure, and you shall have to take responsibility for that too, that the matter is pursued."
"For we are now faced with a difficult crisis regarding the Rules of Procedure, since the matter is to be referred back to Committee again, even though the majority in this House rejected that option today."
"I therefore request that it is ensured that this resistance from a particular quarter, creating the present situation in which Members of Parliament alone are not monitored by OLAF, does not become a permanent state of affairs."
"For that is precisely what you have achieved!"
"Please deal with this matter, Mr President, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, so that we can settle it in a decent and dignified manner on behalf of the Members of this House. Otherwise, we will no longer be able to look our fellow citizens in the eye."
"Ladies and gentlemen, after listening to all the opinions, I do not believe that we can proceed to the vote on the draft decision, because the draft decision was drawn up on the basis of the amendment to the Rules of Procedure."
"I therefore think that we must look at this subject again in the future, and I too hope that we will be able to do this very soon."

"I would like to say that the work is so positive that no amendment will be rejected and, to this end, I am happy to say that the Commission accepts Amendment Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13."
"Therefore, the Commission practically accepts all of the amendments and with regard to Amendment Nos 7 and 8, it cannot accept them as they stand, but it accepts the spirit of their content."
"I can say that the work has been magnificent, that we offer our congratulations on it and on the fact that no amendment has been rejected outright."
"Mr President, I would like to express my thanks to the Commission for responding so quickly to our own quick work."
"The principal task, however, still lies ahead of us, namely that of persuading the Council."
"The chief problem area can be found in the Budget. With Parliament' s demands for EUR 980 million, we are now facing a Council proposal of EUR 350 million, and another EUR 490 million in the seven-year programme."

"Common resolution1 on the restructuring of firms"
"As you will have understood, Mr President, there is a problem in this morning' s debate. We are not agreed on the compromise text."
"It would therefore be advisable to find out, first of all, what this compromise text involves, especially in relation to paragraph 17 thereof."
"Personally, I think that if we were to adopt compromise texts which are not those that the Members signed or to which they committed their Group, we would be setting an extremely dangerous precedent."
"All the Members who were present in the House at the start have already heard the debate and several Members have already intervened."
"Clearly, we need to avoid a repeat of the debate which we had this morning, both as regards the agreement existing between the Groups on whether we should mention the firm we discussed at such length this morning and also as regards the specific question of whether the signatories of a specific compromise text were aware of the fact that a part of the text had been changed."
"I would like to make two proposals."
"Firstly, I think that the Secretary-General of Parliament should carry out a swift investigation into what actually happened."
"I think it is right for all of us to be informed for the sake of clarification."
"Some Members say they signed one text, but other Members say they signed a different one."
"I think that it is right for us to be informed as to what really happened."
"The Secretary-General of Parliament will inform us as soon as possible."
"As far as the point under discussion is concerned, I have the following proposal to make."
"If there are no objections, I can also put to the vote the part of an agreed text with regard to which there is a difference of opinion over whether or not it exists in the compromise text."
"However, I will only put this part to the vote if you all agree because, given that there are two versions, I cannot say that there is agreement."
"It is, however, possible for everyone to agree that, despite this different interpretation, it is appropriate to vote separately on the part which is controversial."
"I repeat - I can only go ahead with this vote if everyone agrees."
"I will obviously not be able to put that part to the vote if any of you is against this working hypothesis."
"To avoid restarting the debate, I would ask the Members who do not agree with the proposal which I have just made to say so immediately, so that we know whether, when we reach that part, we can vote on it or not."
"If there is an objection, I repeat, we will not be able to put it to the vote."
"Is there an objection to this proposal or do you all agree that that part of the amendment can be put to the vote anyway?"
"There are no objections?"
"Good. Well, when the time comes, we shall have a separate vote on each part."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I spoke yesterday."
"I wish to remind you that I am the representative for the town where Michelin has its headquarters, since we do not dare mention its name today, although Commissioner Diamantopoulou did have the courage to do so yesterday."
"I believe that the union leaders from Michelin who were among us yesterday will be able to assess the manner in which the majority of this House is treating them at its face value."
"Thank you, Mr Auroi, but the explanations of votes will follow shortly."
"Joint resolution1 on the rejection of the Test Ban Treaty by the United States Senate"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTES - General Budget 2000, Bourlanges report (A5-0030/1999), Virrankoski report (A5-0031/1999)"
"Mr President, I want to give a brief explanation of vote with regard to the Bourlanges report and in particular our vote on Doc. A5-30/99."
"In that document Mr Bourlanges sets out in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 the reasoning behind the conclusion that Parliament does not approve the Council' s proposals."
"In particular, paragraph 8 was an important political signal to the Council."
"My own group, which is of divided opinion on the matter, has a minority who intended to vote against paragraph 8, and did so."
"However, I also led the majority of the group inadvertently into voting against paragraph 8 due to an incorrect voting indication."
"I wish to place on record for Mr Bourlanges and for the House that the majority of my group was disposed to vote for the strategy in paragraph 8."
"I should like that to be noted and duly recorded."
"Mr President, I voted against the proposed budget of the European Parliament for the year 2000, as it seemed to lack rigour, unlike the Council proposal."
"In this respect, I would like to draw attention to two specific points, which I think are extremely indicative of the spirit and the methods which predominate within the Union' s institutions."
"Firstly, the stubbornness with which the European Parliament, despite all the regulations in force, persists in seeking to hand the taxpayers' money over to so-called European political parties."
"The Council of Amsterdam which signed and approved the Treaty of the same name had looked into this question and explicitly refused to recognise the existence of European political parties, and still less to finance them from public funds."
"We must therefore refer back to the current edition of Article 191 of the Treaty, formerly Article 138A, which only mentions, in a rather vague way, the action of political parties, I quote, ""at European level"" , which is a very different matter, or so the Amsterdam Council and the Treaty intended it at any rate, from the idea of a ""European political party"" strictly speaking."
"So, in the Parliament budget, under Category 3710, we are surprised to read an entry relating to contributions to European political parties, with an explanation to the effect that the Commission is shortly to present a statute for European political parties."
"Such a brief reference and yet it contains three instances of irregularity. There is no European political party, there is no provision for the allocation of public funds to them, and the Commission has no right to prepare a statute of this type, which is not in accordance with the Treaty."
"In doing this, the European Parliament is moving its pawns in an illegal manner."
"Admittedly, for the moment no appropriations have been allocated to this item, but, even so - and this is my second point - it has set aside an enormous appropriation, of EUR 60 million, in a reserve for the Members' Statute, which is rather mysterious, since the statute does not yet exist and, in any case, even if such a Members' Statute were to be adopted, it would certainly not apply within the present term of office."
"These two problems, apparently unrelated, lead me to draw a common conclusion."
"As recently as last year, the Court of Justice of the European Communities severely reprimanded the Commission for making budget expenditure commitments without a legal basis, with the collusion of the European Parliament."
"I observe that these practices are continuing and even getting worse, since now the European Parliament itself is taking a direct part in it."
"Thus the old European rule is still being applied here: every base act is permitted as long as it contributes to the construction of a federal Europe."
"Mr President, unlike the vast majority in Parliament, I think that the Union should finance its possible activity in Kosovo, East Timor and Turkey with appropriations that remain within the excessiveness threshold for Category 4 of the Financial Perspective."
"The same goes for the adoption of the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"As the Council has stated, no precise estimates of the aid requirements have been presented other than those regarding Kosovo."
"It is thus too early to fix the total amount of appropriation needed for external operations next year."
"Besides, funds have already now been reallocated to respond to the challenges that go with the relief operations mentioned above."
"Regarding point 11 in the report, I think that Parliament, for its part, committed to reviewing its statute already last spring, so that travel expenses would be paid according to bona fide costs incurred."
"Although I am also personally committed to reviewing the expenses arrangements on the basis of bona fide costs, I call also on the Council' s commitment to push through Parliament' s proposal."
"Mr President, I would like to move on to the Virrankoski report."
"I would like to indicate to the voters that we at the European Parliament are not just big spenders but that we also look after the pennies."
"I was therefore disappointed to hear that Parliament did not adopt my amendment."
". (EL) Budget 2000 marks a major turning point in the whole question of funding for Turkey."
"The Council has introduced the amounts to be used for action to extend the EU-Turkey Customs Union and for the economic and social development of Turkey, but it has not set the usual political criteria which have to be fulfilled nor has it allocated any of the funds to action over the earthquakes."
"For the first time in years, the amendment of the Committee on Budgets not only approves the Council' s appropriations but actually increases them, thereby making good the cuts the Council had previously made as a result of Kosovo."
"Also, instead of stipulating the political criteria which the European Parliament had so rigidly laid down, it has simply confined itself in the ""Remarks"" section to mention of an institutional control mechanism, the actual effectiveness of which, from our experience with the MEDA programme, is somewhat questionable."
"Unfortunately, the position of the European Parliament benefits neither democratic nor human rights in Turkey, does not encourage a settlement of the Cyprus and Kurdish questions and does not support the tragic victims of the earthquakes in Turkey."
"- (FR) In today' s sitting, the European Parliament adopted the General Budget of the European Union for the financial year 2000."
"The vote on the budget is a key point in the parliamentary calendar."
"Throughout the process of drawing up the budget, the Group of the Party of European Socialists forcefully defended the principles of Union solidarity and political commitment with regard to the most disadvantaged in order to meet the objective of eradicating poverty."
"As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I paid particular attention to the development of Category 4, intended to finance the Union' s external policies and to promote development aid."
"Indeed, the Community' s historical and political responsibility towards developing countries must be fully taken up by this House and represents one of our absolute priorities."
"Despite the rationale of the general reduction of appropriations allocated to development aid, the European Community is, and must remain, the main partner of the most disadvantaged countries."
"In this respect, we cannot accept the Council proposal to implement a 10% reduction in the appropriations allocated for cooperation and development in order to finance the reconstruction of Kosovo and aid to Turkey following the earthquake, or support for East Timor."
"The cost of these displays of solidarity, all perfectly legitimate, must not be borne by the poorest countries on earth."
"Indeed, how could we sanction any reduction in the amounts allocated to the prevention of AIDS when it is known that 25 million people on the continent of Africa are already condemned to die from this scourge?"
"Industrialised countries in general and the Member States of the Union in particular must not withdraw from their development aid commitment as that would have social, economic, political and health-related repercussions on the ever fragile equilibrium of the most disadvantaged countries."
"This is why, while being fully aware that the increase in Community spending is occasionally hard for the public finances of Member States to bear, I voted, in spite of everything, in favour of the resolution proposed by the general rapporteur for the budget."
"The European Women' s Lobby represents over 3,000 different women' s organisations across the EU."
"It has represented the interests of women with competence and professionalism."
"The group has provided invaluable information and support, particularly on the impact of European programmes on women' s lives."
"We have also been able, as individuals, to access information, evidence and analysis when necessary."
"The material produced by the lobby is high quality, as are the forums, seminars and conferences which they organise."
"A clear example of this was a day conference involving women from all over the EU which was held in Cardiff to coincide with the summit during the UK presidency."
"It is clearly inadvisable to distribute the funds between a variety of organisations which would, by definition, fail to identify the core objectives in terms of giving the service which EWL can so uniquely provide."
"The agenda pursued by EWL is clear and incontrovertible - to promote the concerns, priorities and interests of women."
"The accusations which have been made, that the EWL is a ""single issue"" body, is simply not true when it represents such large numbers of women through its 3000 member organisations."
"- (DE) The Members of the Austrian Freedom Party will be rejecting both Mr Bourlanges' motion for a resolution (individual plan III - Commission) and Mr Virrankoski' s (further individual plans), since the principles of transparency and efficiency in the budget procedure were not respected."
"Nor is it possible to carry out effective supervision of the Union' s budgetary procedure."
"Apart from that, the Commission operates far too ponderously."
"The processing of applications and payments to the citizens of the Union in some cases takes more than 18 months, leading to justifiable criticism of the administration of the Union."
"Insufficient funds and programmes are provided in the Budget 2000 for real problems such as, for example, the high rate of unemployment."
"The Union is somewhat helpless in the face of the effects of globalisation and the introduction of the euro."
"Instead of developing employment schemes or programmes promoting small and medium-sized enterprises, the Union indulges in an administration which is far too expensive, with two parliament buildings, for instance."
"The challenge for the future will be whether the EU can manage to draw up common principles which ensure that an economic recovery returns to Europe through which the problems of the labour market can for the most part, be eliminated."
"To this end it will also be necessary, however, for the administrations of the Union and national states to be structured more effectively."
"Since it cannot seriously be discerned that the Union can contribute to an economic recovery in Europe, the Budget for 2000 is rejected in its entirety."
". (EL) The Commission' s draft and more so the Council' s draft EU budget for 2000 are marked by their austerity and drastic cuts, even in relation to the decisions reached at the European Council meeting in Berlin."
"Budget 2000 is an austerity budget with drastic cuts in agricultural, structural and social expenditure."
"It is a budget tailor made to the Stability Pact and to the drastic cuts imposed on Member States both within and outside the euro zone."
"The victims of this policy are the public at large, workers, farmers, artisans, young people and women."
"In the agricultural section of the budget, it is evident that even before the start of the multilateral negotiations of the World Trade Organisation, the EU wishes to join forces with the Americans and reduce protection and intervention by reducing the funds allocated to individual agricultural products."
"In turn, this will entail further cuts in producers' income and further restrictions on farming."
"What is particularly worrying is the fact that, alongside the reduction in support expenditure for agricultural product markets, there is also an increase in and systemisation of expenditure under the second pillar of the CAP intended to wipe out small and medium-sized farmers."
"We have noted a reduction in the Structural Funds, which proves that the heroic declarations to iron out social and regional inequalities were merely rabble-rousing tactics."
"The same goes for the exceptionally limited social expenditure which is oriented not towards reducing unemployment or improving workers' lives, but towards facilitating measures to upset working relations."
"We wish to denounce the efforts to activate the appropriations allocated to Turkey within the framework of the Customs Union and for the promotion of Euro-Turkish relations. We are equally against the tabling of proposals to approve the necessary appropriate legal bases, when it is a well-known fact that the human rights situation in Turkey has showed no signs of improvement, that the same policy is still being pursued on the Kurdish question and that Turkey is still occupying a large part of Cyprus."
"We also wish to condemn the hypocrisy of the EU on the Kosovo issue."
"On the one hand, it has totally destroyed the area with its unprovoked and criminal attacks on Yugoslavia and, on the other hand, it is now bending over backwards with its restructuring endeavours, without prejudice of course, while at the same time demanding that the perfectly legitimate government and the President of the country be overthrown."
"Despite the report' s containing certain positive individual amendments, it embraces the restrictive and unacceptable agreements reached in Berlin on Agenda 2000."
"It would be naïve of us to expect a different approach from the bodies of the EU, when both the community budget and national budgets have to operate within the unpopular and austere framework of the Maastricht criteria with tight cutbacks in public finances. It would be naïve to expect a different approach when the external policy of the EU is marked by crass hypocrisy, oppressive controls and the ever-increasing subjugation of countries, not to mention open and multiple intervention in their own internal affairs, as is the case with the enlargement process and the Stability Pact for south-eastern Europe."
"For these reasons, we shall once again be voting against the draft budget."
". UK Liberal Democrats are voting with this budget line as proposed by the Committee on Budgets, but in anticipation that further discussion is to take place in order to meet the substantive points of Mr Jan Mulder, MEP, and to find more financial resources within the overall total without either depleting the reserves or calling upon the Council to provide new funds."
"Reconstruction aid to Kosovo is essential but the pile-up of earlier unspent budget lines means that more discussion might be fruitful."
". I raised the issue, put to me by European citizens, of an unacceptable monopoly within the process of European funding."
"The ""Scallon amendment"" was not accepted by the Committee on Budgets."
"My colleagues who belong to this committee drafted an amendment in order to broaden funding for women' s groups to a wider range of women' s groups."
"Parliament today has debated this issue and the vote continues this monopolistic arrangement."
"The issue will certainly continue to be debated over the next year."
"It is a matter of principle that all women, and the groups that are campaigning for them, should have equal access to EU funding, most of all when its aim is to allow European organisations to be represented at UN level."
"People are well aware that sometimes it is necessary to take a stand on the principle of transparency and fairness in our democratic structures."
"Monopolistic arrangements cannot be allowed to continue."
"While I acknowledge that a monopolistic arrangement has been allowed to continue, I welcome the continuing allowance of EUR 600 000 and would welcome future increases, hoping, of course, that it will assist in making all women' s voices heard."
"Napolitano report (A5-0036/1999)"
"Mr President, I would like to state that I have voted against the referral back to Committee of the Napolitano report and in favour of the inclusion in the Rules of Procedure of the Annex which appears in the said report."
"I have done so firstly for basic reasons of coherence because, when the text of the Annex was signed by me in the name of this Parliament, I did so in accordance with the mandate of the competent bodies of this Parliament."
"Today' s vote seems serious to me because it entails the discrediting, not of me personally, which would not matter, but of the bodies of Parliament itself during the last legislature."
"Secondly, because I cannot see anywhere, and nor did we see it at the time nor since, these supposed legal irregularities which would give rise to the rejection of the text."
"Thirdly, for political reasons."
"It seems to me to be a serious political error that, if the Council and the Commission have established a system through which its own members, the Commissioners, Ministers and Heads of State of the Member States, can be investigated in the event of irregularities, we MEPs cannot also be investigated."
"For these reasons, I have voted in favour of the Napolitano report and against its referral back to Committee."
"Mr President, very much in the same tone as Mr Gil-Robles I voted against referral back and for the amendment which, sadly, was rejected."
"I have to say that a section of the EPP Group were playing games on this issue."
"There is a valid need to draw a distinction between staff matters, which are a Bureau responsibility, and Members' matters which are a plenary responsibility."
"That would have been dealt with by Amendment No 2 had we reached that amendment."
"I was disappointed because the Christian Democrats, as well as the Socialists, had put their names to Amendment No 2 and so it would have been carried and the matter would have been covered."
"As Mr Gil-Robles has said, and as I said earlier, we are now in a position where the interinstitutional agreement as regards OLAF applies to the Commission, to the Council and to the staff of this institution but it does not apply to the Members of this institution."
"Given that we are the institution that, quite rightly, has made great play of tackling fraud in European Community institutions, how are the citizens of Europe going to understand that the only people with whom OLAF has not reached an agreement in terms of internal investigations are Members of the European Parliament?"
"It puts us in an intolerable position."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to say that we supported approval of the interinstitutional agreement as an essential building block in re-establishing the credibility of the European Union in how it relates to fraud and deals with allegations of fraud."
"It is highly regrettable that we have not been able to approve this today, for the reasons outlined by my colleague Mr David Martin."
"It leaves Parliament in a highly embarrassing position and with a few honourable exceptions, notably Mr Gil-Robles, the attitude of the European People' s Party is highly hypocritical."
"They supported this in committee."
"They supported it in the debate on Monday in which they stated clearly and unequivocally that they would be supporting this proposal, and yet today they back out of it and they fail to adopt it."
"How can we show ourselves to our electorate and how will the EPP be able to show itself to the electorate when it quite rightly makes a fuss about fraud in the election campaign yet, when it comes to delivering here, it fails to deliver?"
"The EPP Group needs to examine its conscience and to do so rapidly because the position it has created in Parliament today is an embarrassment for all of us."
"Mr President, I see that at the last minute there has been an avalanche of explanations of votes regarding referral of the Napolitano report to committee."
"I have the impression that my own has been lost en route, and I would also like to give an explanation."
"Thank you."
"I believe that the question before us is not whether or not the expenses of Members of Parliament must be strictly controlled."
"I am the first to say, and I explained this at length in my speech last Monday, that there must absolutely be supervision, but that this must be specific supervision, in line with our role as elected representatives, Members of Parliament."
"In this respect I have just heard many rough approximations, in my opinion."
"The institutional agreement explicitly mentions the members of institutions, true, but if you take this expression in context you see that it is more a matter of paid members, such as the members of the Commission, and that the terms established are not appropriate for elected members like those of the European Parliament."
"The two categories of member must not be muddled."
"In the Napolitano report there is, indeed, another strange confusion resulting from this, between the situation of Members of Parliament and that of officials."
"Quite clearly, as far as officials are concerned, the decision could have been taken long ago."
"Besides, Mr President, the Annex was, in my opinion, related to the main body of the text and, consequently, it was not possible, as you quite rightly decided, to vote on the Annex after rejecting the main body of the text."
"Referral to committee is therefore perfectly justifiable."
"The Napolitano report had been discussed too quickly, in haste, and many things had been overlooked."
"- (FR) The project on which we are called upon to declare our opinion in the form of the report by our fellow member, Mr Graça-Moura, is hardly a matter for controversy and is one which can legitimately gain the support of Parliament in its entirety."
"Indeed, the European Union has a central role to play in the development of culture and the arts in Europe."
"In the vision of a Europe of the nations, which is the one I am arguing in favour of here, this is precisely the type of action in which European cooperation can contribute a significant added value."
"But I must stress that we are not to be fooled, for all that."
"The fact that Parliament wishes to substitute the term ""cultural policy"" for the term ""cultural cooperation"" shows the temptation to standardise of a ""European"" cultural policy intended to replace those of Member States would have."
"Culture must not be the test-bed used by ideologists for the creation of the ""European nation"" ."
"There is no European culture, any more than there is a European nation."
"There are, and this is a formidable source of cultural wealth, many nations which participate in the European Union, and many national cultures."
"This programme will, I hope, contribute towards permitting all citizens of Member States to discover this wealth and this diversity."
"The Union for a Europe of Nations Group will always support programmes intended to promote exchanges, to develop the appetite for culture in the citizens of our Member States. As long as this really means exchanges and discovery and not creating the Homo Europeus who knows the speeches of Jean Monnet off by heart."
"This new expression of European cultural cooperation is of very special importance on the eve of the Seattle negotiations which will not, I fear, do anything to challenge American cultural hegemony."
"This is why I am warning the Commission and Parliament against the temptation to use these programmes as an instrument for propaganda or standardisation."
"There is too much at stake."
"Moreover, and in conclusion, it seems to me that the war of figures which Parliament, the Council and the Commission are waging regarding this case is particularly fruitless."
"We all know that the European Union must face up to decisions, painful decisions perhaps, but crucial decisions, in order to ensure its enlargement."
"So, please, ladies and gentlemen, let us learn to face up to our responsibilities, and let us not accuse the Council of stinginess, when it is simply facing up to the responsibilities which voters and tax payers in our Member States have entrusted to it."
"Restructuring of firms"
"- (FR) The Union for a Europe of Nations Group co-signed the joint motion for resolution on the restructuring of firms in the face of globalisation, since it indicates the beginning of a new spirit, distancing itself from free-tradism, and encouraging one to think of international trade ""in terms of the more complex objective of sustainable development"" ."
"Indeed I believe that, even though it would be inappropriate to challenge the idea of international free trade, it should however now be forced to take account of a number of unquantified costs imposed on society in Europe."
"We must somehow continue to reap the advantages of free trade while neutralising its disadvantages."
"Among the unquantified costs are the social costs resulting from firms relocating."
"Of course, the redistribution of the workforce internationally may contribute to the better use of the workforce, and thus ultimately benefit everyone."
"But, at the same time, competition in terms of wages marginalises the least qualified personnel in developed societies, and this is something we cannot accept."
"Michelin, who have just implemented some controversial redundancies in France, are in precisely this type of situation, since its main competitor produces tyres in Eastern European countries where wage costs are five times less."
"The French Minister for Social Affairs, Mrs Aubry, put forward the idea of charging Michelin an exceptional unemployment contribution."
"This proposal seems absurd, since, in the event, this firm is, if anything, the victim."
"As far as I am concerned, I would propose the exact opposite. Firms who have their manufacturing operations in low-wage countries should be forced to pay an exceptional unemployment contribution when they import goods into France, or into Europe."
"This contribution would be one element, but no doubt not the only one, in a system for balancing out social costs so as to better regulate international trade between heterogeneous areas, without however depriving us of the advantages of free trade."
"We consider that this proposal is one that should be put on the table at the forthcoming trade talks of the Millennium Round which is about to begin in Seattle."
"I would furthermore like to take this opportunity to recall the main objectives of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group at the beginning of these negotiations."
"1) We would like the importance of the problems which were not resolved by the Uruguay Round to be stressed, problems whose harmful effects we are only just starting to perceive, in the fields of social costs, as I have just mentioned, but also those of the environment, public health, food, etc."
"It should be remembered, even so, that, alone against the world, or almost, we refused to approve the Uruguay Round, both in the French National Assembly and in the European Parliament, for precisely this reason, i.e. we thought it extremely dangerous to agree to significant reductions in customs tariffs without first resolving the essential collateral problems."
"And so now we have to try to make up for lost time by entering these matters of social, environmental and health costs on the agenda for Seattle."
"2) We want an objective and complete assessment of the Uruguay Round to be drawn up, based on the transparent consultation of governments and specialist non-governmental organisations."
"We refuse to negotiate in the dark, as at present."
"It is inappropriate for negotiations to begin in such conditions, and a period of moratorium must be decided while waiting for the assessment to be drawn up."
"3) We object all the more to a number of matters which the European Union presently proposes to add to the Seattle agenda, subjects whose consequences we shall absolutely not be able to control."
"I shall cite in particular the question of international investments, which would lead to a second attempt to establish the ghastly Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI)."
"I shall also cite the definition of a world competition policy which, as presented today, even more surely than current European policy would lead to public services being compromised."
"4) Finally, we demand that future negotiations openly acknowledge one fundamental principle from the outset, the principle that each nation has the right to choose its own laws, and international trade must respect them."
"As a logical consequence of this, every nation has the right to express choices and preferences."
"Areas of preference, be they regionally-based (European Community) or functionally-based (the Lomé Convention), must immediately be recognised as legitimate if they are founded on the democratic decisions of the peoples concerned."
"- (FR) Ridicule never killed anyone."
"Fortunately for the European Parliament, which should have strongly denounced the attitude of the Michelin management which has just announced a massive series of cuts in workforce and redundancies, even though the returns and profits for this firm increased substantially."
"The simultaneous nature of the announcements, of course, blatantly exposed the scandalous and unfair aspect of current economic reasoning and this financial capitalism which has gained the upper hand in Europe and throughout the world."
"Of course, in the first place, the European Parliament must, in this specific instance, strongly condemn the Michelin management, and request that the firm reconsiders these job losses, and assure the group' s employees of its solidarity."
"But this House must also learn the lessons necessary to improve Community legislation, in order to provide some protection for employees against such practices."
"Obviously, the directive on collective redundancy procedure must be reviewed and measures which afford greater protection for workers and for jobs must be included in it."
"In particular, it is necessary for employees to be able to challenge the actual basis for these redundancies and the economic motives for these before they are actually implemented, and this at a very early stage of the procedure."
"Moreover, the establishment of real group level works councils, European Committees with real powers, becomes ever more essential."
"Once more, the European Parliament should review its directive on this point."
"Our resolution is singularly lacking in determination and it is to be feared that, unless widespread forces are mobilised, Social Europe will go unheeded on a long-term basis."
", in writing. (EL) The phenomenon of mass redundancies from large multinationals which seems to be having an 'avalanche' effect is a sharp slap in the face for the high-sounding proclamations on tackling unemployment and job creation in the EU."
"Goodyear, Renault and now Michelin, having adapted themselves to the growth models created by the single market and integrated into the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties and EMU, have turned the climate of unaccountability to their advantage by gradually annihilating every form of social responsibility and protection of workers."
"This has created more unemployment and increased levels of social exclusion."
"Extensive restructuring and company mergers have favoured increased profit-yielding activities at the cost of productive investments which, in turn, has led to mass redundancies."
"Pretexts are hardly even needed now in the climate of rampant competition and unaccountability of big business, as is apparent from the announcements by the Michelin management of a 17% increase in profits and 7,500 redundancies, adding to the 15,000 redundancies in recent years."
"This callousness and cynicism are not only endorsed by the EU and its various bodies; they are also being funded in the context of direct or indirect financial aid intended to safeguard competitiveness on a global scale."
"The human factor has been largely overridden by the most barbaric form of capitalism."
"Employees are expected, with a gun threatening unemployment held to their heads, to underwrite increased profits and to accept humiliating agreements on terms, conditions and salaries, as in the Michelin case, only to find that their jobs are eventually axed anyway."
"EMU is a one-way street for monopolies whose only aim is to increase profits and consolidate their power."
"Employees have nothing to gain by following this route which only leads to unemployment, a lower quality of life, marginalisation and eventual destitution."
"Since employee protection is being violated and disregarded altogether and since employees' rights are being flagrantly trampled underfoot, the only way open to employees is to protest, fight, challenge the choices made by the monopolies and EMU and fight for full employment, improved living conditions, real social development and prosperity."
"Today' s resolution, in effect, renders the European Parliament jointly responsible for implementing more unpopular policies to the detriment of workers."
"It is an unacceptable resolution and, on behalf of all working people, we shall be voting against it."
"Nuclear tests"
"Throughout Europe, the restructuring and relocation of companies, particularly multinationals, has resulted in several thousand employees being laid off, a situation that is unacceptable and that is to be condemned for the serious economic and social consequences it has on the workers, on the region and on the country affected."
"Cases such as that of Michelin in France, of Renault, Grundig, Siemens and Texas Instruments, amongst others, in Portugal, have made it clear that it is crucial to strengthen European legislation and legislation in the Member States in order to protect workers' rights, particularly their jobs, and to prevent multinationals from continuing to act in an arbitrary way, in order to achieve greater profits."
"It is particularly important that special attention is paid to the granting of any kind of subsidy to these companies, which should always be conditional on jobs being maintained, and weighty penalties must be provided for as well as the return of subsidies received if this does not happen."
"It is equally vital that the necessary measures are taken to give more rights and more scope for intervention to the European Works Councils established in the 94/95 directive, particularly in terms of the right to suspend licences."
"- (EL) The arrogance of the American superpower, as demonstrated by its flagrantly murderous bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, is becoming all the more defiant and monocratic towards all the people of the world, with endless Senate decisions on the research and development of nuclear weapons."
"Following the recent Senate decision to restart the famous ""Star Wars"" by voting for further funding, in contravention of the ABM Agreement, its refusal to ratify the Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons demonstrates out and out contempt towards worldwide demands for a general and comprehensive ban on all nuclear testing."
"At present, popular movements are fighting for the total abolition of nuclear weapons and, with the threat looming of a resurgence of nuclear rivalry, the general public is calling for a reduction in military defence expenditure to avert the danger of a nuclear disaster. Nevertheless, the USA is not only adopting an extremely defiant stance by blocking efforts to stabilise international relations but it is deliberately undermining endeavours to build a climate of international peace and security."
"This move has evoked considerable concern over the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the extensive armament of certain regions of the world and the modernisation of weapons of mass destruction."
"Recent revelations concerning the proliferation of nuclear weapons and warheads to third countries which are not nuclear powers, and unbeknownst to their citizens, have added a new terrorist dimension to the threat of a nuclear disaster."
"Unfortunately, some EU Member States, Greece for example, are included in those countries."
"To ensure that the aspirations of the peace movement are respected all over the world, we are calling for immediate and specific initiatives to be introduced to abolish all nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. We are also calling for a general and definitive end to nuclear tests, a ban on the deployment of nuclear weapons outside the boundaries of the countries that own them, in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the withdrawal of all atomic weapons which are either deployed or stored in other countries and a ban on the export of all nuclear waste."
"If the funds for nuclear testing and armament were released and channelled towards more productive investments in economic and social cohesion, education, culture and the protection of the environment, then this could ensure conciliation and peaceful co-existence and enhance mutual relations and equal cooperation."
"This and only this can encourage, strengthen and guarantee stability and peace."
"The rest would simply overfeed the greedy interests of monopolies and imperialism, particularly American imperialism which is a constant threat to all the people on earth."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.18 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Transport of dangerous goods by rail"
"The next item is the report (A5-0027/1999) by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 96/49/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail [COM(1999)0157 - C5-0005/1999 - 1999/0087(COD)]."
"Mr President, as you said yourself, the report concerns a Commission proposal on the transport of dangerous goods by rail."
"In recent years, this transport has expanded considerably, thus increasing the risks of accidents occurring."
"The international transport of dangerous goods by rail is governed by the regulations concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by rail, usually known as RID."
"All the Member Sates are contracting parties to this Convention whose geographical scope extends beyond the European Union."
"This Convention only applies to cross-border transport and does not cover the national carriage of dangerous goods by rail."
"Therefore, and in order to ensure a high level of safety for national and international transport operations and to guarantee the elimination of distortions of competition, the European Union has adopted Directive 96/49/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail."
"The main purpose of this Community legislation is to extend the above-mentioned regulations concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by rail (RID) to national transport, i.e., to transport operations within the national territory of each Member State."
"The aforementioned directive entered into force in January 1997."
"However, this directive provided for a certain number of derogations, restrictions and exemptions."
"In particular, transitional provisions expiring on 1 January 1999 relating to the construction, use and conditions of carriage of new tanks and new receptacles for the transport of gas, allowed Member States to retain the provisions of their national legislation."
"The reason was that the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) had not yet completed work to standardise the construction and use of tanks and receptacles."
"The present proposal aims to extend the aforementioned transitional period until 1 July 2001, or even longer for the transportation of pressure equipment for which no detailed technical specifications or no adequate references to the relevant European standards exist."
"In this case, the date of entry into force of the provisions of the directive is to be determined by the Committee set up on the basis of the directive."
"The reason for the postponement is that, due to delays in the standardisation work being carried out by the European Committee for Standardisation, the 1999 version of the RID does not incorporate standards for the construction and use of tanks and receptacles for transporting Class 2 gases."
"The second objective of the present proposal is to amend certain provisions in Article 6 concerning derogations and to specify their acceptance procedure in more detail."
"In particular, it aims to define the conditions that must be met for the application of certain derogations authorising Member States, as an exceptional measure, to issue administrative authorisations valid on their territory alone to carry out ""ad hoc"" transport operations of dangerous goods."
"The general public takes a great interest in the transport of dangerous goods and measures relating to such transport."
"Ensuring quality and safety standards in the carriage of goods by rail must be the main objective of any EU legislation in this field."
"The key problem is that standards for the construction and use of tanks and receptacles for transporting Class 2 gases have not yet been agreed by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN)."
"In all Member States, there are various provisions in industrial and transport law concerning the packing and transportation of these gases."
"The national regulations can be very different, in particular on technical grounds and also for climatic reasons, which leads to a fragmentation of the market within the EU which is incompatible with the single market."
"It is therefore difficult to explain to the general public why the necessary common European standards have not yet been incorporated into the Annex to the EU legislation."
"This is the reason why I cannot welcome this Commission proposal."
"I understand, however, the need to extend the deadlines in Directive 96/49, in order to preclude the need for Member States to amend their national legislation for a brief period, entailing extra expenditure for the Member States and industry."
"With regard to the second part of the proposal specifying the conditions on which a transport operation can be considered an ""ad hoc"" transport operation and also regarding the procedure for the acceptance of derogations, I personally welcome and approve the Commission proposal which is, in fact, more stringent than the legislation in force today."
"Mr President, we have latterly been discussing technical regulations, technical details, regarding which one might ask whether such details are actually the concern of Parliament."
"Transport safety in all transport operators has always been an important matter of concern to Parliament, particularly, of course, in the transportation of dangerous goods."
"The annoying thing about the matter before us is that the CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, is extremely dilatory."
"We therefore find ourselves in the situation of having to concede an extension to the time limit for, as the rapporteur said, it would be senseless if all Member States were now going to have to issue further individual regulations for a set period of time."
"We therefore need common regulations which are as strict as possible, also for the transportation of dangerous goods."
"Consequently, one can only fully endorse the proposal of the rapporteur, our committee chairman, and also thank him for the work which he inevitably took on himself."
"This would have been superfluous if the other authorities had completed their work in good time."
"Mr President, if we want dangerous goods and materials to be transported primarily by rail, then it would seem necessary, as a matter of urgency, to establish requirements for the conditions for this."
"The fact is that the general population and the personnel working in this sector are being subjected to ever greater risk, and this is due to a number of reasons."
"Firstly, the privatisation of rail networks, particularly in all matters to do with their maintenance, presents serious problems for safety, with an increasing number of accidents occasionally causing real disasters in human terms, such as we have just seen in Great Britain."
"The need to make profits and competitivity are enshrined in European standards. They demand drastic reductions in costs, always to the detriment of the employees who nonetheless play an essential part in the field of maintenance and safety."
"This is done without any supervision."
"Neither officials, nor users, nor citizens are called upon to give their opinion."
"The diversity of the legislation within each State further complicates safety matters and increases the risk factor."
"As far as we are concerned, it is important for the principle of precaution and of maximum safety to have priority."
"This is true, particularly for the transportation of radioactive waste, which is dealt with in France with intolerable insouciance, particularly in the case at The Hague, with little respect for the health of railway workers and the general public."
"Today, then, it is a matter of urgency to put an end to privatisation, to increase staff levels, and to give these people proper training, to enforce compulsory budgets reserved for the maintenance and supervision thereof, to set up user/professional committees to supervise traffic, to enforce an official right of veto with regard to goods transfers when real risks are involved."
"This would make it possible to take preventative action rather than waiting for accidents to happen, as they will, more and more, if no action is taken involving the authorities and the general public."
"Mr President, it is absolutely crucial that we obtain some common regulations, offering a very high level of protection, governing the transport of dangerous goods by rail."
"The risk of accidents has increased concurrently with the growth in the number of consignments of this kind in recent years."
"I myself have experienced at close quarters a rail accident involving dangerous goods."
"A few years ago, a goods wagon containing poison overturned in my home town of Næstved, with catastrophic consequences."
"The dangerous liquid poured out."
"If there had been a powerful wind, thousands of people could have been poisoned."
"It was so serious that the team which cleared the track after the accident was clothed in what looked like space suits, which almost began to melt."
"I am therefore very glad that we in the EU are making a point of enforcing some very high standards in connection with this kind of transport."
"The present directive states that the international regulations in this sphere also apply to transport within the individual Member States."
"Unfortunately, it was necessary to have a number of exceptions because the European experts had not finished drawing up standards for the transport of gas."
"The Member States were therefore given permission to keep their national regulations for a transitional period."
"The experts have still not completed their work, and the transitional arrangements ought therefore to be extended."
"I therefore think that we shall be voting for the report."
"In fact, it secures a high national level of protection which can be retained until such time as we get acceptable international regulations adopted."
"But we need to get a move on before a major accident occurs."
"We have been lucky."
"But for how long will our luck last, and for how long can we go on saying that we are getting by unscathed?"
"One of these days, an accident will happen with disastrous consequences, and we shall be left with a bad taste in our mouths for not having got things organised."
"So let us make sure now that we get this matter sorted out properly."
"Mr President, I wish to speak in favour of the report by Mr Hatzidakis, simply because we do need regulations on the transportation of dangerous goods in Europe. I would, however, add at the same time that this report also describes the tense relationship of road and rail."
"We have, in the agreements which we are to conclude here, repeatedly drawn attention, from many different points of view, to the fact that rail transport must be intensified."
"This is as is should be, because we do need these transport operators, particularly in the case of dangerous goods."
"There is no doubt about it."
"But we must approach this subject honestly and ask ourselves whether we have the necessary capacity in this sector."
"I have my doubts in this regard."
"I think all of us here, getting up on our soap-boxes, have repeatedly discussed the capacity of the railway system, a capacity which just does not exist in reality, either because too few rail networks are available or because there is much too much passenger traffic on these rail networks."
"I believe we need a touch more honesty in this discussion."
"I myself come from a region in Germany, the Ruhr, in which there is a very dense railway network, but despite that we can observe in the same region that the capacity available is simply far from adequate, even if it was required."
"Permit me to introduce a second aspect in connection with this, a matter which I believe it is very important to take note of."
"Whenever the European Parliament discusses this theme or similar ones, it is clear to me that this is a field which we must deal with on the European scale, for example, on the subject of railways, or on the subject of the transportation of dangerous goods."
"It is accepted that we should establish a common European transport policy."
"It is accepted that we should establish a common European environmental policy, and these are precisely the areas where this Parliament and European policy are credible, in my opinion."
"So what use are national regulations, for dangerous goods on the road, for instance, if we need Europe-wide regulations?"
"This is precisely the point described in this report."
"We do not need to justify to the citizens of Europe the fact that we need a common European environmental policy or a European safety policy in this field relating to dangerous goods."
"It has been accepted and is understood."
"It is applicable, besides, to other areas of transport policy."
"Let me just mention, in connection with this, that there is no longer anyone in Europe who understands why we still regulate aviation safety in Europe on a national and not a European basis."
"I am therefore grateful to President Prodi for adding this as a point and clearly emphasising it in the Commission' s intergovernmental programme."
"We must put an end to petty national jealousies and say that, with five phases, we could guarantee safety in aviation in Europe."
"In this area we need European solutions, not national solutions, and here the national state is yielding none of its sovereignty. Instead, all one is trying to understand here is what is necessary in order to provide safety."
"The sovereignty of national states was lost long ago in the fields of the environment, aviation, or safety. This is an area where Europe must make a positive contribution."
"That is why this report may be seen in isolation as dealing with a specific subject, but when it is examined in the European context, it becomes clear that this report is outlining more than the specific subject of dangerous goods on the rail network. It exemplifies the fact that in this House we do see connections, and this is something I wished to stress clearly once more."
"Let us approve this report, and on all matters let us keep in mind the big picture, seeing this as a document which contributes towards a Europe which is responsive to its citizens."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to thank Mr Hatzidakis, rapporteur and President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, for the excellent report which he has carried out concerning the proposed amendment of the framework Directive on the transport of dangerous goods by rail."
"The truth is that the framework directive entered into force in January 1997 and the current Commission proposal attempts to resolve the problems of application of the transitional provisions concerning containers for the transport of gases and tanks."
"In fact, as has been correctly pointed out by Mr Hatzidakis, this directive lays down certain transitional provisions, valid until 1 January of the current year, in order to allow for the termination of certain work by the European Committee for Standardisation."
"To this end, I would like to express my agreement with Mr Hatzidakis and with certain other speakers and to express my regret that the European Committee for Standardisation has still not reached an agreement which would allow Member States to legislate in accordance with what will be the final regulation, and not to find themselves in a position, if today and in the weeks to come we are not capable of amending the current directive, where they have to legislate to amend the legislation once again within a short space of time, with all the problems which that would entail."
"We are talking in the short term about the application of paragraph 4 of Article 6 which refers to containers for the transport of class 2 gas, as well as the corresponding tanks."
"The time limit for this provision causes problems and therefore we will have to see how this situation can be resolved."
"We are simply trying to resolve a question which, if the Committee had done its work on time and correctly, we would not be facing now."
"On the other hand, the second objective of the present proposal is the amendment of certain provisions concerning derogations, with the aim of making them more precise, as well as the amendment of the procedure for their approval."
"Given the good reception in this regard, which amounts to an acceptance without amendments on the part of this Parliament, it only remains for me to thank you for your cooperation, study and work."
"I would like, however, to make some comments about what has been said in the debate."
"Firstly, it is clear that a directive is necessary because we are amending a previous directive."
"In this case, the instrument necessary to amend a directive is another directive."
"Passing on to other matters, I would like to reply to Mr Pohjamo that Directive 96/35 on safety advisers, which will enter into force on 1 January 2000, will contribute to the application of the legislation on the transport of dangerous goods, and make it more transparent and more in line with our intentions."
"I would like lastly to comment briefly on what Mr Konrad said with regard to the capacity of rail transport and the promotion of railways by the Commission and the Member States."
"It is true, as he has said, that in certain areas of the network we have a situation of overload, with infrastructures which are already very well used, particularly for the transport of persons, which is the form of use which is currently the priority of all the Member States in terms of their railway policy."
"In recent years, when the Member States have supported the railway it has mainly been with regard to the transport of persons."
"These magnificent and successful efforts mean that today we have high speed trains which connect, for example, Brussels and Paris in little more than an hour."
"But in fact we still have the problem of the transport of goods by rail."
"And I believe that in this area we still have work to do."
"The forecast regarding the increase in the transport of goods in the coming years - which is good or bad depending on your point of view - is very significant."
"This increase will be the result of increased development and growth in our countries and, in a way, if it did not happen, it would be a bad indication with regard to the performance of our economy and therefore of our society as well."
"To this end, we must improve the infrastructures."
"And above all the interoperability of our trains."
"As Mr Konrad has explained very effectively, when you arrive at a border in a goods train, it probably takes six or seven hours to cross the border."
"But this problem also has its equivalent in the field of air transport."
"If, for example, you travel by car and cross the border between Germany and France, nobody asks you to identify yourself nor to say whether you are crossing the country."
"However, if you travel by plane, you have to ask permission to cross from one side to the other and sometimes it is even granted when you are already in a third country because you have already crossed in the meantime."
"Mr President, I wish to repeat my thanks and say that I hope that we will soon conclude the handling of this directive, which will allow the Committee for Standardisation to carry out its work correctly."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m."
"EC-Morocco fisheries agreement"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B5-0031/1999) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the EC-Morocco fisheries agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to express my regret, firstly at the fact that the Council cannot reply to this oral question which had originally been formulated by our Committee for both the Commission and the Council."
"For whatever reason the Council is not going to reply to this question."
"I am pleased, however, that this debate is taking place today instead of being, as is usually the case, one of the last items on the agenda of the last day of one of our Strasbourg part-sessions."
"I hope that these debates can take place during the sittings on the ""important days"" in Strasbourg, because fishing deserves it, and an agreement of the importance of the one we will discuss today, even more so."
"I would especially like to thank Mr Fischler for his punctual presence, and to thank him also for honouring the promise that he made to the Committee on Fisheries, in the hearing of 30 August, when he told us that he would give priority to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, which can be seen from the promptness with which he has drawn up a proposed mandate for negotiation."
"I wish therefore for this expression of thanks to be noted."
"We must also congratulate ourselves on the fact that the Council has approved, despite the storm clouds which had gathered, this proposed mandate."
"Therefore, we now have a mandate for negotiation of the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"If we add to this the fact that the two budgetary authorities - that is, the Council and Parliament - have declared themselves in favour of the political priority of funding this fisheries agreement, we will conclude, Mr Fischler, that ""all"" that is left is to negotiate and sign it."
"That is your challenge now, with no doubt whatsoever, but in this task you can count on the support of this Parliament and of course the help of the Committee on Fisheries which I preside over."
"I would like to inform you that on the 29th in our committee we will have a wide-ranging audience with the sector affected by this fisheries agreement with Morocco and the participation of the European Commission would also be desirable."
"I am sure it is not necessary, Mr Fischler, to emphasise once again the importance of this agreement with Morocco to certain Member States, such as Spain and Portugal, and to certain autonomous communities such as Galicia, Andalusia and the Canary Islands, all of which, as is well known, come within Objective 1, are very dependent on fishing and at the moment have no other fishing grounds for their fleets and have a business structure which does not allow certain types of cooperation."
"Commissioner, you will have the opportunity to observe what we are talking about on your next visit to Galicia, which we await with open arms."
"A significant amount of the supply of fish to the European market depends on this agreement, as do many direct jobs, as well as many more involved in the industry and services."
"The proposed resolutions presented speak for themselves and I need no more evidence."
"The recent seminar between Europe and Morocco which took place in our own Parliament highlighted the great interest, at the highest level, which Morocco has in Europe."
"""Cooperation"" has been the mostly commonly used word."
"Well, the cooperation which the European Union is asking of Morocco at the moment is in the specific field of fishing."
"In relation to fishing we have no choice but to understand each other and cooperate."
"It is not a matter of exchanging one thing for another: fruit for fish."
"It is a matter of cooperating in the area of fishing."
"It is a matter of reaching the best possible agreement in terms of fishing cooperation."
"When?"
"How?"
"Fortunately the European Union is an economic, financial and commercial power."
"Fortunately we have structural mechanisms which provide for the negotiation contingencies."
"And, at the moment, I call on the Finnish Presidency to go ahead in the next Council with the FIFG Regulations and on the Commission, Mr Fischler, to be flexible in this text so that it may come closer to the position of the European Parliament."
"It is urgent that we foresee these contingencies in our structural aid and also, in exceptional cases, both for shipowners and for fishermen."
"In this way, we should not be excessively hasty: our legislative and budgetary forecasts allow us to deal with a protracted negotiation."
"It is better to have a prolonged negotiation, resulting in a good agreement, than a bad one achieved quickly."
"What kind of agreement, Commissioner?"
"One which continues to allow the fishing activities of the different fleets which today fish in those waters."
"What kind of cooperation?"
"The widest possible, which must also include extractive cooperation, since if Europe is the principal market for the export of Moroccan fish, to subscribe to cooperation in terms of marketing and processing is not what is necessary, given that the market is controlled from the centres of consumption rather than from the centres of production."
"In any event, Mr Fischler, a genuine association policy should involve the opening up of that country to European investments, including in the field of extractive fishing. This will allow us to compete under equal conditions, putting Europeans and Moroccans on the same footing."
"Equality has to be both real and effective and therefore non-discriminatory with regard to measures for the conservation of resources."
"Let us make sure, Commissioner, that what happened with the agreement with Argentina never happens again."
"Effective measures concerning the monitoring and control of the issues agreed, equally applicable to both parties, will be necessary."
"Nobody has a greater interest than the European Union in protecting resources and fishing responsibly."
"Let us ensure that the other party guarantees that it will apply these measures in the reproduction areas of the various species, where European fleets do not fish, and in those areas where both parties fish, and that closed seasons and temporary fishing bans are also applied, without discrimination and with a mutual system of control."
"Commissioner, the European Parliament will support you politically and financially."
"That is why we have asked to be associated with this negotiation, which I hope will be approved in the coming tripartite meetings."
"Therefore, Mr Fischler, now - as we say in my country, on which you will no doubt become a great expert - good luck and al toro [take the bull by the horns]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Varela, as you know, on 15 October the Council finally accepted the mandate for the commencement of negotiations with the Kingdom of Morocco."
"For our part, all the arrangements to be able to start these negotiations had been made a long time ago."
"Thank you, Mr Varela, for the good luck you wished me in this matter."
"Since it is more to do with ships, perhaps it would be more appropriate, rather than wishing for me to take the bull by the horns, to take the helm, using the more nautical expression."
"The objective of these negotiations is to seek new forms of cooperation in the fisheries sector together, which are in harmony with the development of the Moroccan fisheries sector and with maintaining the catch capacity of the European fleet."
"As you also know, in spite of all the efforts undertaken on the part of the Commission, and in part by my predecessor, Morocco has still not wished to hold any exploratory meetings."
"Consequently, on the occasion of the meeting which you already mentioned, Mr Varela, on 21 October with Prime Minister Youssoufi, I offered to take up the negotiations in Morocco personally."
"In the meantime, the Moroccan authorities have approached us with regard to setting a definitive deadline."
"Since it has been mentioned, I would also like to point out that I have been invited to participate at the meeting of the Committee on Fisheries on 29 November. That is the date that was set."
"To be perfectly frank I envisage some problems there, as at that time I am also required to be in Seattle for the opening of the WTO Millennium Round."
"I would therefore ask you to understand that we shall either have to postpone this meeting or you will have to hold your Committee meeting without me."
"I absolutely agree with you that we must spare no effort in order to successfully sign this agreement."
"But we all know, too, that it is going to be tremendously difficult, and you mentioned the discussions on this matter with the Moroccans last week."
"I attended some of these talks myself, and I had to observe that up to now the Moroccans' attitude towards us has been anything but positive."
"I would also like to go into one other matter, and this concerns what should happen after November, after the agreement has expired, if the discontinuation of fishing activity is enforced."
"The Commission intends accordingly to apply the possible terms of Community law in favour of the crews and fishery firms affected."
"But the legal basis for applying these, especially after December, will be the new structural measures."
"It will therefore be important for an appropriate decision to be taken in Council in good time so that we have a legal basis for having available, at least, an instrument to be able to guarantee financial support to the fishing firms and fishermen affected in that event."
"Mr President, on the initiative of the Socialist Group and with the support of other groups, the Committee on Fisheries has formulated this oral question to the European Commission and the, once again, absent Council of Ministers, so that European citizens may learn of the current situation with regard to the contacts with the Moroccan authorities, with a view to the negotiation of a future fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco."
"You will be aware, Mr Fischler, that the current agreement will expire on 30 November and that the following day the activities of the Community fleet which is fishing in the waters covered by this agreement will come to a halt."
"That is to say, Mr Fischler, that on 1 December 7,000 European fishermen will lose their jobs, 477 Community ships will remain moored in our ports, 10,000 jobs in the preserving and processing industries will be under threat, as well as many thousands more, relating to marketing and dockyard activities, will also be at risk."
"And these are jobs, Commissioner - and I want to warn you of this - in coastal areas which are highly dependent on fishing, Objective 1 regions, where fishing is the principal activity."
"In Galicia, which is my region, extractive fishing plays a part in 45 of the 56 Galician economic activities."
"The Community fleet which fishes in this fishing ground, Commissioner, has been decreasing agreement after agreement in terms of the number of ships and fishermen."
"This does not surprise me, but we cannot imagine that the ships and men who have fished there for decades, and of course long before the Jamaica Convention, will disappear overnight."
"The aid to shipowners and fishermen which is going to result from the FIFG has already been mentioned."
"I would like to tell you, Commissioner, that, firstly, neither the fishermen nor the shipowners wish to be subsidised."
"They are hard-working sea-faring people, who just want to work in the job that they know and for which they take such risks."
"On the other hand, these subsidies are never going to make it to a certain proportion of the population affected by this stoppage: to Mrs Manuela, who owns a fishmongers, to Mr Antonio, who sells electrical goods, or to the traditional boat-builders who are carrying out their work in the Galician training workshop in Rianxo because there will be no boats to repair."
"And, furthermore, Commissioner, if these subsidies are paid with FIFG resources, which are scarce and which are aimed at the adaptation and renovation of fleets, there will be fewer resources for the objectives of this fishing fund."
"Four years ago this Parliament declared itself in favour of creating a line specifically to deal with halts of fleets, unforeseen crises and circumstances such as a delay in the renewal of agreements."
"After the expiry of the previous agreement, Commissioner, there was a halt which lasted seven months, to which we have to add the natural biological stoppages and other bans which were not so much biological as arbitrary, imposed by the Moroccan Administration on a European Commission which was not able to defend the interests of its people, which was illustrated by the numerous unjustified seizures including some which were outside the Moroccan exclusive economic zone."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what he plans to do with regard to preventing the re-occurrence of this situation because, until now, I have no idea what he intends."
"Neither do I know - since the Commissioner mentions it - what the Commissioner' s position is and how fishing will be defended at the Seattle Summit."
"I have seen how active you have been in the newspapers, Commissioner, in defence of agriculture, but I have heard nothing about fishing."
"I believe it would be useful if you were to establish a line of defence for European fishing."
"But the Council is also doing a dreadful job, especially in view of its incomprehensible inactivity with regard to providing the Commission with a mandate for negotiations with the Moroccan Government."
"And I believe that the Council' s delay can only be explained by the lack of pressure from the Government of the Member State which should be most interested in this Agreement."
"And further proof of this disinterest on the part of the Council is its absence today in this debate: disinterest in the fisheries agreement with Morocco and a lack of respect for this Parliament which represents all the citizens of Europe."
"The European Parliament, which will have to express its opinion on the future agreement by means of the assent procedure, must - I believe - be involved with the other institutions during the negotiations with the Moroccan government."
"There is no place here for a late and bad consultation, as is normally the case."
"And I would like to say to you, Commissioner, that I believe that the current agreement already has the characteristics of a second generation agreement and that, therefore, you must not insist on that position, which you have indicated, of saying that the negotiation is going to be very difficult."
"This agreement is not limited to mere financial compensation."
"There are already joint Euro-Moroccan enterprises and these will continue to exist, but this cannot be an exclusive model."
"Because we must not demand that shipowners get rid of their fishermen, with all their savoir faire, and we Socialists will not allow the continuation of certain companies to take place at the expense of their fishermen."
"The existing agreement and the one to come are a sign of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation and benefit both parties."
"Within the future agreement the Community must offer its technical services so that Morocco may also put its fishing fleet in order."
"Mr Fischler, with regard to fishing, you have not yet begun your work, or at least, you have scarcely started and started badly."
"You are still an unknown Commissioner, and I say ""started badly"" because of your unfortunate début of announcing the probable disbanding of the Directorate-General for Fisheries which, as you well know, caused a real storm in the sector."
"But I would like to tell you, Commissioner, that we are not going to take that into account."
"You were an acting Commissioner and I would like to borrow the metaphor of Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and tell you that you have a good bull, a miura, to fight; carry out good negotiations, bring them to a satisfactory conclusion, defend the interests of the European fishermen as the Moroccan Government will defend the interests of theirs."
"Mr President, first of all our group did not sign this resolution for a number of very important reasons."
"We find it very one-sided and a blatant demand for Morocco to give in to European demands regardless of what it wants."
"We Greens believe it is up to Morocco to decide how best to benefit from its resources in its own waters."
"One of the most deplorable aspects of this resolution is the failure to address the issue of the Western Sahara."
"Last night a representative of the Saharoui people spoke to the Greens."
"He told us of EU-flag vessels fishing off the coast of Western Sahara."
"The border of the Western Sahara is established at 27º 4' ."
"North of that is Morocco and south of that is the Western Sahara."
"We all know that the Saharoui people are supposed to vote in a referendum very soon on self-determination but of course many serious problems have been posed by the Moroccans."
"There is no EU country that has recognised Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara, but according to the Saharoui people, at the same time the EU pays EUR 500 million to Morocco."
"EU vessels fish hake and other species in waters off Morocco, and Morocco has no legal jurisdiction in these waters."
"Many people believe this constitutes illegal fishing."
"Some might even go as far as to call it piracy."
"These are very serious allegations and I should also point out that similar allegations have been made as regards Somalia."
"I would ask the Commission what assurances it can give that this is not happening."
"Current agreements with Morocco have provisions for an experimental satellite system."
"Can the Commission reassure us, through the results, that EU vessels are not engaging in illegal fishing."
"I should add that the representative stressed that they had no problem whatsoever with EU/Morocco agreements."
"Their concern was that it be ""legal"" , that is, restricted to Moroccan waters only."
"Our problems with the resolution are not just on this point - although it is a very serious issue."
"The Greens would like to stress first of all that we are not, as many people would have it, against fisheries agreements with third countries but we have very important conditions that we want attached to those agreements."
"We want them to be more equitable, less environmentally and socially damaging and consistent with other Community policies."
"There are specific criteria that we would like to follow."
"First of all with regard to all EU fisheries agreements, not just Moroccan agreements: they should follow the precautionary approach."
"Most people subscribe to this in theory but not in practice."
"Simply put, in the case of agreements there must be clear scientific proof that added fishing pressure from proposed EU activities will not compromise sustainability of fish stocks."
"If we cannot be sure that fish are available these particular species should not be put in the agreement."
"The second criteria is that the regional approach should be followed."
"All countries involved in fishing the relevant stocks, be they coastal states or distant water states, should be involved in assessments of stocks and negotiations over how much fishing is done and who has the right to do it."
"This approach is followed very successfully in the South Pacific on tuna and there is no reason whatsoever that it should not apply here."
"There is a consistent EU approach of negotiating with one state at a time."
"This is not acceptable."
"Control is also a very big problem in most of these agreements."
"The third countries simply do not have the resources to ensure that the vessels from the EU and other distant water fleets respect the rules."
"We know the problems that the Member States have in their own waters, so it must be very difficult indeed for these other countries to be able to tackle these problems."
"Satellite systems are a very small but positive step, but a lot more needs to be done."
"In 1997 the Council requested an in-depth analysis of the EU third country agreements."
"The summary report is now available."
"It was discussed on Tuesday at the Council meeting."
"We welcome this study very much and hope that the Council will now conduct a wide-ranging debate, both within the Council itself and with other sectors of society, about these EU fisheries agreements."
"Some of the conclusions of the report are questionable but at least it provides some hard information and figures on the agreements."
"This is something that was sorely needed and has been called for for a long time."
"Another point I want to make, as previous speakers have and, I suspect, most of the following speakers will, concerns the importance of this and other fisheries agreements to certain regions of the Community which are heavily dependent upon fishing."
"The Greens sympathise with their plight and trust that appropriate compensation will be made available for those fishery workers who are put out of work in the eventuality of a halt in fishing activities."
"But the current EU policy is doing them a disservice by continually holding out hopes that there are fish available for them somewhere."
"It is fanning false hopes."
"It is clear that there are limits to how much fish is available."
"For many years the FAO has been warning of the problems, yet we keep looking for fish somewhere else until there is nowhere else."
"If one looks at Community statistics on employment in the sector, it is clear that this is on the decline."
"Much of this is due to the continued industrialisation of the sector, developing even larger vessels which require fewer people."
"While this serves to make fishermen' s lives easier and safer, it does come with certain social costs in terms of employment."
"The aspect of employment in all sectors of the fishing industry needs to be reviewed."
"It is affected by many factors including structural policy which does not take employment into account in issues of vessel size."
"Finally, to come back again to the point of Morocco' s right to make its own decisions."
"On behalf of the Green Group, I went with the Committee on Fisheries last year to Morocco and the Moroccans were very clear: they did not want to sign the last agreement."
"They did so only under extreme pressure from the European Union including a letter from Jacques Santer pleading and begging with the Moroccans to agree this last time; this would be the last agreement; the EU needed time to find another solution."
"But nothing has been done to find other solutions and this has to be done."
"We cannot force our wishes on other countries."
"We must respect their rights."
"We must have equitable agreements with other countries."
"Mr President, just a few brief observations - as Mr Salvador Jové Peres will be speaking next on behalf of my group - to say that this is an issue that is becoming extremely important and extremely relevant today, both in terms of what it means for fishing stocks, and in terms of the number of jobs that it involves directly or indirectly. And also in terms of the unpleasant incidents that would ensue from a possible stoppage of the fleets working in Moroccan waters, with all the inherent tension and social costs."
"And as far as this is concerned, I cannot fail to highlight the mistake made four or five years ago by establishing a fisheries agreement outside the broader framework of the cooperation agreement established between the European Union and Morocco."
"At the time we drew attention to the dangers that would ensue, and now we have new and inevitable consequences, specifically the demands for more Moroccan fishermen on Community vessels, fishing licences restricted to new, joint ventures, the obligation to unload fish in Moroccan ports, more concessions in the agricultural area etc."
"Of course we are in favour of and want to reach a rapid and efficient negotiation with the Kingdom of Morocco, which will be to our mutual advantage. But we think that it is vital that the negotiations about to start, which may prove to be difficult and slow, are directed towards certain key areas at Community level."
"Next, we cannot make more concessions or give more compensation in the area of agriculture, and the current jobs in the fisheries industry must be guaranteed. And finally, but no less importantly, we must take every precaution and provide for appropriate compensation in case of a possible and undesirable stoppage of the Community fleet' s fishing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the fisheries agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco is by far the most important ever signed by the European Union by virtue of the number of Community vessels which it affects, the fishing opportunities which it opens up and the jobs which depend directly on it, more than 8,000 fishermen and 20, 000 workers."
"A number of regions within several European Union Member States are closely, if not totally, dependent on this fisheries agreement."
"Everyone here knows that if this agreement were not renewed, then the whole European Union fishing sector would suffer indirectly from the consequences."
"Effectively, the fishing vessels that could no longer fish in Moroccan waters would inevitably transfer their activities to other areas, thus risking causing dangerous chain reactions and imbalances harmful to everyone."
"It should have come as no surprise to the Commission to find that the Moroccans are tough negotiators. It should have come to this conclusion before."
"We already experienced considerable difficulties when negotiating the agreement currently in force."
"It is, furthermore, perfectly legitimate for Morocco to seek to manage its fishing resources to the best advantage of its long-term interests."
"It would be remiss of us to reproach them for this."
"But it must be possible to integrate this requirement properly, and respect it fully, within the framework of a new agreement."
"Yet, has the Commission made our Moroccan friends sufficiently aware of the formidable consequences that Member States of the Union would have to deal with as a result of the non-renewal of this fisheries agreement with them?"
"We have the impression that the Commission has not shown the necessary zeal in this matter."
"The fisheries agreement expires on 30 November."
"The Commission was very tardy in requesting its negotiating mandate."
"New negotiations have not been initiated, even though the deadline is only one month away."
"What mechanism is envisaged, Commissioner, if the situation becomes deadlocked, to prevent the vessels directly concerned, the fishing sector participants affected, the regions concerned and, most especially, Objective 1 and 2 areas which are dependent on fishing, as our joint resolutions specifies, bearing the brunt of the disastrous consequences in the event of non-renewal of the agreement?"
"Just now, Commissioner, you were rather vague on this essential point."
"There is no question that the Commission has demonstrated passivity, incompetence and laxity, even though this is an essential task entrusted to it under the terms of the Treaties."
"If the Commission does not now devote all the energy needed to preserve this fundamental pillar of the common fisheries policy which the fisheries agreements represent, then there will be great and justified pressure from those working in the fishing sector to demand that the common fisheries policy is challenged and a bilateral framework reintroduced enabling fisheries agreements to be signed directly between Member States and third countries, agreements which would better respect and defend the vital interests of our nations."
"This is to say, Commissioner, that the issues involved in the negotiations with Morocco are particularly important to the very future of the common fisheries policy."
"We therefore hope that in Brussels, Strasbourg or Seattle, you will give it all the priority attention which it demands."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the matter of renegotiating the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement which is due to expire on 30 November has been referred to us."
"This is one of the 29 fisheries agreements signed by the European Union with around fifteen countries of Africa and countries bordering the Indian Ocean."
"These negotiations are going to take place in a specific context, characterised by two new elements, firstly, the death of His Majesty Hassan II, the last giant figure in the history of the twentieth century, and, secondly, the principle of Turkey' s candidacy for accession, accepted a few days ago."
"When proposing to integrate a country which has nothing in common with Europe, it is hard to voice significant reservations with regard to Morocco which at least shares with Spain or France its language, history and economic relationships."
"Technically, Morocco wants comprehensive negotiations on fishing, the preservations of fish stocks, on local industry and even, more generally, on our agricultural dealings with Morocco."
"The position of our countries is essentially a budgetary position, with a cost of EUR 125 million per year."
"The main beneficiary is Spain which carries out 20% of its fishing production within the framework of the agreement with Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal."
"As for Portugal and France, they benefit to a lesser extent, and Italy too would like to derive advantage from it."
"Furthermore, Morocco wishes to preserve fishing resources within its economic area, and other countries, such as Great Britain, are announcing their concerns about the budget."
"It is true that the Community budget allocated to fisheries agreements is not inconsiderable: EUR 300 million, or 5% of the budget for European external policies."
"It is a not inconsiderable sum then, even if we lose nothing in the deal."
"If IFREMER is to be believed, then, for every euro invested, the turnover generated for Europe would be around three euros, and the added value would be 900 million."
"The Spanish are the main beneficiaries, with the Canaries where 91% of the fleet is dependent on this agreement, and with Andalusia where 75% of the fleet is involved, and there would be a cost to pay if there were to be no agreement."
"And indeed Morocco does not lose out either since almost a thousand jobs are affected by this agreement, for an annual added value of 36 million."
"But the Moroccans bring up, quite rightly, the risk of over-exploitation of fishing resources."
"Forty years ago, fishing catches worldwide were less than 20 million tonnes, today they are around 100 million tonnes, even if Europe is not responsible, as we are fishing less and less in the Mediterranean, where our share is no more than 40% of the catch."
"It is important, then, to monitor these fishing resources, which I know well, from the small ports of Oualidia or Media down to Mauritania by way of the Western Sahara, which I must remind Mrs McKenna is not independent, but has belonged to Morocco for centuries."
"How are we to find a compromise with the Moroccan Minister, El Khyari?"
"On the European side, we could make concessions on the development of the local Moroccan processing industry, on aid for scientific research and on landings in Moroccan ports."
"There are still two stumbling blocks: firstly, the matter of abandoning community preference in the field of agriculture, and we already know the problems affecting the sectors of tomatoes, early fruit and vegetables or horticulture, and secondly, another point, on which we cannot yield involves trading the Spanish fleet' s fishing rights for an increase in immigration in a Europe which already has 18 million unemployed."
"Mr Fischler, you reminded us that you will be in Seattle. The problem must therefore be considered at a much higher level."
"These are not negotiations regarding just fishing, but are far wider-ranging negotiations, Euro-Mediterranean talks, or even WTO talks."
"If, in Seattle, we are going to give in to the United States on the subject of compensation funding in agriculture, then it will be difficult to refuse Morocco similar concessions in the agricultural sector."
"Clearly, too, Morocco-Europe relations must be evaluated at the summit."
"We must take advantage of His Majesty Mohamed VI' s forthcoming visit to Parliament to undertake comprehensive renegotiations, and we must ensure that Morocco is not destabilised by the sort of foolish remarks made just now by Mrs McKenna regarding some putative Saharan sovereignty. We know full well what the consequences would be if Algeria had access to the Atlantic coastline."
"Europe needs Morocco and vice-versa."
"The agreement must therefore be sought with respect for our shared identities, for sovereignty and also for our separate identities, while acknowledging that history has made Morocco, if not a cultural exception, then at least a Mediterranean exception, for Europe in general and for France in particular."
"Mr President, the enormous pressure which the Council, this Parliament and the fishing industry had to put on the Commission has finally led to the achievement of a mandate for negotiation, hardly a month before the termination of the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"It is never late if the outcome is good."
"And at least we have a good mandate, above all in view of its ability to seek different forms of possible cooperation and even new legal formulas which may allow us to maintain satisfactory fishing relations for both parties."
"However, we should regret the delay, which has created public alarm and a nervous state within the fleet which could have been avoided, and the speculation and declarations which may do more harm than good to negotiations which, given the importance of the agreement, should be held in a discreet, calm and cordial environment."
"But also because, at this stage, a halt in fishing activities seems inevitable, which will necessitate, as happened at the time of the expiry of the previous agreement, a search for extraordinary Community funds to finance time when the fleet is forced to remain in port."
"I am not going to repeat the arguments which other Members have given and which illustrate the enormous importance of this agreement and its socio-economic repercussions."
"But I do want to insist that, for all these well-known reasons, the fleet is in suspense, and since it also has to pay for an ever increasing proportion of the fisheries agreements, it has stated that it is not prepared to not receive information regarding the progress of the negotiations."
"Natural discretion and reserve is one thing but secretiveness towards those who have everything to lose is another thing altogether."
"Unfortunately, Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries knows very well what it feels like to beg for information from here and there amongst the negotiators, even in these times of transparency and cooperation which we have just inaugurated."
"For this reason, like the industry itself, I believe that this time - and in this case I am particularly sorry that the Council is not here, because it is to them that I mainly address my comments - we must stand firm and show that, even though we have spent years asking and begging to be able to take part, as simple observers, in the negotiations of the fisheries agreements, this participation can no longer be postponed, Mr President."
"It is the case that, within the meagre budget which fishing represents in Community funding, the agreement with Morocco implies a relatively significant amount, so much so, Mr President, that it is the only agreement for which we are asked for our assent."
"We are therefore legally bound to the result of the negotiations and we have, therefore, the full right to first-hand information, without having to wait for the charity of representatives of the Council or the Commission who may come to inform us third-hand whenever they can or whenever it suits them."
"The citizens also demand information and we are the representatives of those citizens, elected by them and, for this simple reason, we have acquired the responsibility, in this case, to at least be informed of what is happening."
"Therefore, Mr President, I hope that the question of observers, which appears in at least one of the motions for resolution also signed by my group, is taken seriously for once."
"And to this end I ask, as other Members have done as well as the motion for a resolution, that this be, once and for all, a priority issue in the next tripartite meeting."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the situation is well known and the Commissioner has had the opportunity throughout this debate to obtain further details about the difficult situation in which we find ourselves, especially the fishing communities most affected by this problem."
"This is not only an economic problem. And if it were, that alone would have required the Commission to act more rapidly and to take the initiative in this matter."
"It is also the problem of the relationship between two countries in a part of the world that needs peace and tranquillity."
"And this is why this Agreement is of strategic importance, not only in relation to these fishing communities, but also in relation to the balance, to the peace that can only be achieved by means of various types of cooperation, this being a case in point."
"But now that we have reached this situation, we should work out why it is that we have done so. And the Commissioner is not new to the Commission; he is a Commissioner who has joined us from the previous Commission."
"He has joined us with exactly the same portfolio and the same dossier, and therefore, he has a very specific and genuine political responsibility which is his alone, not only to resolve this problem, but also to resolve all the problems that will remain until the agreement is renegotiated."
"I would like to tell you sincerely, Commissioner, that I was not very convinced by your speech a while ago."
"I sensed little enthusiasm, and it seemed to me that you have come here to give an administrative response to what is a worrying situation."
"This is a cause for concern not only to me, but certainly to my fellow Members in Parliament too."
"What fishermen need to know on this specific point is not that the Commission will be implementing initiatives and not that the Commission is prepared to help them."
"What the fisherman need to know, Commissioner, is what kind of initiatives are going to be implemented, and above all, what amount of Community subsidy is going to be provided to help these fishermen, and for how long the Commission is prepared to maintain it."
"Because, as Mr Miguélez said, what the fishermen need is not to be financed to remain inactive, but to be supported by the European Union so that they can carry out their professional duty, which means being able to work and thus contribute to the wealth of their country and to the wealth of the Community."
"Therefore, Commissioner, I am asking you for concrete responses."
"You know that you are already not very popular in Portugal because of the meat issue."
"We hope that your popularity does not continue to decline because of fish!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, within the global framework of relations between the European Union and Morocco, I would like to highlight, on the occasion of this oral question on the fisheries agreement which we are dealing with today, the regional dimension of that agreement."
"I refer to a Community region, European politically speaking but African geographically speaking, which is called the Canary Islands and is situated on the Atlantic flank opposite Morocco."
"In recent years, including Spain' s time as a democracy, we have experienced various situations where fishing has always been an unresolved issue between the parties because of the contentious issue of defining our territorial waters in relation to the neighbouring continent of Africa."
"Nevertheless, we have recently managed to take cooperative positions, by means of the Morocco-European Union agreements, despite having other unresolved matters, such as agriculture (tomatoes), the environment (nuclear energy policy) and the Saharan referendum, which affects us significantly from a global point of view."
"In fact, the Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries of the Spanish Senate has begun a visit to the Canary Islands in order to directly familiarise themselves with the problems facing the primary sector: agriculture and fishing."
"The President of the Government of the Canary Islands has also expressed his desire to visit Morocco in order to hold a dialogue and often a direct channel of communication with the Moroccan Government, along the lines of the good neighbourliness which should characterise the relations between two neighbouring and civilised peoples, since frequently the viscosity of reality - as Mr Obiols said so well the other day during the debate in Brussels in relation to the common destiny of Europe and Morocco - does not always permit the most appropriate type of action."
"We trust that peace and stability will reign in our Atlantic area and we have a good opportunity to use the fisheries agreement or other European instruments for transnational cooperation to achieve this."
"I hope that Morocco will fulfil its international obligations, as indicated in the talks held last week in Brussels by the Moroccan authorities."
"In any event, I hope that the diplomacy of the European Commission will adequately defend the general interests of the Community fishermen who are affected by this future fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco."
"Lastly, I would like to remind you of a Spanish saying - which I believe is relevant today - which says: ""he who wants to eat fish, Commissioner, must get his breeches wet"" ."
"For this reason there are many of us here, Mr Fischler, who want to convince you of the social and economic importance of renewing the European Union-Morocco fisheries agreement."
"Mr President, I am participating in this debate in order to demonstrate my position and also to demonstrate our desire to support any positions which will contribute, both in Parliament and in the European Commission, to the achievement of the new agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco."
"To this end, I support the resolution tabled by the European Popular Party, the European Socialist Party and the UEN Group, and I belong to the group of ten MEPs from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance who have expressly supported it."
"Logically, our position is a consequence of our conception of the relationships of the European Union and also the specific interests of the countries which we represent."
"I wish to express our support for the signing of the agreement for two fundamental reasons."
"Firstly, because we consider that the policy of reaching agreements with non-EU countries is a correct policy on the part of the European Union."
"In this case it is a policy which affects an essential industry, which affects a significant section of our society as well as employment in certain countries."
"It affects the way of life of our coastal populations, in the same way that agriculture affects the populations of our inland regions and - why not say it - it affects a fundamental part of the food requirements of the entire European Union."
"We clearly want these agreements to respect the conservation of resources."
"We clearly want them to defend and respect the interests of non-EU countries."
"But I would like to say that the agreements should not only refer to poor non-EU countries, that is, Morocco, Angola and other countries, but that they should also refer, and this is also a European Union Policy, to agreements with Canada, the United States, Australia and Argentina, countries with which my country - specifically Galicia - has a direct relationship."
"I would like to say that at last, agreeing with these arguments, the Spanish Economic and Social Council has said that European Union agreements with non-EU countries lead to seven times the benefit than the cost of producing them."
"I said that this particularly affects the territories of the Spanish and Portuguese States: the Canary Islands, Andalusia and Galicia, in Spain."
"In Galicia, specifically, you know that 120,000 jobs rely directly or indirectly on fishing and that the agreement with Morocco especially affects three very significant areas: Ribeira, O Morrazo and A Guarda, where there are approximately 150 ships and 1,500 sailors who depend on the signing of the agreement with Morocco."
"I would like to remind you here that on 15 November 1995 the economic and social cooperation agreement with Morocco was only signed after Morocco had agreed that a fisheries agreement had to be signed."
"I say this because these two agreements, which were considered essential if the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona was to take place, shows that in our fisheries agreement, as we and Morocco want, all relations, political, economic and social, with the neighbouring Mediterranean kingdom should be taken into account."
"I also want to say that no agreement will be valid unless it conforms to the fishing industry as it actually exists."
"The fishing industry in the Kingdom of Morocco is made up of small businesses owned by shipowners for whom it is absolutely impossible to create joint enterprises which are largely Moroccan. Therefore, the new agreement must be an agreement which extends, while amending the necessary clauses, the current agreement, bearing in mind, of course, that we respect the fact that this agreement must benefit the economic and social development of Morocco."
"On the other hand, we want a quick negotiation and in any event we want significant and sufficient economic support for the sector affected - shipowners and workers - to cover any transitional period during which there is no right to fish in those waters."
"Mr President, my political group has tabled its own resolution and amendments to the resolution of the other political groups."
"I am not going to insist on the different aspects of the resolution, which you already know, I am simply going to refer to certain specific points which - I am afraid - may be important in our future debates."
"First point: joint enterprises."
"It appears that Morocco would be prepared to sign an agreement in which joint enterprises were the principal element."
"What does this mean?"
"Simply that it would be an agreement which would only benefit certain shipowners."
"The small-scale and inshore fleet would be of no interest to Morocco in terms of establishing joint enterprises; this would mean, in areas such as ours where employment problems are very serious, the scrapping of small vessels and a reduction in employment."
"On the other hand, joint enterprises would mean fewer Community crews and the demand by Morocco for more landings in Moroccan ports."
"This would mean cutting jobs."
"If this were the principal element of the agreement, it would benefit the type of fleet which is multi-purpose and larger-sized which, in any event, is already looking for other fishing grounds."
"Second point: on the 26th, Commissioner Fischler - according to items in various parts of the media in my country - appears to have expressed his approval of considering additional concessions in the importation of fruit and vegetables originating from Morocco in the negotiation of the fisheries agreement."
"In this regard, we should take into account three factors: firstly, fruit and vegetable are grown in the European Union in areas where there is also an urgent need for employment; secondly, fruit and vegetable are frequently used as an exchange currency in commercial agreements with non-EU countries and thirdly, in the last reform of this sector, important public instruments for market management were dismantled."
"Therefore, it is not admissible for fruit and vegetables to pay the price for a large part of the European Union' s external policy."
"I would like to remind you that, during the negotiation of the fisheries agreement which is about to expire, the Group of the European United Left opposed the signing of a fisheries agreement through the concession of additional quotas for the importation of fruit and vegetables within the framework of the parallel negotiation of the Association Agreement."
"Initially it was a question of balance: while the fisheries agreement was in force temporarily, the conditions for fruit and vegetables were of a permanent nature."
"Frequently, these concessions are granted as a contribution to the development of non-EU countries."
"Nevertheless, the reality is much more complex."
"And in the case of Morocco, 85% of tomato production and exportation is carried out by five companies; the largest of them is Domain Royal, which belongs to the royal family, and the other four belong to the Moroccan aristocracy."
"The cuts to the fisheries agreement to favour the Moroccan fishing industry only benefited the main owner of the cephalopod-fishing fleet, a family relation of the former Minister for External Affairs."
"This does not exactly favour a just and egalitarian development, but rather benefits certain interests."
"And lastly, I would like to refer to the way that negotiations are carried out."
"Traditionally, Morocco does not negotiate until the previous agreement has run out and the fleet is halted, with the social tension which that causes."
"This time the same thing will happen."
"This attitude cannot be permitted from a supposed partner."
"My group wishes for a just and balanced agreement with the Kingdom of Morocco on the part of the European Union, but we also think that, in order to prevent this periodic bartering which causes our fishermen enormous anguish and places them in a difficult situation, the future agreement should be established within the framework of the Association Agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly let us address the situation in hand."
"On 30 November, Portuguese boats that currently fish in Morocco will stop doing so."
"As a result, many boat owners will obviously ask for vessels to be decommissioned, thereby adding even further to the graveyard for boats that the common fisheries policy has become."
"And many fishermen will fall straight into unemployment, thereby adding even further to the poverty trap that the common fisheries policy has become."
"Another two Portuguese ports will be badly affected if this agreement is not renewed: we cannot fish nor can we work, which is a denial of basic human rights and of citizenship."
"Let us now address the situation from the political angle."
"This situation reflects the incompetence of the Commission and of the Council."
"The agreement expires on 30 November and the mandate for negotiation does not extend beyond October this year."
"I have never seen such negligence, such delays, such inertia and such total lack of consideration for fishing countries and for the fishermen of Southern countries."
"Do not deny it, Commissioner, because it is true."
"Secondly, this is a case of negligence on the part of the European Union."
"We have known of Morocco' s intention not to renew the agreement since the day the last agreement was signed."
"Years have passed and neither Commissioner Bonino, nor Commissioner Fischler, nor the respective ministers have had the necessary diligence or agility to avoid the need to debate now, a month before a very damaging event takes place, what we can do about it."
"On the other hand, the situation shows the foolishness of a certain vision of the European Union' s Economic Policy."
"We gave Morocco a trade agreement with no time limit."
"We obtained a fisheries agreement with a time limit. This means that Morocco can place its products in European Union territory at will, but we can only fish in Moroccan water until 30 November 1999."
"We are conceding much more than we are getting in return, and this is what you get for choosing an unchecked and unfettered globalisation in which you systematically prefer uncontrolled liberalism on a global scale, to the defence of national interests."
"Finally, this case shows how mistaken it is to allow federalism into common policies. Morocco' s problem is essentially with Spain."
"As everyone knows, the Spanish fleet is much bigger, the Spanish fish in competition with the Moroccans; the Portuguese fleet is smaller which means that our fishing does not compete with that of the Moroccans."
"What is Portugal's situation at the moment?"
"Europe is not able to negotiate with Morocco because Morocco does not want to, and Portugal cannot negotiate with Morocco because Europe will not allow it to!"
"We cannot even guarantee our right to fish, we, who are a maritime nation, nor can we guarantee our right to handle our own affairs, we who are a neighbouring country of Morocco."
"We entered Europe in order to be part of a solution."
"In terms of fishing as well as agriculture, this Europe is isolating us as if we were part of the problem!"
"The only solution is to allow, within the framework of the common fisheries policy, each country to reach bilateral agreements with third countries which do not have agreements with the European Union."
"And this is what I am asking for in the name of the principle of subsidiarity, with a view to a revision of the common fisheries policy: a member country of the common fisheries policy must be able to make bilateral agreements with third countries as long as an agreement is not already in place between the European Union and those third countries."
"Commissioner Fischler, I have been here for three months and I have already seen you harm Portugal' s interests three times: over mad cows where your decision defies belief, over pig-breeding, where your desire to persecute us is unacceptable, and now over fishing where your Commission' s inaction is also unforgivable."
"I would just like to say one thing to you: I am beginning to be convinced that you think that Portugal is just a beach."
"If you have the misfortune to go to that beach one day, you will see that the Portuguese fishermen will tell you politely that you are a persona non grata in my country."
"Mr President, I will speak this afternoon along the same lines as most of the MEPs who have spoken. I will not have much to add."
"Firstly, I would like to congratulate Mr Fischler on his taking up of this fishing portfolio at a very bad time."
"We have worked with him for the last five years, and I have confidence that he will move these issues forward."
"I am not in favour of nationalist speeches."
"We should not use this debate to look after our own national political interests."
"It is a Community debate."
"Fishing policy is a Community policy."
"The Commission, the Council and the different institutions are obliged to defend this common fishing policy, which of course includes agreements with non-EU countries."
"I come from one of the three Spanish regions which are most directly affected by the fisheries agreement."
"I am referring to the Canary Islands. And I can tell you that we have always fished in these waters- my great-grandfathers fished in these waters - and it seems incredible to the population of these regions that this agreement could disappear."
"But I believe that it would be a mistake at the moment for us to tell the Commission what the conditions for the negotiations should be."
"Parliament, this very morning, fulfilled its obligation to include in the 2000 budget an item of EUR 125 million, which had not been envisaged in the Financial Perspective negotiated in Berlin, in accordance with the interinstitutional agreement between the Council and Parliament, but which is fundamental to the starting of the negotiations."
"I believe that Parliament has fulfilled its duty and has offered the Commission the means to carry out the negotiations, and we hope that the Commission will carry this task forward."
"But I also believe it would be a mistake, as some have done here, to impose any kind of conditions on the negotiations."
"I do not believe that we should tell the Commission what it should or should not do."
"I believe that, finally, this agreement is important and that must be concluded."
"There is another important dimension: Morocco is a nearby country."
"This European Community was not built to attack anybody nor to threaten anybody."
"This European Community has to be concerned not only for its own future but also for the future of the neighbouring countries."
"At the moment, we are dealing with the future of the neighbouring countries of Central and Eastern Europe by means of incorporating them into the European Union, but we also have to concern ourselves with the future of the neighbouring countries on the southern side of the Mediterranean."
"It is not a matter of trading one thing for another."
"I do not believe that the solution to the Moroccan problem consists of admitting Moroccan immigrants, but the reality is that every week twenty or thirty Moroccans arrive on my island in small boats - the so-called pateras - at great risk, and many of them drown."
"We have a critical situation within a few minutes of our own shores, within an extremely short distance."
"I believe that in the negotiation, the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, which is rich, is probably able to offer sufficient compensation to Morocco so that the fisheries agreement may become a reality."
"It would be tragic if there was a re-occurrence of what happened last time, when there was a delay of seven months."
"I hope that as a result of the ability of the Commissioner and the attitudes of the Commission, the Council and our Governments, a favourable agreement can be reached which will allow us to continue fishing, on the one hand, and, on the other, allow Morocco and the Moroccan people to profit from the privilege of administering waters which contain such an abundance of fish."
"Mr President, today' s sitting has been dominated by talks about the Budget 2000."
"The fisheries agreement with Morocco has also been on the agenda this morning in this context, when we talked about external action expenditure."
"The majority of this Parliament was then of the opinion that this agreement would feature as one of its new priorities and that it belonged on the list comprising the reconstruction of Kosovo, East Timor and Turkey."
"Whatever the opinion may be concerning the fisheries agreement with regard to the impact on the local population or the European fishing fleet, there will be very few people who will be prepared to put the humanitarian disasters of Kosovo, East Timor and the earthquake in Turkey on a par with this fishing deal."
"Also, from a budgetary point of view, I find it completely irresponsible to agree on an amount whilst negotiations have not even reached the halfway stage."
"In fact, we do not know if an agreement will be reached."
"We do not know what the situation will be like then and we cannot gauge the financial implications."
"But the funds are already available."
"I would have thought it was acceptable to place an amount in reserve."
"Then, at least Parliament would be able to vote again on the allocation of these funds after having read the content of this agreement more carefully."
"Because how will this pan out?"
"Is the integrity of Parliament' s decision not seriously prejudiced if we have the funds available at this stage?"
"What happens now if you do not like the agreement?"
"Or would any agreement be acceptable a priori?"
"You will get another chance during the second reading of the budget in December."
"It is therefore important that you grant more importance to the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries and not to consider it as a little added extra to a fait accompli."
"What input will Parliament have?"
"There is no guarantee whatsoever that the agreement will be submitted to the European Parliament for approval."
"The agreement with Mauritius was subject to a simple, consultative procedure."
"Parliament objected to this and took the matter to the Court."
"The Court ruled that it was unnecessary for Parliament to approve agreements."
"As a result, we now have a situation where it is completely unclear what agreements have to be submitted to Parliament for approval and what agreements only require comments."
"In this light, the agreement with Morocco might well bypass the European Parliament in terms of content on account of the consultative procedure and in financial terms on account of the blank cheque we provided this morning."
"Parliament' s power should not only be fought for by government leaders at intergovernmental conferences but must also be asserted by ourselves in our daily work."
"Mr President, the question of renewal of the fisheries agreement between Morocco and the European Union perfectly illustrates the general policy of Europe enshrined in the budget which we discussed this morning and whose rationale we denounced."
"We are opposed to the reduction of appropriations for aid to developing countries."
"Europe is directly affected by the desperate situation in Africa."
"Firstly, as a former colonial power, but also for having continued to plunder the wealth of these countries even after they became independent."
"The very nature of this aid must be completely reviewed since, until now, it has served only to maintain neo-colonial relationships favourable to the establishment and the multinationals. Elf provides a particularly striking example of one of these."
"As for the population, they remain entrenched in endless poverty."
"Instead of setting the interests of workers in the fishing industry, the interests of European countries and those of African countries against each other, a way must be found to unite their demands and their campaign against powerful capitalist interests."
"In the case of Morocco and this particular fisheries agreement, it is no longer possible to once again ignore the rights of the Western Saharan people, starting with their right to self-determination, their right to establish an independent state, if they so wish, and to protect the natural wealth of their territory, whether it be phosphate deposits or the specific resources of its shoreline which are threatened by this agreement."
"I would, finally, like to draw your attention to the particularly tense social situation in the Moroccan fisheries sector."
"A strike movement has been affecting most of the ports in the country for several weeks and is being violently repressed by the forces of law and order."
"Once again, as in September 1998, it is a campaign to gain the freedom to exercise elementary social rights, paid leave, social security, retirement at 55 and a guaranteed minimum income."
"But the fishermen of Morocco are also demanding justice following the murder of the founder of their union, Mr Mounacir, by the henchmen of Basri, and I would like to express our solidarity with them."
"Mr President, at this point in the debate, I believe that nothing new nor original can be added but, as a member of the Committee on Fisheries and representative of the citizens and interests of Spain and Andalusia, I would like to make two brief points."
"The first is that thousands of Andalusian and Spanish families are looking to us."
"They hope to see evidence that, for the European Commission and especially the Council, the priority and the most urgent matter at the moment is to come to a sound agreement with Morocco."
"It is difficult, Commissioner, as you have just said, but it is not impossible."
"Employment is a priority objective of the European Union and it is not enough just to create it. We also have to prevent its destruction."
"Andalusia, my region, has the highest rate of unemployment in the Union and almost 50% of the boats which fish in Moroccan waters are Andalusian."
"The second is that Morocco is a priority country within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean relations."
"Morocco and the European Union have a mutual interest and need, and intransigent positions and insults are the enemies of cooperation and understanding."
"Parliament can and must help with this understanding insofar as we are the legitimate representatives of the citizens of Europe, who at the moment are naturally expectant and concerned with regard to the results of the future negotiations."
"Neither is it good for the negotiation climate that, through an absurd desire for the limelight, spectacles should be made such as the one this morning with the resolution which various political groups have presented."
"It does no favours for the workers in the fishing industry and their families if certain politicians are after a photo and a headline in a newspaper or, as they say in my region, want to confuse wheat with chaff."
"I believe that there is no place in this debate for the Sahara question."
"The Commission, the Council and Parliament must act together, in a coordinated and transparent fashion."
"Nothing would offer as much advantage to the other side as a lack of unity amongst ourselves and contradictory debates on a matter which is so vital to our interests and also for Morocco itself."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as has already been said here, it would be hard to say that the end of this agreement comes as a surprise, given that this scenario has been foreseen since December 1995."
"This is why we are somewhat perplexed that the Commission has still not explained its plan to us for dealing with this situation."
"By making the substantive part of the FIFG regulation an implementing regulation, the Commission will cause fisheries to be the only area in the agricultural and structural domain not to be decided on in the first six months of this year."
"It is also worth pointing out that even if the Commission' s proposal for an implementing regulation had been adopted, it would not have helped us in the slightest."
"In article 17(3), concerning financial compensation in case of a temporary stoppage in activity, it excludes fishermen from any compensation and imposes ridiculous limits on boat-owners."
"I do not know if you have noticed, Commissioner, that one of the annual financial ceilings that you are proposing in order to deal with situations of this kind in Member States is lower than your own salary as a European Commissioner."
"We know that when you assumed your new responsibilities for fisheries, you made a show of highlighting your distance from the sea."
"Nevertheless, you should not forget that you are a Commissioner for Europe and that here, both on the coast of continental Europe and on archipelagos such as the Azores and Madeira, there are many people who make their living from the sea, and as a matter of fact, these people tend to be some of the most deprived and the least supported."
"To conclude, I would like to say that I agree wholeheartedly with two things said here by my friend and colleague Manuel Medina Ortega."
"We, the Portuguese Socialists, are radically opposed to any kind of nationalistic rhetoric or rhetoric about re-nationalisation."
"More than this, we are also extremely concerned, as my friend António José Seguro has also said here, about the support to Morocco, and not merely in terms of its commercial aspects, as has been suggested by certain speakers."
"But for this, Commissioner, you will need a radically different attitude to the one you have had in the past, particularly towards my country."
"Mr President, Shakespeare wrote that Bohemia was located on the seacoast."
"Bavaria lies in the neighbourhood of Bohemia, so perhaps Bavaria has a coastline too, and I may say that this has become true in the present-day EU, since today in the EU Morocco is in the neighbourhood of Bavaria and Spain shares a border with Poland."
"All European problems are the problems of all EU states, and I therefore wish to say that this fisheries agreement is a problem for Europe as a whole."
"It concerns the European Union as a whole."
"It is not a local phenomenon."
"Of course we must safeguard the interests of the fishermen concerned, but we must recognise that there are general ecological problems in connection with this fisheries agreement and general problems relating to both foreign and security policy, affecting the whole of the EU."
"It is our task to support stability in Morocco, and I am therefore dismayed at the notes which Mr Jové Peres has introduced into this debate, in both his proposed amendments and his contribution today."
"We must be glad that the remarks appropriate to the class struggle which he has expressed today have not previously led to the establishment of a socialist system in Morocco, like the ones in Libya and Algeria, with whose consequences we are having to fight a running battle today."
"Instead, democracy is slowly maturing there under the new King, and we must try to support this tender shoot of democracy."
"Spain has just achieved something exemplary for Europe, thanks to its intelligent policy of compensation for Morocco, in which Mr Medina Ortega, for example, also had a part."
"I found his speech to be a very fine one and very important, and I would like to say quite clearly that it must be in our interests to safeguard the fishing interests of the Spanish and the other European fishermen affected, but to ensure that a sensible agreement is obtained in the near future, which includes the interests of ecological, foreign and security policies and which does not make the mistake of working with a demagogy which destabilises our neighbourhood, so that we do not wake up until it is too late, as in the Balkans or in the Caucasus today."
"Mr President, thank you for your various efforts to track me down, and for the opportunity to be able to speak now!"
"Commissioner, because of the development of international maritime law in the 1970s, traditional fishing grounds were lost to European fleets."
"Approximately 35% of world seas and 90% of fishing stocks are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of coastal states."
"The European Community was therefore forced to conclude international agreements in order to retain access to fishing grounds and thus ensure the livelihood of the Community' s fishermen."
"More than two dozen fisheries agreements with third countries are currently in force, ranging from a straight exchange of fishing rights to agreements for access to stocks in return for financial compensation payments."
"I would like at this point to stress the vital significance of the fisheries agreements for the EU."
"They finally constitute and facilitate a guarantee of job security in the EU."
"Approximately 40,000 workers are employed in this sector, and thus the existence of an international agreement, such as the agreement with Morocco, also plays an essential role with regard to the supplying of consumers and the fish processing industries, and thus to sustainable prices."
"We can see what a fundamental matter of concern the fisheries agreements represent for the EU."
"The negotiations must therefore be driven forward until further agreements or renewed agreements are signed."
"Today we are discussing the renewal of the agreement with Morocco."
"This agreement - I still clearly remember the long drawn-out negotiations four years ago, which were the subject of many parliamentary resolutions - has exceptionally important social and economic consequences, especially, of course, as we have just heard, for the less favoured regions of Spain and Portugal."
"Around 8,000 fishermen and 20,000 jobs in the processing industry are directly affected by this agreement."
"The previously applicable compensation payments of over EUR 400 million to Morocco over the course of four years make the agreement the most significant fisheries agreement in the Community Budget."
"Due to these considerable financial repercussions on the EU-budget, as we have just heard, the assent procedure comes into play."
"This is a challenge to Parliament."
"The effects of non-renewal would be catastrophic."
"There would then be the threat that thousands of jobs would be lost, with widespread effects not only on the entire Iberian Peninsula but also on the status of Europe in this important sector of industry."
"Unfortunately matters are not so simple."
"Morocco is reluctant to start negotiations or to come to terms too quickly."
"It is playing for time."
"Nonetheless, the Community should not have the objective of striving to come to an agreement on any terms due to pressure of time."
"On several occasions in the past, Morocco has unilaterally presented obstacles which were not covered by the agreement."
"The situation where the costs of the agreement are continually increased while the fishing areas and seasons are continually reduced is unacceptable."
"The European Parliament, and the Committee on Fisheries in particular, are generally very concerned about the renewal of this particular agreement."
"Why did the Council take so long to give the Commission its mandate for negotiation?"
"Where, Mr Fischler, are the Commission' s long-announced cost-benefit analyses?"
"The economic and social consequences in the event of expiry of the agreement for Community fishermen are sufficiently known."
"Why then this hesitation, which in the end is playing into Morocco' s hands, cutting the ground out from under the feet of EU fishermen?"
"Clarification is essential here, and in short order."
"In the interests of EU fishermen, Parliament must make a clear statement (and that is what it is indeed doing, as we are just learning now) to put an end to this intolerable situation as quickly as possible."
"If not, I fear a negative effect on international agreements per se."
"This means, as Mr Posselt said, ultimately a negative effect on Europe' s foreign policy too."
"I therefore consider it necessary as a matter of urgency, today and tomorrow, to give a signal and invite the Commission to actually initiate measures up now for the financial aid of those affected."
"Moreover, I expressly ask that Parliament, represented by us, the Members of this House, should now actually participate directly in the negotiations on the agreement."
"There can be no further doubt about our involvement."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, many thanks for your contributions."
"I believe this really is the way to make constructive progress in this certainly very difficult situation we find ourselves in with reference to the future agreement with Morocco."
"Unfortunately Mr Portas is no longer here, as he expressed a rather different opinion."
"Apparently there are always people who think that discussion and debate involve insulting the Commissioner and then disappearing!"
"You can be certain of one thing: even though I did not in opening mention all the elements relating to the significance of this agreement, particularly for the Spanish and also the Portuguese fisheries industry, I am nonetheless perfectly aware of its significance."
"But I think we all know how important this matter is, and you can also be sure that I shall be lending my wholehearted support towards arriving at a solution to this matter."
"I am even willing, Mr Nogueira, to wade in myself, if necessary."
"This is not the essence of the problem."
"I would like to stress, in particular, that it is essential to look upon 15 October and the formulation of the mandate for negotiation in the right light."
"This is undoubtedly not a case of delay."
"We started to approach the Moroccan authorities as early as February with direct contacts, a great number of letters, and a great many visits."
"As early as February, we initiated preparatory talks in order to ascertain what exactly Moroccan future interests would entail."
"For this would have considerably facilitated the task of drawing up a customised mandate in order to be able to have very precisely orientated negotiations."
"You all know that these efforts were to no avail because, quite simply, our Moroccan counterparts were not yet ready to exchange even a word with us or even meet us to discuss the matter."
"Our prime concern at the moment, therefore, is how to manage to start meaningful negotiations."
"Our positions in the debate have become very clear."
"When I am told that we must make no concessions, then you have to consider what our respective starting positions are."
"As far as our starting points are concerned, ours is, as virtually everyone here emphasised, that this agreement is of exceptional importance."
"Morocco' s current starting position is that they do not want this type of agreement any more!"
"At any rate, emphasising that we will not tolerate any concessions in the negotiations will not, I believe, succeed in making the Moroccan side more open towards us, as it were, and more prepared to come to an agreement with us."
"So now, as has been said, it is really important to get things underway."
"There is another thing you can be quite sure of. It is also very important to me that these negotiations are handled in the most transparent way possible, and, obviously, I am willing to report back to Parliament at every stage on the further progress of negotiations."
"It has been stressed how dangerous it would be if this agreement which is, incidentally, not part of the Association Agreement, as many people thought, were to be extended to include associations relating to agricultural goods."
"We should be very, very cautious here, and we should try as far as possible to reach an agreement purely concerned with fisheries."
"When, at some stage in the future, we know precisely what the Moroccan demands are, we can certainly come back again to a further debate on the matter."
"I have also been asked whether there is any guarantee that the use of this agreement will guarantee sustainability for the future, and to what extent the satellite monitoring system actually serves to monitor fishing activities."
"Well, again, to be frank, all the prerequisites have been met on our side."
"All European vessels operating in this area can be monitored by satellite."
"There is though still a problem on the Moroccan side."
"We have proposed to the Moroccans that we are willing, within the framework of the MEDA Programme, to contribute towards resolving these problems on the Moroccan side, but, as has been said, definitive implementation on the Moroccan side is still outstanding."
"On the matter of aid following 30 November: I have already pointed out, too, that we wish to proceed on the basis of potential support in principle, as we already did last time."
"Therefore, fishermen can count on our providing aid."
"But we must also obtain the necessary administrative prerequisites in good time."
"Here too, no time is to be lost."
"Here too, there is some urgency, I believe, and I would like to ask for the support of Parliament in this matter."
"The last question, why at this stage have we applied for EUR 125 million in the Budget?"
"I am very grateful to see that this was accepted this morning."
"It is a matter which I think can be seen from two points of view."
"I do not think that anyone could realistically expect any future agreement to be obtained substantially more cheaply, or at a substantially lower price, than the previous agreement."
"Therefore if we envisage an amount in the budget which is exactly equal to the previous annual amount we were prepared to allocate, then that is a clear sign that we are not going to let ourselves be persuaded to part with increasingly high amounts, but that we are setting a limit at this point for the amount of money we are prepared to assign to this agreement."
"I believe this is a good sign to send to Morocco, one which will certainly be of support to us in negotiating."
"A final point, something which certainly does not help us progress in this difficult matter is our tendency to continually pass the buck to one another, from Parliament to the Council, or Council to the Commission, or vice versa."
"We can only be successful in this matter if all three institutions work together."
"This is what I would request, and I find it a pity that the Council is not represented here today to be able to give this guarantee."
"Mr President, it has just come to our attention that the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament has decided by a large majority to award the Sakharov Prize to Xanana Gusmão."
"For this reason, personally, and on behalf of the European Socialist Party..."
"I would like to say how pleased we are with this action which pays tribute to Xanana Gusmão as a citizen, but above all, to the resistance, the tenacity, the courage and the determination of the people of East Timor."
"In our opinion, this award is a good incentive for all the men and women who, in other regions throughout the world, are fighting for the establishment of peace, and in the defence of human rights, liberty and democracy."
"We Socialists think that awarding this prize to Xanana Gusmão honours the spirit of the creation of the Sakharov Prize and also honours the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, very briefly and in support of Mr Seguro, I would like to say that the awarding of the Sakharov Prize by this Parliament to Mr Xanana Gusmão does honour to this Parliament."
"I believe that we must be proud that people such as Xanana Gusmão exist."
"He is a man who has suffered, and has done so responsibly, and who we hope in the coming months and years will be able to lead his country along the road to peace and democracy."
"And I hope that the European institutions will cooperate with a new free population of East Timor with regard to its economic and social development within a framework of democracy."
"Mr President, agreeing with the words of the previous speakers, I would like to say, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group that it gives me enormous joy that in a world which is often driven by a hierarchy of interests and not by a hierarchy of principles, Parliament is recognising a man of great principle who fought for a principle, that of his people' s freedom, and is awarding him the Sakharov Prize."
"This is a particular source of pride as this Prize bears the name of a scientist, Andrei Sakharov who, suffering all kinds of hardship, lent his prestige to the fight for the freedom of the people of Eastern European countries against one of the most horrendous forms of totalitarianism seen this century."
"This is a source of pride for all of us and we Portuguese Christian Democrats are extremely happy."
"Mr President, I should just like to endorse what other people have said about giving the Sakharov Prize to Mr Gusmão."
"I should also like to remind Members of this House that what has happened in East Timor after the referendum is something we should look at."
"We have just discussed Morocco, and the Western Sahara was mentioned."
"A referendum will be taking place there."
"The European Union needs to be extremely diligent to ensure the same fate does not befall the people who go out and vote."
"We need to see that a fair and democratic procedure takes place in Western Sahara, that people have the right to vote freely."
"We hope that what happened in East Timor, after the UN persuaded the people to go out and exercise their right to vote and they were subsequently persecuted and murdered by the Indonesians, will not happen when the people in Western Sahara vote."
"The European Union needs to address this issue."
"We are delighted that Mr Gusmão has received this award."
"He deserves it and the people of East Timor deserve it."
"They deserve their independence, their freedom and the right to live in peace."
"I have received three motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure.1 2"
"The sitting is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 5.45 p.m.)"
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, there was a great deal of confusion and uncertainty yesterday surrounding the voting on amendment 11 to the Virrankoski report."
"The aim of the PPE' s amendment was to delete the second part of the text of the report, with the first part remaining intact."
"The purpose of this amendment was clear, but the way in which the voting was to take place was not. This was due to the fact that those who submitted the amendment also applied for there to be split voting with regard to the original text."
"This was also requested by the socialists and the Greens/ ALE group."
"The EDD requested voting by roll call."
"The request of the latter was granted, the others were not."
"As such, the amended text has been brought to vote in a way unlike that which many Members could reasonably have expected."
"As a result, thirteen people in my group voted against their convictions."
"The difference was 16 votes and I am quite sure that there are at least three others who voted in error."
"I find it striking that an issue which is so close to many MEPs' hearts, namely absurdly high travel expenses, should be the cause of so much confusion."
"I hope that the way in which the voting took place will be good enough reason to allow a repeat vote during the second reading in December on what was voted on in the original text."
"I shall give you an answer."
"Your remarks will, of course, be recorded in the Minutes of today' s sitting."
"There is a golden rule in Parliament."
"We never go back on a vote."
"I am sure that you understand that to hold a vote that has already been held would set a dangerous precedent."
"However what you have said will be recorded in the Minutes of today' s sitting."
"Madam President, the Minutes contain the sentence: ""Since different Members have asked to change their voting behaviour with regard to this last vote, the Members Mr Van Hulten and Mrs Swiebel have requested a repeat vote."""
"This concerns the same report that Mrs Buitenweg touched on."
"In my opinion, this is not right."
"The issue was not the fact that various members asked to change their vote, the issue was that many Members were unable to cast their votes."
"I would like to see this minuted."
"I should also add that the arguments brought yesterday for not having a repeat vote were not right either, in my opinion."
"I understand the rule that the same issue cannot be subject to voting twice."
"As far as I am concerned, however, this issue has not been voted on at all since many Members were unable to participate in the voting."
"I have noted your remarks and, I am sorry, it is also the custom to stand when one has the floor."
"You did not know this and now you have been made aware of it."
"Madam President, I would like to point out that in my intervention concerning the incident with the groups who presented a resolution on the fisheries agreement with Morocco, it appears from the Minutes that I was speaking on behalf of the Greens-ALE Group and this is not correct."
"At that moment I was only representing the ten MEPs who make up the ALE and I therefore ask for the Minutes to be corrected."
"I remember perfectly well."
"We shall correct the Minutes to show this."
"Madam President, you have quite rightly said that we should never have to vote a second time, yet this is precisely what we did yesterday."
"There were certain reasons for this as the roll call vote had been forgotten."
"However, yesterday afternoon, we had another attempt to take a vote for a second time."
"I call upon you, Madam President, and your colleagues, to reiterate the fact that once we have taken a vote, then that should, in principle, be the end of the matter and we should not keep on engaging in further debate as to whether to take a second vote."
"This principle, which you have made reference to here, should be stringently observed."
"Madam President, it is not a point about the Minutes but about the problem that was mentioned in the Minutes."
"It does seem to me that the difficulties that many of us had yesterday were to do with the fact that the Vice-President in the chair was too quick to close the vote."
"And people who had their fingers on the button discovered that it was not registering."
"Could the President and the Vice-President take careful note and discuss with the sessional services the need for a reasonable space between calling the vote and counting it."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President, I would like to clarify a point following my reference to last Monday' s regulation relating to the publication of a directory by the American Chamber of Commerce in Brussels which contained seriously erroneous information about me, about the MEPs in my Group and about several other MEPs."
"I have just received a letter from Parliament' s Secretary-General who says that there has been a mistake and that he never imagined that this directory would contain such partisan information."
"I take note of his words."
"We have agreed that he will write to the Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the directory be withdrawn and that a corrigendum be issued concerning the copies already in circulation."
"I thank him for reacting in this way which I think is appropriate, but obviously the matter is not over because we must now have this directory withdrawn from circulation altogether."
"Thank you Mr Berthu."
"This information was indeed quite partisan and the Secretary-General tells me that the letter has already been sent to those concerned."
"Votes"
"Poli Bortone (UEN), in writing."
"(IT) The fact that the Commission has waited until the last minute to ask for negotiations is certainly regrettable, especially considering the overall course of the whole affair, which already, in recent years, has experienced a conflict created in the institutional consultation framework, with regard to Parliament' s role in an agreement which has significant budgetary implications."
"We are fast approaching 30 November and the new agreement appears to be at the conclusion stage. The Commission has therefore given little attention to the economic level of the Objective 1 and 2 regions which, as they depend to a large degree on fishing, are seriously concerned about maintaining employment in the sector."
"No-one wants to call into question efficient instruments for cooperation with Morocco through negotiations, which reinforce, where possible, the interests of both the Community and Moroccan operators and emphasise the sense of solidarity which, moreover, even in sectors that are not purely economic, has been shown daily, especially between the countries of Southern Europe in the Mediterranean area."
"The European fishing fleet which, I may add, is so careful to fish in accordance with specific legislation concerning the environment - closed seasons, fishing groups, bans on fishing with sweep nets and trawl nets etc. needs socio-economic compensation measures following an agreement which further limits its activity, including compensation for the processing industry."
"One thing must be clear: the compensation must not be to the detriment of the agricultural sector, which has already suffered notable cuts in its budget."
"In this sense, the new FIFG regulation is fairly reassuring as it covers unforeseen events in the fisheries sector as well as the consequences of international agreements."
"Finally, a remark on the role of Parliament, whose Members must act as observers in all the negotiation procedures in order to fully protect the interests of the European fishing fleet."
"British beef and veal"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on British beef and veal."
"At the Florence Summit in June 1996, the heads of government agreed to take any decision on lifting the UK embargo ""only and exclusively on the basis of public health and objective scientific criteria and of the judgement of the Commission, in accordance with the existing procedures, that these criteria have been satisfied."""
"The conditions for the scheme are very demanding."
"First the UK had to slaughter offspring, which could otherwise be eligible, of known BSE cases before the scheme could be operational."
"This cull continues for new BSE cases."
"Then, the only eligible products are: deboned meat and a limited range of derived products, from animals between 6 and 30 months of age and born after the effective feed ban, that is born after 1 August 1996."
"In addition to that, there are not only stringent conditions concerning the identification and traceability of both the animal and its dam, but also the absence of any suspicion of BSE in the dam."
"Finally, stringent specific controls and full compliance are required from the entire production chain."
"These controls are under the competence of the UK authorities."
"But, prior to setting the date at which exports under the scheme were to commence, a mission of the Food and Veterinary Office to inspect the operation of the scheme was carried out."
"This led to a satisfactory conclusion and allowed that date to be set at 1 August 1999."
"Just this year two inspections in the UK have already been dedicated to auditing the DBES controls, namely in April and again in October."
"The opinion issued by AFSSA on 30 September 1999, concerning the lifting of the ban for bovine meat and meat products of UK origin, comes to an unfavourable conclusion on the basis of arguments related to scientific and control matters."
"The scientific matters have been presented for opinion to the Scientific Steering Committee."
"Preparatory meetings took place on 14 October and on 25 October in the framework of the ad hoc BSE group."
"During these meetings, the scientific documentation provided by AFSSA was examined and supplementary hearings of epidemiologists from MAFF also took place."
"A report of those meetings, in which a detailed analysis of the situation is provided, has been presented to the Scientific Steering Committee."
"This committee met in Brussels yesterday and is meeting today in order to discuss and draft an opinion on this matter."
"This meeting is still going on."
"Consequently, at this moment, I do not have any information on the outcome of the meeting."
"I understand that my colleague, Commissioner Byrne, together with the chairman of the Scientific Steering Committee, will give a press conference in Brussels at 6 p.m. this evening on the outcome of the meeting of the scientists."
"I can assure you that the European Parliament will be kept fully informed about the conclusions of the Scientific Steering Committee."
"Madam President, the reason I believe France should immediately lift the ban on British beef is because Britain has met the requirements of the Florence agreement."
"The Florence agreement reached between the EU heads of state and government on 21 June 1996 sets out five preconditions which the UK must meet before the beef export ban can be lifted. They are: implementation of a selective slaughter scheme."
"Introduction of an effective animal identification and movement record system, one that is fully in place. Legislation for the removal of meat and bonemeal from feedmills and farms."
"This is complete in the UK and not in the rest of Europe. Effective implementation of the Over Thirty Month rule, meaning that nothing over 30 months old can get into the food chain."
"Improved methods for removing specified risk material from bovine carcasses. These conditions have been met through the implementation of the control measures outlined above."
"The European Commission inspection visits verify that they have been fully and effectively implemented in the UK."
"This is the reason for my argument. I believe that the Commission has passed UK beef safe for export."
"The Commission lifted the ban on British beef on 1 August this year."
"The key issue is no beef animal over 30 months old is allowed into the food chain in Britain."
"There has not been a case - and I repeat: there has not been a case of BSE - in an animal born after 1 August 1996 in the UK."
"That is very important."
"Nothing over 30 months old and no case of BSE in anything born after 1 August 1996."
"There has been a selective slaughter of cattle born and reared alongside confirmed cases of BSE."
"There is a compulsory cull of offspring born to cattle with confirmed BSE."
"The cost to British farmers is enormous."
"UK exports to the EU alone in 1995 amounted to almost GBP 500 million, of which nearly half was to France."
"Nearly half a million calves were exported from Britain to the rest of Europe in 1995 and that must deliver a message in itself."
"The cost to farmers from the reduction of the value of the UK beef herd and by-products, along with the extra regulation, is estimated to be GBP 1000 million."
"While the bureaucrats and the politicians argue, farmers and their families in Britain suffer."
"On 1 August this year when the Commission lifted its ban, 12 out of 14 Member States to which Britain could export lifted their bans."
"If France had new evidence as to the safety of British beef why did the French Government not bring this information to the Commission before the ban was lifted in August 1999 - why wait until now and delay and delay and delay?"
"People in Britain expect France to comply with European law and they also expect the European Commission to act decisively to end the illegal ban on British beef."
"The single market is fundamental to the very existence of the European Union and the illegal action by France throws the whole single market into disrepute."
"Having a war of words on whose food is safest in Europe will only result in one thing: the destruction of consumer confidence in food from Europe wherever it is produced."
"We learned that lesson when BSE originally came in."
"The longer this dispute continues, the more likely there will be a boycott of French food by British consumers."
"Feelings are running high in Britain and the crisis must be resolved quickly, otherwise there will be tit-for-tat retaliation on both sides of the channel."
"Three months after the lifting of the ban by the Commission, the Veterinary Committee is still considering evidence as to whether British beef is safe."
"This is unacceptable."
"The Commission accepted British beef was safe on 1 August when it lifted the ban."
"It must now act decisively and make France lift the illegal ban on British beef immediately."
"Compensation must be paid to the British beef industry by the French government for the damage it has caused the industry."
"The longer this illegal action by France continues, the more it damages the reputation of the whole of the European Union."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Commissioner Fischer for his statement, and say to him that on Wednesday of next week we want either President Prodi or Commissioner Byrne to come to Parliament to make a clear statement on what measures the Commission intends to take following the publication of the scientific conclusions later today."
"This new Commission must be seen to be acting decisively and if public confidence is not to be eroded we need action within days, not within weeks or months."
"Therefore I say to Commissioner Fischler that when you have discussions with your colleagues over the weekend, when you look at the scientific conclusions - when you meet as a College on Wednesday - we cannot have prevarication or fudge."
"We have to have decisive action based on a clear decision that would be taken at the scientific committee later today."
"Perhaps Mr Parish could send a copy of his speech to his own party leader because sadly in Britain his own party leader has been advocating a ban on French products in the United Kingdom."
"What we want here, President, is the scientific evidence to prove or disprove the French case and we want an immediate resolution."
"We do not want the xenophobia and the jingoism that we have heard on both sides of the English Channel in the last couple of weeks."
"We want to make sure that farmers and their families are taken care of."
"We want to make sure that the British beef ban is lifted."
"All of the evidence demonstrates that British beef is now the safest in Europe and, we believe, the safest in the world."
"It was this House, through its special committee of inquiry into BSE, together with the European Commission, that recommended the measures that have now been taken to guarantee the safety throughout the European Union of those who consume British products and British beef."
"It is for the future of the European Union, it is for the future of our unity in the World Trade talks in November when we go to Seattle, that we need to have two of Europe' s major trading partners resolve this dispute."
"Can anyone imagine what it will be like when we open the World Trade talks, if there is still a dispute between the French and the British on such a fundamental issue?"
"It will be used by our opponents to divide the European Union in these crucial talks."
"I would pay tribute, President, to the National Farmers' s Union and to British farmers."
"This week we had the Vice-President of the National Farmers' s Union, Tim Bennett, here."
"He met my French colleagues from the Socialist Group and he put forward a compelling argument as to why the British beef ban should be lifted."
"He did not use the gimmicks that we have seen recently: the Liberal Democrat dragging a sack of British beef through the airport, hoping that some hapless customs officer would arrest her for a photo opportunity, or the Tories storming the Bastille two weeks ago in Paris, again for a photo opportunity."
"The National Farmers' Union came here to meet Parliamentarians and to meet representatives of the Commission because they have a compelling argument."
"I want to thank those colleagues from Parliament who met representatives and British farmers and listened to that compelling case."
"But I say to the Commission that the responsibility being shown by the National Farmers' Union can only last for so long."
"If the Commission does not act next week, if this drags on for more than a few more days, then the argument in Britain will shift."
"Those people who at the moment have been asking for calm and for no retaliatory action will not be listened to."
"Inevitably, this issue will escalate and I think it will do permanent damage to British and French relations."
"I say to the Commission and I say to this House that over the next few days, we need calm: we do not want a trade war, we do not want an escalating trade ban."
"We want common sense and we want to base our decision on science because in the disputes that occur in the future - and there will be many on food safety because consumers are so concerned now about the food that they eat - the scientists, the objectivity and the independence of the scientists is absolutely critical."
"Who knows what issue we will need to refer to that Scientific Committee."
"It is critical that we base our decisions on the scientific evidence and if there is a clear majority today by the scientists to lift the British beef ban we expect the French authorities to act within days, and we expect the Commission to take the appropriate legal action if that does not happen."
"Let me conclude on one final point. The one issue that has been highlighted by this dispute is the fact that we now need a European Food Agency in place as a matter of urgency."
"I would say to Commissioner Fischler that, when the College meets next Wednesday, please come forward more rapidly with a proposal to establish a European Food Agency because in my view, if that had been in place today, this dispute would never have arisen."
"Madam President, I should just like to say before I start that it is a bit rich of Mr Donnelly to say that people should not have a trade war."
"Mr Brown, the British Minister for Agriculture, said himself that he would not be buying French food."
"I am very disappointed that there is no solution today."
"I hope there will be a solution quickly."
"It is not doing any good to any of our farmers, whether they be French or British."
"British beef is safe."
"Hygiene standards prove that British beef is safe; the scientific evidence has proved that British beef is safe."
"Other countries lifted the ban on 1 August."
"There have been no cases of BSE in the relevant age group - 6 months to 30 months old - since 1996."
"No cases at all."
"So why have the French not lifted the ban?"
"I suspect it is because they have picked up our trade."
"Nearly 40% of our trade with the EU was to France."
"No objection was raised by the French back in May when the International Veterinary Organisation adopted less rigorous conditions than those foreseen by the date-base export scheme."
"But all this argument illustrates the need for an independent food standard agency at EU level."
"It would prevent the undue influence of national bodies who quite often have a political axe to grind."
"It could look at EU practices across the whole of the European Union."
"It could point out the hypocrisy of France continuing the ban."
"I have heard of some of the practices in France at the moment."
"I do not know how true they are, but I have heard of: French beef being sold in markets with the spinal tissue and brain still attached - the food agency could look at that; carcasses not inspected in France by qualified vets, unlike in the UK; pigs still fed bone marrow - the food agency could look at those cases; lower standards of farm hygiene in France;"
"The list is endless, not to mention the sewage sludge."
"That has disgusted everyone."
"But I am not as worried about that as I am, perhaps, about the reports that offal and bonemeal are still being fed to French animals."
"Before any food safety agency is set up, the Commission must examine all these cases in France as well."
"Stringent action must be taken against them if the Commission finds, through scientific evidence, that France is breaking any of the rules and that the food is not fit for human consumption, in the same way as it did on BSE."
"I do not think the French were wrong to criticise Britain over some of the practices over BSE in the past."
"I felt the Conservative Government should have acted sooner."
"I felt they should have put more money into research sooner."
"But now we are BSE-free in the 6 months to 30 months-old exports."
"It is important to remember that."
"But we must make sure that when the evidence comes forward tomorrow and when we hear the result, if there is no new scientific evidence - and I doubt there will be - that action is taken against France immediately if it does not lift the ban."
"I hope France will see sense."
"I hope it will see sense for the sake of our farmers, for the sake of the French farmers, for the sake of the European Union and for the sake of the Commission."
"The Commission has to be seen to be acting firmly."
"If it fudges the issue, if it comes up with a compromise not based on scientific evidence, then the Commission will be brought into disrepute and consequently the whole of the European Union will be brought into disrepute."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the French study confirms the finding that as regards BSE there are no definite scientific criteria regarding the cause, transmission and the incubation period, including for the human variant of BSE."
"Rather, the only thing that is certain is that BSE cannot be transmitted horizontally."
"This basic uncertainty and risk, including with regard to human health, not only applies in England but in France as well."
"There is no scientific certainty that there is no risk of BSE either in Great Britain or in France or, for that matter, in other European countries."
"In other words, the only absolute guarantee against becoming infected by BSE is if people do without animal protein completely or, qualifying that somewhat, if they purchase products where they can be sure that BSE has not occurred in the herd in question."
"The tragic fact, however, is that those people who are affected today were most probably infected in the mid eighties to early nineties."
"The risk of becoming infected with BSE in Europe today is considerably less, very slight indeed, although there are no guarantees."
"An embargo or an export ban does not fight BSE, rather it is simply a means of containing the disease and a way of implementing the European safety standards which the Commission has enacted."
"This has been the case in Great Britain, England and Portugal."
"Our Group has always maintained that this is not an English disease but a European problem."
"Thus, the criteria that are now leading to the lifting of the embargo are in keeping with the safety criteria which the Commission has laid down."
"English beef is also eaten in England, and always has been."
"The European institutions, those of us who are politically active at a European level, also have to provide care for English consumers as well as make provision for them."
"Even if national provision is an overriding priority, it should also be a matter of concern for us."
"One simply cannot say that they should be left to their own devices!"
"It is clearly not possible to limit the incidence of BSE to certain parts of the body, as has been discussed previously."
"As you are aware, BSE or prions indicating the presence of BSE have been found in blood, even if these tests have not yet been validated."
"In other words, even though removing risk material is no absolute guarantee of safety, it is a valid safety measure, since in the carcass, of course, we have a decreasing order of incidence."
"Commissioner, I have two further points to put to the Commission."
"You are also personally aware, through your exchange of letters with our Group, that we have always said that the lifting of the embargo must be associated with the introduction of tests."
"You have three tests that have been validated, and yet you are not applying them."
"It was a safety measure, Mr Fischler, but at the same time also a psychological one."
"We could have spared ourselves this Anglo-French conflict, also involving Germany to some extent."
"My second point is as follows: You know that, back in 1997, Parliament wanted to introduce the label I for beef, a measure that was designed to safeguard consumers and allow them to make a decision."
"This was to have come into force on 1 January 2000."
"Instead of enacting the implementing regulations, you are now putting proposals to us to defer this labelling for three years."
"That is not a measure that engenders confidence!"
"Finally, I would like to come to the question of the Agency."
"An Agency is sensible and appropriate."
"You may also choose to call it an Agency but let us not get onto the slippery slope in this discussion where we start saying that we should have an independent Agency which the European Parliament will no longer have supervisory access to."
"We want to retain control. We did, after all, also sort out the BSE problem here in the European Parliament!"
"Mr President, nobody can dispute the fact that Great Britain is still the continuing source of an epidemic which has affected half of its beef herds."
"There will be more than 3,000 cases of mad cow disease in 1999, in spite of the measures that have been taken since the ban was declared in 1996."
"The persistence of this endemic raises a frightening question; whether there may be other means by which this disease is transmitted, apart from the ones we have seen so far, such as feeding animals with animal meal and transmission through the mother."
"In the light of these fundamental questions, as in the case of GMOs, we must be as prudent as possible, and all the more so because we will soon have an effective scientific instrument - the BSE tests - which will enable us to judge the state of health of all herds."
"The scientific validation of these tests is imminent."
"So why should there be such a rush to force the lifting of the ban now, even though Great Britain has no beef that it can export and when these tests are about to be validated?"
"Nevertheless, the French government' s attitude is not entirely consistent."
"If, instead of abstaining at the Council, it had, like Germany, voted in favour of maintaining the ban in the absence of elements which are essential for traceability, the ban would now be in force, consumers would be safe, the tests would be able to clarify things for us, the great British people would have been spared the blast of nationalism from across the channel and our Conservative friends would not have had to disown the principle of sovereignty for which they feel legitimate affection."
"Having said that, issues that are just as vital for human health as those surrounding BSE would not stand up to most close examinations."
"The whole issue of protecting our people' s health and food is at stake."
"Indeed, the crisis is fundamentally a result of the obstacles created by both the European Union and the WTO to the implementation of the precautionary principle, and we will only be able to implement the precautionary principle appropriately by regaining genuine subsidiarity, not by subverting it in the name of federalist and free trade ideologies."
"As far as food safety is concerned, given the current state of the European Union, we know very well that we can only expect it to provide a minimal level of protection, and to provide reduced value rather than added value."
"Subsidiarity thus makes it a matter of urgency that we recognise that States have the right to derogate from any harmonisation measure as long as they intend to adopt regulations providing greater protection for public health, and for the environment too."
"It is essential to add this as an emergency measure to the next IGC agenda, and this is, consequently, a point that must absolutely be renegotiated in the framework of the WTO, otherwise any attempt to apply subsidiarity at the European level would be susceptible to being bypassed."
"In Marrakech, the Commission forced us to surrender our freedom in the area of health protection."
"The burden of scientific proof, which weighs heavily enough on those wishing to protect the health of their population, puts a brake on applying the precautionary principle or actually prevents it."
"It is crucial that these measures be revised if the current crisis is to lead us in these two directions, which are closely linked."
"We cannot demand that the precautionary principle be taken into account at the WTO in Seattle when at the moment, we are denying this to Member States."
"If we do this, Mr President, Commissioner, some good will have come out of this crisis."
"Mr President, let me say right from the outset that the UK Independence Party, my party - the members of which are so often dismissed as ""little Englanders"" - totally deplore the outbreaks of petty nationalism in the UK and France, over this beef issue"
"However, I find it ironic that the EU institutions - which introduced the ban on British beef exports in 1996 - and which exist to promote the unity and cooperation of European nations, have by their original actions, created a political situation which has directly led to this disharmony."
"My party, which has a clear election manifesto to seek Britain' s withdrawal from the EU, notes that if the Commission had not interfered in the first place, back in 1996, individual nations would have been able to decide whether or not to buy British beef."
"At that time, a number of countries, particularly South African and Botswana, were willing to continue to buy British produce."
"Without the EU ban, Britain would have been free to exploit alternative markets, and this crisis would not have arisen."
"Now we have a classic demonstration that membership of the EU is bad for British business."
"It affirms my belief that it is about time that my own country recognised that our interests are best served by not being a member of this club."
"Most people in the UK thought we joined a free trade area but this crisis demonstrates it is anything but that."
"While the UK has obeyed EU law to the letter, other countries are running a cart and horse through the rule book."
"The ""level playing field"" is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit the iceberg!"
"Thus, while I wish the Commissioner well in his endeavours, I am afraid that whatever he does it will not be good enough."
"I, for one, will be urging my own government to leave this club and to rejoin the real trading world."
"Mr President, I understand the position of our British friends, just as I understand the position of our Portuguese friends who are also concerned, just as I understood the position of our Belgian friends in the dioxin affair and just as I understand even better the position of the French in the sewage sludge affair."
"But this is not the same thing."
"Atypical Creutzfeldt-Jakob is a terrifying disease which affects young men or women of around twenty years of age."
"First they lose the ability to move, to walk, they are confined to an armchair, their muscles waste away, they find it more and more difficult to breathe, they can see themselves dying and then die after six months."
"It is true that our British friends have taken precautions over traceability, that they have introduced a passport for cattle, that different types of meal have been banned since 1990, that conditions for the slaughter of animals have been changed, that lymph nodes, spinal marrow and lymphoid tissue are now removed and that only cattle less than thirty months old are exported."
"They have seen to it that the consequences of the terrible mistake made by the Demulder brothers in Yorkshire, which was the original cause of the disease, have been mitigated."
"It is nevertheless still the case that slaughter by means of a special pistol causes particles of the brain or lymphoid tissue to enter the jugular vein and from there they can reach the muscle mass."
"It is also true that there are still 3,000 cases every year in Great Britain, and that there are 40 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is the upper limit for normal rates of occurrence."
"It is nevertheless true that there are 650 cases of BSE per million head of cattle."
"People say to me that the cattle that are exported are in perfect condition."
"That may be true, but the disease incubates for 15 or 20 years."
"There may be no clinical signs when the cattle are imported, but they may be incubating the disease, and so may the Englishman who has eaten the meat!"
"It is also true that the first results of the screening tests show that cattle that are clinically perfect may in fact already be affected."
"I am sure you understand why there is still some doubt."
"It was thought that the disease was transmitted by different kinds of meal."
"These kinds of meal have been banned but the disease still exists."
"It was thought that the disease was transmitted from mother to calf, and there is undoubtedly a third means of transmission perhaps through scrapie, through the soil or through fodder."
"There are some accursed fields from which a herd is removed and then, two years later, a new herd is put there, which also contracts the disease."
"Perhaps the same thing applies to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."
"You can understand then, why the French food safety agency recommended not lifting the ban."
"People say to us that things would be different if it were a European Agency."
"Would they?"
"So French biology is one thing and Brussels biology is quite another."
"This harks back to Lysenko who, in the days of the Soviet Union, told us that there was one biology for proletarians and one for capitalists."
"This is completely untrue!"
"The laws of biology apply to everyone."
"Professor Dormond and Jeanne Bruger Picou are two of the greatest scientists around, as is Professor Dirringer in Germany, as is one of the Scottish consultants, who also has his doubts."
"People tell me that the ban has been lifted, and that first Germany and then France is resisting."
"I must remind you that at the beginning of 1996, when five German states refused to accept British beef, the European Commission tried to bring a liability action against them when all that these states were trying to do was to protect their citizens."
"Then a few weeks later, the European Commission imposed the ban and admitted that the German states had been right."
"We all agree on opposing meat containing american hormones and to the use of somatotrophin, a lactation hormone, when there is no scientific evidence to say that it is dangerous."
"Somatotrophin can cause mastitis in cows, but if we were to inject ourselves with it, we might experience a swelling in the chest, but it would not kill us."
"How can we refuse to accept meat containing american hormones and somatotrophin, when there is no clearly established risk, and yet accept British meat which presents a serious risk?"
"How can we make a case for Europe and the precautionary principle at the WTO, whilst refusing to apply the precautionary principle in the case of British cows?"
"There is a hierarchy of standards, and top of the hierarchy of standards is the health standard, then the standard of international trade."
"After all, our British friends are just reaping what they have sown."
"It was an Englishman, Ricardo, who explained the laws of international trade and its comparative advantages to us."
"He explained to the Portuguese that they should produce wine instead of cloth because the English were better at producing cloth."
"Well, my dear British friends, you should realise that others are better than you at producing cows, and maybe you should stop producing cows."
"In any case, you have been punished for your sins, which result from excessive free trade practises and from an excessively ultraliberal approach, for that is the fundamental cause of this pandemic and of this disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans."
"We cannot take the risk of allowing young men of twenty to die just so that international trade may flourish."
"Mr President, Mr Martinez will certainly be a hard act to follow."
"The violence of the reaction from the Europeans across the channel to the measures taken by the French public authorities, in response to the recommendation by the agency that has already been mentioned here this morning, seems to be out of all proportion."
"It must be admitted that a three and a half-year ban is extremely harsh and that something that could be mistaken for a lack of goodwill can become the straw that breaks the camel' s back."
"I know that livestock breeders are suffering enormously and, as a result, I received a number of them in my office on Tuesday."
"The British are currently trying to set their health concerns about meat from animals fed with banned products, against the health concerns of the French."
"I would, however, like to clarify a few things."
"Firstly, the beef war: cattle have not been fed meat meal since 1990 and are thus are no longer a factor in this problem."
"Secondly, it is undeniable that legal action must be taken against all the practises that have been criticised, and these must be severely censured."
"Thirdly, France is the only European country, apart from Belgium, to have undergone an inspection from a team of experts from the Commission."
"Does this mean that the British are not committing any offence, even when we know that their exporters have not had any misgivings about exporting contaminated meal, which was banned in their own country in 1988?"
"They exported it to the Community until 1990, the date of the European ban on these products, and to other countries for a long time afterwards."
"I would like to add that measures have been taken in France too, for if there is a sick animal in the herd, the whole herd is killed."
"We have had 22 cases compared to several thousand in the United Kingdom."
"It has to be said that this is another reason for the French not to feel particularly reassured any more."
"As Northern Ireland is not restricted and transit through France is legal, trade can nevertheless still take place with all European countries except France."
"For my own information, I shall now ask the European Commission for some technical details."
"Which European countries are currently buying British meat, and in what quantity?"
"I think that this will shed some light on the matter."
"All the evidence suggests that French consumers have no blanket, a priori prejudice against British meat: you only have to think of the great quantities of British beef to realise that this is the case."
"Producers and consumers must realise that the current debate is primarily a debate among scientific experts, who must be allowed to make their case freely."
"Producers and consumers should also be aware that scientific facts evolve as new discoveries are made."
"I hope, for everyone' s sake, that screening tests are quickly implemented."
"Once the scientific debate is over, everyone will have to face up to his or her own responsibilities."
"It is indeed vital that the meat on European consumers' plates is healthy."
"To conclude, I would like to say that I am delighted to see that throughout this crisis, governments and the respective professional organisations have finally sought to restore the calm that is essential for allowing a debate to progress, a debate which, all the evidence suggests, will not come to an end today, and I would simply ask the British Minister to adopt the same measures adopted by the French Minister."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is crucial for all of us that we can guarantee the safety and quality of our food."
"To this end, the French government has established the French food safety agency in order to make a better scientific assessment of the risks from food."
"It was thought to be essential that France should have an authority which will enable it to make decisions on a rigorous, scientific basis, completely independent from any outside power."
"Just imagine the things that people would have said if the government had not taken the scientists' advice when their conclusions were negative!"
"Nevertheless, we must not allow psychosis to take hold."
"It is also quite unacceptable to stigmatise the British farmers who have suffered a great deal and who have made Herculean efforts."
"We cannot ignore their desperate plight."
"On the other hand, nobody will come out of a trade war unscathed, least of all the European Union."
"Let us not give anyone a stick with which to beat us, and let us not play into the hands of the anti-Europeans who are shamelessly exploiting the situation."
"Those people who do not want Europe are making shameless use of any pretext to set the public against Europe."
"It is so easy to use emotion, but let us not forget that it is entirely thanks to Europe that we are able to have a free market and actually trade our products."
"If the European Union did not exist, today, whenever we are confronted with a problem, our borders would close and that would be that!"
"We would not be here holding a debate today."
"The European Scientific Steering Committee must express its views on the relevance of the French arguments because, on Monday, the ad hoc group, which gathers together European prion disease specialists, was not able to reach a unanimous conclusion and passed the results of its study to the European Scientific Committee."
"This committee must take a decision, and we are all waiting to hear the opinion of the Commission, which must take responsibility."
"It will take responsibility, and we feel sure that it will do so in a way that will not affect high standards of protection."
"It was scientists' recommendations that triggered the crisis, and scientists will be the ones to get us out of the crisis."
"We now have the opportunity to make use of a test which will allow us to screen incubating animals."
"We will have to see if it is possible to set this up quickly, because although there is no such thing as zero risk in food safety, it is our duty to make use of all possible means to reassure our citizens that everything has been done to prevent mistakes, particularly where food is concerned."
"The Commission could propose complementary measures which would allow us to feel completely reassured."
"I would like to add that, of course, everyone should keep their own house in order, and that includes France."
"All those who have led our countries into mad agricultural practises must be roundly condemned."
"It is quite easy to see today that the race for profits leads to appalling events and terrible paradoxes."
"At a time when manufacturers have had no misgivings about turning ruminants into carnivores, there is still hunger in the world."
"Scientists make their recommendations and politicians make their choices, which are not always easy to make."
"The problem is really one of knowing to what extent we can take on a risk when one exists."
"This is exactly why the precautionary principle has been developed."
"We will only come out of this crisis by working together, and we will come out on top, because we cannot allow our credibility to be damaged."
"All our consumers want to know what they are eating, and they want to be sure that they can trust us."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this debate and situation have come at the worst possible time for the EU and is causing a lot of harm."
"Just think, ladies and gentlemen: we should and must defend the European agricultural model at the WTO talks in Seattle."
"We have made a decision that there should be no import ban on British meat but, nonetheless, within the EU - an EU which should represent a free economic area at its best - a decision is being made to impose an import ban."
"This is an absolutely inconceivable situation!"
"The English have had to suffer the inconveniences of BSE for quite long enough."
"They have done all they can to get the problem off the agenda and solved."
"That was a very commendable thing."
"It seems inconceivable that we should take a joint decision to lift the ban on the export of British meat, and yet we decide, for our part, that the ban on importing it has not been lifted at all."
"Just think of the future, when we are discussing EU enlargement."
"Let us take the example of Poland."
"If Poland' s agricultural standards quickly reach the average standards in the EU, it will just about be able to feed the whole of the EU on its own."
"That is why we must defend the European agricultural model at the WTO talks, so as to safeguard exports in the future since, in the years and decades to come, we will not find a solution to the problems of agriculture anywhere else but in exports."
"These are basic principles."
"In a way both England and France are guilty: it is a case of the pot calling the kettle black."
"If, in Finland, my country, we were to make feed which had had sludge added to it, that plant would be closed down the next day - you can be quite sure of that."
"There is no way you can produce feed from sludge."
"We in the EU are allowing this situation to continue, although it was banned in 1991."
"We will certainly have to take a good look at ourselves and contemplate what sort of image we want to present to the outside world, and how we should accomplish that, in this very difficult and delicate situation, when we join the WTO talks and when we consider the issue of EU enlargement and what the future will look like."
"These sorts of crises have to be dealt with very quickly."
"We can do it by ourselves, and only by ourselves, and we must do so as quickly as possible."
"Mr President, it is regrettable that again today we are having this debate in the absence of a decision from the committee currently meeting in Brussels."
"It is also regrettable that this debate has taken such a hysterical tone in certain parts of Europe, fuelled by some of the London-based media in particular."
"We would all agree that food safety and public health issues must be regarded as the highest political priorities throughout Europe, but British beef, as stated again today by Commissioner Fischler, has satisfied the public health objectives set by the European Union."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner, in his summing up, can state that every other Member State now meets equally high standards in beef production and slaughter."
"I also regret that this matter has been allowed to be portrayed as a battle between Britain and France, because it ought to be an issue between France and Europe."
"Here we have just ended a period of the most difficult conditions being set by the European Union on the British beef production industry, conditions which have been met, and therefore action to implement the lifting of the beef ban should be taken decisively by the Commission."
"My group colleague, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, referred once or twice in his speech to ""English"" beef but of course the UK consists of four distinct countries and in Scotland, where I come, from the beef farmers are rightly entitled to feel badly treated because we did not have a significant BSE problem in the first place."
"These conditions set by Europe have been met and still we are not able to export."
"Our farmers rightly wonder what was the point of all of the pain they went through over the last few years in order to meet the high standards which have been set and which have been met."
"What would be the point of having more years of discussion and of setting up a European food standards agency if its recommendations were not to be implemented?"
"The issue here is that if we are to have European standards then surely we must be entitled to expect that these standards are accepted by the participating Member States."
"Our consumers must be protected in relation to food safety, but consumers are also entitled and intelligent enough to make choices."
"I am quite convinced, as a resident of Angus in the heart of Scotland' s Aberdeen Angus beef production country, that consumers in France, as elsewhere, would choose Scottish beef if they were allowed to do so."
"Mr President, I would first like to state that I am in favour of the precautionary principle in an area where consumers' health is under direct threat, but the discussion taking place here between the supporters of the ban and their opponents is nothing but hypocrisy."
"Everyone knows that both the good and the bad arguments in favour of consumer protection are used above all as weapons in a trade war and as arguments in shady manoeuvres in domestic politics."
"It is therefore total hypocrisy to blame farmers and their interests and to set them in opposition, explicitly or implicitly, to the interests of consumers, without censuring the part played by the large capitalist groups which produce and supply cattle feed."
"In Parliament we hear endless praise for companies' competitiveness, for their right and even for their duty to maximise profits."
"Well this is the result of this race for profits in an area which affects health and food safety!"
"Along with the carcinogenic consequences of asbestos, spongiform encephalitis is yet another time bomb laid by industry' s capitalist management."
"Whether the European Parliament adopts a position in favour of the embargo or of lifting it, the basic problems will not have been addressed."
"There will still be companies that cut corners on the investment necessary for studying the danger posed by new products."
"There will still be companies, such as those that produce asbestos, that continue to pass the dangers on to their workers and to consumers; companies which, in all conscience, will continue to run the risk of poisoning and even murdering people, in order to make a little more profit."
"Mr President, following the excellent interventions by Mr Souchet and Mr Martinez on maintaining the French ban on British beef, I would just like to add three observations, from the legal, moral and political points of view."
"From the legal point of view, it is obvious that the French act of 1 July 1998, establishing the Agency for food safety, infers that France has sovereign power to safeguard the health of its citizens."
"It is equally clear that Article 95 of our Treaty, in the way it has been reinforced since Amsterdam, says the opposite, out of an absurd desire for standardisation."
"This kind of contradiction between national law and Community law also exists in the area of hunting and in many other areas, as if governments were signing abstract European commitments whose aberrant practical consequences they only discover later."
"In this type of contradiction, the ultimate yardstick can only be the free choice of each nation; otherwise the whole European system will explode."
"We must also consider the moral dimension of this business."
"There is of course a superior moral principle which requires a government to safeguard its citizens' fundamental interests."
"But neither must we lose sight of the fact that the catastrophe that was mad cow disease which struck our British partners could have struck in any one of our countries, as we all practise the same policy of high productivity in agriculture that goes against nature, and which is more and more subject to the worldwide doctrine of free trade."
"As far as this policy is concerned, all Member countries share collective responsibility."
"I would not say that this applies to all sectors of our relationships within Europe; nor would I say that about our relationships with third countries, but within the Union, there is undeniably a common agricultural policy and a joint responsibility with regards to this policy."
"This is why we should find it understandable that the European budget gives particular help to British livestock farmers."
"And whatever you say about it, there is no shortage of money!"
"Only yesterday, Parliament' s Federalists found the means to set aside EUR 60 million - yes, EUR 60 million - for a unified statute for MEPs which would be completely useless and which, moreover, has not yet been decided."
"Finally, the political dimension and political thinking: how can we get out of this mess?"
"Well, beside the compensation that I have just been talking about, I think that the only solution to this business is to make screening tests available as quickly as possible."
"Until then, the principle of prudence must prevail; otherwise, our citizens' trust will be broken a little further."
"In broader terms, we should agree on the need for high-quality farming, which will respect the environment as well as consumers' health, and which will ensure our self-sufficiency in food production."
"But this kind of farming requires Community preference, which we should now go and fight for in Seattle."
"I think that a positive outcome of today' s debate would be to reach agreement with the British in recognising that this must be one of our main priorities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, scientific checks in France have allegedly brought new findings to the subject of BSE."
"Allegedly!"
"I am not a scientist, I am a farmer, a consumer, a politician, but I say to you quite candidly that I am not always ready to trust science for it is all too often the case that scientific findings come out in favour of the parties who commissioned the inquiry."
"There are countless examples of this in everyday life."
"I will give you one such example."
"We are currently awaiting the findings of the Scientific Committee with some trepidation and I believe that we will be continuing this discussion this evening and next week in Brussels."
"We all know the expression, ""two lawyers, three opinions"" ."
"Where I come from, it goes, ""two scientists, two opinions"" ."
"And for why?"
"We once had a case of trying to find a location for a waste disposal site, the application for which had been turned down."
"The assessment of the district scientists was that the subsoil was watertight, while the local authority scientists maintained that the subsoil was as watertight as a bathtub without a plug!"
"I admit that this topic is now actually far too serious."
"We can have a very emotional discussion here this morning on this subject of BSE, but this does nothing to help either British farmers or European consumers."
"It is also of little help when we, as European MEPs, refer to current contraventions of internal market regulations."
"An infringement of the Treaty is an important topic for all of us involved in European politics but, as an MEP in my constituency, I cannot use this at the moment as an argument to circumvent a political discussion on this topic."
"While we sit here and discuss this issue, we are driving more and more consumers away from the meat counter."
"As recently as the last plenary part-session, we made a renewed call for more stringent food safety and improved consumer protection."
"Commission President Romano Prodi made it clear during the debate that he would make the safety of foodstuffs his priority and the Commission wants to, and must, set up a new chapter in consumer policy."
"The most recent developments in the BSE crisis, in the ""beef war"" , involving not only France and Great Britain but Germany as well, where the federal Länder are currently adopting a very negative attitude, clearly demonstrate, Mr Fischler and Mr Byrne, too, the difficult task that we are faced with and the enormous challenge we have before us of creating a responsible and transparent consumer policy."
"Economic interests represent one side of the coin, consumer protection the other."
"I nevertheless believe, as I also said at the beginning, as a practical person I have a great deal of trouble with the results, that we should take the objections of the authorities very seriously."
"I eagerly await the outcome of this evening."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that we are not proud of the situation in which the farming profession finds itself today."
"But you can be assured that I shall not be speaking just as a Frenchwoman, but primarily as an ecologist and as a European."
"This is why I am fighting for the environment, and particularly for the precautionary principle, as much for Great Britain as for France, Spain and the countries of Southern Europe."
"This precautionary principle is, for us, a political line which must be followed in order to guarantee food safety itself."
"In France, it was under pressure from the people, from consumers, and of course from ecologists and Greens, that this agency for food safety was established."
"The agency made a recommendation, and of course the French government acted on it."
"Therefore people cannot refuse to accept the French position, all the more so as we are calling for this type of agency to be established at a European level."
"Of course, I hope that MEPs and the Commission will follow the recommendations of this future agency once it has been established."
"But we must spare a thought for the farmers."
"Mad cow disease dealt them a terrible blow and they barely recovered from it."
"It is completely unacceptable today to allow the situation to become poisoned by letting citizens from the same profession within the European Union stand in opposition to one another."
"The distress of British farmers is quite understandable."
"It must, nevertheless, be pointed out that the farming that is responsible for the situation in which all European farmers now find themselves, or at least a large proportion of them, is a result of a farming policy that emphasises high productivity."
"Therefore, it is our responsibility today finally to radically modify the European Union' s farming policy."
"Moreover, we have assumed our responsibilities towards the WTO and is the European Union not in the same situation in relation to the United States that France is facing today in relation to the European Union?"
"We cannot reject, on the one hand, the supposed legality of the WTO' s position on meat containing american hormones whilst, on the other, invoking the European raison d' état in order to reject the precautionary principle that France is proposing."
"The Greens are asking the Commission for concrete and urgent proposals even if today, the experts have not yet given their verdict."
"Commissioner, you are familiar with the current situation, and you know that it has been going on for a long time."
"It is really crucial to put forward proposals in order to reassure European consumers as well as farmers."
"Mr President, cattle in England was fed with the ground carcasses of animals and foreign prions caused BSE."
"In France sludge has been mixed with animal feed, which has also contained human waste, because of its urea content."
"In Belgium, fats have been mixed with animal feed, and the fats, when heated, have produced dioxins."
"The EU and Mr Fischler, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, are very much to blame for many problems, but the real guilty parties in these matters are the national governments."
"The basic problem is animal feed."
"It is the most important stage in the food chain."
"The solution to this problem is not to establish an army of EU officials to oversee the work of farms."
"The solution is a national one."
"The national authorities must dare to monitor farms and their production."
"Perhaps that way the illegal use of hormones will also be discovered."
"In any case, this issue will best be resolved by adopting the practice of food labels that indicate the origin of the produce."
"Mr President, the embargo on UK meat imposed by France raises, in my opinion, two kinds of issue, both of notable importance and significance for the future of the Union."
"On the one hand, there is the need to give substance to the very existence of the European Union by implementing in all the Member States the decisions made by the competent bodies on matters relevant to the Community, particularly in cases like the one we are addressing today which are liable to invalidate one of the fundamental premises of the Union itself - the free circulation of goods."
"On the other hand, there is the requirement to protect consumers, which is one of the absolute priorities and which is so important as to justify even national choices that contrast with Community decisions, provided that they are justified on scientific, health and hygiene grounds."
"The appraisal carried out on both of these kinds of issues cannot be reduced to specific for or against positions being taken in Parliament regarding the French decision."
"It is up to the other institutions to decide on the validity of the legal premises and, in particular, on the health grounds given by the French authorities. In this regard, we are waiting impatiently for Commissioner Byrne' s press conference this afternoon."
"An in-depth Parliamentary debate leading to a political assessment on someone' s behaviour would be misleading, and, above all, it would not contribute to the overall smooth functioning of the European institutions."
"On the contrary, what seems appropriate and desirable is for us to use these opportunities as well to continue the work of bonding the Community institutions together. This is something that Parliament, under the mandate conferred on it by all the Europeans it represents, must take responsibility for, incorporating the role performed up until now by the national governments in the construction of the Community."
"Moreover, Parliament must, with increasing commitment, perform that function of acting as a counterbalance to the Executive, that is, the Commission, which is a characteristic of all modern democracies."
"Returning to the case in hand, I believe that Parliament should not ask the Commission to investigate the existence of recommendations made by national agencies responsible for food safety that conflict with Community decisions."
"Instead, I think that it should ask the Commission and other competent Community institutions to draw up reports on what has been done as regards these decisions, in order to enable Parliament to formulate critical assessments which are a preliminary step towards perfecting the Community legislation in force on this subject."
"Mr President, I have certainly enjoyed some of the speeches today, not least the opening speech by Mr Donnelly where he seemed to be criticising the failure of the French and the British governments to achieve any solution to this escalating trade war."
"I would remind Mr Donnelly that both the governments in France and the United Kingdom are socialist governments."
"It has just been revealed that the Minister for Agriculture from his party in the United Kingdom has not even been in dialogue with his opposite number in France, which is ridiculous when you consider the way tempers are getting raised in the process of this trade war."
"But I can understand some of the rage felt by farmers and consumers in Great Britain when they hear that sewage sludge has found its way into feedingstuffs in France, when they hear that the British Government has known about that since June but has not chosen to raise the matter with the European Commission and when they know that in Britain we are still slaughtering 60,000 cattle a month because they are over 30 months of age and cannot enter the food chain."
"Otherwise these are perfectly healthy cattle."
"They are going to incineration after they are slaughtered and then their ashes are dumped in landfill sites."
"This will be seen as one of the great mistakes of this entire century as far as agriculture is concerned."
"There is rage when we know that in France there is also BSE - 22 cases so far this year."
"Yet even injured and diseased animals which die on the farm are finding their way into rendering plants and the tallow from these animals is finding its way into the pharmaceutical industry, into the cosmetic industry and therefore into the food chain."
"There is no level playing field, as other speakers have said."
"I hope that we can find a diplomatic solution and we must do everything within our power to do that."
"I appeal to the Commission and to the UK government to put pressure on France to comply with the findings of the Scientific Steering Committee, whatever those may be later today."
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank you above all for the manner in which today' s debate has been conducted."
"I believe that it was an exemplary debate which will contribute considerably towards allowing us to bring the discussion back to the realms of objectivity."
"Essentially, I can draw the following conclusions from this debate: Firstly, I am deeply convinced of the fact that we have to base our decisions, and also the decisions of the Commission, on the judgement of independent, and this is an important point, independent scientists, as well as on the state of the art."
"Nor should we overlook the fact that the cause of the entire BSE problem lay in the fact that this principle was disregarded, that decisions were taken for market reasons, for economic reasons, without appropriate consideration being given to the health issue."
"We should therefore take care to avoid making a similar mistake again by heading in one direction or the other."
"For this reason it would also be wrong for us to draw our own conclusions without being aware of the conclusions of the scientists who are at this moment discussing the issue in committee."
"We must await the verdict from the Scientific Committee which is made up exclusively of independent scientists."
"What we must then do, and I take this very seriously, is act immediately, so that we are doing more than just waiting and I am quite prepared to also communicate the message, which I am announcing here, to President Prodi and to my colleague David Byrne."
"I am quite prepared to ask you if this debate could then be continued on Wednesday, incorporating the conclusions drawn by the Commission."
"This French report essentially discusses four elements."
"One of these elements is application of the tests that are now available."
"I am not of the opinion that these tests should be used solely for placebo purposes, but in this regard as well we should base our decision, as indeed we have done, on scientific fact."
"I am convinced that these tests can render a valuable service in supervising the events on a Europe-wide basis and they should also be applied to this end."
"As to the extent that they may be used over and above this, we should certainly be careful on one point, and that is in believing that we have a one hundred percent guarantee, and that we can give a one hundred percent guarantee that we can distinguish between meat which may pose a risk and that which does not."
"However good the tests are, they are not one hundred percent reliable."
"In this regard as well, we cannot dream of a zero risk."
"Should the scientists put forward new recommendations in this matter, we should obviously be more than ready to examine these recommendations accordingly as well."
"As far as supervision is concerned, I agree with those here who have demanded that the level of supervision be comparable throughout Europe and that it is not sufficient to have a working system of supervision in Great Britain alone."
"We are not, however, carrying out inspections only in Great Britain but in other countries as well so as to guarantee this at a European level too."
"With regard to the calls for a Food Agency, I would like to point out that we would be well advised to make headway on this question."
"In this regard, we must establish the preconditions laid down by my colleague, Mr Byrne, and in this connection I would like again to emphasise the following: I do not consider that we should go in the direction of a Food Agency along the lines of the FDA, but we should adopt the Food Agency which we already have for pharmaceutical products as a model, in other words, a European model for a Food Agency."
"As far as the question of postponing the labelling is concerned, I would again like to draw your attention to the fact that the Commission' s interest is not in delaying this, but rather in ensuring that we do not get to the end of the year only to find ourselves without either a voluntary or a mandatory labelling system in place."
"Do not overlook one point, namely that it is of no use to make a labelling system obligatory if the data required for this is not available."
"After all, we would then actually be deceiving consumers with something that does not exist in reality, thus undermining our call for transparency and objectivity."
"In conclusion, what we really should be concentrating on from now on is letting the facts speak for themselves."
"In this way, we should also encounter various emotions and, in addition to these facts, we have to demonstrate competence and transparency in this regard."
"On a final note, I would like to say one more thing, which is that the results of the Committee will be made available to all MEPs in electronic format today."
"Thank you, Commissioner Fischler."
"I am sure you have the support of the entire House in trying to resolve this difficult situation."
"Following Commissioner Fischler' s announcement, the Commission will be making the appropriate documents available this afternoon before the press conference."
"That will be made available to you on e-mail and it will also be on Parliament' s intranet."
"The debate is closed."
"EC-Angola fisheries agreement"
"The next item is the report (A5-0022/1999) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining, for the period from 3 May 1999 to 2 May 2000, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Angola on fishing off Angola (COM(1999)389 - C5-0170/1999/0169(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his capacity as rapporteur, Mr Cunha has called on me to present his report."
"The Protocol to the EU-Angola fisheries agreement, as mentioned, already expired on 2 May this year."
"A new Protocol was signed by both parties."
"This Protocol laid down the technical and financial conditions whereby Community ships are permitted to fish in Angolan waters in the period from 3 May 1999 to 2 May 2000."
"Apart from the extremely short period of validity of the Protocol, one year instead of three, and the fact that the tuna quota was increased, the Protocol is identical to the previous one."
"This Protocol is significant for the EU, however, from the budgetary viewpoint alone."
"EUR 10.3 million is already a large sum in itself, and we do not even have a guarantee that we can interrupt payments in the event that Angola stipulates a closed season for shrimp fishing."
"Moreover, we are not making the most of our fishing entitlement, with the exception of tuna vessels where 100% of permitted capacity is taken up."
"Only 63% of shrimp vessel capacity is taken, and 0% of dredger capacity."
"We also must give serious consideration to the funds allocated to scientific programmes (EUR 1.7 million), training (EUR 1 million) and studies (EUR 350,000)."
"There is no clause authorising the Commission to check whether these funds are used correctly."
"For their part, the Angolan authorities are not obliged to account for how the funds are used."
"In this area, the rapporteur recommends that all payments under the agreement should be dealt with by the Angolan Central Bank. This is valid for reasons of security and transparency, especially as Angola is still in a state of war."
"The Commission made a sound choice in concluding a protocol with only a one year duration because Angolan fish stocks have been exploited intensively over recent years, particularly by the Soviet fleet, which has led to a spectacular drop in catch levels."
"We have also heard that, as a result, licences will not be distributed to shipowners belonging to the EU."
"If we consider the repercussions of this, we could conclude that fishing in Angolan waters is a rather risky matter as far as the EU is concerned."
"Nevertheless, as the rapporteur says, we can be optimistic."
"The number of tuna vessels and surface longliners has increased."
"This is generally a reliable indicator of the state of deep-sea stocks, and so can be viewed positively."
"However, the Protocol does not contain any international standards regarding the conservation and rationing of fish stocks."
"Having a closed season is certainly an effective means of preserving fish stocks, and this has been borne out in practical and scientific terms."
"An international framework is necessary, however, otherwise the fear remains that Angola could abuse the close season to the detriment of the EU."
"The Commission has to ensure in this regard that shipowners are informed in good time, i.e. at least three months in advance."
"My conclusions are as follows: The negotiations are obviously important."
"The current political situation in Angola is deplorable, all the more so given the fact that it is fundamentally a potentially rich and geopolitically important country."
"What the Protocol lacks, however, is precise information on the state of fish stocks in Angola."
"The Committee on Fisheries has submitted the appropriate amendments so as to obtain this information."
"For this reason, we are not in a position to talk about a new fisheries agreement."
"The results of the negotiations should be supported however and should serve as a basis for a comprehensive Protocol or a new fisheries agreement in the future."
"In return, the rapporteur expects Angola to observe the interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and to improve its budgetary procedure in connection with financing the expenditure arising from this fisheries agreement, which is extremely important as far as we are concerned."
") Mr President, the current Protocol to the agreement with Angola, which lasts one year, is in reality an extension of the previous one, in the hope that conditions may improve so that the Agreement may be renewed within the traditional period of three years."
"We are in total agreement with this solution."
"On the one hand, it allows fishing to continue, within the framework of an agreement whose formulation has been generally satisfactory to both parties and which has presented no apparent problems."
"On the other hand, this Protocol provides a natural step towards the signing of the new agreement, which could be under threat given the political situation in the country and the possible presence of other fleets in the event that the European Union were absent from the area."
"Another piece of good news is the increase in fishing opportunities for the tuna fleet, whose number of ships has almost doubled, which indicates the more than healthy state of the fish resources in those waters."
"On the other hand, the maintenance of fishing relations with Angola is, at the moment, of great importance and the least the European Union can do is to help a country which is traditionally closely connected to certain Community areas and which is enduring worrying political and economic times."
"There is no doubt that financial compensation is an important form of support but, nevertheless, the presence of the European fleet contributes to a greater sense of stability in the area, which can only be beneficial to international relations with Angola."
"Furthermore, the presence of the Community brings a more responsible form of fishing to the area and may be an important factor in terms of balance given the presence of other fleets, particularly the Russian fleet, not to mention the aid to scientific research programmes which is included in this Protocol."
"For all these reasons, and in the hope that, as Mr Cunha' s report requests, the Commission will inform this Parliament of the result of the application of this Protocol, our group, Mr President, calls for the approval of the Cunha report."
"Mr President, the PSE group supports the Protocol which extends the fisheries agreement with Angola."
"Both Mrs Langenhagen and Mrs Fraga have summarised the content of this agreement."
"It has been pointed out that it is not a new agreement, but rather an extension of the previous agreement which, in reality, was signed in 1987 and which the Community inherited from a previous agreement between Spain and Angola."
"With regard to its importance, it is perhaps not one of the most important, but it is a useful agreement, both for the European Union and for Angola, as Mrs Fraga has highlighted."
"This type of agreement - as long as they conserve biological resources, that is, they do not lead to over-fishing - also benefits those countries in which such activity is carried out, both through the financial contribution of the European Union, and through the aid which is provided, for example, in the field of professional training and scientific research."
"I believe that the Commission is doing good work, but our main concern at the moment is the maintenance of fishing activity and, specifically, activity which does not lead to over-fishing, but rather the conservation of natural resources."
"The European Parliament, in the amendments which the Committee on Fisheries has presented, asks the Commission to pursue the matter, to inform Parliament and the Council, at least three months before the expiry of the agreement, so that its continuation may be ensured."
"Finally, Mr President, I would like to insist on the usefulness of the agreement, both for Angola and for the European Union, and we hope that the Commission will make the necessary effort so that this agreement may remain in force in the years to come."
"Mr President, yesterday we were urged to approve the renewal of the EU agreement with Morocco to give Spain and Portugal fishing rights in Moroccan waters."
"Today we are being asked to review a similar agreement with Angola."
"In my brief but eventful career as an MEP, and particularly after yesterday, I have noted a willingness of this Assembly which dares to call itself a ""parliament"" to act as a rubber stamp for the Commission and again I sense that this is our role."
"But if this Assembly is to begin to behave as a proper review body with any teeth it must begin to ask some fundamental questions about the whole principle behind these agreements."
"Such evidence as we have about their operation indicates that these have been responsible for conservation disasters of the first magnitude."
"Effectively, an example of colonialist exploitation of the peoples of the Third World which should shame everyone in our supposedly civilised one."
"In the past seven years the taxpayers of the European Union have paid out EUR 1.4 billion to the governments and elsewhere and, even in the neutral words of the Commission, it is difficult to trace where the money goes."
"Yet all this is to fund Spanish and Portuguese fishermen, giving them a licence to pillage Third World waters, often in flagrant disregard of the basic principles of fisheries conservation."
"We know from Morocco what despair this has aroused among local fishermen as they see immense damage being done to their fish stocks, simply to provide European markets with sardines and other common species on which their own livelihoods depend."
"The horror of what is happening down the west coast of Africa was illustrated a few years ago by Namibia."
"In the end it said it had had enough, so devastating was the impact of Spanish fishing there."
"It is about time that we in this House said that we have had enough of it all."
"The result of these policies has been a conservation disaster."
"In fact the whole thing, it seems to me, is an insane catastrophe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Cunha, on the report which he has carried out."
"I would like first of all to express my support for the Agreement and for the position held by the European Commission, as well as the opinion expressed by Mrs Langenhagen, Mrs Fraga and Mr Medina."
"And I absolutely and radically disagree with the position of the previous speaker who has demonstrated a policy which shows very little solidarity with the Member States of the European Union and the fishermen. This policy fortunately has minority support in this Parliament."
"With regard to this report, I would like to point out that the fisheries agreement with Angola means a continuation of the common fisheries policy of the European Union with regard to international fisheries agreements, which contribute to the consolidation of one of the fundamental pillars of said policy. This was pointed out by Mr Crampton' s report to this Parliament in the previous legislature, this report stating that these agreements were a fundamental condition in the effort to reduce the commercial deficit in the European Union in the field of fishing, in fish supply and in order to protect direct and indirect employment in the fishing sector and in the industries related to fishing in the European regions which are heavily dependent on it."
"This was approved here during the last legislature."
"In relation to the Cunha report on the conclusion of a new Protocol which defines the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the agreement with the Republic of Angola for the period from 3 May 1999 to 2 May 2000, I would like to point out that this is a classic Protocol, which allows for access to fishing resources during a certain period and sets a financial contribution."
"Despite the fact that certain information and statistics must be borne in mind, and the Commission has promised to be very strict about this, and also bearing in mind the delicate situation that that country is in - it is in a state of war - we believe that the conclusion of this provisional Protocol is very positive, in the hope that it will be renewed for a year or that a new agreement will be reached."
"This is a very important country geopolitically, with a very considerable potential wealth and which the European Union has to support, clearly helping it to put an end to the serious situation which it is in."
"But it must help in the best way possible for both parties: Angola, on the one hand, and the Member States of the European Union and the regions involved in fishing, on the other, with the control of this Parliament and in accordance with the amendments which the Committee on Fisheries has presented with regard to this important Agreement which has, as has just been pointed out here, a considerable political dimension, as well as economic and financial dimensions."
"Therefore, Commissioner, on this question and with regard to fisheries agreements in general, as was demonstrated yesterday in the important debate which we held in relation to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, you will always enjoy the favourable, generally majority, opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, and I hope that you will continue to enjoy the favourable opinion of this Parliament."
"Mr President, I am taking the floor in order to lend my support to the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Angola."
"I am doing so for economic reasons, which have already been explained by several speakers in this Chamber but, as in yesterday' s debate on the fisheries agreement between the European Union and Morocco, also in order to help a country that is rich in natural resources, but which remains poor due to its political situation, and particularly its on-going civil war."
"This is why I think it important to see this agreement, in addition to the economic benefits that it brings to one of our country' s industries, also as assisting the development of an economic sector, as well as the consolidation of peace in Angola."
"We agree that we must be vigilant in the way this agreement is implemented, specifically in the way funds are spent. Vigilance is also necessary in order to ensure the preservation of species and the sustainability of fishing."
"However, we would like to point out, Mr President, that although the words exploitation and cooperation have the same ending, there is quite a difference between them; cooperation means both parties cooperating when they are in agreement, and we do not believe that Angola sees any kind of exploitation in this agreement, otherwise they would not have renewed it the day after it expired."
"Commission. (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to give my heartfelt thanks to this Parliament, on behalf of the Commission, for its all in all positive assessment of the new Protocol to the fisheries agreement with Angola."
"Until tuna fishing is extended, this Protocol certainly assumes the potential catch quotas of the previous Protocol for the years 1996 to 1999 as well as the appendices thereto."
"It must also be emphasised, as a number of speakers have already said, that the Protocol is only valid for one year and more than half of this period has already lapsed in any case."
"This year, however, the Community and Angola will be able to redefine the future framework of their fishing relations, as has been proposed by Angola."
"We should therefore use this time."
"What the Community is paying Angola in return for the catching opportunities afforded under the Protocol and the contribution which Community shipowners pay in the form of duties have also remained at the same level as previously."
"The financial consideration therefore corresponds pro rata for one year to the sum established in the previous Protocol."
"As far as Parliament' s amendments are concerned, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to assure the Committee on Fisheries that the Commission, as has been the case in the past, will inform Parliament in the appropriate manner as regards the implementation of the Protocol."
"We should, however, choose the most suitable form for this."
"Commissioner, now that you have a new portfolio looking after fisheries you will discover that Parliament very often discusses fish on a Friday, but you have had a mixed menu this morning, for a change."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Explanation of vote"
"Mr President, I wholeheartedly endorse this excellent report by Mr Cunha as it brings very much to the fore the principle of sustainability which is necessary for a forward-looking fisheries policy."
"Angola is suffering under the consequences of the Soviet colonialism which plundered this country."
"I therefore consider the role of the European Union to be positive and important and also regard this fisheries agreement as being an integral part of our foreign and development policy."
"Mr President, to conclude, I would like to make one more personal observation: I am delighted that you have been chairing this sitting here today."
"That puts me in a more conciliatory frame of mind."
"I hope that one day you will be just as pleased to be the President of this Friday club as your predecessor, President Gutíerrez!"
"Thank you, Mr Posselt."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 29 October 1999."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to tell you how shocked I have been, as I know you have, by the tragedy that has taken place in the state of Orissa in eastern India, due to the terrible cyclone which, as you know, has caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people."
"More than 200,000 houses have been destroyed and more than one and a half million people are now homeless."
"I would simply like to express, on your behalf, and on behalf of the European Parliament, my sincere condolences to the victims' families. If you agree, I shall write to the Indian Prime Minister to send him our condolences."
"Furthermore, we shall be asking the Commission to implement an aid plan to address the most immediate and urgent needs."
"I was anxious to make this announcement to you."
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of Friday 29 October have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, last week Prime Minister Sarkisian and seven other leading politicians were murdered by terrorists in the Armenian Parliament."
"An expression of sympathy from us would be appropriate."
"In this context I would like to ask whether our own Security Service and the Belgian authorities are prepared for incidents of this kind."
"Mr Rübig, that was not at all relevant to the Agenda."
"Madam President, I would like to make an observation regarding Friday' s voting in Strasbourg."
"I think the fact that only forty MEPs voted on important issues on Friday has somewhat tarnished Parliament' s image."
"I am aware that it is not unusual for only a few MEPs to attend certain deliberations, but if voting is involved, then I think that this is extremely detrimental to the image of our Parliament."
"Forty MEPs voted on important matters."
"I know that quorum is not an issue - this is in line with the Rules of Procedure and there is nothing that can be done about that - but we should avoid this situation at all costs."
"I therefore wonder whether it might not be a good idea to refrain from scheduling any more votes for Friday in the future."
"Thank you, Mr Vander Taelen."
"I have noted your words and, on a personal level, I can tell you that I entirely share the feeling you have just expressed and I do indeed hope that there will be many more MEPs present at the Friday votes than are here now."
"We know that this is a longstanding problem, but of course we all share the same desire."
"Madam President, this is not really a point of order, but new events are constantly taking place, and I was obliged to take a decision on Friday because there was nobody who could answer my questions."
"On Friday morning, the Armenian Ambassador to the European Union, Mr Chitechian, invited me to attend the funerals last week of those murdered in the Armenian Parliament."
"Having checked to see whether I was able to attend, I then took the decision to attend these funerals and I tried to inform the Presidency and the Secretariat of my decision."
"Unfortunately, it was between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Friday afternoon and there was no-one I could speak to."
"So, I faxed you a letter to tell you that I would be attending in a personal capacity, but would nevertheless represent the European Parliament to some extent at these funerals."
"I was therefore present at the funerals and at the official ceremonies held in the memory of those murdered in Armenia."
"I wanted to inform you of this, Madam President."
"Thank you, Mrs Isler Béguin."
"You were quite right to do so."
"Madam President, I would like you to inform us as to whether there is any truth in the rumour that - and if this were to happen, I believe it would be disastrous for the information policy of the European Parliament - the press reports covering the part-sessions in all languages of the European Union are to be discontinued."
"These press reports have always been extremely useful as they reach a wide audience and make known in each language the activities of the MEPs speaking a particular language or from a particular national party. That is why it is something that we, if you like us older MEPs and Members of the previous European Parliament, are quite perturbed about."
"If this is the intention, then we would like to know."
"Mr Alavanos, I shall answer you straightaway."
"It is true that tonight, in the Bureau, we will be holding a debate on information policy."
"I can also tell you that I have no intention of discontinuing this report."
"I hope that the Members of the Bureau will follow me in this matter."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Agenda"
"The next item is the agenda."
"I have received two proposed amendments to the agenda; firstly, the communication by the Commission, which has been tabled as the first item on the agenda, and which was due to address the fight against discrimination."
"The Commission has informed us that contrary to what it had laid down, it is not able to adopt the proposals on the subject and therefore does not wish to make a communication on the matter."
"On the other hand, the Commission is quite prepared to make a statement on the situation regarding British beef and veal following the meeting of the Scientific Committee."
"I shall therefore ask you if you agree that the communication on discrimination that was tabled should be replaced by a communication on British beef and veal."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"We shall have a communication on British beef and veal then."
"A second problem now arises."
"Some of you have requested that this communication be followed by a debate and not by the question time that had been envisaged originally for the first communication."
"Madam President, on behalf of my group, I have requested that the communication proposed by the Commission concerning the case of British beef be followed by a debate."
"This is for various reasons."
"The first is that we are in the European Parliament and, last Friday, we held a debate without the Commission and without the report from the experts."
"During this debate I believe that Parliament, and certainly my group, tried to place the issue within its corresponding framework, that is, within our competences and duties as MEPs, towards our citizens."
"I believe that Friday' s debate, without the Commission and without the report of the experts, was a positive step because we are obliged to create confidence and offer responses to the people' s problems; we should not always become embroiled in debates amongst ourselves which may be very interesting but only when a joint approach is required."
"The second reason is that, in the past, and also very recently, this matter has lent itself to images which may have been amusing in some cases, such as the image of smuggling meat between two countries of the Community, but I do not think that we should re-awaken certain conflicts between our countries since this would seem a farce given the gravity of the issue."
"We therefore believe - and of course my group is prepared to do this - that it is important that the Commission should give an explanation and that we, in the debate, should express the positions that we have taken as groups."
"My group is prepared to do this and I believe that this would be more effective in restoring citizens' confidence, rather than holding a Question Time as we go along."
"Madam President, our Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats has called for us to follow the system that we always use and debate BSE on a 'catching the eye' basis."
"I must say, Mr Barón Crespo, that I am absolutely amazed that you are demanding an impromptu debate now."
"You criticised me last week when I called for the Napoletano report to be referred back, for quite understandable reasons as we saw it."
"You said that conflicted with the agreements."
"Fair enough, I had to accept that."
"This morning our group considered this afternoon' s discussion."
"Some Members in the group also felt that there should be a debate."
"The Members who called for that will recall that I said that we had no idea what the other groups' positions were."
"I said it would be unfair to demand a debate here, because we could prepare ourselves for the debate, whereas the other groups would be unprepared."
"Therefore, as a matter of principle, we are not in favour of having an ad hoc debate which this House is not prepared for."
"That is why I am in favour of sticking to the present procedure."
"Commissioner Byrne will make a statement to us, and we will then discuss it using the 'catching the eye' system and ask our questions."
"We should then deal with this serious topic at a later date in a very orderly and serious fashion, giving us the opportunity to conclude the debate with a resolution."
"But right now we are most definitely opposed to having a debate sprung on us under the ad hoc procedure!"
"(Applause from the PPE group)"
"Madam Speaker, I do not see much cause for drama here."
"I would like to think that we could organise a small debate."
"It goes without saying that it has not been possible to prepare this matter properly in the groups or at the Conference of Presidents, as the news of this resolution came so late."
"I really do not think this is much of a crisis; debate is a good thing, but the most important thing is that we get a chance to hear this announcement in the first place."
"It is very important that we have the opportunity to question the Commission on this sensitive issue and the issue between questioning and debate should not loom so large."
"We have a procedure and that is that we should proceed now to questioning in depth."
"Certainly in my group we have not prepared a list of speakers, nor do we wish to revert to that procedure at this moment."
"But we would welcome the opportunity to question the Commission in depth and eventually we can have with due process a reflective debate on the matter."
"We should not be discussing a sensitive question, such as this beef issue, on the hoof."
"Madam President, with regard to Rule 1 et seq, it seems very unfortunate to me to compare the rights of MEPs with the situation regarding British cattle."
"I believe they are unrelated."
"Mr Barón Crespo, are you standing by your request that we hold a debate and not a question time as usual?"
"I shall put this proposal to the vote, with a request for a vote by roll call."
"(Parliament rejected the proposal)"
"British beef and veal"
"Madam President, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to update Parliament on the developments over the past few days in relation to BSE."
"To begin with, I would like to update you on the opinion adopted unanimously by the Scientific Steering Committee last Friday."
"This opinion was on the scientific grounds of the advice of the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA) regarding the measures applicable to British beef exports."
"I arranged for the summary recommendations of the committee' s opinion to be issued to Parliament on Friday together with a copy of my statement to the press."
"Yesterday, I also arranged for the full copy of the report to be issued to you."
"However, you may not all have had time to digest their contents and I will, therefore, briefly summarise the main issues."
"The opinion addressed in particular three questions from the Commission. These questions can be summarised as follows:"
"Is there any new evidence in the documentation provided by AFSSA?"
"Is there a need to re-examine any of the four Scientific Steering Committee opinions directly related to the scientific rationale of the date-based export scheme?"
"Is the date-based export scheme satisfactory with regard to the safety of meat and meat products concerned?"
"In its opinion, the scientific steering committee confirmed that there is no need to review the decision to lift the ban on UK beef exports."
"Allow me to quote three of the more important conclusions of the committee:"
"""there is clear evidence of the continuing progressive decline in 1999 of BSE in the UK."
"There is no justification at present to infer any new route of infection"" ;"
"""the SSC concludes that there are currently no grounds for revising the overall conclusions of the SSC opinions directly related to the rationale of the DBES"" ; and, finally:"
"""the SSC considers that the measures taken by the UK make any risk to human health from the UK DBES at least comparable to that in other European Member States"" ."
"This followed a very thorough examination which focused on the concerns raised by the French authorities."
"I was greatly encouraged by the unanimous view of the Committee."
"It has provided the reassurance necessary that the DBES is sufficient to ensure that British beef exports are safe."
"And let me be very clear: I have always insisted that the opinion of the committee would be instrumental in determining the Commission' s handling of this dispute."
"I have gone on record several times, including in my hearings before Parliament, that my decisions on food safety will be science-based."
"My priority is to ensure that there is no threat to public health."
"Sound, independent and excellent scientific advice is essential in this respect."
"In this particular case, we now have scientific backing for the existing systems of controls."
"It is on this basis that I have called on the French and German authorities to take the committee' s opinion into account and lift their national restrictions on imports of British beef."
"As I said on Friday, these restrictions are no longer necessary in the light of the safeguards in place."
"However, we have to accept that this is a highly charged issue where we need to proceed cautiously."
"This is why I also insisted on Friday that everybody needs a few days to reflect on the full implications of the scientific committee' s opinion."
"My meeting last night with my French and British counterparts was held in this spirit: we need to discuss the best way forward to resolve this dispute."
"The French authorities have now requested clarification on five key points."
"Very briefly, they want further information on traceability, testing, derived products, controls and labelling."
"I do not consider this request for clarification to be unreasonable."
"Accordingly, a meeting of officials will take place this Friday to discuss the issues in question."
"Let me quote the very short communiqué agreed by all participants last night which agreed this strategy:"
"""We have drawn up a method to emerge from the crisis as quickly as possible by identifying five points - which I have already mentioned - worthy of being looked at by our experts over the next few days."
"Our experts will begin this work on Friday."
"We undertake this work in a constructive spirit and a common will to assure public health of our citizens"" ."
"I am very surprised at the reaction in the press to last night' s developments."
"It is not a setback."
"It is not a victory for France or a defeat for the UK."
"It is simply a further necessary stage in resolving this difficult issue."
"A few extra days in discussions is a very small price to pay for a successful conclusion."
"I need not add that the alternative - legal proceedings - would be a far longer and more painful process."
"Some additional reassurances or clarifications may be necessary to allow the French authorities to lift their restrictions on UK beef."
"However, that should not prove to be an insurmountable problem and it is in that spirit that discussions should continue."
"It is the clear implication of these discussions that the ban will be lifted."
"However, I would like to make very clear that there is no question of re-writing the date-based export scheme."
"It has been upheld by the scientific steering committee as a set of reliable safeguards to ensure that British beef exported under the scheme is safe."
"It does not need to be changed."
"Finally, I will continue to insist on a very quick solution."
"Let me remind you that today is the very first working day since the adoption of the scientific committee' s opinion."
"We have all worked long and hard over the past several days and these efforts will continue until we have found a solution."
"I will, of course, continue to keep Parliament fully informed of developments."
"Madam President, I should like to thank Commissioner Byrne for that statement."
"He has had rather a baptism of fire as a new Commissioner."
"Would he agree with me that the situation as regards beef has now tended, in the public eye, to throw into chaos the question of the acceptability of judgments delivered at the European level on food safety and that this bodes rather ill for Mr Prodi' s plan for a European food safety agency?"
"That is of great importance to my committee and will be of importance to this Parliament in the months to come."
"Specifically on the ban and the judgment of the Scientific Steering Committee, could he say why, if the judgment is so clear and unanimous, there is any need for further negotiation . . ."
". . . or should we call it clarification."
"The boundary between clarification and negotiation seems - at least from the other side of the Channel - to be somewhat blurred."
"Will he take action against France after the Commission meeting on 10 November if, by that stage, having had several days to digest the unanimous decision, the French Government has taken no action to lift this ban?"
"In answer to the first part of your question, Mrs Jackson, I believe that the very opposite is the case."
"Rather than throwing President Prodi' s plans for a food safety agency into chaos, it highlights the very need for such an agency at Community level."
"We are working on that very point in my service at the moment."
"Not only are we concerned to identify and establish its level of competence but also it would be of considerable importance to identify clearly and mark out the jurisdiction that the food safety agency would have at Community level and how it will interact with the agencies at Member State level."
"It will be important to identify where the function of one begins and ends and dovetails with the other."
"Once that has been clearly established, in my belief, the problem that we have seen over the last four or five weeks should not arise again."
"I should emphasise also that, what we are engaged in now, and the exercise that is going to be undertaken on Friday and the subsequent days is, as I have said, a clarification."
"It is not a negotiation."
"A negotiation implies that two parties come to a negotiating table, each with their own views, and something comes out of it at the end which reflects both their views."
"What we are engaged in here is an exercise in clarification of the five points that I have referred to."
"The French authorities have not unreasonably requested more information in relation to these very important issues."
"Most of them are a request for information as to how the date-based export scheme actually operates, both on a practical level and on a technical level."
"My service is perfectly happy and willing to give that information to the French authorities."
"Civil servants from the UK will also be involved."
"There are practical considerations involved in how the issue works on the ground which are necessary to explain."
"So I am perfectly satisfied that it is more accurate to refer to this exercise as a clarification."
"In the event that my statement that the clear implication of this exercise is that there will be a lifting of the ban turns out to be incorrect, then, as I have said from the very beginning when we first saw this issue on Friday 1 October, there would be the initiation of infringement proceedings."
"That remains my view."
"I have said on numerous occasions since then that court proceedings would be the last option."
"I believe it is much better to achieve a result by discussion with the parties so as to ensure that everybody understands what is involved."
"That is the exercise we are engaged in at the moment."
"In the event that does not yield results, then my view that it is appropriate to bring infringement proceedings will prevail."
"Madam President, Commissioner, do you agree with me that it really is astonishing that Member States are now seeking fresh explanations and clarifications when this has been the subject of discussions with the same Member States in the Standing Veterinary Committee for over a year and a half, and do you agree that Member States still imposing a ban on imports should present fresh scientific evidence, failing which it simply gives the impression that they want to push the internal market still further into some distant future?"
"Do you also agree with me that you should make it compulsory, immediately - or rather in the next four weeks - for those Member States and all others to universally apply the newly evaluated BSE tests."
"No doubt the two Member States who still have an import ban will support you in this!"
"Lastly, do you agree with me that even if there were - were, that is a subjunctive - if there were such an agency of the kind that Mr Prodi would like and which has not yet been fully discussed in this House, even if that were the case, a situation like this could recur again and again? The reason being, of course, that there would still be national agencies that could, at any time, claim that there was new scientific evidence."
"Would you therefore agree that your hope that a European agency could avoid such a situation is quite simply an illusion?"
"Not a lot astonishes me nowadays."
"I believe, however, the clarifications that are asked for by the French authorities are not unreasonable."
"They are related to the date-based export scheme itself."
"They are related to five topics: traceability, further testing, issues surrounding derived products, further information relating to controls, inspection and controls by the Food and Veterinary Office on the single plant that exists in Truro, in Devon, which slaughters and exports this product, and finally, on the issue of labelling."
"In relation to the labelling issue, there is EU-wide legislation in draft at the moment, intended to be implemented by 1 January 2000."
"Those provisions have been put back for one year because Member States had not completed the preparatory work to enable the legislation to be implemented."
"In the meantime, the UK authorities have in place their own beef assurance scheme labelling system and have indicated that this labelling system, on a voluntary basis, would operate in respect of exports to France and elsewhere."
"That, I should stress, is being operated on a voluntary basis."
"It is not being legislated for at EU level."
"I would not have the competence nor the desire to do that."
"As a transitional measure, pending the final implementation of the EU-wide labelling system, this proposal has been put forward by the UK on a voluntary basis and will operate in that way."
"I agree fully with what you say, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, that there is no new scientific evidence being put forward by the French authorities."
"That was confirmed by the Scientific Steering Committee last week."
"There was up-to-date information but no new evidence to change the opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee."
"In relation to the agency I can only refer you to the answer that I gave to Mrs Jackson that my belief is that the establishment of a centralised Commission level food safety authority will go a considerable distance to eliminating these kinds of difficulties."
"There may be teething problems along the way but it will be the challenge of all of us involved in establishing the legislation for that agency to ensure that the competences of each of the various institutions - whether they be at Community level or at Member State level - properly interact and that each side knows exactly where their competence begins and ends."
"In those circumstances one is in a position to bring more certainty, rather than less, into the situation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, together with the Scientific Committee, you have taken responsibility for the consumer and I believe that I myself was one of those who have experienced this crisis at first hand and I have always monitored the work of the Scientific Committees."
"But I think that we must be particularly vigilant as regards the identification of cattle in the different countries of the Community."
"Of course you have answered one concern in terms of labelling and traceability, and I beg you to do the same, especially in terms of complete transparency throughout the Community on the whole beef and veal sector, whose past we are all familiar with."
"So what different control systems are available to you across the Community and how far have you got with the various tests, particularly the BSE test which has been accepted by the Commission?"
"There are, at present, four BSE tests, three of them of the very highest reliability and the fourth one quite reliable."
"They are post-mortem tests."
"Further work is on-going to try and achieve a situation whereby these tests, or a development of these tests, might well be used in a pre-clinical situation."
"We have not reached that stage yet but it is the hope that we will."
"Work is on-going in relation to that at the moment."
"Tests are being undertaken as we speak."
"The control systems that are in place - the inspections and controls - are undertaken by the Food and Veterinary Office in respect of the DBES scheme."
"That office has conducted two tests in the last six months."
"Certainly the last one was as recently as the first week in October."
"Whereas I have not yet got a written report from that particular inspection, I have a verbal report to the effect that the findings are satisfactory."
"Madam President, Truro is in Cornwall, not in Devon."
"Can you give assurances that France is not just playing for time?"
"With the Scientific Committee having ruled on Friday that British beef is safe, it seems incredible that we have this further delay."
"I believe it is probably just a face-saving exercise on behalf of France."
"I am sorry that the Agriculture Minister, Mr Brown, seemed to cave in."
"Whatever the reasons for it, it does not help consumer confidence."
"We need to make sure the ban is lifted as soon as possible."
"Can the Commissioner give assurances that it will be lifted in the foreseeable future?"
"Last Friday he mentioned a two week time span."
"Can he tell us now what he feels the time span should be for the lifting of the ban by France?"
"Thank you, first of all, for your correction in relation to the location of Truro."
"I am, as best I can be, satisfied that the French authorities are not playing for time."
"They have asked for these clarifications."
"I believe these requests are not unreasonable."
"I believe my civil servants and those in the UK can reply and give the information that is necessary."
"This can be done within a matter of days."
"In relation to the delay, I should like to point out that the Scientific Steering Committee' s report was delivered on Friday night."
"This is the first working day since then so it does not seem to me that there has been much evidence of a delay in the meantime."
"In relation to Mr Brown, he and I have discussed this issue on a number of occasions over the last two weeks or more."
"I have found in my dealings with him a determination on his part to resolve this difficulty as speedily and satisfactorily as possible."
"You have raised the issue in terms of him having caved in, but that is far from the true position."
"He has dedicated himself to this in negotiations with me and then with Minister Glavany most assiduously."
"In my opinion the views and position that were adopted last night were the intelligent, rational, reasonable approach to adopt to this situation and, in my view, is far from a cave-in."
"I hope that my judgment in this will prove to be right and that within the next ten days or so we will have a final resolution to this particular problem."
"Commissioner, I think - and this is not because I am French - that we must put this Franco-British squabble behind us."
"We already had occasion to say so on Friday and I think that the work being done by the Agriculture Ministers shows that it is crucial to find a compromise that is acceptable to everyone and not only to us, the MEPs who are rather trailing behind the news, but especially to consumers."
"If there is a problem today and French specialists have recommended that this ban should not be lifted, this means that there are some serious questions to be asked."
"Personally I am trying to put myself in the shoes of consumers who must by now have an idea of the situation."
"On the one hand you have a French food safety agency which says that there are in fact risks, and on the other, experts who tell us unanimously that there is no problem at all."
"Personally, this raises serious questions in my mind."
"I have read in the press that there are only three prion specialists on the Scientific Committee."
"I therefore turn to you, Commissioner, in order to find out if these three prion specialists really abstained, in which case those who voted unanimously were not prion specialists and we would then be able to understand why the proposals, the compromises and the supplementary questions tabled by France have been accepted."
"Like you, I am also concerned as to the protection of consumers."
"That is part of the brief that I have been asked to undertake."
"I have noticed with interest and already welcomed the statement made by the French Minister for Trade and Consumer Protection, Mrs Lebranchu, who referred to the unanimous report of the Scientific Steering Committee over the weekend saying it would provide a reassurance to consumers."
"I welcome her statement in that regard."
"There has been a little confusion in relation to the interaction between the Ad Hoc Committee and the Scientific Steering Committee."
"I should like to shed some light on that at this stage, having been given the opportunity to do so by the last question."
"The Ad Hoc Committee is made up of experts on BSE."
"They met last Monday for the second time."
"On the previous occasion they were given the evidence from the French authority, which I had asked the French authorities to provide."
"They also asked for up-to-date information from the UK."
"They got that information also."
"They then met last Monday, considered all of that, applied their own experience to it and produced a report which, in effect, recited all of the issues involved and the aspects, dangers, risks and the pros and cons of the arguments relating to BSE."
"There was no vote taken by that committee."
"It is not their function to do so."
"It is an advisory ad hoc group that feeds into the legally established committee, established to carry out the function of advising the Commission in relation to these matters - that is, the Scientific Steering Committee."
"It is that committee that took the vote and it is that committee that was unanimous in its view, having reviewed all of the information that was contained in the Ad Hoc Group' s report and some other documents that were supplied by the Ad Hoc Group and obviously applying their own scientific knowledge."
"These sixteen scientists are drawn from most of the Member States."
"They are vets and scientists of the very highest calibre, at the pinnacle of their careers, people of the very highest reputation."
"They formed their view - which we now know - which was expressed unanimously."
"So there is not any confusion or contradiction between any ad hoc view and the Scientific Steering Committee."
"That is the genesis of how the decision-making process actually takes place and the interaction between the Ad Hoc Committee and the Scientific Steering Committee."
"Madam President, Commissioner, do you think it is right that at the very point the export ban is being lifted - and there is no doubt that we belong to a legal community - earlier decisions about labelling and identification should be deferred?"
"Do you think that these are confidence-building measures?"
"My second point is this: what is your opinion about the fact that we have different measures in place within the Union for combating scrapie and BSE?"
"As a matter of principle, would the correct approach not be to eliminate and cull all herds infected with BSE in the case of incidences of BSE in all Member States, and would this not have been the correct approach right from the beginning as a means of preventative consumer protection?"
"In relation to the issue you raise about scrapie in sheep and BSE, whereas they are similar diseases they are quite different in their forms of transmission and so on."
"One cannot readily extrapolate from information available in relation to scrapie directly across to BSE."
"It is informative but it does not directly extrapolate one from the other."
"I believe the issue relating to labelling is an issue that builds consumer confidence."
"I have spoken about this on a number of occasions, including at my hearing in September, that the provision of information to consumers must be the very first stop in any armoury of a Commissioner charged with consumer protection."
"The provision of labelling obviously provides information."
"I regard this as a good way forward."
"Madam President, Commissioner, please give me a straight yes or no answer. Have there been more than forty fatal cases of atypical Creutzfeldt-Jakob due to mad cow disease, that is, a zoonosis?"
"Commissioner, did or did not the European Parliament' s Committee on Agriculture receive a draft directive one month ago saying that until 2003, we would not be able to show the cattle' s provenance on the label?"
"Commissioner, in what way is the scientific competence of the members of the Scientific Steering Committee superior to that of the German scientists, of the Scottish scientists and of the French scientists who tell you that there is a risk of zoonosis."
"Commissioner, who chooses the members of the Scientific Steering Committee?"
"How are they chosen?"
"How independent are they?"
"Commissioner, how do you explain the fact that for seven years, two MEPs, the Belgian Socialist José Happart and myself said here, between September 1989 and March 1996, that there was a risk of zoonosis before the British Minister for agriculture admitted it on 24 March 1996 in the House of Commons?"
"What good is the precautionary principle, Commissioner, when, if there is any doubt, we do not refrain from selling cattle that are still suspect?"
"And finally, Commissioner, are you still prepared to say to the country of Fleming and Newton that Galileo was wrong to say that the earth turns, when the university and the Scientific Steering Committee say that the earth does not turn?"
"My information is that there have been more than forty cases diagnosed of new variant CJD."
"In relation to the provenance of animals from labeling, you are correct to the extent that the legislative regime that is to be established at Community level will ultimately provide that products which are imported from another Member State will identify that it is of EU origin rather than from a Member State origin."
"What is happening in this situation is that on a voluntary basis the UK propose to keep on their beef the labelling that they have put in place under their beef assurance scheme."
"It is a purely voluntary aspect and it is not governed by legislation at EU level."
"I should say that I am absolutely satisfied as to the competence of the Scientific Steering Committee."
"It is made up of the chairmen of the eight scientific committees dealing with such issues as food, toxicology and other issues, and then eight others who were selected and appointed by the Commission."
"They are, let me emphasise, absolutely and completely independent."
"The Commission cannot tell them what to do, either in relation to the substance of their reports or indeed as to their timing."
"In relation to your reference to the Scottish scientists and so on, my understanding is that this issue relates solely to beef on the bone which is not part of the DBES scheme."
"I am not at all convinced that anything that the Scottish scientists have said on that issue is relevant to exportation from the UK under the DBES."
"In relation to your question on the precautionary principle, this is derived from a concept that was first laid down in the environment field."
"It lays down the basis on which the precautionary principle will be applied."
"It is quite specific in the way it says that it should be applied and one of the specific aspects is that there has to be an absence of scientific evidence in relation to a particular danger, or serious doubt as to the scientific evidence."
"We have a unanimous report from the best scientists and vets in the European Union available to the Commission and they have expressed their view that the British beef exported under the DBES scheme is as safe as any other beef in Europe."
"In those circumstances it is not appropriate to apply the precautionary principle."
"Commissioner, would you agree that it is of paramount importance that we have a European solution to this problem and would you accept our congratulations that you have put your best efforts towards that in the events over the weekend."
"Nevertheless, would you not agree that since the unanimous confirmation of the safety of the date-based export scheme, provided you personally endorse it in this House, as I hope you will, there is a very limited area for clarification of what more can be done."
"Would you not accept that some of the issues now raised by the technical experts - and I particularly refer here to labelling, to improved diagnostic tests and so on - are incremental improvements in safety measures for Europe as a whole."
"They are not a replacement or a supplement needed for the date-based export scheme."
"If that is the case, would you not further agree that the debate about the safety of British beef ought to be concluded by 10 November next and on Wednesday, if the Commission has no word on that matter, will you bring forward, regrettable as they are, the legal proceedings which are then overdue?"
"Mr Whitehead, thank you for those kind words."
"I agree with you that it is of paramount importance that this issue be resolved at European level for the reasons that I identified earlier."
"It is important for a number of reasons, not least consumer confidence, and it is to that end that I am trying to resolve this issue as I am sure also Minister Glavany and Minister Brown are doing."
"In relation to the date-based export scheme, of course I endorse it."
"I welcome the opportunity, in response to your question, to do so again."
"You may have noted I did so earlier and I have done so on a number of occasions."
"Let me repeat that it is not my intention to put forward any legislation to amend the date-based export scheme which itself is the subject of legislation."
"It is not my intention to do that and I have made that situation clear over the weekend on a number of occasions and I did so again yesterday."
"These improvements, as you describe them, are incremental."
"Some of them are not related to the application of the date-based export scheme but I have to say that some of them probably are, particularly in relation to the issue for instance of traceability, to the issues surrounding derived products."
"Some further information was requested as to how exactly the derived products scheme would operate under the DBES."
"Of course I am perfectly happy to give a clarification in relation to that but I should remind you of something that I am sure you are aware of: there is no exportation of processed beef under the DBES from the UK because it is necessary first to identify and approve a plant for that purpose and no such plant has been proposed by the UK authorities."
"Therefore there is no exportation of derived products under the DBES scheme but it may happen and in the event that it does, questions were asked of me yesterday to clarify exactly how it would work, how products might be segregated and so on. These are not unreasonable questions which I feel perfectly happy to answer over the next few days."
"In relation to when this should take place, the meeting is taking place on Friday, I would hope that it would conclude its deliberations and its explanations on Friday."
"There may be other meetings next week."
"I suspect that the French authorities may well have a further discussion with their food safety authority and I would expect a response from them certainly no later than Thursday of next week."
"I would then be in a position to first of all give an up-date to the Commission next Wednesday and give a final conclusive version on the following Tuesday at the Commission meeting in Strasbourg."
"It may all happen earlier."
"If it does, so much the better."
"If it does not, on Tuesday week I will be bringing a report to the Commission."
"In my innocence and naivety I thought that when the scientific steering committee met last week and made their announcement, indeed the announcement was made by Mr Pascale, himself a Frenchman as President of that committee, indicating the unanimous approval of that committee that British beef is as safe as any other beef in the EU or possibly safer than any beef worldwide, that was the top of the pyramid."
"I did not think you could go any higher than that."
"Now we are told by Mr Byrne that we need just a few extra days of discussions."
"Well, it appears to me that we have had three months since 1 August in which the French and the Germans have defied EU law."
"Are you now telling me Mr Byrne that during those three months when a vast dossier was prepared by the French food safety agency that they did not examine the technical implications embracing traceability, testing, derived products, controls and labelling?"
"Are you telling me that only now at this last minute after the scientific steering committee has made its unanimous pronouncement they want further technical clarification of those points?"
"It seems ludicrous."
"What exactly are they asking for?"
"We heard Mr Martinez questioning the competence of the Scientific Steering Committee."
"Is Mr Martinez aware, and are you Commissioner aware, of the fact that the AFSSA, the French food safety agency, has an annual budget of EUR 52 million and has a board of governors of whom 50% are appointed by the French government, the other 50% representing farmers, food retailers and food distributors?"
"So let us ask some questions about their competence."
"We were assured at the highest level in Paris that this matter was not being driven by protectionism but was being driven purely by science."
"This smacks to me of pure commercial protectionism and now it has been exposed."
"Are you aware this is the way that the AFSSA is being driven, Mr Byrne?"
"(Applause from the PPE group)"
"I am glad of the opportunity to reiterate my view that the Scientific Steering Committee is, as you describe it, the top of the pyramid."
"They are the best available I rely on their advice, there is no doubt in my mind, and I am not in any way challenging their view."
"However, I should say that the issues that have been raised by the French authorities in requesting some clarification of the issues that they have identified seem to me quite reasonable."
"I have referred to some of them earlier in the answers that I have given, particularly to Mr Whitehead."
"They seem to me to be not unreasonable and therefore I think it correct to take this opportunity over the next few days to clarify these issues so as to avoid having to go to litigation in the European Court of Justice."
"That seems to me to be the sensible and the quickest way forward."
"In the event that we do not achieve a result along the lines that I envisage then, of course, that option is open and will be looked at in a short space of time, but I believe that the course of action which I have identified as being appropriate, and that others have agreed with me is appropriate, including my colleagues in the Commission this morning, is the appropriate way forward and I intend to pursue that line at least for another number of days."
"Thank you, Mr Byrne."
"The use of my gavel was not aimed at you but at an MEP who was trying to interrupt you."
"Madam President."
"(Heckling by Mr Martinez)"
"Oh, just shut your trap!"
"Commissioner, I believe that as long as we do not have consistent labelling, we will never be free of disputes about BSE in this House and in Europe in general."
"The fact that you are now telling us that compulsory labelling going back to animals' place of birth will not be implemented until 2003 - Mr Böge has already touched on this - well, in my opinion that is partly to blame for this whole cankerous BSE crisis."
"Now that the legal basis has changed - and that is the reason why we have this new regulation now - so that this is no longer to be dealt with under Article 37, that is by means of consultation, but under Article 152, under the co-decision procedure - we in this House damned well have a duty to bring this deadline forward from 2003!"
"Yes, that is our duty, and my question to you is this: you said that you would put pressure on these countries concerning this issue, which is to be the subject of a decision in the next few days."
"I would like to know what scope the Commission has for exerting pressure so that these Member States bring in consistent labelling and identification of bovine animals before 2003?"
"If that could be done as quickly as possible, we in this House would not have to worry about BSE any more!"
"Proposals in relation to labelling are before Parliament, as you say, under Article 152 which is a co-decision procedure and you are correct to say that those labelling provisions provide for information in relation to the animal from birth so that thorough labelling arrangements are a valuable tool."
"They provide information but they will not, of course, provide absolute guarantees in relation to public health but they at the very least provide information."
"Other procedures have to be put in place, which we have put in place, and we are examining so as to ensure public health safety and I am talking now in particular about the DBES scheme itself."
"But yes, I agree with Mr Goepel, that the labelling issue is an important issue, it is before Parliament and we will obviously have an opportunity to discuss that in the future."
"Commissioner, throughout the crisis of the last few days, the Commission has, on several occasions, adopted a position in favour of a European food safety agency."
"As far as this agency is concerned, it could take one of two forms."
"The one that I find quite positive would consist of creating an authority formed by a group of European experts without detracting from the decision-making power of national states on the fundamental issues which are the closest to citizens' concerns. There is quite another concept which I feel is much more negative and this consists of establishing an additional feature which would take away a nation' s right to safeguard themselves, a right which is nevertheless inalienable."
"This form would, because the Commission seems unable to act in any other way, immediately prioritise the free movement of goods over consumers' health, as we have just seen in the business of the ban on British beef and veal where, Madam President, we should really wait until the tests are available."
"Furthermore, this leads us to the following extraordinary conclusion that the precautionary principle is not being applied within the European Union, when we are trying to make it prevail in relations with third countries, particularly with the United States."
"Well, Commissioner, what form would you choose for the food agency; one which takes a flexible and liberal approach towards countries, or one which takes an authoritarian approach towards countries?"
"Yes, as I said earlier, I am in favour of the establishment of a European food safety authority and the work is on-going in my service in relation to this."
"I have had a number of discussions with colleagues and with Members of Parliament also in relation to this on an informal basis."
"So work is proceeding on this issue."
"No final decisions of course have been taken and, as I said to you a moment ago, the constitutional structure of that authority has yet to be decided and how it would interact with the other institutions of the European Union and with the national food safety agencies of Member States."
"It also has to be carefully choreographed because we want to rule out any difficulties like the ones we are faced with at the moment."
"However, we have to be careful about, as you say, the removal of Member States' inalienable rights because any interference with the Member States' rights may very well encroach upon the rights of Member States' , thereby requiring Treaty changes."
"I am not sure that we want at this stage to move quite that far."
"I am not ruling that out, but I want you to understand that in addressing your question in that way you should be aware that for progress to be made in that particular area, if it is intended to reduce the jurisdiction or the rights of Member States, Treaty changes would be necessary."
"Let me just finally address the issue of the precautionary principle you mentioned."
"I have mentioned the precautionary principle in the context of imports from the United States and I am sure you are referring to beef and hormone-treated beef."
"I have referred to that in this House and I have referred to that in the Environment Committee on a number of occasions."
"I have to point out to you that the advice that I am receiving from the scientists in the European Commission is that the beef imported from the United States contains the hormone 17-beta-oestradiol."
"I am advised that is a complete carcinogen."
"In those circumstances, it is appropriate to apply the scientific evidence rather than the precautionary principle because with clear scientific evidence, it is open to me and the Commission to make a decision based on that scientific evidence."
"It is only in the absence of scientific evidence, or where there is a clear uncertainty in relation to scientific evidence, that the precautionary principle comes into play."
"So that is why we do not apply the precautionary principle to the hormone issue on the importation of beef from the United States."
"What British farmers, and in particular farmers in the English West Midlands region that I represent, are looking for is a speedy resolution to this particular problem."
"The scientific committee has clearly demonstrated its belief that British beef is as safe as any other beef anywhere in the European Union and under those circumstances I am sure that the Commissioner would agree with me that a delay of perhaps another few days only is better than two or three years going through courts which ultimately frustrates everybody, satisfies nobody and in particular does not satisfy British farmers who have followed the rule of law, have done what has been asked of them and are now in a position to sell an excellent product throughout the whole of the European Union."
"What I would like the Commissioner to go through just one more time again here now for total clarity is his belief that this delay will only be a few days and that at the very latest he envisages this process being completed by the Tuesday of the Strasbourg session, and preferably before."
"Let me say to you that I have met Mr Ben Gill of the National Farmers' Union on a number of occasions, I have spoken to him on the telephone and I have seen what he has had to say on the subject over the last couple of days and in particular overnight."
"I have kept in close contact with him and I can assure you I am conscious of the problems that this issue poses for farmers in the UK."
"I fully agree with you when you say that a delay of a number of days, if it achieves a resolution of this difficult problem, is by far the better solution, rather than embarking upon litigation in the European Court of Justice."
"I also further confirm to you, and repeat what I said earlier, I hope to bring a final report on this issue to the Commission no later than Tuesday week in Strasbourg."
"Thank you for addressing us so clearly."
"I just wonder whether or not, having listened to all the debates, you are actually totally and utterly aware of the devastating effect of this decision on UK farmers."
"You have said already quite clearly that the standing committee on scientific evidence is the highest authority."
"Mrs Jackson asked you as the very first question if we have another committee to look at our food safety across the European Union will that actually be better than the present standing committee and will people take any notice of it."
"It appears to me that they have not taken any notice of it."
"You actually argued almost to the contrary that in actual fact the standing committee on scientific evidence is probably not as good as a food agency."
"British farmers are suffering as a result of indecision."
"It is about time the decision was ratified."
"The previous speaker said in a few days; it was actually in August the decision was taken."
"How many more days do we need to have a decision?"
"Can I also ask you: there is a practice within Member States, or some Member States, to feed what I would call banned substances to some of their beef cattle."
"Is the scientific committee and the Commission going to look at that?"
"Or are we going to continue with a situation where the press are just going to use it to attack Member States?"
"Commissioner, all I say to you is that British farmers, the European Union and agriculture are suffering as a result of indecision."
"We want to see the decision taken on Friday evening, not waiting until Strasbourg."
"There is no more scientific evidence."
"Did the French sign up to the Florence agreement?"
"Has the United Kingdom met all the conditions that were laid down in that agreement?"
"Why has a decision not been taken immediately?"
"(Applause from the PPE group)"
"I am totally aware of the problems that all this has caused for British farmers."
"This issue has been going on for a long time now, long before I came to the Commission."
"The decision that was taken by the French authorities on 1 October is a decision that has had to be dealt with as best one can in the meantime."
"Since then the one feature that can be pointed to is that there has not been any indecision on the part of the Commission or on the part of those who are involved in trying to resolve this difficult issue."
"I have said on a number of occasions - and I have said it again here today - that I believe that the application of steady diplomacy, cool heads with firm determination, will make more progress than knee-jerk reactions resulting in the Commission ending up in the Court of Justice in Luxembourg two years hence."
"It will not do the farmers of the UK any good, in my view, if the ban remains in place in the intervening two-year period."
"I am firmly convinced that the view I take, the line that I have adopted, the decisions that I have made, reinforced by my colleagues in the Commission this morning, are the correct decision."
"I look forward to a speedy resolution of this issue."
"I have mentioned on a number of occasions over the last weekend in various interviews that it is my firm wish that this matter be resolved quickly and diplomatically."
"Sometimes it is difficult to achieve both of those at the same time."
"That is what I am trying to do."
"That is what I am trying to achieve."
"Allowing me a week until Tuesday to do that is not unreasonable."
"To bring this debate to a close, Commissioner, I think that it would be useful to let the matter lie."
"For much of the debate, I have had the impression that a kind of war was being fought to see whether it would be Great Britain or France who would lose face."
"I think that that is not what the issue - or the debate - is about, but it does affect the following question in a major way: what is being proposed for European consumers as a whole?"
"British consumers, just like French and Spanish consumers, have the right to know what they are eating and from this point of view, I consider labelling and traceability to be both unavoidable and essential."
"But, Commissioner, should it not be pointed out that the source of the whole business, geographically speaking, is Great Britain."
"Excuse me for saying so, but that is where the first cases of BSE occurred."
"And why was that?"
"Because there is a farming system there that is particularly geared towards high productivity, because there more than anywhere else, farmers are sacrificed at the altar of the food-processing industry and because instead of crying over British farmers, we would do better to help them to achieve sound means of production, more appropriate means of production."
"This is something they have already begun to do. I would not want to forget to mention the fact that at the worst moments of this mad cow crisis, the Welsh and the Scots, who have continued to maintain more traditional farming methods, have been punished in the same way as English producers."
"Therefore, Commissioner, please tell me what financial resources will be released to pay for traceability, for the slaughter of whole herds in which there is a single case of BSE, for cases of cattle plague, because that is the only way we will be able to reassure consumers."
"I also think that from this point of view, every European country needs to stop repeating the words ""precautionary principle"" , as we have done for years, whilst continuing to practise the same frenzied methods of high productivity, and to highlight two or three rather limited examples in order to exercise their rights."
"Well, Commissioner, what resources will this agency be given?"
"I fully agree with you when you say this is not an issue of losing face or winners and losers."
"The characterisation of this difficult matter in those terms is quite unhelpful."
"Also, those who address it in that way do not give full justice to the seriousness of the problem."
"I also agree with you that assurance for consumers is of paramount importance."
"It is the DBES scheme which has been devised by the Commission with the advice of the scientists which, in my opinion and the opinion of those scientists who advise the Commission in these matters, will give that assurance to consumers."
"I also agree with you that it is extremely valuable to have labelling and traceability."
"In relation to the labelling issue, you have asked me what will be put in place at Community level in the legislation regarding labelling."
"From 2003, all beef will be labelled with place of birth, place of fattening, place of slaughter, breed and age of the animal."
"It is not possible to provide this labelling and information at present because the Member States have not yet provided the information for that to happen."
"But it is being addressed and that will be the situation from that date."
"Again, I should like to emphasise the importance that I attach to this entire issue in terms of consumer confidence and, in particular, the issue of public health."
"It is my intention to take this into account over the next number of days in the on-going discussions."
"Thank you, Commissioner Byrne."
"This item on the agenda is now closed."
"Before we continue with the agenda, I would like to point out that tomorrow morning, the reports by Mr Hughes and Mrs Smet will be debated together, as that is what the rapporteurs wanted and everyone agreed to do."
"Macroeconomic dialogue"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the macroeconomic dialogue in order to encourage growth and employment (Cologne process)."
"Madam Speaker, Members of the European Parliament, may I first say how pleased I am to have the opportunity to come here to meet you and especially to be allowed to contribute my views to the macroeconomic dialogue, which is only just beginning."
"It is thus a new process."
"The adoption of a single currency in Europe has increased the need for dialogue on economic policy."
"Both the ECOFIN Council and the presidents for the euro area have seen evidence of this in their work."
"In order for the euro to quickly acquire the weight it deserves, not only as part of the international economy but also in discussions concerning the economic policy of the Union area, the common points of view on economic policy in the euro area in particular must be explored in more depth."
"The European Council in Helsinki is expecting a report from the ECOFIN Council on the development of coordination with respect to economic policy, which again will help to step up this debate."
"The economic and monetary union opens many new possibilities for Europe."
"We must seize this opportunity and do everything possible to safeguard economic growth and employment development."
"The best way to do this is to ensure that the benefits of a single currency and a single market are fully exploited."
"The economic and monetary union means a new beginning for Europe, both in terms of entrepreneurship and of economic policy."
"The European Employment Pact, which was signed last summer at the European Council at Cologne on the initiative of Germany, is an initiative which will promote mutual understanding and a reform of the European economies."
"The macroeconomic dialogue is part of the European Employment Pact."
"The implementation of this Pact begins with the organisation of the first macroeconomic dialogue, which will take place on Monday next week at the meeting of the ECOFIN Council."
"For the first time, all the prime movers at Union level will be seated at the same table: representatives of the Council, of the Commission, of the European Central Bank and of the parties in the labour market."
"Until now we have met up with representatives of the parties in the labour market twice a year, and been engaged in a separate dialogue with the ECB."
"Now we are coming together at the same event."
"The participation of the ECB is a significant feature of this."
"It is a clear indication that the bank is prepared, for its own part, to be involved in open and direct discussions, and to justify its reasoning and its actions."
"It is important to recognise the main principles of dialogue."
"They ensure that the independence and autonomy of the parties involved are respected."
"The dialogue will be based on confidentiality, which means that there is no intention of issuing joint conclusions or passing joint resolutions."
"The time will be used for discussions."
"There will be no public report on the discussions: each side will report to their own quarter on the content of the meeting."
"We may question the usefulness of the parties having confidential talks behind closed doors."
"The answer is that this dialogue is primarily aimed at generating an understanding of the fundamental principles of economic policy."
"It complements - but by no means excludes - public debate on economic policy, which takes place in any case."
"It is a lot easier to begin discussions on the basis of a common viewpoint and a joint analysis of the situation."
"It is not possible, of course, to arrive at anything as concrete as this at European level, nor is there reason to talk about negotiations or coordination."
"Even so, we believe that the dialogue will make a positive contribution to the climate of debate surrounding the issue of economic policy."
"In Finland, the responsibility for dialogue on a political level lies with the Economics Council, whose duties and objectives are of a general and unofficial nature."
"We have found how beneficial it is to maintain contact through discussions, especially in difficult times."
"These discussions have concerned matters of principle regarding social and economic development."
"Similar practices exist in several countries."
"National experience and procedures, of course, are not directly transferable to European level but there is plenty to do at that level, too."
"Macroeconomic dialogue at European level cannot take the place of national dialogue, either."
"We need both."
"We just have to find the right content and form for the dialogue at European level."
"In our presidential capacity, we have also wanted to make sure that this dialogue works."
"It is for this reason that all 15 Member States are not present, only the representatives of the Council."
"This, too, is significant. The debate should not focus on the situation and problems of individual countries - the matters on the agenda concern the whole area, a joint area of responsibility."
"This provides significant parameters and policy guidelines."
"The participants in this dialogue were specified in the conclusions of the European Council at Cologne, and it was declared that the limited number of participants would ensure the success of the dialogue."
"Naturally, we have acted accordingly."
"The conclusions of Cologne also emphasised the fact that the macroeconomic dialogue is perceived as a sustainable and on-going process."
"For this reason, in its arrangements, Finland has wanted to look ahead with an emphasis, above all, on continuity."
"Therefore, future presidents of the Council will also be taking part in the meeting, whose tasks it will be to develop and further deepen the dialogue."
"The dialogue is not about coordinating economic policies; it is linked with those current challenges which concern the development of economic policy cooperation."
"Much of the decision making that has an impact on economic development and employment still takes place within the Member States despite the introduction of the economic and monetary union."
"Above all, it is a question of budgetary policy and determination of wages."
"Can we be sure that the conditions and demands created by economic and monetary policy have been internalised?"
"From the point of view of individual Member States, there is a risk, not of inflation, but of excessive nominal pay increases, which will lead to a sharp decline in competitiveness and profitability in business and, consequently, to job losses."
"Still, there is no reason to paint such a sombre picture."
"It is, however, vital that those who make decisions on economic policy - especially on monetary policy - can feel confident."
"That is why we need dialogue and reassuring signals, just as we need the decision makers to act swiftly and decisively in potential problem situations."
"This is a positive way of promoting the prospects of an economic policy which favours economic growth and employment."
"As part of the dialogue, we also have to improve the statistics on economic development - including wage and cost trends - and the flow of information."
"The two levels of dialogue - technical and political - complement each other successfully."
"Discussions must be based on facts, and it would be better still if we could agree on these facts."
"It is, above all, a question of being realistic."
"Madam President, I would like to point out that macroeconomic dialogue forms part of the complex process of the Employment Pact and that, as the Presidency-in-Office of the Council has explained, it is a consequence of the Cologne decisions, trying, through the establishment of this dialogue between social partners and the people responsible for economic and budgetary policy with the participation of the European Central Bank, to achieve our ultimate objectives."
"In accordance with the broad guidelines of economic policy, these objectives simply consist of achieving stability in monetary policy through budgetary measures and wage trends which are appropriate and more favourable to growth and employment, including exchange rates and interest rates in the long term."
"The macroeconomic dialogue will be initiated in accordance with this philosophy."
"Its significance has been clearly defined by the President-in-Office of the Council and I do not intend to insist on it."
"I simply want to point out that the first technical meeting took place on 29 October and the next will take place on 8 November."
"Despite previous experiences, such as the social dialogue established after Val-Duchesse, it is clear that the new macroeconomic dialogue has some different characteristics."
"I would like to concentrate - so as not to repeat part of what has already been said - on the contribution which the Commission made to the technical debate on 29 October."
"Firstly, I would like to point out that the Commission' s Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs provided, prior to the debate, two working documents."
"One related to the economic situation and the other was intended to prepare the informal exchanges on macroeconomic policies in the medium term."
"Both documents should serve as technical contributions to the debate."
"The first Commission document aimed to present the general economic situation and the macroeconomic perspectives in the short term."
"The diagnosis of trends for the European Union contained in this document is of a descriptive and analytical nature."
"And its contents confirm that it is possible to have a more rapid return to growth than the one announced by the Commission in its macroeconomic forecast in the spring."
"The growth announced for 1999 will be around 2%, similar to that established in the forecast."
"But this 2%, as an annual average, reflects a different performance."
"Performance was lower than expected in the first part of the year but, nevertheless, the upward trend which will occur in the second part of the year will favour growth of close to 3% as an average for the last two years, thereby reaching similar and even higher figures for 2000 than those which we had forecast in the spring."
"The document also includes the possibility that growth may be higher in the future."
"The second document presented by the Commission must serve to prepare for informal exchanges on macroeconomic policies in the medium term."
"The document presents the macroeconomic conditions needed to promote durable growth, drawing certain conclusions from the slow growth recorded in the past, especially since the middle of the 1970s."
"A technical analysis allows us to reach the conclusion that the deceleration of the growth tendency in the European Union can be explained by a combination of external impacts, exacerbated by divergence in national policies, in a context of structural rigidity."
"In particular, the lack of consensus on the content of macroeconomic policies in the period prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Maastricht and of the initial guidelines on economic policy played a fundamental role in the increase in negative effects, external impacts and the development of greater obstacles to growth and employment."
"It is worth emphasising that the change to the rules introduced on the implementation of Economic and Monetary Union has lightened the load of those responsible for national macroeconomic policy and is helping to overcome these obstacles, so that growth may become more sustainable."
"The document analyses the conditions necessary so that the policy mix may continue to be as balanced as possible, thereby allowing us to achieve longer-lasting growth."
"At the meeting on 29 October there was a discussion of this information which was very open and constructive, and I will tell you about this in a summarised fashion."
"With regard to the diagnosis of trends, all the participants agreed that the perspectives had improved considerably, and that the negative external impact of 1998 had already been absorbed by the internal development of the European Union itself."
"With regard to possible risks to future growth, there were differences of emphasis, especially when some of the participants pointed out the risk that further external impacts may affect the Union' s economy."
"In relation to economic policy - the second document provides a response to the challenge of transforming the current upturn into a sustainable process of higher growth - each participant expressed their position very frankly."
"However, I would like to emphasise some of the elements of the debate which may be very useful for the purposes of today' s debate. Firstly, the broad guidelines of economic policy are confirmed as a fundamental element."
"All the participants agreed on the need to maintain price stability and negotiate wage agreements which are compatible with the objective of continuing the process of consolidating the budgets - in accordance with each country' s stability programmes - and of completing the structural reforms in accordance with the Luxembourg and Cardiff processes."
"Secondly, I would like to point out that there was also absolute agreement on the key principle of the macroeconomic framework, which I referred to earlier."
"That is, the more we promote the objective of stability of monetary policy through budgetary measures and appropriate wage trends, the more favourable monetary conditions will be towards growth and employment."
"Thirdly, I would like to point out that the discussion clearly demonstrated the usefulness of this type of direct exchange, which allows each of the participants to express, directly, their points of view and receive adequate answers from the other participants."
"The role of the social partners was fully recognised as a third element of the policy mix."
"Fourthly, some of the ideas offered by the participants warrant special attention."
"I would like to highlight the fact that there was an emphasis on macroeconomic policies, particularly monetary policies, having to take into account progress on the supply side of the European economy."
"In this way, we will increase the possibility of sustaining, without inflation, higher growth in demand."
"The combination of the complete realisation of the single market together with the single currency, in a context of structural reform and strong international competition, will allow for a reduction in the risk of bottlenecks that may arise in the event that wage and budgetary policies are inadequate."
"Lastly I would like to point out that the representatives of the Commission underlined the fact that the supply of labour currently seems to respond more positively than it did previously, but that there exists a significant reserve of qualified and available labour."
"If we add to this the availability of existing capacity, given the high potential tendency towards inflation, the consequence of raised profitability, structural changes will be put in place which those responsible for economic policy must take into account when adopting their respective decisions."
"These are what seem to me to be the most relevant elements of the meeting of 29 October and which, today, as I said, I wanted to share with you so that you may then comment on them and debate them."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, by way of introduction, I would first of all like, on behalf of our group, to put it on record that we regard the macroeconomic dialogue as a welcome innovation, because for the first time it obliges all the key players in European economic policy to participate in a direct exchange of views with each other about the overall economic situation."
"At the same time, we are delighted that Parliament has received this information so soon after the first meeting, although that should go without saying in my view."
"Secondly, I must add, however, as an Austrian, that this dialogue between social partners, between political institutions, between fiscal policy and those with a political mandate has been going on in a similar way for years in my homeland, Austria, and has made an important contribution to Austria' s present position as an economically successful and socially secure country with a high employment rate and lower jobless figures than others can boast."
"That should encourage us to take heart for this dialogue."
"There are a lot of things that we too need to reform and there is some room for improvement."
"The previous speaker touched upon this - the dialogue can only prepare, accompany and supplement."
"It is no substitute for policies."
"It does not relieve those in positions of responsibility from their specific obligations."
"The dialogue is a supplementary component of the many and various measures for growth and employment."
"And for precisely that reason I would also like to point out that this debate fits into the overall framework of these two plenary sittings."
"Our debates during these two days include the Smet report on working time and the Menrad reports on employment policy in the Member States in 1999 and 2000."
"And tomorrow' s agenda includes a debate on Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s question about the strategy for the European internal market, while last week in Strasbourg, in connection with the ECB report, there was a debate about how the macroeconomic dialogue with Parliament could be deepened and reinforced."
"That request has been taken on board in our report."
"I do not think that anyone would argue that comprehensive and coherent strategies are needed for growth and employment, and I am glad that the term growth and employment itself deals with the prejudice we so often hear from the left to the effect that growth can be set against employment, and that currency values and price stability can be set against employment measures."
"The dialogue and the name of this dialogue show that we are all in the same boat."
"It is a question of being willing to take an overall view and to accept overall responsibility."
"The macroeconomic dialogue is a constructive way of tackling urgent problems."
"I therefore call on everyone involved to take part in this macroeconomic dialogue in a responsible manner and to accept this responsibility for the economic and employment policy future of Europe."
"We must eliminate constraints on growth and on business start-ups."
"We must fight the mood of pessimism and deliberate scare-mongering with a new intellectual, innovative, up-beat approach, and I hope that this dialogue will help us do what is needed at the right time, in an open and responsible fashion, and that it does not mean that mundane political opportunism or legitimate group interests will result in our obstructing each other."
"Mr President, the macroeconomic dialogue that the European employment pact has established is a highly praiseworthy new exercise."
"There is never enough dialogue between political leaders and economic operators."
"I would nevertheless like to question the real impact of a dialogue which is fixed beforehand by abstruse procedural rules."
"First of all, there is a technical level which allows fifteen experts to discuss matters and twenty-five other experts to listen; the political level will bring together twenty-four high representatives and 18 aides."
"It is understood in advance that the aim of this two-level dialogue is not to reach agreement on common guidelines or binding commitments; this dialogue will therefore not result in an ex ante agreement for the coordination of different fiscal, budgetary, monetary or even contractual policies."
"Governments and the Central Bank will remain free to decide on their own respective policies."
"Their social partners will continue their free negotiation on conditions of work and pay."
"What will be the added value of this exercise?"
"Whilst I hope that I will be pleasantly surprised, please allow me to remain sceptical."
"To tell the truth, the European Union would gain from rationalising the different projects launched by successive Presidencies following the Amsterdam summit."
"Who, apart from the professionals involved in Community policy, is still involved in the processes known as Luxembourg, Cardiff, Vienna, Cologne and tomorrow Lisbon or Helsinki?"
"The debates on employment guidelines which are, of course, always useful, overlap with discussions on the broad economic policy guidelines and now with the macroeconomic dialogue."
"Green papers and white papers come one after another and are all more or less alike."
"The Commission' s communications pile up on top of reports and resolutions by Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions."
"So many words, and quite often incomprehensible to the average citizen!"
"Community texts look more and more like the political literature that used to be produced by the former Soviet Union."
"The bulk is made up of quotations and references to sacred texts adopted by the European Council or the Commission: replace plenum of the Central Committee with European Council and politburo by Commission and the texts become interchangeable."
"European citizens do not expect more words, rather concrete measures for employment."
"Macroeconomic dialogue only makes sense if it results in macroeconomic action."
"Maintaining price stability is still crucial."
"Inflation affects the poorest people first but the Union' s sole ambition cannot be a policy of stability which is established as dogma."
"Each Member State taken individually is too open to other markets to practise a policy of growth in isolation."
"The Union is a rather closed entity."
"Intercommunity trade represents some 90% of the common GDP."
"At a time when economic recovery might permit both a reduction of public deficits and a policy of maintaining growth, effective coordination of budgetary policies focusing mainly on infrastructural investments, research, education and training could achieve a sustainable economic revival."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, on behalf of the Liberal Group we support this initiative which we consider to be very appropriate in terms of ensuring the necessary consensus in the economic and social field as well as absolutely essential in order to achieve a climate of stability, growth and greater employment in the European Union."
"While accepting this approach, I would like to make two observations."
"The first takes up the observations of the Socialist representative with regard to the good sense in taking account of fundamental aspects, of structural reforms, which were already contained in the White Paper on Competitiveness and Employment."
"The report of the European Central Bank explains that there are certain problems in achieving greater levels of growth - or greater stability in the European Union or greater competitiveness in a process of open economy, needs which are even more accentuated bearing in mind the coming Millennium Round - specifically because certain structural aspects still need to be dealt with in more depth: from the labour markets to, as has been said, the training system, or other equally important aspects such as, for example, an improvement in the levels of research and development."
"On the other hand, I would like to refer to the participants who must be taken into account in the macroeconomic dialogue and I would dare to suggest that three more should be added: the representatives of two institutions of the European Union itself, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - two institutions which represent an extremely important economic and social dimension and, in the case of the regions, clearly, some of them have an absolutely essential role in guaranteeing these objectives - and finally the organisations of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"All of us say that the SMEs play a very important and decisive role in ensuring greater growth and yet, I have not seen them incorporated into this macroeconomic dialogue."
"Having made these observations, I would like to reiterate our support for this initiative."
"I want to speak about three areas: context, dialogue and democracy."
"Firstly, the context within which this macroeconomic dialogue is taking place."
"There is a huge and vitally important factor missing although it is reflected in the Treaties and I refer of course, as you would expect me to, to the environment."
"Article 2 refers to sustainable development as one of the objectives of the European Union, although many of us might question the methods which are set down to attain it."
"But certainly some of them are macroeconomic, as reflected in this debate."
"And sustainable development I would like to point out is not the same as sustainable growth which we have been hearing a lot about this afternoon."
"If growth is quantitative and not qualitative I would submit that we are actually creating instability by making money out of oil spills, clearing up after crime etc."
"Article VI, Title 2 of the new Treaty clearly states that environmental considerations should be integrated into all areas of European Union policy and practice and we believe that includes macroeconomic dialogue."
"For example, climate change, if unchecked, is certainly destabilising to anybody' s economy as the European Union' s own research shows."
"Our own research also shows that economic development in the conventional sense is becoming limited in some areas due to lack of fresh water and that the European Union already produces more toxic waste than it can deal with as a by-product of economic growth."
"The environment has therefore to be factored in and I would like to know how that is going to be done."
"Who is going to be represented?"
"We would also like to ask for real dialogue within this, not just economic propaganda."
"It is essential that we look for new ways and the best ways to meet the objective of balanced and sustainable development in a way which meets our own needs, those of the environment and which does not have a negative impact on the living standards of those in the poor parts of the world."
"So how are we going to evaluate the wider effects of our own macroeconomic policy?"
"Thirdly, I would ask for the democratic deficit in this process to be repaired, certainly at the next Intergovernmental Conference."
"I listened to the list of those who were going to be present and it struck me that the process is actually similar to what happens down the pub on a Friday night where you get together with your mates, then go home and tell people what happened and if you are lucky other people might hear the best stories."
"I want to know how, as elected Members, we are going to be involved in this process, particularly if it is going to be as closed as has been laid out for us."
"It appears to me that we are not being treated as parliamentarians here, as being grown-up and mature enough to participate in the process of dialogue on macroeconomic policy, and I would urge you to change that and at least open up in the meantime so that we know what is happening and can explain it to our constituents."
"Mr President, the declarations on employment from the European Union Summit meetings are continuing at a steady pace."
"With the same steady pace, however, mass unemployment, underemployment and part-time employment are also continuing to torment the working people of Europe."
"Mr President, the European Employment Pacts, the Cardiff, Luxembourg and Cologne processes and their combined effects, the macroeconomic dialogues and the technical and political bodies engaged in those dialogues are doing nothing positive to boost employment levels for the working people in Europe."
"This dramatic worsening of the unemployment situation is due to the initiatives being undertaken and the policy currently being pursued; that is, a policy which not only puts economic factors before social factors and price stability before social security, but also one which declares that the Stability Pact is the supreme law which must be applied at all times."
"This is not a policy for the working people, rather a policy for capital gains."
"When the European Central Bank considers a growth rate of over 2.5% dangerous, whilst the Commission is calling for a growth rate of over 3% in order to reduce unemployment to 7% within 6-7 years, then this can only lead to greater pressure on the labour market which in turn will upset working relations. It will also lead to part-time employment, fewer jobs and reduced salaries, and it will cripple the social security system."
"From this viewpoint, the only success that can come of macroeconomic dialogue with the participation of employer and employee representatives is to enforce collective bargaining and readjust salaries to suit the demands of credit capital, the euro and the ruling economic policy which is guided by EMU and the Stability Pact."
"The transparency which goes hand in hand with the procedures for macroeconomic dialogue and the continued absence of the European Parliament from this dialogue are giving rise to concerns that we are once again faced with attempts to overturn fundamental rights of workers and to undermine any social model still in existence in Europe."
"Mr President, at the European Summit in Cologne, the Council decided on a European Employment Pact with a view to cutting unemployment substantially and permanently."
"One of the three main components of this Pact concerns the institutionalisation of the macroeconomic dialogue at European level."
"My political group would firstly like to state that this dialogue is the latest in a long line of hybrid ""European talking-shops"" ."
"As the proposals stand at the moment, four parties are involved in this dialogue: representatives of the European institutions, of various committees, of employers and employees, the latter two insofar as they are organised at European level."
"Secondly, this consultative body, on account of its tripolarity, embraces elements of both government and society."
"Its corporate nature casts uncertainty on who should be held responsible for the realisation of the macroeconomic policy and its implementation."
"In this way, transparency and the separation of powers, two key principles of our European democratic constitutional states, are not honoured at European level."
"Put more bluntly, they are being blatantly ignored and, as such, further jeopardised."
"Also, it is quite remarkable that the European Union appears to be assuming the dimensions of a state, whilst it is primarily a cooperative of national states and as such, could not be a state in itself and never will be."
"With this proposal, the European Union seems to have become too big for its own boots and chooses to ignore the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality for the time being."
"A fourth point concerns the serious possibility of overlap with the Economic and Social Committee."
"The transparency of the process for developing the general guidelines for economic policy and employment policy would benefit more from an official and public recommendation by the Economic and Social Committee than from tripartite-flavoured consultation, the outcome of which has, at best, the quality of obligatory effort."
"Could the Commission explain how it views the relationship between the proposed macroeconomic dialogue and the existing Economic and Social Committee?"
"Do European bodies not run the risk of endlessly repeating themselves?"
"After all, meetings cost time and money."
"Could the European Commission indicate how it sees the intrinsic role of the Economic and Social Committee once the macroeconomic dialogue has been set up?"
"Fifthly, the macroeconomic dialogue concerns a field of policy with regard to which the European Union does not issue any legislation."
"Macroeconomic policy and employment policy are primarily a matter for the individual Member States."
"Needless to say, it is beneficial for Member States to exchange ideas and dovetail their policies, as far as the macroeconomic situation in the relevant country allows for this."
"General agreements are reached via guidelines, within which the Member States have sufficient scope for a degree of policy freedom necessary to incorporate measures which will accommodate the specific features of their national economy."
"Given this situation, a macroeconomic dialogue at European level is largely up in the air."
"Efforts are, of course, required to reduce the unemployment levels which are still far too high."
"We should, in particular, focus our attention on the long-term unemployed."
"But talks at an abstract European level do not create jobs."
"We therefore advocate freedom of policy at regional and local level because that is the level at which there is expertise in the actual labour market."
"Exchange of information and good practices at European level are highly commendable but the official institutionalisation of a European macroeconomic dialogue hardly has any impact on this, if any."
"Mr Niinistö, Commissioner, if the millions of European unemployed had heard this first account of the macroeconomic dialogue promoting growth and employment, they would have despaired."
"It seems that, apart from evoking the odd principle, there is nothing incisive, there are no proposals and there is no blunt analysis - and we need a blunt analysis of the state of many of the European economies, especially those of the European continent."
"Commissioner, when I hear talk of macroeconomic dialogue - given that the definition seems extremely evasive - the conciliation process in Italy comes to mind."
"What I am afraid of is that this macroeconomic dialogue will try to export to European level the method and mechanism of the Italian conciliation process, which is the method that has given our country its lowest growth rates, its highest unemployment levels and its highest inflation rates."
"In Italy, conciliation between social partners and the Government has become a pact between the representatives of established interests -unionist, political and those of Confindustria (the Italian Manufacturers' Association) - seeking to protect the established interests and revenues from the possibility of the unemployed and all those who are not represented by conciliation having a place in the new economy."
"In Italy, conciliation with the social partners has blocked all the strategies and the hypotheses for reform on the crucial points - I am thinking of the labour market, public spending and social security spending in particular, a labour market act which closely follows the one adopted in the seventies."
"Both the representative of the Council and the representative of the Commission were right only about one thing, that is the request for pay moderation."
"In Italy, starting with pay moderation, which the trade union oligarchs allowed, any plans for reforming the economy have been blocked."
"I wonder why we have to tell European workers that only one thing is certain, that their pay will be moderated."
"And I wonder why, on the other hand, we must not say that if - thanks to liberalisation and thanks to being able to accept the challenges of the new economy openly - we manage to reverse the downward trend in economic growth, there will be wealth and there will also be the prospect of salary increases. Instead of having collective national or European contracts, maybe these salary increases can be linked to productivity and the profits of firms."
"In conclusion, I think that we should use this dialogue, if necessary, to explain to the European citizens why employment has increased by 45% in twenty years in the United States but only by 4.12% in Europe."
"I think that the European unemployed, and maybe even immigrants need liberalisation, less State interference, less taxes and less State intervention in the economy."
"Maybe this would lead to economic growth and more employment."
"Mr President, many things have already been said which I think can be summarised in this way: either the macroeconomic dialogue is sheer hypocrisy, hiding the lack of a real economic policy for the Union, and so it is completely useless, a mere imitation and a waste of time, as other Members have already said, or the macroeconomic dialogue is something real and substantial, and so there is hypocrisy on the other side and they are trying to use flimsy words to hide the danger, to my mind, of a trend towards State intervention in the European economy."
"What does macroeconomic dialogue actually mean?"
"What could it mean?"
"According to the sacred texts of the economy, it means conciliation and policy on revenues, which Mr Della Vedova has just reminded us have been around in Italy for some time, with the results he emphasised."
"So macroeconomic dialogue and policy on revenues basically come down to wage policy and pay moderation policy?"
"Let us just admit it!"
"A group such as the European People' s Party - Democrats cannot agree with this because its aim is the free functioning of the market, which leads to the free distribution of revenues, starting with workers' income in particular."
"Workers' income must be linked to productivity, and not to coordination strategies of varying degrees of obscurity decided upon by others."
"Furthermore, who are the participants in this macroeconomic dialogue?"
"The Council?"
"The States?"
"The Commission?"
"The European Union?"
"The European Central Bank?"
"Well, when free traders see the Central Bank in this group they go into a state of shock - a Central Bank can never be part of an assembly of this kind, never!"
"If, in fact, the Central Bank tells the truth, it commits harikari, so to speak."
"If it does not tell the truth when talking to the other participants - as indeed it should not because the Central Bank should do otherwise - then it is telling lies and wasting time."
"Then there are the social partners."
"Well, these four participants are a highly dangerous mix which, on the one hand, is trying to eliminate Europe' s real problem, which is the lack of a real economic policy and, on the other hand is doing its best to clog up the system with negotiating games of varying degrees of obscurity, and to hell with unemployment and to hell with the market."
"Just one more point."
"Cologne had based its hypothesis for an employment pact on three pillars, but too little is said about the third pillar, the liberalisation of the markets."
"At the beginning of this year a macroeconomic dialogue became absolutely essential and no doubt the first meeting of the partners to that macroeconomic dialogue next week will be an historic step."
"Sadly we here in Parliament will be witnessing it from the sidelines."
"Despite an absolutely resounding rejection just last June in the European Parliament elections of the remoteness and secrecy of our institutions collectively, that first step next week will be adding to the democratic deficit in that Parliament will be excluded and there seems to be no good reason for this."
"The partners to the dialogue are of two types."
"First there are those like the social partners or the central bank who have a direct influence on facets of the equation such as wage formation or the level of interest rates and then secondly, in a class of their own, are the European Commission and the Commission advisers on the direction, for example, of the policy mix."
"They do not directly affect any of the facets of the equation, they have not got that decision-making power."
"They are there to advise and influence."
"In this respect this institution is one of the Commission' s main interlocutors."
"We might disagree with the advice and the direction they will suggest but we will not have the right to be there at the macroeconomic dialogue to say so."
"I am told that these sorts of things are technical issues and that we in Parliament should remain above them, but to me the issues that will be discussed in the macroeconomic dialogue that have been touched upon here are not technical, they are highly political and we, as the democratically elected institution, should have a part to play in that macroeconomic dialogue."
"That leaves the excuse of what some call the need for confidentiality, trust or even secrecy."
"Some have used the word secrecy."
"That is a retrograde step."
"We have found all sorts of ways in the budgetary procedure to find a working arrangement for this institution together with the Commission to maintain confidentiality and that could be done in relation to this dialogue."
"On the content, I hope the macroeconomic dialogue will call for and take note of evidence on the success of the active labour market measures we have been increasingly pursuing since Luxembourg."
"Has that resulted in an increase in the effective supply of labour or do we need to hang on to the increasing unsustainable view that structural unemployment represents the bulk of unemployment?"
"Can we begin to abandon concepts like that, can we perhaps begin to take a more realistic view in the setting of interest rates, a view which would accept that conditions have changed and that we can now begin to hold back on interest rate increases as unemployment falls so as not to choke off a fragile growth?"
"These are the sorts of points I would love to be at the macroeconomic dialogue next week to make, but sadly neither I nor any other Member of this institution will be allowed to be present at that meeting next week."
"That is a real retrograde step and an absolute shame."
"Mr President, the fact that so many of Europe' s citizens turned their backs on the EU at this summer' s election is largely due to the fact that they did not think that the EU and the Member States had succeeded in creating jobs in Europe."
"Growth in the EU is still too low, and unemployment in the vast majority of countries unacceptably high."
"Quite simply, not enough is being done by the individual Member States."
"The tax system is still preventing new jobs from being created and, in fact, my own country, Sweden, is an example of one country where this is happening."
"Laws and regulations in the labour market, too, are still an obstacle to job creation and, where this issue too is concerned, I can cite Sweden as an example."
"According to a recent survey, it is Sweden and Germany which have the least flexible labour markets."
"If the macroeconomic dialogue is to be fruitful and produce results, which is something we all want to happen, and if European countries together are to be able to provide better conditions for new job opportunities, then I am firmly of the view that all Member States without exception must participate in EMU."
"In Sweden, there is a debate going on at the moment about whether Sweden, including the Swedish Government, has less influence within the EU because we are at present outside EMU."
"Former Finance Minister Erik Åsbrink and - most recently, yesterday - former Commissioner Anita Gradin have expressed the view that this is the case."
"I fully share their opinion."
"To believe that a macroeconomic dialogue can seriously be conducted if some Member States remain outside EMU while the majority of countries are a part of it is, in my view, an illusion which cannot be maintained in the long term."
"For the sake of employment and welfare throughout Europe, I am therefore looking for a clearer and sharper perspective upon EMU from the Commission and Commissioner Solbes Mira, as well as from the Council."
"Mr Karas said that ""we are all in the same boat"" ."
"I should like to say to him, ""no, unfortunately, we are still not all in the same boat"" ."
"But it is important that, in future, we should in fact be so."
"Mr President, complete or partial unemployment is a tragedy in human terms for millions of families."
"It is a social catastrophe even in those European countries that claim to have the fewest unemployed people, and here we have the Cologne European Council and the European Commission, which are both content to gorge themselves on words as they talk about the European Employment pact."
"The measures that are envisaged though are ridiculous given the extent of the problem."
"The worst thing is that they are cynically using unemployment as an excuse to give more money to employers. The extra EUR 500 million that the European Central Bank is being asked to release on the pretext of stimulating job creation, as well as the EUR 1 billion for hi-tech SMEs are officially supposed to be used for investment."
"Now I would like to take one recent example, amongst so many of those big companies who make their workers redundant at a time when they are experiencing increased profits."
"The ABB Alston Power Trust is preparing to shed a large number of jobs in several countries within the Union, in England, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden, not to mention other countries in Europe or across the world."
"Why then does the Commission not use its authority to oppose these kinds of job cuts?"
"It is deciding on a huge number of directives which have the force of law in the areas affecting competition."
"I shall stop now."
"How can we understand the Commission' s refusal to react to this attitude of big companies, which is irresponsible in human and social terms, unless the explanation is that it serves the interests of these big companies and that it does nothing for the unemployed apart from offering words of consolation?"
"Mr President the procedure relating to the macroeconomic dialogue that has been presented to us is characterised by two dominant features at the moment."
"The first is the fact that very vague aims are expressed, in terms that are much more emotional than practical."
"The second is the way that they are formulated appears to be liberal but actually results in further constraints."
"The first matter concerns the very vague aims of growth and employment."
"These are things that we have been promised for years."
"It has been discussed in Vienna, in Luxembourg, in Cardiff, and in goodness knows how many other places."
"We now have to recognise the fact that until now the Europe of full employment has been the same Europe that has made unemployment worse."
"This is unemployment that does not exist to the same degree in developed countries that are not Members of the Union such as Switzerland or Norway."
"To seriously address the problem of full employment would mean questioning the validity of removing borders but that will not come into the discussion, because that would mean opposing globalisation."
"It would mean questioning the validity of excessive taxation and bureaucracy but that will not come into the discussion because that would mean opposing the doctrines of socialism."
"It would mean questioning the validity of our immigration policy which takes a heavy toll of employment not to mention the costs that it incurs, but that will not come into the discussion either because it would mean opposing the orthodoxy of the single-system Europe."
"I fear therefore, that the real problems will not be addressed but also - this is the second aspect, as vague as it is - that the terms of this dialogue will result in further constraints."
"We are being told that there will be dialogue, but the simple fact that certain subjects are being mentioned means that they will fall within the Union' s area of competence, and the Union is beginning to look more and more like the frog who ended up exploding because he wanted to become as big as a cow."
"We are also being told of coordination, harmonisation and cohesion; even striking a balance is mentioned, never constrictive regulations and detailed laws which would restrict everyone' s freedom."
"This, however, is the direction in which we are inexorably heading."
"Currency standardisation has resulted in the standardisation of financial policies; the standardisation of financial policies has resulted in the standardisation of economic policies and the standardisation of economic policies in the standardisation of social policies."
"We all know full well that this is the direction in which a hidden hand is leading us in this area."
"Hazy arguments will not bring about the freedom of nations, as they would have us believe; they serve only to hide the aims to which they would like to lead those nations."
"These aims are undoubtedly already known, but only by a select few."
"Mr President, monetary union binds the Member States of the European Union together in a permanent, mutually supportive community in which national approaches are possible but are not permitted to play a crucial role."
"The regulatory policy necessary to supplement the European market on the road to a socially and environmentally sustainable European market economy cannot succeed in the European Union unless priority is given to community interest."
"Hence, also, the importance of the macroeconomic dialogue."
"The macroeconomic dialogue is not an end in itself."
"It serves to bring about growth with a positive impact on employment in the European Union and to help to overcome mass unemployment."
"It thus complements structural and labour market policies."
"However, I wonder if we have really grasped the scale of this dialogue yet."
"In a society with such a great division of labour, it is essential for the economic actors' activities to be coordinated, either by the market or through economic planning."
"I believe that market-led coordination will not work."
"We need political guidelines."
"That is why the Maastricht Treaty rightly emphasised in Article 103 that coordination of this kind is necessary."
"All we need now is the implementation measures."
"Unfortunately, national governments are either unwilling or unable to achieve the implementation measures, as mentioned in the Delors White Paper."
"We know a good many national governments which have seen that there is a major interdependence between monetary, financial and wages policies and which, like Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland or Denmark for example, have drawn the obvious conclusions, with positive consequences for the labour market and for budget consolidation as well."
"That is why I think it is incredibly important to make it clear that coordination means understanding the conflicting interests of the individual economic actors and getting them to act without having to limit their autonomy."
"Even today there is no real insight into this coordination, and I think that the ECB contribution to the last sitting highlighted the dangers we need to be aware of and how great the fears here are."
"We accordingly need a genuinely successful coordination of wages, monetary and finance policy."
"This will provide the basis for coordination across the European Union."
"It will not just imply good governance but also a European multi-level system of governance."
"What actually strikes me is the failure to involve the European Parliament."
"I would like to stress once again that the European Parliament was calling for the coordination of policies long before the Maastricht Treaty existed, as a means of genuinely achieving European added value."
"I believe that nowadays transparency is a given for all democratic institutions."
"Just as we demand it of the European Central Bank in the dialogue, we must also call for greater transparency on the part of the Council of Finance Ministers, the Jumbo Council, the Social Affairs Council and the European Council, and demand direct European Parliament participation."
"It is not a question of confidential information or of keeping state secrets - although Members of Parliament are quite capable of that - it is really all about how we shape our future in the twenty-first century, and in that respect there should be no information, no analysis, no forecast that is dealt with sub rosa, no, everything must be genuinely accessible to the public."
"That is why I believe that European Parliament participation should really be required again."
"We are not talking about information like that at this sitting, or, following this sitting, at the joint meeting of the Council and the Commission with the two committees responsible."
"This is actually about dialogue with Parliament, because we really must ensure that we are involved here, so that in the interests of our citizens the macroeconomic dialogue truly creates really concrete guidelines that can then be taken up in the employment forum under the Portuguese Presidency."
"Mr President, nobody can say that any form of dialogue, macroeconomic dialogue in particular, is useless."
"But come now!"
"Let us not present this as an institutional reform or as a significant step forward in the evolution of the European Union."
"What kind of dialogue is this?"
"A confidential and secret dialogue?"
"A dialogue with no flexibility, silent witnesses and no freedom of speech?"
"And whom will this dialogue affect exactly?"
"The European Central Bank which is not accountable to anybody?"
"Governments which, or at least most of which, cleave to trade unions and the automatic guiding of the EMU, which will effectively function as a mechanism which embodies and by-passes collective bargaining?"
"In my view, this is making us regress; it is a return to the Privy Councils of pre-Cromwell days when there were no records of proceedings and the people knew nothing."
"From this point of view, I would like to congratulate Parliament for not participating."
"In my opinion, in refusing to take part in such short-lived institutional fabrications, the European Parliament, which is a vehicle for openness and transparency, is showing dignity."
"Mr President, last week, in plenary session here in this House, I enquired after Wim Duisenberg' s opinion and commitment regarding the macroeconomic dialogue which is about to kick off in the next couple of days."
"His reply was courteous and obliging, albeit rather reserved."
"He said that the exchange of information is fine, as long as absolutely no coordination of policy takes place beforehand."
"This reserve, which is somewhat exaggerated to my mind, is also something that can be detected in the other partners in the dialogue."
"If the leaders, the majority of whom are men, are in the least ambitious, then there will certainly be a healthy dose of scepticism at grass-roots level."
"This is also true of the circles I come from, the trade unions."
"There too, there is a rather sceptical attitude towards involving the government and central banks in wage development."
"I think this is a serious case of getting cold feet. Surely, there is a whole world of possibilities between preliminary policy coordination on the one hand and complete non-commitment on the other."
"This world is what we refer to in the Netherlands as the ""consultation system"" , a set-up of frequent and reasonably structured consultations between the main socio-economic operators."
"This is a joint framework of analysis where attempts are made to come up with solutions to shared problems."
"A key element of this process is the organisation and guarantee of trust, as well as commitment among the respective grass roots."
"The latter is essential but cannot be brought about overnight of course."
"It is a world which is yet to be conquered at EU level."
"In my opinion, this is one of the great challenges of this post-EMU era."
"This is why I regret that at the start of the process, parties are threatening to hide behind the interests of their own autonomy on their own patch of authority: the government with respect to their budgetary policy, the two sides of industry with regard to wage negotiations and the European Central Bank with regard to monetary policy."
"The very presence of this autonomy could make the dialogue so interesting."
"I am also among those, as is Stephen Hughes, who would have liked to participate in last Friday' s meeting and who have had discussions with the European Central Bank on this rise in interest rates."
"I am convinced that various colleagues here in this House would have made a brilliant contribution to this debate."
"Whether this means that we could have made Mr Duisenberg change his mind is a different matter but this could perhaps be a goal for the future."
"Also, I would like to take part in this coming Monday' s political debate on the effects of this rise in interest rates, which will probably be implemented soon after, and by that I do not just mean the effects on the current financial rates but also on the real economy."
"There is a strong wish in Parliament to bring this about."
"I feel we should not only focus on this but in particular that we should also endeavour, together with our colleagues in the national parliaments, to enter into this debate with our government representatives and the European Commission."
"This is why it is so beneficial to have this debate now."
"I do hope that there is no question but that this will be carried through at heads of government level and I feel optimistic about Prodi' s initiatives in this direction."
"Mr President, it is very important indeed that the Council and the Commission think very carefully about the meeting that is being held and the meetings that will be held in the future on the macroeconomic dialogue."
"It is absolutely pointless to exclude the European Parliament from that discussion."
"We debate the annual economic report with the Council and the Commission."
"Last week we had Mr Duisenberg in the European Parliament to oversee the work of the European Central Bank."
"We have finance ministers coming before the Economic Committee of the European Parliament and we have the social partners also coming before the European Parliament."
"I hope that at this stage it is an oversight in not involving the European Parliament in this discussion."
"It seems to me a rather pointless exercise if we are not present."
"I want to talk about the outputs from the dialogue."
"Frankly, that is much more important at this stage than who sits around the table at the first meeting."
"It is called a macroeconomic dialogue."
"I hope it is a dialogue and not a monologue."
"Our experience from our discussions with the ECOFIN Council and the European Central Bank is that we are very much involved in a monologue."
"We sit and listen to the orthodoxy from the ECOFIN Council and we listen to the orthodoxy from the European Central Bank."
"They show absolutely no imagination whatsoever."
"The macroeconomic dialogue is critical."
"At the moment we are operating in a very benign economic environment."
"We have low inflation, we are returning to growth and things are reasonably stable."
"What happens in the future when we have a problem in our economy and where there is a serious external shock or a serious internal shock and you have to talk to the social partners and the other economic actors about some perhaps unpalatable measures that need to be taken at a European level?"
"I say to the president of the ECOFIN Council and to Commissioner Solbes Mira that what we set out in the macroeconomic dialogue in the next few days is not just for what is occurring at the present time, but to set the mood so that in the event of a problem or difficult issues we can actually sit together with the social partners and work out solutions to our problems."
"Equally, we do not want this monologue - having listened to Mr Duisenberg it will certainly run the risk of being a monologue - to be a discussion only about wage levels."
"There are many more things involved in the real economy of the European Union than the level of wages of people in employment."
"We need to look at the reform of labour markets."
"We need to look at the reform of the capital markets."
"We need to look at the reform of the product markets."
"All those things impact upon the social partners."
"In conclusion, my group will look with interest at the conclusion of the macroeconomic dialogue."
"We see this as a first step."
"But please involve us in the future and understand that in times of difficulty this dialogue could be critical to the way in which European citizens accept the institutions of the European Union when difficult decisions have to be taken."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office used the image of a relay baton to be passed on with the macroeconomic dialogue."
"But it is not totally clear to us where he wants to run with this baton."
"We are still afraid he will just do a few splendid laps of honour round the stadium for the gallery, and that we will have to make do with unproductive or inadequate results."
"I would like to emphasise what has already been said here about Parliament' s non-participation."
"The lack of European Parliament participation in this dialogue is more than just a slight drawback."
"There is a direct link between democratic productivity, the productivity of the results achieved through a dialogue of this kind, and the type of participation."
"None of you involved in the dialogue, neither the Council nor the Commission, nor the European Central Bank, will be held directly to account if European solutions fail to emerge - unlike those elected to this Parliament, unlike those who sit in this House and are considered directly responsible by the electors who have voted for us!"
"I warn you not to underestimate that point, because I believe that participation by Members will lead to better results in this case."
"There are pivotal shortcomings in the thought process."
"These relate to both the employment guidelines and to the key features of our economic policy."
"What is more, in some important areas thinking revolves around out-of-date ideas that public budgets can be consolidated just by limiting revenue and at the same time cutting expenditure."
"But that is not the sort of thinking that can eliminate remaining deficits."
"Last but not least, experience in America has shown that you cannot save your way out of remaining deficits, but rather that you have to eliminate them through growth."
"That is why it is necessary to support the economic development process in Europe, so as to tap all the available potential."
"That is why we are asking you very directly as to when agreements will be reached in which concrete benchmarks will be negotiated on the contribution of public investment to steady growth, which is also bound to have a positive impact on the labour market?"
"When will you finally agree quantitative and qualitative employment targets to ensure that employment is raised to the level prevalent in Japan or in the USA?"
"And when will you enter into a concrete agreement with us so that we can implement a consolidated strategy to exploit all the economic potential of Europe' s countries as well?"
"There is no sign of that yet!"
"Mr Speaker, first I would like to thank you for this debate."
"I believe that it is useful; it has certainly been interesting."
"It is important that Parliament is involved in these deliberations."
"I am obliged to confirm, however, that the European Council at Cologne very explicitly limited the number of participants in the dialogue proper, and that the country which holds the presidency of the Council cannot but comply with this restriction."
"I believe that the macroeconomic dialogue will make progress and will bring results."
"This is quite an opportune time, but also a very challenging one."
"Economic growth seems to be underway, it is beginning to take shape."
"It does not present itself, however, as some fundamental reduction in unemployment."
"On the other hand, although there is unemployment, there are bottlenecks and a shortage of manpower in certain industries."
"This sort of situation is very challenging."
"It is important that we try to create confidence and faith in the future among the economy' s key players. In the private sector: those who provide employment; and consumers, who generate demand and opportunities for employment."
"As was mentioned earlier, the single currency has increased our opportunities, but at the same time also produced new risk factors."
"As far as the macroeconomic dialogue and its nature are concerned, I would like to express my agreement with what Mrs Randzio-Plath said earlier."
"It is important that the economy' s main players can enter into confidential discussions in so far as their duties overlap."
"Each one will have their own duties to perform, both the ECB and the social partners, but in places they are tangential to one another."
"It is important that these main players understand one another' s reasoning and basic points of departure."
"As the country to hold the presidency, Finland also wants to stress the importance of transparency in this matter, although the operative word here is confidentiality. This is very much due to the fact that all participants are likely to speak about their own issues and their own area and may not necessarily be seeking joint decisions, but mutual understanding."
"I am convinced that Parliament will get its voice heard, and I for one will be very happy to convey news of this debate to the dialogue next Monday."
"Mr President, this has been a particularly interesting dialogue and I would like to begin by making an initial political comment."
"I believe that it is in fact dangerous to glamorise and glorify the facts and create false expectations in the same way that it is dangerous to dash efforts and to generate feelings of emptiness and despair."
"I therefore believe that we should see macroeconomic dialogue in its true light."
"It is not a one-off event or even a process which will change the way things are in the European Union."
"It is, however, an innovation."
"It is a new endeavour which will enhance communication between those members and leaders of economic life who have never before sat at the same table."
"It is a dialogue between the masterminds of monetary policy, i.e. the European Central Bank, the political powers of Europe, represented by the Council and the Presidency, and the social partners, representing workers and manufacturers. We have full participation."
"All of us, the new Parliament and the new Commission alike, must act on a decision reached at the Cologne Council and it is important that we show the political will to develop, change and transform this dialogue since we are the ones who will be trying it out first, and with this first-hand experience we will be able to see where changes need to be made."
"I would like to stress that macroeconomic dialogue, as was also stipulated in Cologne, focuses in essence on the need for both employment and growth."
"A particularly interesting agenda has emerged through the various participants in this dialogue on both a technical and political level."
"How effective can the action plans of the Member States and the employment policy with its 22 guidelines be in addressing the problems of structural unemployment, long-term unemployment and youth unemployment?"
"Can restructuring within the labour market and the restructuring and reforms which must take place pursuant to the Cardiff decisions in both the products and services markets create the preconditions for monetary policy to operate within another framework?"
"Alternatively, can the common currency, today' s low inflation rate and the anticipated growth rate create the necessary framework for job creation within the European Union?"
"When a dialogue at this level and with these procedures is only held twice a year, it is not possible for it to provide all the answers to such questions."
"But I believe that politically we must look at its positive side and consider the major concern of the peoples of Europe- after all, MEPs do represent the peoples of Europe and speak on their behalf - which is why the interesting yet burning issue of employment and unemployment is at the heart of macroeconomic dialogue."
"In other words, financiers, finance ministers and the unions of industry on the one hand, and the labour ministers and social partners in the area of trade unions on the other hand, are discussing employment and placing it at the top of the common policy agenda."
"That is precisely the reason why it would be worth our while to give this dialogue some time, to see how it progresses and to see the ensuing results, before we begin casting stones and calling for changes before it has even got under way."
"Mr President, both the President-in-Office of the Council and Mrs Diamantopoulou have made certain observations concerning the issues covered in this debate and, therefore, I shall simply introduce certain additional elements."
"Firstly, we are aware - and this has been explained well - that the dialogue is aimed at preparing the political debate, not replacing it."
"Therefore, it is an essential element of information which, unfortunately, cannot lead us, as some MEPs have suggested, to the definition of a different economic policy."
"The coordination of our economic policy is not on that level at the moment."
"Neither does the dialogue intend excessive consensus nor authoritarianism."
"It is an exchange of information with the aim that the different economic operators should understand the reality better and be able to act accordingly."
"The problem regarding the content of the dialogue and of the members who take part in it is, and will always be, contentious."
"Should it include the issue of the environment?"
"Should other elements be included which clearly relate to the economy but not to the aspects of macroeconomic policy to be applied at a particular moment?"
"An increase in the content of the dialogue will possibly not make it more useful, but will cause it to lose some of its effectiveness because we will be causing greater dispersion."
"The second problem, concerning who should or should not participate in the dialogue has been mentioned today."
"Should the Social and Economic Committee and the Committee of the Regions also have their place in the macroeconomic dialogue?"
"They could undoubtedly make an interesting contribution despite the different nature of the participation of the businessmen and workers in, for example, the Economic and Social Committee."
"Nevertheless, the essential point which has been put forward - and I understand this perfectly - is the possibility of the European Parliament itself participating in the macroeconomic dialogue."
"Both the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou have referred to this issue."
"You already know the situation, thanks to the decisions of the European Council."
"Having said that, what can we do and what are we doing?"
"Of course, we can be here today, we can inform you of the work we have done up till now, and make ourselves available to you to carry on debating with Parliament the issues which are of interest with regard to the macroeconomic dialogue."
"The fact that you are not physically at the dialogue table does not mean that it is out of the question that Parliament may maintain a presence, with the opportunity to communicate its ideas."
"I believe that today, certain issues of interest have been highlighted."
"Is it necessary to pursue a policy of greater demand in the present context?"
"Is it reasonable to continue to plan certain elements of the structural policies as has been decided?"
"Is it useful to envisage, in the long term, the presence of Parliament in the macroeconomic dialogue, given that it is very likely that, in the future, the conditions of that dialogue will turn out to be different from the present ones?"
"These are questions which we have taken note of, which we will study very carefully, and obviously we will remain committed to keeping Parliament informed and even holding a debate with Parliament on those points which are of special interest to it."
"Seafarers' hours of work - Organisation of working time"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"the recommendation for second reading (A5-0042/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the enforcement of seafarers' hours of work on board ships using Community ports (8639/2/1999 - C5-0035/1999 - 1998/0321(COD)) (rapporteur: Mr S. Hughes);"
"the recommendation for second reading (A5-0041/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 93/104/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time to cover sectors and activities excluded from that directive (8642/1/1999 - C5-0036/1999 - 1998/0318(COD)) (rapporteur: Mrs M. Smet)."
"As you said, the proposal for which I am responsible is that relating to the enforcement of seafarers' hours of work on board ships using Community ports."
"This is just one element of an overall package of proposals that were brought forward by the Commission last November to try to plug the loopholes of the sectors that were excluded from the original working-time directive back in 1993."
"I hope we are nearing the final chapters in this long saga and that soon we will have all sectors covered by arrangements on working time to protect worker health and safety."
"Just as a quick reminder, the batch that was brought forward last year by the Commission included first of all an overall amendment of the 1993 directive, that is the subject of Mrs Smet' s report; a directive on road transport, sadly that one is totally blocked in the Transport Council at the moment I understand it; the third, a directive implementing the agreement between the social partners on seafarers, was adopted in the form of a directive in June this year so that element is taken care of, and then finally the proposal that I am speaking on today, a directive on the enforcement of working hours on board ships using Community ports."
"The three proposals effectively need to be seen together in relation to the one proposal I am speaking on."
"There is the agreement reached between the two sides of industry in the maritime sector, there is the specific proposal relating to seafarers having recourse to Community ports, but also there is ILO Convention 180 and in fact the agreement between the two sides of industry in the maritime sector was very closely based on ILO Convention 180."
"These three proposals: the agreement, the directive on seafarers' hours and the ILO Convention are designed to come into effect together in mid-2002."
"At the first reading on this particular proposal Parliament made no amendments but the rapporter, Hugh McMahon at that time, made the point that it was absolutely essential that these three instruments should come into effect at the same time to avoid any competitive disadvantage."
"I am therefore very pleased indeed that seems to have been agreed and we seem to be making progress in that direction."
"The fact that the ILO Convention now has a time limit set down effectively in the form of the other two directives means that we will, I am sure, have sufficient Member States with sufficiently large fleets ratifying the Convention to make sure that it too comes into effect in mid-2002."
"The only significant difference in the common position compared with the first reading position is that the implementation date has been put back by one year."
"That really is to allow Member States to overcome one or two technical difficulties they might have in ratifying ILO Convention 180 and thereby allowing the whole package to be brought into effect at the same time."
"Perhaps I could also say that I have just met with the two sides of industry from the maritime sector and congratulated them heartily on the agreement they reached."
"It took five years of negotiation to reach the agreement in the maritime sector."
"These things do not happen easily, they do not happen overnight but they did work extremely hard and we are now seeing the fruits of the social dialogue in that particular sector."
"I think it is very sad indeed that we have not seen similar progress in the road sector."
"The difficulties we are now facing in the Transport Council over the legislative proposal the Commission brought forward stem directly from the fact that there was a failure to make progress on a framework agreement on working time in the road sector."
"It reveals a real sharp contrast to the progress that was made in the maritime sector."
"That really poses a danger; it poses a danger to the revision to the general directive that Mrs Smet is also dealing with and the danger is this: the rail sector is included in the general directive."
"The two sides of industry there agreed to be included in the general directive so long as parallel progress was made in the road sector because they quite naturally fear a competitive disadvantage if they put in place wide-ranging arrangements to cover working time but the road sector does not."
"I hope the Transport Council will hear that message and that we will see some progress to make sure that road transport is covered, otherwise we see a real danger to the rail sector element of the revision to the general directive."
"For now, however, I can thoroughly commend the common position in relation to the enforcement of seafarers' hours at work on board ships using Community ports."
"This will make sure that the workers on board vessels from third countries having recourse to our ports are covered by the same broad arrangements as the agreement between the two sides of industry."
"It is a perfectly sensible and good proposal and I commend it to the House."
"Mr President, the PPE Group agrees with the rapporteur' s recommendation on the second reading and would like to thank the rapporteur for a sound and comprehensive report."
"I think it is very important that if an ILO treaty is concluded which does not provide binding and enforceable legislation - this also includes inspections, sanctions and remedial measures - so we fail to succeed in this, then we have not done our work properly."
"We would therefore back the rapporteur' s draft directive concerning seafarers on board ships calling at Community ports."
"The other report concerns the organisation of working hours."
"If you, Mr President, were to have a heart attack any time now, which of course I do not wish upon you, then I hope you will be treated and cared for by a junior doctor who has benefited from sound training and a good night' s sleep, because in a number of EU Member States this is by no means certain."
"It could well be that this doctor has been on duty for 70 hours over the past five days or has carried out medical and even surgical operations for the past 14 hours without a break."
"It could also be that this doctor does not have enough experience in order to carry out this type of work but will do so anyway out of necessity without the supervision of a competent senior."
"Mr President, when you - in good health, I hope - make your way home by car immediately after this session, then you will still not be safe."
"You will be sharing the roads with other vehicles and especially transport operators, including truck drivers."
"They should only drive for 10 hours a day but they also carry out other duties apart from driving, such as cleaning or maintenance."
"These working hours are not regulated in a number of EU Member States."
"So on the way home, you may well have to face a transport operator who has only been driving for 10 hours that day but has spent 5 hours loading and unloading on top of this."
"Consequently, it is important in terms of both public health and road safety that junior doctors and truck drivers respectively are given reasonable breaks and working hours."
"Moreover, working hours form part of health and safety at work and of competition rules, both of which fall within the scope of the European Union."
"Despite this, the entire transport sector, activities at sea and junior doctors are excluded from the scope of the working time directive of 1993."
"In order to nullify this inadequate exemption rule, the Commission drafted a White Paper in 1997 and made an announcement in 1998 which included a draft directive reviewing the working time directive."
"The European Parliament pronounced its opinion as early as the first reading and the Council has since established a common position."
"Meanwhile, the institutional context has changed and we are now involved in a co-decision procedure with the European Council."
"In the capacity of rapporteur, I have sought a balance, not only between the Commission' s draft directive, the first reading of the European Parliament and the Council' s common position, but especially between the safety and health of both workers and the other parties involved."
"So the issue is restricting working hours to benefit the safety and health of employees at work, especially in the various transport sectors, for activities at sea and in the case of junior doctors."
"The Council is right in distinguishing between mobile and non-mobile workers."
"The Social Affairs Committee has adopted this distinction but not the definition issued by the Council."
"According to the Council, mobile workers also include own-account transport operators and transport operators who work outside the transport sector, such as those involved in the transportation of concrete in the timber and construction sectors, for example."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of our Parliament has rejected this definition, partly because these workers would then be partially excluded from the scope of the existing working time directive."
"They presently come under its scope and no problems have materialised so far."
"I therefore wonder why the Council is so keen to introduce a change, hence an amendment."
"Not included in the description of mobile workers are rail transport workers."
"There has been a European collective agreement in place since 1998 which advocates the wholesale inclusion of rail transport in the existing working time directive, barring a few exemptions."
"This has been the case but this collective agreement also states that a solution needs to be found, not only for rail but also for road transport and other methods of transport for which there is, as yet, no solution."
"I would remind the Commission that it has also promised to issue separate proposals for the air-transport sector and internal shipping."
"Nothing has been tabled so far."
"As far as road transport is concerned, as already stated by Mr Hughes, no agreement appears to have been reached within the Council, which I regret."
"At any rate, all mobile workers in the transport sectors are guided by four basic principles which are embodied in the common position on the draft directive and which, in fact, also apply to seafarers and junior doctors; namely four weeks' annual paid leave, restricted annual working hours, appropriate breaks and medical examination in the case of night work."
"This applies without any restrictions to all workers in the transport sector."
"In addition, provisions need to be drafted for each sector with regard to daily breaks, weekly breaks, other breaks and night shifts."
"This has been regulated in the railway sector and this is being regulated here for seafarers and junior doctors."
"Amendment No 3 concerns exemption in the case of work activities where the employees live at considerable distances from their workplace or there is a significant distance between the employee' s various workplaces."
"Needless to say, this deviation applies also, but not exclusively, to the off-shore sector."
"Hence the need for a legal technical amendment."
"Similarly, Amendment No 4 is a legal technical amendment on urban transport."
"Amendment No 5 regulates the weekly working hours of junior doctors."
"The Council and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are aiming for 48 hours over a four-month reference period."
"This is the goal we would like to achieve."
"The Council, however, has accepted a transitional period of 13 years, I repeat 13 years!"
"According to the European Parliament, this is far too long and it proposes a four-year transitional period."
"This is more than adequate."
"A transitional period of 13 years cannot be justified from the point of view of health and safety."
"There have been enough accidents in hospitals involving junior doctors to render the Council' s proposal unjustified."
"So we are in favour of a limited transitional period."
"Amendment No 6 relates to the reference period for calculating weekly working hours in the off-shore sector."
"The Council authorises the Member States to extend the reference period of four months to twelve months."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is in agreement, provided that the two sides of industry involved enter into consultation and negotiation with each other, although this consultation does not have to lead to any agreement."
"Amendment No 7 provides for seafarers on board sea-fishing vessels to work an average of 48 hours per week over a 12-month reference period."
"This is comparable to that provided by a collective agreement for seafarers."
"The time which the Council gives the Member States and hence itself to transpose the directive amending the existing working time directive is, according to the common Council position, four years."
"This is a huge exaggeration, Commissioner."
"It is even the case that only three years were allowed for the transposition of the original directive, which was a great deal more detailed in those days."
"A transitional period of four years is suggested here."
"We would like to restrict this to two years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, working hours are often a matter of give and take, with some flexibility around the edges."
"But sometimes it is also a matter of life and death."
"To conclude, for the millions of transport operators, seafarers, junior doctors, for the patients, the passengers and other road users, it is absolutely essential that a sound agreement is reached swiftly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I now have a heartfelt request for you."
"We are very badly behind with the schedule for this meeting."
"So my request is that you should really stick to your speaking time, and above all that you should actually conclude when the President wields his gavel, and not get carried away in the heat of the moment!"
"Mr President, I will indeed try to do this, although the issue in hand would probably merit 30 minutes."
"Luckily, there is a stream of people from our group who will illustrate this issue."
"I am also very pleased that so many people from my group have expressed an interest in this social issue."
"I think that, in practice, this often means more to people than long debates on macroeconomic dialogues, etc."
"I would like to start by thanking both rapporteurs, Stephen Hughes and Miet Smet, but I would also say a big thankyou to Raf Chanterie, who got the ball rolling in the previous Parliament, for his contribution."
"As far as I can see, although there are few amendments to the documents from Stephen Hughes, this Parliament has invested a great deal of time and effort in the relevant sectors."
"The sectors, however, are very complex indeed and especially with regard to road transport, it is extremely regrettable that no agreement has been reached."
"It is now really up to the Council to reach some sort of resolution, because the minute strikes break out, the whole of Europe will go mad."
"We now have time to solve this matter and this is the time to do it."
"The Council is putting itself in a very vulnerable position if yet again something were to happen in the field of road transport."
"This, of course, applies even more so to the Commission because it has failed to submit any proposals with regard to the other sectors."
"I think that, in general, we have reached acceptable compromises."
"The off-shore sector has proved to be a highly complex area but we eventually reached a sound compromise that is better than the one the Council proposed but not as far-reaching as some attempted to make it."
"Also, I think we have found an extremely good compromise where junior doctors are concerned."
"Here again, I would say that I hope the Council adopts this."
"Actually, I have a proposal."
"Let those individuals in the countries which do not wish to see this issue resolved over a twelve-year period seek treatment by doctors who have worked in excess of 48 hours."
"If they need to perform brain surgery or something similar, let' s volunteer one of the Members of the Council."
"Maybe this would help them realise that it is rather dangerous to have junior doctors work such long hours once the first Council Member has passed away following an operation that went wrong."
"My concern is that this is not happening at the moment but that poorer people are being exposed to this experiment and I do not think that this is the intention."
"All in all, I firmly believe that sound proposals are being tabled and that further negotiations with the Council are certainly called for."
"I would like to talk just briefly about some of the amendments tabled in the report by Mrs Smet."
"First of all Amendment No 5 relating to the working time of junior doctors in training."
"I agree absolutely with the amendment that has been tabled here reinstating the first reading position."
"I know certain Member States feel that a far longer transition period will be necessary."
"It might well be that the maintenance of this amendment will take us into conciliation."
"That will give us an opportunity to look at the circumstances facing certain Member States but for now I think it is absolutely right that we stick to this amendment."
"Mr Pronk is absolutely right."
"We should ask ourselves would we want to be receiving an injection from a doctor at the end of an 18-hour working day, which is not unusual."
"In the offshore sector, Amendment No 6 - we have looked long and hard to try to come up with a formulation that will make sure that we get a collective agreement leading to the maximum flexibility available under the directive, that is annualisation of working time."
"The formulation of the common position would have simply allowed the employers to walk away from attempts to reach negotiation on annualisation of working time and Member States could then have allowed annualisation."
"We have built in an addition here that will ask for a review after five years involving the two sides of industry at European level to see how the regime is functioning in this sector with particular reference to the health and safety of the workers involved."
"Amendment No 7 relates to sea fishing."
"The effect of this amendment will be to try to limit to one year the reference period available for the annualisation of the calculation of working time, in other words making sure that annualisation of working time is possible but no more."
"If we go to two, three or more years as the reference period for the calculation of working time it becomes absolutely meaningless and we feel that the maximum flexibility of one year annualisation should be sufficient."
"In Amendment No 8 we look at the issue of the transposition period to be allowed to the Member States."
"The common position proposes four years which I think is without precedent in the social area."
"We have looked in this amendment to return to the first reading position of two years."
"Perhaps again this is something that will be subject to conciliation but we will have to see if and when that is triggered following our vote tomorrow."
"My final point relates to urban transport, Amendment No 9."
"We have also built in here a review in order to try to remove an anomaly."
"The way things stand we would have a different regime applying to a person driving a tram to a person driving an urban bus."
"That needs to be reviewed."
"We think a five-year time period should be sufficient."
"Mr President, we generally welcome these reports and their recommendations."
"I particularly want to speak about doctors in training."
"As others have said, it has been a concern in a number of Member States for many years and of particular concern for EU residents who travel, let alone those who reside in places like the United Kingdom or Ireland."
"Some Member States have clearly not acted quickly enough on this."
"Looking at some of the rates of pay for overtime one might understand their lack of incentive."
"However, we believe that now is the time to up the pace for change."
"The working time for more than one quarter of a million doctors in training in the European Union is an issue of health and safety for the doctors themselves, who should have the same rights to safeguard their health and personal lives as those they treat."
"It is a similar issue for those who need treatment."
"We want to be sure that those treating us are able to act effectively and efficiently, which we cannot be when we have research showing that 24 hours of sustained wakefulness reduces performance to levels associated with excessive alcohol intake without - I would argue - some of the pleasures."
"Training doctors is a lengthy and expensive business, we are told."
"It is a reason for giving a lengthy implementation time, some governments argue."
"However, there is reason to believe that the harsh working hours contribute to a significant drop-out rate, with a particular impact on women junior doctors."
"We therefore urge colleagues to support the four years proposed in this report because we believe we need to accelerate change through negotiation."
"Mr President, ensuring the same working hours for seafarers on board Community vessels as for seafarers on board vessels flying the flag of third countries using Community ports is undoubtedly a positive measure."
"Of course, I do not agree with the date of implementation of that measure being postponed until the end of 2002."
"It should have taken immediate effect."
"May I take the opportunity, however, to denounce the unacceptable situation on ships at present."
"My country is a country with an advanced merchant navy and so we know what we are talking about."
"We have increased workloads and exploitation of seafarers by ship owners, and, at the same time, the situation with regard to health and safety of life at sea is worsening."
"We have many fatal naval accidents making ship owners wealthier and seafarers fewer."
"Of course, those responsible for this situation are the politicians who allow unrestrained action to ship owners who, in many ways, are forcing their crews to work very hard in exceptionally dangerous conditions, very often pushing them to the limits of human endurance."
"Those same politicians are making reductions in the number of workers per ship."
"Therefore, if the real cause of the problems facing seafarers is not identified or recognised, then it would be pointless to introduce measures and create control mechanisms, such as the one concerning the rest period for seafarers which will not only be ineffective but will also be hypocritical as it will only increase workloads and lead to even greater exploitation."
"It is essential that demands for a five-day, 35-hour, working week with no more that 7 - 8 hours work per day, are met, and with pay rises. We must also put an end to regulations obliging seafarers to work a 12-hour day as standard."
"It is imperative that the operational crew members on board ships be increased."
"In any case, Mr President, we support the just demands of the seafarers and we shall stand by them. And regardless of how positive those directives may be or whatever improvements may come of it, we cannot vote for them since they will eventually perpetuate the current unacceptable state of affairs."
"Mr President, I, like my colleagues, would like to congratulate both our rapporteurs on the presentation of their work."
"Also, as this is the first opportunity I have had, I should like to welcome the Commissioner to the House for this debate."
"The whole area of working time and the directive have created a lot of difficulties for individual Members and also in Member States."
"I feel that whilst each of us in this House would welcome the opportunity to ensure a safer working environment, not only for employees, but also for consumers and other users of transport and so on, we have to ensure that we do not over-regulate in any individual area."
"Therefore, my group will be seeking separate votes on certain paragraphs, in particular within the Smet report."
"When framing legislation we have an obligation to ensure that legislation is effective, that it can be easily enforced and that it does not impose an onerous burden on employees or enterprises."
"I feel there are some areas within the present proposals which will create difficulties."
"Firstly, with regard to mobile workers, the exclusion of own-account operators from the definition will subject this group to the full rigours of the original working time directive."
"This will mean, for instance, that in the road transport area there will be three categories of operators: own-account, third party hauliers and self-employed."
"Secondly, the deletion of mobile workers from Article 17 dilutes the opportunity for mobile workers to extend the reference period from 4 to 12 months."
"Thirdly, the proposed sector-specific directive for working time in road transport, when finalised, will supersede this common position and will provide a more detailed regulatory framework for this area."
"In the light of these issues we should be cognisant of the difficulties which will be created."
"Therefore I am recommending a negative vote in relation to these areas."
"There is one further point to bear in mind."
"The intention of the introduction of this legislation, as I said earlier, was protection of health and safety."
"However, I have in my possession a study carried out by University College, Dublin, which highlights the negative impact of this proposed extension of the directive, not only on the grounds of safety and competitiveness, but also on the grounds of damage to the environment."
"The Commission already has a copy of this study."
"I would welcome a response from it with regard to the points highlighted in it."
"I should like to refer very briefly to some of the points highlighted."
"Firstly, the overall cost of the directive would be far greater than that proposed under the impact assessment."
"Secondly, the average cost increase for firms in this study would be in excess by about a hundred times that of the study carried out by the EC which stated that it would be 0.2%."
"The impact of this directive will not be uniform across all sectors of the economy and therefore it will negatively impact on certain sectors, in particular those areas that are more heavily dependent on transport."
"Thirdly, it is likely that rather than aligning competition, the application of a single standard across all road transport and other transport areas in some Member States will actually distort competition."
"The proposals will also lead to a conflict with other goals with regard to the regulation of traffic to reduce congestion and other impacts."
"Finally, we already have in place in the transport sector tachograph requirements which are rigorously enforced in all Member States and which may be one way of dealing with some of the concerns about the health and safety aspect."
"We should look at modifying and solidifying those tachograph requirements."
"In Ireland we have a road safety plan which has been in operation since 1998."
"This is a five-year plan which aims to reduce road deaths, the amount of traffic on the roads and to ensure that the quality of vehicles on the road meet the highest possible standards to protect the environment."
"The next point I want to cover is with regard to junior doctors and training."
"This is an area that has been fraught with danger for the Member States."
"I believe everybody in this House would welcome the opportunity to give a very positive and assertive vote in favour of the proposals put forward by Mrs Smith in her report with regard to reducing the transitional period to four years."
"There is no reason why we need a 13-year introduction."
"Even the common position proposal of 7 years is too long."
"Each of us is fully aware that junior doctors in training carry out tasks which are virtually the same as those carried out by their so-called ""masters"" , the consultants."
"Indeed, in 1994 the report commissioned by the European Commission which looked at this whole area of junior doctors in training highlighted seven points which need immediate action: the excessive hours of work in some countries; the question of on-call duties; unrealistic rostering periods; protracted periods of continuous duty; the distribution of duties between junior doctors and senior doctors; informal pressures on doctors in training; the vulnerability of breaks and time off in the face of the pressure of service needed."
"I have had several meetings with junior doctors in Ireland over the last number of months with regard to this issue."
"One of the areas that is of highest concern to them is that because of the existence in Ireland - and in Britain as well, for example - of the archaic feudal-type system whereby junior doctors in training are apprenticed - I use that word broadly - to senior consultants, they are afraid to raise too many issues of concern, because it might affect their future careers."
"What we have to guarantee is that the proper level of health care and health protection can be given to patients in the health service and also, that junior doctors are given the highest possible level of training with proper standards for their working conditions and working time - this will mean a reduction in the amount of hours that are worked - and also, the other so-called duties which they are obliged to carry out merely to deliver the service."
"We have a model in Australia and New Zealand which could usefully be copied in the European Union Member States."
"Finally, with regard to the concerns of fishermen, special consideration has to be given to this special sector."
"There is no other sector to which it can be compared. The proposals put forward are unrealistic and impractical."
"We must ensure that fishermen' s rights to earn their living are not hindered by ridiculous regulation."
"Mr President, I will restrict myself to saying how extremely bewildered I am, not so much by the rapporteur' s work, but by what is happening in the maritime world."
"This is an extremely important sector."
"I come from a country, Italy, where this sector has always been of considerable importance because of the employment it has created, and it is a sector which no longer manages to give workers what it used to."
"Workers in this sector have experienced a veritable regression; they have gone back in time."
"Today, they earn less and work more, victims of a liberal capitalism which makes them real victims in this sector."
"Even moving the implementation of the agreements to 2002 has baffled us."
"We believe that Parliament must do more, do it soon and do it well in order to rectify the situation."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Smet on her report."
"I should like to concentrate on two specific categories: junior doctors and fishermen."
"Concerning junior doctors, I was delighted that the European Parliament, in committee, has agreed on Amendment No 5 with regard to a transitional period of four years instead of the Council position of nine years, which I believe is too long."
"Doctors have our lives in their hands."
"It is important that they are included in the working time directive."
"I was worried about the weekly working hours and how they should not exceed the 54 hours over a four-month reference period."
"That is why I would like you, for the same reasons, to support Amendment No 10 tabled in my name."
"I should like to mention here that on the order paper it looks as if I had taken out some of the recital 11. In fact my amendment is purely and simply an addition, an add-on to recital 11."
"I am not taking out anything in that."
"I ask for your support."
"It is important also with derogations on minimum daily rest periods that we still have adequate rest for doctors."
"I know doctors in the UK who work 56-hour shifts consecutively; 9 am on Saturday to 5 p.m. on Monday is not uncommon."
"We are not asking for an 11-hour rest period."
"We are asking for, say, six hours within a 24-hour period."
"That is not asking too much."
"If doctors do not get that their judgment will suffer."
"We do not allow people to drink and drive because their coordination is gone."
"I do not believe we should allow junior doctors to be able to practice medicine."
"I urge you to support Amendment No 10."
"Mr President, I want to raise one matter relating to the enforcement of seafarer' s hours, of their working time onboard ships using Community ports."
"I do not really see how this measure can be monitored satisfactorily because the Community ports and the countries within the European Community have no real jurisdiction over those ships that are flagged or owned in overseas countries."
"If we take it forward: Say, for instance, they had agreed that some monitoring was possible - surely they would not have certain working hours outside European Community waters and ports and then change once they were inside our geographical area."
"I have been talking about this with American lawyers over recent weeks - personal friends, I have no interest to declare here."
"They just feel that it is wrong that ports should dictate to owners of ships."
"We want the maximum trade here in the European Union."
"We want to make sure that cruise ships come here, spend money here and give employment to our various countries."
"I do not see how it is possible to monitor a practice that would seem to be more a matter of international law."
"Ship owners and the nations that have these ships flagged in those countries should be monitored elsewhere rather than by European countries."
"Mr President, I want to address primarily the trainee doctors issue."
"But I want to make a few points before I deal with that."
"First of all, the original directive excluded six million workers from its remit."
"It seems to me that was excessive and unfair."
"I cannot see how you can make a distinction between trainee doctors who are fatigued, truck drivers who are fatigued or fishermen who are fatigued."
"They all are a risk either to themselves, to those who work with them, their patients or other road users."
"I do not see how Mr Crowley can make the distinction he has made."
"I hope he is not reflecting the Irish Government' s position in relation to these proposals."
"It is scandalous and unacceptable that trainee doctors in Irish hospitals are expected to work sometimes in excess of 80 hours a week."
"It is scandalous and disgraceful that we have truck drivers who are falling asleep at the wheel, putting the lives of those who are working with them and other road users at risk."
"We know that there is a fairly high rate of road accidents as a result of truck drivers who are driving hours too long."
"For Mr Crowley to claim that the tachograph legislation is rigorously applied in Ireland or anywhere else is simply not true."
"I do not know why that is the case."
"I do not know why it is not rigorously applied but it is not."
"We need to take steps to protect the public at large and patients."
"It is not good enough for any Member State in the Council to say that it would be costly to implement these proposals."
"Of course it will be costly but what price do you put on the life of a child who may be knocked down on the road, or a patient in hospital who may receive wrong treatment as a result of the fatigue of a doctor?"
"It is just not acceptable."
"It is necessary that tomorrow we adopt the position as proposed by the rapporteurs and as proposed by the ESOC Committee and put it to the Council that it must finally come to grips with this issue and ensure that nobody has to work the inhuman hours that we are expecting our trainee doctors to work."
"In relation to truck drivers, it seems to me that the only way to regulate this is to put it into law."
"Own-account truck drivers will work all the hours that they get because they are not sure when they will get another job."
"So it is necessary to apply the law so that they will be forced to take rest and forced not to be on the road when they are simply too tired to drive."
"Mr President, I think the report in question is a quite good one, above all because Parliament' s first positions, especially in Amendment No 5, are being maintained."
"For certain professional groups, establishing working hours is not only a question of doing the obvious and protecting the individuals concerned but also, and to a large degree, a question of our own general safety."
"The roads are not going to become safer and better if those who drive heavy goods vehicles are not alert and wide awake but tired and irritated."
"This is a matter which concerns all of us."
"Young junior doctors' working hours must also be reviewed directly from a public health point of view."
"Firstly, to demand from these young junior doctors an average of up to 60 hours' work per week during a four-month period is ruthless exploitation of young people, because they have to do these shifts in order to pass their exams. Secondly, it is the rest of us who are going to meet these young junior doctors out in health centres and casualty departments."
"In those circumstances, one can only hope that they are fully rested and wide awake and can at any rate judge whether a particular case is one they can deal with themselves or one for which they need recourse to a colleague on duty."
"Once again, I want, as a minimum, to support Parliament' s first position."
"Mr President, the original directive dating back to 1993 on the organisation of working hours was necessary for the health and safety of people at work."
"Also, the present additional directive tabled by Mrs Smet, which includes additional sectors and activities, is of great importance and we give it our full backing."
"In addition to a few previous minor remarks made by my group, I would like to make a few observations."
"In some EU countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium and Finland, employers in road transport have, within the framework of a strategy of contracting-out and more flexibility, rendered their wheels i.e. trucks and transport operators independent as it were."
"They hire these zelfstandigen zonder personeel (staffless own-account workers), as they are referred to in the Netherlands, to carry out the same activities."
"These own-account transport operators are no longer in someone' s employment but their role is virtually the same and the risks are to be borne by them."
"Both trade unions and employers' organisations would like to see arrangements made for them."
"So they fall outside the scope of this new directive."
"Their health and safety is not protected because they are self-employed."
"They hardly seem to be involved in the consultation between the European social partners in this respect."
"In fact, this phenomenon can also be identified in other sectors, such as the building sector and a few others besides."
"The social issues which we are facing here seem to reflect to a certain degree some of the guidelines from the employment policy."
"We should think very carefully about what this means."
"As far as I know, a number of guidelines are being drafted behind the scenes but there are also barriers to these activities and their implementation."
"I would urge the Commission to raise this issue as soon as possible and make the necessary additional proposals."
"Mr President, the working hours in question are those for quite special but, nonetheless, very important areas."
"Now that we have common legislation on working hours within the EU, it is in fact incomprehensible and unacceptable that key groups such as young doctors, train drivers and air crew, seafarers and other such groups should be exempt."
"On the contrary, it might be thought that these particular groups might have a special need for legislation of this kind."
"I believe that this situation is due to a number of factors, and partly to particularly bad traditions."
"In the case of the mobile professions, for example, there are poor conditions for safety work of a practical and technical nature."
"At the same time, employers have had a great need for continuity of service or production, and this has become the decisive factor."
"It should also be remembered that, as we have mentioned here, there are also traditions of this kind where young doctors are concerned. One example - which a number of people here have mentioned - is that of young doctors' dependence upon senior physicians and professors."
"Someone talked of feudal traditions, in which case what is meant is old traditions which force young doctors to work in a way and to a degree that is harmful."
"Their professional future depends upon their doing this."
"Traditions such as these must be broken."
"Most people seem to be in agreement with this."
"Where agreement breaks down is in the wish to postpone the necessary changes, perhaps for financial or practical reasons."
"This is something which this Parliament must oppose."
"We must attach much more importance to the protection of workers than is implied by this type of short-term, expedient reasoning."
"I think we should also remember the need to emphasise that unusual, different and, in various ways, mobile labour markets should also be brought under the umbrella of this directive."
"In fact, we are getting more and more professional groups who are working under mobile conditions, together with more and more individuals in the labour market who have mobile working conditions."
"If we have a situation in which in which it is possible to have exemptions from the labour market directive, then we are going to have more and more groups who will be able to maintain that specifically their own workforce should be exempt."
"I therefore think that it is a very good thing that we have obtained these two reports."
"I want to give them my wholehearted support, but I want at the same time to draw attention to a third factor."
"We have to think not only about showing consideration for employees and employers. There are also third parties involved."
"A high proportion of the groups of employees concerned provide services to consumers or operate utilities on their behalf."
"We are concerned here, for example, with passengers at risk of travelling in aircraft flown by tired-out pilots and of patients at risk of being treated by exhausted doctors."
"This is naturally unacceptable."
"We must therefore set limits upon what the general public can be expected to accept in this regard."
"We cannot, of course, accept transition periods of seven or thirteen years."
"My Group and I should like to have seen us go much further in certain respects, but we are nonetheless satisfied with the developments which have taken place and think that the two reports are excellent."
"There have been some easy and pious words spread around tonight on working time."
"As everyone knows, it is effectively about health and safety."
"Yet it is fraught with problems."
"Nonetheless it should apply to all workers as an absolute principle, whoever they are."
"It is easy to see how some people pick on some groups but will not highlight the need for it to be applied to others."
"Of course, Mrs Smet, who has brought forward this report, having picked it up from the last Parliament, has to accept that as a former Council member she had to accept the common position of the Council which she now rejects."
"Missing in all this debate quite clearly are the necessary staged processes by Member States."
"It is after all an inelastic supply in certain circumstances, just as it is with doctors in training."
"Missing also are the efforts already made in certain Member States."
"In the UK, for example, proposals are in advance of this directive and have been welcomed by Andrew Hobart, chairman of the junior doctors' committee who says he is delighted that an understanding has been reached on a new contract for junior doctors which will guarantee safe working hours in advance in the United Kingdom."
"Deep sea fishing -here is an area unique in its case which proves the rule that this working time directive is fraught with practical problems."
"But, after all, perhaps I can afford a smile."
"I agree with the principles of this report. I disagree with the estimated effects of all these amendments, but I think that is consistent with my position at all times."
"It will be interesting to see how some who feel free to pick and choose who should have effective limits on working time and who should not can explain that to the workers affected."
"Also, what about the emergency workers - paramedics and others."
"Do not they deserve to be a special case too?"
"So before we get smug in our concern for just certain groups, what about sparing a thought for those others who carry out emergency health care at all times and are also derogated from certain aspects of the working time directive."
"Less smugness please, more practical application."
"In general terms I find Mrs Smet' s report and most of the committee' s amendments wholly acceptable and worthy of support."
"Others have referred to particular activities and sectors which are proposed to be covered for the first time by working time regulations."
"For example, my group colleague, Mrs Lambert, referred to doctors in training and I associate myself totally with her remarks and support the proposals relating to that sector."
"I do have a concern though that sea-fishermen, especially share fishermen, who are wholly self-employed, will be adversely affected by some aspects of these proposals and I seek some clarification of this."
"Share fishermen jointly own their vessels and are paid solely by share of their catches."
"Their work patterns are dictated by factors outwith any control, such as weather conditions and fish movements, and therefore it is difficult to imagine how restrictions on working time could possibly be practical in this sector."
"Of course, health and safety issues are a major reason for limiting working time but fisheries is already subject to codes of practice and to regulations which are monitored by competent authorities."
"Share fishermen up to now have been assured that their unique circumstances would be catered for through exemption."
"I believe that share fishermen must continue to be regarded as a special case and not subjected to impractical regulations."
"I will be taking full account of the potential impact on fishermen of the various proposals and amendments before casting my vote tomorrow."
"I will be listening very carefully to the summing up of this debate for indications that the needs of share fishermen particularly can be accommodated satisfactorily."
"Mr President, within a free market with unrestricted competition, the business that produces the cheapest product has the best chance of survival, even if the product can only be cheap on account of bad working conditions, poor wages, environmental pollution or cruelty to animals."
"We can see this on a large scale in the fight for new agreements in the World Trade Organisation and on a small scale in the fight over working hours within the EU Member States."
"Employers would like to think that workers are always available, even after more than 8 consecutive hours or in the evenings, at nights, Saturdays and Sundays."
"Paid work is still seen as a commodity."
"Safety and conditions at work, despite improved legislation, still leave a great deal to be desired."
"In fact, the efforts required are invariably more demanding than before."
"Working has increasingly become a type of top-class sport."
"Only few will sustain it in the long term."
"Many burn out long before their pensionable age due to overworking."
"This is why we desperately need to protect all workers against wear-and-tear, accidents, overworking and lack of consecutive time off which can be spent as one chooses."
"This should be a right for everybody, without exceptions."
"Employers, however, keep pressing for exemptions: exemptions for weak industries which have grown big on the back of production costs kept too low and their nineteenth-century industrial relations."
"As long as we tolerate this, there will be groups of workers who are discriminated against."
"In the case of industries which rely on this, there is something wrong."
"This applies especially to road transport which is far too cheap and passes an increasing amount of business risks onto the transport operators by forcing them to join the ranks of the vulnerable self-employed."
"It is not a coincidence that the exceptions largely relate to mobile workers and people who earn their living at sea in either the fishing or oil industry."
"After all, it is more difficult for them than their colleagues in other industries to stand up against discrimination, especially as they are not constantly together with their colleagues at a fixed place of work which is easily accessible for the trade-union representatives."
"Only in the case of people with special responsibilities and high rewards commensurate with these could it be justified to require, if necessary, working hours that deviate from the norm."
"If, on the other hand, workers in the weakest positions have to work longer hours, then there is something amiss."
"This then only happens for the benefit of the competitive battle between companies that work at prices which are too low or that are aiming for profits which are too high."
"I therefore urge that we do not refer the solutions to this problem back to the consultation between the trade union and employers' organisations since it is precisely the position of parts of these groups of workers that is still too weak."
"Negotiations do not solve their problems fast enough."
"This is why exceptions must be deleted, transitional periods must be short and the traditional rights to Sunday rest actively protected and maintained."
"The first thing that I would like to say is that the 1993 directive on working conditions is quite inadequate and leaves room for all sorts of excesses."
"Nevertheless, the legal grounds speak of the need to harmonise social conditions with progress."
"I deduce from this then that the overall aim is to bring working conditions into line with those of the more advanced countries of the European Union."
"Now, forty-eight working hours per week, just one day of rest per week and an eleven hour break between two working days are proposals which already fall short of the gains made in some Member States."
"This directive leaves room for all kinds of exemptions, which make the situation even worse and as a result, it is not acceptable."
"If it is extended to railway and airline employees, it would even constitute a step backwards, as the legislation in some Member States is more advanced."
"It is absolutely essential that measures which are favourable to workers and which are in force in certain European countries are not abandoned under any pretext and that includes on the grounds of competition in particular."
"In France, for example, where women' s night work is very strictly regulated, no European directive should have jeopardised this right which, on the contrary, should have been extended to all European working women."
"Mr President, I want to talk about Amendment No 5 which deals with trainee doctors."
"The improvements which are being proposed are absolutely essential."
"First of all, we are talking about the safety of patients, that is to say of ourselves, and of a situation in which doctors are alert and manage to fulfil their vital tasks."
"Secondly, we are talking about public health."
"Who among us, or who anywhere, would thrive on having the long working weeks, sometimes of over 100 hours in certain Member States, which some young doctors have?"
"Thirdly, we are talking about doctors as models for others and their life-styles."
"Fourthly, what we have here is a central labour-market issue about the length of the working week."
"It is only right that the European Parliament should be urging governments to act more quickly."
"Thirteen years is an indefensibly long changeover period."
"Four years is a more reasonable period."
"I also see the European Parliament as having an important role in forming opinion and instigating change."
"In a previous intervention, Mr Skinner took offence at the fact that a certain group, in this case young doctors, had had its case selected for discussion here in the European Parliament and that the debate should be focused upon this group in particular."
"Remember, this should be seen as just one example among many of one group of employees' conditions being improved in such a way that other groups too will benefit."
"Enough envy predominates in plenty of other contexts."
"Let us see this as an improvement for one group from which other groups will also derive benefit."
"Clearly there is some misunderstanding."
"I take note."
"Mrs Doyle has listed many of the technical points I wished to make about the conditions of junior working doctors."
"It is ironic on the eve of the millennium that we are discussing the working conditions of doctors who are working in what could only be described as Dickensian situations."
"They have long working hours in difficult circumstances with little or no recognition in terms of government policy to the serious difficulties they are encountering."
"I hope very much that Parliament will clearly indicate their support for the re-introduction of the original time of four years for the inclusion of junior doctors in this directive."
"It is amazing that in this day and age people with such huge responsibilities are working under such difficult circumstances."
"Mr President, would you get into a plane flown by a pilot who was exhausted and had worked more than 70 hours in a week?"
"I would not, and I am sure no other colleague would either."
"I was a nurse, I dread to tell you how many years ago, but in those days the technical demands on both doctors and nurses were considerably less than they are now."
"Now doctors - and, of course, nurses as well, I must make a point for them too - are expected to be highly technologically proficient."
"We all know how dicey it becomes when we are exhausted doing something as simple as working on our computers."
"So how much more so dealing with technical issues."
"These young doctors, these junior doctors, are dealing with serious emergencies in a condition of extreme exhaustion."
"I hope very much, Mr President, and clearly from the debate so far, our colleagues also share this concern, that they will support all the amendments and I thank Mrs Smet very much for the amount of serious consideration she has given to this particular issue."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Hughes, on the report on the organisation of seafarer' s working time and for his proposal to Parliament to approve, without amendments, the Council' s common position on the enforcement of seafarers' hours of work on board ships using Community ports."
"The approval of the proposal without amendments will allow the procedure to be closed once and for all and therefore complete our work in the field of working hours in this maritime sector."
"I would like to remind Parliament that last June the Council adopted Directive 99/63, which incorporates into Community law the agreement on the organisation of seafarers' working time, signed by the social partners in the maritime transport sector."
"And I believe that one of the great successes of this measure is the fact that we are following up an agreement between the social partners themselves, which guarantees - I believe - the effectiveness of this agreement."
"Therefore, Mr President, both the directive on the agreement and the current draft directive will enter into force on 30 June 2002."
"This time period is considered necessary so that the Member States may ratify the relevant agreements of the ILO on the hours of work in maritime transport."
"The ratification of the instruments of the ILO is in fact a necessary condition so that foreign ships which call at EU ports may be boarded for inspection, which will allow us, amongst other things, to prevent unfair competition within our own ports."
"Mr President, lastly, I would to expressly thank the European Parliament once again, and especially Mr Hughes, for the work carried out and for your support for the proposal."
"Mr President, Members of Parliament, I would like to congratulate and thank Mrs Smet. I must stress from the outset that today we are discussing the amendment to the directive concerning the branches of workers not included in the directive on the organisation of working time, which has been under discussion for 6 years."
"It is a very important issue and it has been a political challenge for us to finally come up with a realistic and pursuable proposal. This is what we need."
"Because of the discussions which have taken place following the action by Parliament and the Council of Ministers, I feel that we are now close to that goal."
"The Commission may accept most of Mrs Smet' s proposals, either fully or in principle."
"I would like to point out that Amendment Nos 2, 3, 4 and 8 will probably be accepted fully."
"Furthermore, the Commission will probably agree in principle on Amendment Nos 6, 7, and 9, which may need further clarification in their wording, although we totally agree with their content."
"Furthermore, it must be made absolutely clear that the Commission upholds the right of initiative as regards the proposals arising from the revisions."
"There are therefore two amendments which are particularly problematic; those concerning practising doctors and those concerning Sunday as a rest day."
"Most of the speakers referred specifically to junior trainee doctors and to their working conditions."
"I must stress that there is a great discrepancy between the Council' s proposal and that of the European Parliament, and the Commission has a half-way house proposal to limit the working week to 48 hours within a 7 year transition period."
"We believe that this proposal can help resolve and ultimately push forward this directive."
"Of course, this is not totally satisfactory for working doctors, but for this particularly complex problem we must take into consideration the policies of Member States on local national health systems and the different practices as regards the training period for doctors and the required transition period in each country. Then we must endeavour in realistic terms, to find a half-way house solution which will finally allow us to make headway."
"The second issue concerns Sunday rest."
"If the Commission decides to revise the entire directive on the organisation of working hours and, from the outset, to put forward the issues of Sunday rest, which is now a major topic of discussion and one which the European Court of Justice has already delivered judgments on, then there is the danger that this issue may never actually be resolved and that we will again reach a deadlock in our search for the perfect solution."
"I would like to express my gratitude to Parliament for supporting the efforts of the Commission on the issue of the directive, but it is clear that we need a conciliation procedure for those important outstanding issues."
"These issues include transitional provisions for practising doctors, the date for implementation of the whole directive and working hours for the crew of boats working at sea."
"For two of these issues, sea-fishing and the date of implementation, the Commission supports Parliament' s position."
"As a result of the issue raised today under Amendment No 10 which is something which has only just come to our attention, I would say that from the initial recommendation of my colleagues, apparently this already exists and is covered in article 17 paragraph 2. However, to be more certain and because this is only our first assessment, I feel that we will be able to provide a concrete answer on this amendment by tomorrow."
"Members of Parliament, I believe that the most important issue and also the most difficult one for this conciliation committee and for finding a favourable solution is the issue of the directive on doctors which I spoke about before."
"It is my firm belief that, and I am appealing to you all, we must adopt a realistic approach on all sides so that we can all have an effective directive which will act as an initial safeguard for trainee doctors."
"If, by adopting maximalist approaches and trying to achieve the impossible, we do not in fact reach the required compromise, then I fear that this directive will, for many years, remain on the table without us even making any progress on it."
"I believe that through this whole conciliation procedure we will be able to make swift headway towards a directive which will, in due course, be voted for by the Council."
"With your permission, in the debate I made specific reference to share fishermen and sought specific assurances about the position of share fishermen."
"I detected no reference whatsoever to share fishermen and their position in the answers."
"I wonder if you would permit a specific answer to be given."
"In a previous debate on the subject when I made similar comments, the then Commissioner made it very clear in the summing up that share fishermen were not included in the proposals."
"Can the Commissioner confirm whether that is or is not still the case?"
"Mr President, I did not entirely understand the question."
"Could the speaker please repeat it?"
"With your permission again, share fishermen, as I attempted to explain clearly, are self-employed due to the nature of their ownership and operation of their vessels."
"Previously, share fishermen were specifically exempt from working time regulations in the same way that other self-employed people are or had been."
"I just asked for clarification of whether the particular position of share fishermen has changed since the previous debate?"
"The article of the previous directive still applies here, according to which self-employed share fishermen are subject to national legislation as regards their licences and choice of working conditions."
"The directive concerns only fishermen in an employer-employee relationship."
"I was just saying that the issue is whether fishermen of that kind are regarded as employed or not."
"This is critical to us and the Commission has still omitted to answer the question."
"I shall repeat, although I feel I was quite clear: the working practices of self-employed share fishermen are defined by national legislation."
"We are talking here of a specific employer-employee relationship."
"I do not believe I can provide further clarification."
"I would just like clarification as to when the Commissioner believes the conciliation process on the junior doctors will commence."
"Obviously, this is of great concern."
"I accept her point that there will probably have to be compromise on all sides but I would be interested to know when she anticipates conciliation starting."
"The conciliation process will begin over the next four months."
"It will certainly depend on the Council and on the developments following on from the discussion in Council."
"Mrs Lynne, please tell me on which Rule you are basing your request for the floor for a procedural motion."
"With respect, we are still not very clear whether the Commission intends share fishermen to be included in this article or not."
"We need clarification in some of the parties."
"I am not prepared to break our rules."
"This is a very elegant attempt to reopen the debate and I am not going to tolerate it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."

"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0049/1999) by Mr Gahrton, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concluding the Agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the People' s Republic of China [COM(1999)0287 - C5-0038/1999 - 1999/0123(CNS)]"
"Mr President, it is of course an incredibly important event when the EU is to enter into an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation with the People' s Republic of China, because we all know that China is the big country which will decide a large part of our common future."
"My own basic attitude to the agreement, as rapporteur, and also that of the Committee, is that this is a good Agreement."
"It is important and positive that we should go through this process in order to reach an agreement."
"The Chinese Authorities have recently introduced a number of reforms in line with the broad principles agreed at the 1992 United Nations World Conference on Environment and Development in Rio."
"The European Union is prepared to offer further support to the Chinese Government towards achieving its objectives."
"That is part of the agreement."
"This should especially improve environmental protection and limit the negative impact of industrial growth and urbanisation on the well-being of the Chinese population."
"It is important that this should be stated clearly in the texts of the agreement and that we understand that our type of industrialisation has many positive sides, but also a number of negative sides."
"For the EU' s part, we are funding joint research projects, especially in biotechnology applied to agriculture, medicine, health care and natural resources."
"In this regard, concerns have been raised, and with some justice, about the lack of ethical constraints in China, especially in human genetic research."
"It is very important indeed that we should be well aware of this when we enter into the agreements concerned."
"Various organisations have also pointed out that there are risks of proliferation of bio-weapons technology."
"The EU will supply technical assistance to develop energy resources and promote energy efficiency, energy conservation and clean or renewable energy supply, as well as promoting the use of environmentally friendly technology."
"We are now becoming involved with China in aspects of this cooperative work."
"This is important, not least when it is borne in mind that China produces 15 million tons of sulphur dioxide, causing acid rain, and over 13 million tons of particulate pollutants."
"These are some of the signs that suggest that our partnership with China is extremely important and could also lead to a better environment for ourselves and the whole world."
"The Committee has made up its mind that this is, on balance, a sound agreement."
"We have accepted it, and I completely support our having done so."
"I just have a few remarks along the way."
"They are not binding upon Parliament, as the decision process is, but I hope that the results of certain aspects of scientific cooperation are applied with caution and that, in view of the lack of ethical constraints in China, we avoid cooperation in the field of biotechnology."
"I think it is very important indeed that we should be sure to check up on what would happen in China following this type of cooperation before we enter into any concrete agreements."
"There is also a quite different aspect of the agreement which has a considerable air of secrecy about it."
"I am assuming that when section 5 of the annex relating to intellectual property rights is applied, it will be ensured that it is not applied word for word but in a way that accords more with the general rules of openness which now happily apply more and more within our European Union."
"To summarise, I recommend that we accept this agreement with China which is important for ourselves, for China and for our common future."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy supports the report of the committee responsible and the rapporteur' s presentation."
"We hope that intensive scientific and technical cooperation will also enhance the overall dialogue between scientists and thus lead to greater freedom of expression, and that this will accordingly be a helpful step towards liberalisation in China."
"We do not know of any cases where a scientist has been persecuted or arrested because of his scientific work, but I do know that in recent years any number of scientists have been persecuted or arrested because of their political beliefs, and we consider that this opportunity should be taken to make it clear that such people should be released."
"Mr President, allow me to make one more brief comment, as this will shorten this evening' s proceedings: my committee also believes that the report on the scientific and technical agreement with Argentina should also be viewed in a positive light."
"We have also reached a similar opinion regarding Russia."
"If the rapporteur, should she touch on this subject, were to propose that this agreement should be abandoned, then the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would totally support this request, as this would be a sensible step given the war in Chechnya, as a means of pointing the way to the future regarding this issue."
"In any case, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would support such an initiative if the committee responsible could see its way to come to such a decision."
"Mr President, my group fundamentally welcomes the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the People' s Republic of China."
"The agreement forms part of the Commission' s policy, as described in various Commission communications in recent years."
"China also needs to be included in the international research and development framework, and political and economic links need to be developed."
"The EU and China need to conclude a separate scientific and technological agreement in order to improve and extend cooperation in fields such as energy, the environment, life sciences, abiotic sciences, transport, telematics, information technology and communications."
"This will serve to strengthen the presence of European economic actors in China."
"All the Commission representatives who know me will be aware that it is unusual for me to quote their documents at such length!"
"Not only will the presence of European economic actors in China be strengthened in this way, but also the presence of Chinese research institutions in the EU."
"I accordingly believe that this cooperation will be of great benefit to both sides, and that the democratic process can in this way also be promoted through greater cooperation and an enhanced dialogue."
"We are working on the assumption that the agreement could contribute to greater freedom of thought."
"It is certainly unheard of for scientists to be persecuted for talking about science."
"However, we do know that in many cases freedom of expression cannot always be taken for granted and I now appeal to China to move towards greater democracy and openness in this area."
"However, on behalf of my group I would like to emphasise that we are not in agreement with the rapporteur' s conclusions, as described in his explanatory statement."
"However, it is not customary for Parliament to vote on explanatory statements."
"So we will vote for the report, which consists of one sentence."
"But please do not assume, Mr Gahrton, that your statement reflects the views of this House."
"At best it represents the views of a small part of it."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists will also be voting for this report."
"We believe that international cooperation is bound to benefit from research, without denying that there are also certain risks."
"However, in the case of China, I would also like to point out that cooperation with this country in not a one-way process with Europeans bearing their fine gifts on a golden platter - we can also learn from the Chinese."
"As we are going to discuss Argentina later on, I would like to remind you of something. The compass came to us from China via the Arabs, and if we had not been given the compass, we would probably not have discovered America either."
"We could then forget about the report on Argentina!"
"So European culture has learnt something from China, and I hope that will continue to apply in future."
"Our problem with China - which has already quite rightly been pointed out and which is not limited to this one country - is human rights."
"With China there is also the issue of Tibet, their threatening behaviour towards Taiwan, and so on."
"Nevertheless, I would like to warn again using research as a political weapon, as a means of putting pressure on a country over such issues."
"I do not believe that works."
"In any case, we end up punishing the wrong people since, in general, scientists are our allies, at least in spirit."
"The subjects listed here are quite reasonable - health, the environment, food and so forth."
"Let me remind you that we are not talking about nuclear cooperation."
"Nor are we planning joint development of arms, no, we are considering reasonable issues of benefit to people there and also, indirectly, to us in Europe."
"To conclude, perhaps I could mention an idea of my own."
"I can well imagine that in view of China' s great importance it would make sense to have an EU-China research institute or a facility where Chinese and Europeans could work on one or more long-term projects."
"So Chinese and Europeans would work together on a single site, be it in China or in Europe."
"An experience of this kind, learning each other' s language and understanding each other' s culture, could be extraordinarily attractive and stimulating for both sides."
"There is no mention of this in the project, but I simply wanted to propose it here."
"Perhaps we could consider this when we sign our next agreement with China."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the liberal group is delighted that scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and China is being stepped up."
"Collaboration between scientists promotes mutual understanding of each other' s cultures."
"This could serve as a catalyst to intensify the dialogue with China and, in time, to improve democracy and the human rights situation."
"Since the People' s Republic of China accounts for a quarter of the global population and has great economic potential, its involvement in European research and technological projects is of huge importance."
"I agree with Rolf Linkohr, both sides can benefit."
"But a lot can be gained in the field of environment and energy too."
"Technical support for the promotion of energy efficiency, saving energy and clean and renewable energy sources will enable China to reduce the production of CO2."
"If there is transfer of expertise then the European Union may be able to achieve part of its own CO2 objectives over there."
"My second point concerns cooperation in the field of information and communication technology."
"The problem in this context is access to the Internet."
"The Internet is the first medium which enables worldwide, interactive communication."
"But the Chinese government wants to monitor the free flow of information and the freedom of speech via the Internet."
"This will not benefit the development of information and communication technology."
"In order to continue to grant the Chinese access to the worldwide web, it is essential to cooperate with China in this field."
"An honest dialogue will keep the door open for new developments, such as e-commerce, where China also forms a large potential market."
"Mr President, I would like to ask all those here to think about the process of democratisation in China."
"I think that everything that we have seen over the last few months shows that the opposite is taking place: the huge increase in the arrest of dissidents, the persecution of the so-called sect, the Falun Gong, etc."
"Obviously it is possible to maintain a strategic relationship with an undemocratic country, with a dictatorship."
"The communist regime has many faithful friends here, starting with Mr Gahrton, who is endlessly asking us to resume and strengthen our links with the People' s Republic of China."
"There is another country, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, with a billion inhabitants, and which is the largest democracy on earth, India; and we always forget about that country and develop no strategy towards it."
"Even though it is a democracy, we prefer to talk to dictators."
"I deplore this, and all the more so because this report, and particularly the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy is being particularly hypocritical."
"We state clearly in the text of the report that at least four people are being held in prison for scientific reasons, contrary to what we have been told by Mr Brok, Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"These four people are quoted in this opinion and yet we are not even demanding their release."
"I think that this shows unbelievable hypocrisy."
"Let us carry on then; let us close our eyes to India."
"Let us carry on with China."
"You will see that the process of democratisation in China leads nowhere."
"Strength is the only language that communists understand, and in this case, we have no strength."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to say a few words about the three agreements that we will be debating this evening."
"Firstly, these agreements have been speedily adopted, and I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, as well as the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets, for having studied the proposals in a very short time."
"They are representative of a new generation of agreements for scientific cooperation with third countries."
"The countries concerned of course are different."
"Now we are talking about China and we will be talking about Russia and Argentina next."
"I would nevertheless like to say that these offer real added value to the current situation; they will clarify aims to be pursued, strengthen and extend collaboration, and will provide a solid formal basis."
"Next, I would also like to say, as Mr Linkohr emphasised, that there is a need for reciprocity which will be in our mutual interest."
"The European team' s reciprocal access to, in this case, Chinese programmes and activities, is the very spirit of the fifth framework programme."
"Finishing with the general aspects, I would also like to say that I know how much Parliament would like to be kept informed about the implementation of this programme and that the Commission will ensure that it supplies Parliament with regular detailed information on this matter."
"As far as China more particularly is concerned, whilst thanking Mr Gahrton for his report, I would like to say that we know how crucial the human rights problem is and that it is a particularly complex issue."
"I, as many speakers have said, consider it important to establish cooperation on a scientific level which encourages contact between our researchers and Chinese researchers."
"In this context, I can only agree with the conclusions of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, because this will permit greater freedom of expression for those working in the scientific and technical fields in China as well as in general."
"As far as the contribution that the Internet may make, we think that through this kind of contact, and also as you said, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, regarding the problem of e-commerce, a certain kind of dialogue will be possible in the future, as a result of this type of scientific agreement."
"As far as the issues of biotechnology are concerned, I must answer Mr Gahrton by saying that all research proposals in the area of biotechnology must completely satisfy the ethical conditions that apply to any framework programme project."
"This compliance is an essential requirement if the project is to be accepted, which I think gives all the guarantees we would want in order to prevent, as you pointed out, abuses that we would not want to see."
"Moreover, the framework programme covers only civilian research and the possible areas of cooperation do not lend themselves to its use for military ends."
"Finally, I would like to point out that as far as the problem of the annex relating to issues of intellectual property is concerned, the same thing applies to the three draft agreements."
"It is generally the same for all these types of agreements."
"This text has been drawn up following in-depth discussions with all parties concerned and bears in mind the need to guarantee the best possible protection for the European participants."
", rapporteur."
"(SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say very briefly that I do, of course, fully share Mr Dupuis' basic attitude."
"We are dealing with a country which does not fulfil the demands for democracy and human rights which we have within the EU."
"That is quite clear."
"Do you not believe that we are continually talking with our Chinese friends about this?"
"That is precisely what we are doing."
"We are, in fact, in constant communication with them about this issue."
"Whether or not this has any influence upon them is a moot point but, on absolutely each and every occasion that we meet our Chinese counterparts, we tell them that we ourselves have a different view to them about what they are doing where human rights are concerned."
"We say it openly and to their faces and we say it repeatedly and shall go on saying it."
"We refer constantly to the resolutions which are adopted by the European Parliament."
"We tell them that this is not some kind of campaign against China."
"We tell them that we adopt resolutions against just about every country in the world, including our own countries, when human rights are not respected."
"We do all this when we meet our Chinese counterparts."
"I think that what we say possibly has very little influence indeed, but it can have influence."
"We shall not, from our position here in the European Parliament, change China fundamentally - that is something we must realise - but we shall be able to ensure that when in fact China, of its own volition, becomes a more democratic country, we shall have supported the change by maintaining good relations with the country."
"That is my aim as head of the delegation for cooperation with China."
"It was also my aim when I wrote this report that we should engage in what would be positive cooperation with China but should definitely not in any way be less critical than the non-governmental organisations which work with China."
"Thank you very much, Mr Gahrton."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"EC-Russia scientific and technological cooperation agreement"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0048/1999) by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council decision concluding the Agreement on scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Russia [COM(1999)0324 - C5-0083/1999 - 1999/0133(CNS)]"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is actually very simple to write a report like this, because it consists of precisely one sentence: it recommends that Parliament should vote for the report."
"It also recommends that this decision should be forwarded to the Council and Commission."
"So I could just sit back and stop talking now, after just 20 seconds."
"On the other hand, it is certainly worth asking why we need this agreement right now."
"We all know from experience that cooperation with Russia, with Russian researchers, has constantly improved and increased in recent years, both in terms of the number of researchers and as regards budget lines."
"However, cooperation has been spread over a number of different programmes, including, and this is just one example, the INTAS programme - the International Association for the Promotion of Cooperation with Scientists from the new Independent States of the former Soviet Union."
"A few years ago I was rapporteur for the INTAS programme, and I must say that for me it was an excellent example of how it was possible to build up a cooperation network despite adverse technical conditions and despite poor infrastructure."
"Besides that, it was also a very good example - I am mentioning this to you, Commissioner, in case you were not yet involved in those days - of how researchers can take research policy into their own hands, which did not always best please the Commission officials at the time!"
"Nevertheless, I believe that the experiment as it was carried out at that time was worthwhile."
"We now have the EUREKA and COST programmes and the ISTC in Moscow, for example, and we need to provide a more formal framework for all this cooperation; that is also the point of this agreement."
"We will also make sure that the agreement is actually implemented in accordance with the principles set out in Article 3."
"It must be of mutual benefit."
"This is not about development policy, it is about cooperation in the field of research."
"There must be a timely exchange of information, of all information which may affect cooperative activities."
"There must be a balanced realisation of economic and social benefits by the Community and the Russian Federation."
"Although we now have this improved structural framework, we still need to emphasise several points."
"For one thing, in my conclusions, I have accepted the proposal from the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"We have assumed that the need to increase the involvement of women in the projects financed will actually be taken into account, although it has to be said that Russia is not exactly at the bottom of the class in this area."
"Secondly, we recognise the need to increase private sector involvement in the drawing up and implementation of programmes, and also the need to aim for closer cooperation between the relevant parliamentary committees of the parties to the agreement."
"There is sometimes a lack of concrete political dialogue."
"We could also perhaps use modern means of communication somewhat more, so as to reduce travel costs and allow rapid ad hoc contacts."
"As a Parliament we would like to stress that we expect the Commission to provide us with an overview of all cooperation activities between the European Union and Russia in the field of research and technological development."
"We have already asked many specific questions, and we are now awaiting detailed answers."
"Cooperation on nuclear matters is excluded from this agreement, and I consider that to be quite right and proper."
"We would, however, like to mention here that these matters have been the subject of separate EURATOM negotiations, and that we are also expecting clear and unambiguous information from the Commission about these, as was indeed promised to us."
"I do not think this is the right place to use rejection of a research agreement as a means of signalling to Russia that we expect concrete and rapid efforts to achieve a peaceful solution in Chechnya."
"There are other political means of achieving that."
"Nevertheless, I have to agree with Mr Brok: it can never feel so painful as it does now to vote for an agreement, even if rationally we fully support the objectives behind it!"
"So I really am in two minds, and I would just like to cautiously mention that."
"Mr Speaker, ladies and gentlemen thank you for the report."
"My group supports the line that has been chosen."
"Technical cooperation is important, of course."
"Russia has considerable scientific resources, especially in the field of basic research, and a large proportion of it remains untapped and unutilised in an international context."
"The unstable situation in the country has not interrupted research work, although it too is experiencing difficulties."
"There is a shortage of available funds, salaries are delayed, and it is difficult to produce scientific publications; the shelves of the shops are filled with cheap literature: thrillers, sex and so on."
"In the 1993 - 1998 period, the European Union financed cooperation in the area of techno-scientific research to the tune of approximately EUR 140 million."
"35,000 scientists from Russia have been involved in these projects."
"Quite a number of government officials seem to be travelling into Russia, too. I would be obliged if the Commission could inform us as to what the proportion of officials is to scientists."
"Currently, EUR 90,000 is spent each year on meetings and travel."
"Agriculture is one area of research cooperation."
"I would also like it to cover organic production, for example."
"In Russia, small farmers have actually been compelled to switch to organic production because they cannot afford chemical fertilisers."
"They are therefore surprisingly close to the organic ideal that we aspire to here."
"Cooperation would also be important where industrial methods and organisation are concerned."
"We could make significant progress in that area."
"There is also talk about ""the technology of the information society"" being part of the cooperation referred to in the agreement."
"But why is the content sector of the information society not included?"
"In many ways, Russia is a very content-rich country."
"Where content is concerned, we are lagging behind our main competitor, the United States, and the Russians really do have very different angles, which ought to be exploited."
"Finally, I would like to refer to the war in Chechnya, where the relentless fighting continues - or bombing, to be exact."
"The number of refugees is on the increase, and conditions have become horrific."
"The Russian leadership refuses to react to any of this."
"The real victims are now civilians, not the terrorists, as they call the Chechen rebels."
"It seems more and more likely that this is all part of the Russian election campaign."
"Those responsible for the explosions in Moscow have not been found, or have at least not been charged."
"This amounts to pulverisation of a nation, and I believe we should become more seriously involved, in order to make Moscow listen and take heed."
"This is something that cannot be tolerated."
"Mr Speaker, our group supports this report."
"Cooperation between the EU and Russia should be continued and developed."
"The agreement now under discussion will provide a better framework than ever for this."
"The cooperation process has been slowed down by the fact that it has become fragmented and is being administered by many different authorities, especially on the Russian side."
"The agreement now under consideration will bring the widespread cooperation activities within the sphere of a more effective coordination."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of cooperation, particularly in the field of environmental and climatic research, and within the framework of information technology and telecommunications."
"The cooperation that takes place in these areas also reflects positively on Russia' s neighbours."
"Through techno-scientific cooperation we can also promote the exploitation of natural resources of North-Western Russia, which are of great importance for the future development of the economies of both Russia and the EU."
"At the same time, I would hope that developing techno-scientific cooperation will direct practical cooperative projects to the right places and improve, inter alia, the implementation and success of the research framework programme and projects funded through the TACIS and the Interreg programmes."
"Practical projects must be coordinated more efficiently; they must be increasingly target-oriented and their timetabling and scheduling improved."
"We must also see to it that projects that have been started are brought to a conclusion within their allocated time span. We must also insist that the Russian side adhere to their part of the project."
"In recent years, many projects have been implemented ineffectively, they have dragged on for an unreasonable long period, and some of them have even been abandoned."
"To a certain extent, this has detracted from the interest in practical cooperation with Russia."
"The results of research work must increasingly be utilised for improving the environmental conditions and economy of Russia."
"I believe that the cooperation agreement will further the implementation of these objectives."
"Mr President, contact between scientists is important for the development of our civilisation."
"I therefore fully agree with Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and with the subsequent speakers in essence."
"But I would nevertheless like to express two very specific reservations that I have."
"We know that the nuclear aspect is excluded from this agreement."
"Negotiations on this are taking place within the framework of Euratom."
"A great deal of uncertainty remains in this respect, despite agreements between the Commission and Parliament - the KEDO agreement which is due for renewal."
"Pursuant to this KEDO agreement, Parliament should be kept abreast of the state of affairs within the Euratom negotiations. This was not the case."
"The Chairman, Mr Westendorp, has therefore written to Mr Lamy whose reply was received today."
"In his reply, he wrote that negotiations started in 1994 regarding the nuclear segment and nuclear fusion were completed but not signed."
"We can only guess why."
"There are formal objections, according to some."
"But we do not really know what is behind all this."
"Official confirmation from the Russians is pending."
"Furthermore, and this is something new, investigative talks on cooperation are said to be taking place regarding the trade in nuclear material."
"You will understand that we are very concerned about this in our group and that this is raising further questions."
"The ambiguities in the field of the nuclear segment and our concern with regard to this would, in fact, be sufficient to formulate a reservation and to say, for example: we want both finalised simultaneously."
"But these days, there is an even larger problem looming."
"It has also been touched upon by previous speakers."
"Incidents are taking place in Chechnya which are forcing us to rethink."
"In view of the fact that Russia continues to terrorise Chechen citizens with bomb attacks and traps people, men, women and children like rats, we cannot sit by and watch or look the other way and preach business as usual."
"The European Parliament needs to give a clear signal in the short term."
"Pressure on Russia must be stepped up so that it respects the human rights in Chechnya."
"We demand this as emphatically as we did for Kosovo."
"We condemn the Russian military intervention and the humanitarian crisis it caused."
"The fact that the civilian population cannot even take refuge flies in the face of all international rules."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to consider and ask you to consider with me whether we should formally postpone this vote tomorrow to allow us to present our opinions tomorrow."
"Mr President, in principle, we welcome the conclusion of a cooperation agreement in the scientific and technological fields between the European Union and the Russian Federation."
"Particularly against the background of anti-western feelings being deliberately fanned amongst the Russian population, this specific agreement gives out a clear, positive signal to the citizens of Russia."
"The EU hopes to serve their welfare and life interests just as well."
"This is clearly evidenced in the list featuring areas of cooperation."
"Within this framework of thought, there is space for joint regional and local research projects, as well as non-governmental ones."
"However, quite the opposite can be observed on the Russian side."
"The grip of the central government is becoming tighter in true Russian style."
"This then begs the question as to whether in the event that this agreement is implemented effectively, European interests will be satisfactorily aligned with those of Moscow."
"For example, in all honesty, does the Russian government attach the same importance to ecological disasters as we do?"
"Past experience does precious little to put our minds at rest on this crucial point - after all, the health of people inside and outside our own borders is at stake."
"In short, European persistence in elementary, humanitarian research fields is needed very urgently indeed within the framework of this agreement."
"For the first time, relatively minor research programmes come into their own for this exercise, whereby we remind our Russian partners consistently of the mutual obligations entered into."
"After all, if we are to avoid further western disenchantment in the East then we must take our own precautionary measures."
"I thank you and the rapporteur, in particular."
"Mr President, I believe that cooperation between Russian and the European Union is one of the most important conditions for creating peace in the twenty-first century."
"This involves working towards cooperation from which both sides can benefit."
"Russia will always be one of Europe' s main providers of raw materials."
"That is why this is important for us, as we can only maintain our own prosperity by seeking such cooperation."
"And of course we also have to consider, no matter how masochistic this might perhaps sound, that in the long run we will also have to offer fair prices for raw materials."
"We cannot, of course, ignore Chechnya."
"It represents a vital issue and an enormous challenge."
"We should remember that it was precisely these Caucasian territories round the Caspian Sea that were the cause of conflicts a hundred years ago, because they were geographically strategic, just as they are today."
"After all, these events shaped the twentieth century as we know it."
"I believe that this area, research, provides a way of defusing one of the main causes of such conflicts - the battle for raw materials."
"So the research aspect here is also very important as regards renewable energy sources."
"My next point is that the non-nuclear component of these research projects must be given clear priority."
"We have seen what is happening on the nuclear side."
"We need to be aware whenever we are considering Russia that it represents one of the most important challenges for the next century in terms of strategic geography."
"Mr President, I would first like to thank Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl for her fine report."
"I think that you covered all the essential points. I would just like to confirm that a very important aspect of this agreement is that of mutual interest, unlike in other agreements, such as TACIS, which are unilateral assistance projects"
"As far as women are concerned, we agree entirely with the Commission' s report of February 1999 on Women and Science, and we will ensure that we encourage the presence of women in the fifth framework programme."
"Finally, you rightly spoke of the issue of private companies, and we also feel, as you do, that the presence of companies in the project for collaboration is a central element for the whole framework-programme and which is particularly important in this kind of agreement."
"Of course there is also the question of the summary document on the different points that have already been made in terms of information."
"I believe that you have already received a series of particular items of information, but I shall shortly be sending you a summary document, which will give an overview."
"As for the more specific question on nuclear power and Mr Lamy, you know, as Mrs Maes alluded to it, that Mr Lamy has today sent a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, Mr Westendorp, in which he sums up the situation and in which he says quite clearly, and I am answering Mrs Maes at the same time, that we do not yet have the official confirmation from Russia which we need in order to proceed to the signing of the decision of 12 December 1994."
"Thus, as far as the answer that Mr Lamy has just given you is concerned, it is the Russians who are holding up this agreement."
"I would also like to tell other speakers that electronic resources, both for information and for communication, are heavily used by researchers, and that they already use them as much as they can."
"This use must obviously be developed even further. This will moreover contribute to a greater exchange of information and of developments in common."
"More fundamentally, as far as the political issue that has been raised over Chechnya is concerned, I obviously share your questions and your distress, but the question is this: until now, the European Union has neither suspended nor curtailed its diplomatic relations with Russia, because we feel that we must always maintain channels for dialogue with Russia in order to get our messages across, including those which express our concern about what is happening in Chechnya."
"I would, moreover, like to remind you that the Union, through the Finnish Presidency, informed the Russian Government and its Prime Minister, Mr Putin, of its deep concern, at the European Union-Russia summit of 22 October 1999."
"This is why, in this matter, whilst sharing Parliament' s concerns about the gravity of the situation in Chechnya, neither do I think, and I fully understand your position on this matter, that this agreement is the best way to show our concerns and our questions about what is happening."
"Like all of you, I have been affected by the events that have taken place."
"I think that this agreement is of great importance for dialogue and for the promotion of cooperation in the area of technological research and development."
"This agreement is therefore a positive thing."
"It has been questioned, but we think that it will be a positive step in our relations with Russian researchers, and from there, towards the construction of the best possible area of freedom and trade."
"Thank you, Commissioner Busquin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"EC-Argentina scientific and technological cooperation agreement"
"The next item is the report (A5-0047/1999) by Mr Linkohr, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision concluding the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Argentine Republic [COM(99) 0292 - C5-0040/99 - 99/0125(CNS)]."
"Mr President, fortunately we do not have the same problem with Argentina that we have with Russia or China."
"I am happy to say that Argentina has put its military past behind it."
"It is now a democracy - to be taken with a pinch of salt, perhaps, but a democracy."
"That is why as rapporteur I would also like to recommend that we include the democratic aspect in this scientific and technological cooperation, by which I mean that Members of Parliament from Argentina and also from the European Union should discuss research and science topics and perhaps point the way to the future."
"In recent years, Argentina has made efforts to increase public expenditure on research and technology, but it remains at a relatively low level."
"0.5% of GDP is spent on research."
"That is far too little, even if, within Latin America, it is still one of the top-spending countries."
"But that is no way to approach the twenty-first century."
"Cooperation between Argentina and the European Union is therefore also a way of encouraging Argentina and other Latin American countries to increase the amount they spend on investing in future."
"It is no secret that Latin America' s share of world trade - and thus Argentina' s share - has fallen significantly over the last 20 years."
"This is associated with a lack of investment in the future."
"We are witnessing a flight, not only of capital, but also of people educated either in these countries or in Europe or in the USA, who have left their country and sought work elsewhere."
"In this respect - let me repeat this - cooperation with Europe is a form of encouragement to take the same approach as we do, that is to invest in the future."
"Nevertheless, the funds involved are meagre."
"In my report you will see a summary, provided by the Commission, which indicates that Argentina received EUR 18 million under the fourth framework programme of research."
"This consisted of nothing but small, yet very interesting programmes. EUR 18 million is not a lot!"
"If you have that sort of money available, then you have to try to use it to attract larger sums."
"I would like to encourage the Commission to consider using these modest sums to encourage private companies to invest more in research in Argentina, and, once again, in other Latin American countries also."
"I have a figure in front of me which I find encouraging - and it ought to be extrapolated to the whole European Union: Germany' s chemical industry spends DM 12.3 billion a year on research and development, added to which there is DM 5 billion for research abroad, generally in the USA in practice, but also in countries in Latin America and elsewhere, and you will see that there are more and more investors in the research sector."
"If you extrapolate that, European industry as a whole may be investing DM 20 billion or EUR 10 billion in research activities outside the European Union, and if the funds the European Union is making available here could be used to attract private research funding also, that would be a benefit, and would mean that countries like Argentina would not be just tantamount to extensions of Europe' s workshops, but could also participate in research and development themselves."
"I would like to encourage the Commission to adopt that approach."
"The committee for which I am rapporteur will approve that."
"In addition, just as with China, I would like to remind you that research with these countries - with Argentina and other countries - is a two-way street."
"We benefit from it too."
"Given that this year is the two-hundredth anniversary of Alexander von Humboldt' s journey to Venezuela, I would like to recall that Alexander von Humboldt did not just take something out there - his curiosity - but he also brought something back, namely knowledge about tropical plants and about the geography of this interesting continent."
"On that note, I also hope that research cooperation with Argentina and other countries will benefit the people of Europe, the European Union."
"Mr President, the report by Mr Linkohr is really good and I am therefore very happy to congratulate him."
"The European Community and the Republic of Argentina have a great interest in cooperating in terms of mutual assistance because, despite the fact that Argentina is a young country, I believe that it is very important that this Latin American area should be fully associated with the fifth framework programme for technological research and development."
"I agree with the rapporteur that this form of cooperation must be promoted in the Latin American region as a whole and that we should provide impetus for the negotiation of the agreement with Mercosur, an agreement which - I think we have to accept - I believe has come to a bit of a halt or, to put it another way, has not proceeded at the speed which we expected in 1995 when we approved it and when the Agreement on Interregional Cooperation was signed between the European Union and Mercosur in Madrid."
"With regard to other possible forms of cooperation, we must follow a logical order of priorities, starting, as proposed, with member countries of the said area, that is to say, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina, and then moving on to their associated countries - Chile, Bolivia, etc - with which, as we all know, the European Union is discussing an interregional association."
"I would also like to highlight the fact that we are looking at a good example of how a country which has still not achieved its maximum level of development will commit itself to a sustained form of growth which respects the environment through the use of renewable energy, by means of this agreement on scientific and technological cooperation."
"Finally, I believe that it is very important to establish these regular contacts between the European Parliament and Argentina, not only in this area, but also in the economic, social and cultural fields, since it is an obligation of the European Union to consolidate our presence in that country with which we Europeans have so much in common."
"I would like to thank Mr Linkohr for his significant report on this cooperation agreement with Argentina."
"In fact this is the first agreement concluded with a Latin-American country and it fits perfectly within the guidelines for cooperation by the Union with countries with emerging economies, as laid down in the Commission' s communication in 1996 on this matter, and put into practise in the fifth framework programme."
"Until now, as you pointed out, Argentinian researchers have only benefited from cooperation projects established in areas such as nutrition, health or the environment."
"This agreement will enable both parties to exploit all the potential for advanced research skills in countries in terms of sustainable development, as has been pointed out, but also, as you can imagine, in the area of the specific Energy-environment programme, in the area of renewable energies, bearing in mind the commitments made in Kyoto."
"We will also ensure that this constitutes a starting point for negotiations with other countries in Latin America."
"I am able to inform you that preparatory work on the agreement with Brazil has already reached an advanced stage."
"But as you pointed out, perhaps we should extend the issue to the whole of the Mercosur zone."
"Next, as I indicated in my general presentation, it goes without saying that Parliament will be kept fully informed of developments arising from this agreement."
"One final remark by way of a conclusion."
"An important aspect of the Union' s cooperation with the countries of this region is, as you have pointed out, the interregional dimension."
"In the projects undertaken until now, the emphasis was on the development of projects in collaboration with other Mercosur countries, an association in which Argentina plays an important role and is thus a sort of bridgehead for us to reach other countries in Latin America."
"This aspect will thus continue to be the object of particular attention in terms of the Union' s relationship with the countries in this region."
"The Commission, as well as Parliament, will be particularly attentive to it."
"Thank you, Commissioner Busquin."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"Information on fuel economy in new cars"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0040/1999), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive on the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars [C5-0037/1999 - 98/0272(COD)] (rapporteur: Mr Sterckx)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the UN Climate Convention in Kyoto, the European Union accepted a target to reduce CO2 emissions by 8% by the year 2012, relative to emission levels in 1990."
"If we now know that cars are accountable for 12% of these CO2 emissions, if we know that people who buy cars are completely unaware of the fact that the car is a polluting tool and to what extent it does pollute, although, for example, they do know what the maximum permitted level of alcohol in the blood is or I know that if I buy a car which uses three litres per 100 km then this is quite an economical car, then it is a matter of urgency to make the consumer aware of car pollution."
"Only then can we ensure that the European Union will yield results when reducing CO2 emissions."
"We have to impress on people that, at the moment, we emit an average of 186 grammes of CO2 per kilometre by car and this must be cut down to 120 grammes per kilometre."
"So one way or another, we have to drum these grammes per kilometre into people."
"How will we do this?"
"The directive proposes we provide information in four different ways."
"Firstly, it is suggested to introduce labels for new cars which specify information such as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions."
"Secondly, we can compile a guide containing this information on all new models, which also includes a top ten of the most economical and environmentally-friendly cars."
"A third suggestion is to display posters in showrooms with a list of data for all models on display and lastly, the fuel consumption and CO2 emission data should be included in advertisements for new cars."
"At the Commission' s proposal, the European Parliament submitted a number of amendments during the first reading."
"We have noted that the Council has incorporated a large number of these in its common position."
"Parliament had requested not to mention fuel costs."
"The Council went along with this."
"Parliament had also requested to make a fuel consumption guide available on the Internet and at European level."
"Again, the Council agreed."
"Mentioning CO2 emissions explicitly, as was suggested by Parliament, has also been complied with."
"There are two other points which the Council seems to have accepted to some extent, and one is that there should also be a ""top ten"" per category of cars."
"Although the Commission has stated that this is a complex issue, the Council still requests that the Committee concerned with the revision of this directive should look into this and get on with this categorisation exercise."
"A second point relating to the revision is that Parliament had requested that the directive should also apply to second-hand cars, managers' cars and cars registered for the day."
"Upon revision, it is possible to include second-hand cars, according to the Council."
"Again, Parliament' s request has been met to some extent."
"Since the Council' s stance is so close to that of Parliament, I would recommend swift action, not tabling any amendments and approving the common position now so that, by the end of next year, the directive can enter into effect."
"I think this is rather more important than trying to achieve perfection in every last detail which would not make any significant difference."
"The Committee on the Environment has supported this proposal unanimously."
"This does not mean that we think this regulation is now perfect."
"A number of observations made by Parliament are important, however."
"From the very outset, it was clear, for example, that complete harmonisation was impossible."
"As such, the Member States can elaborate on the provisions set out here."
"We would ask the Committee to ensure that the internal market is not disrupted."
"That on the basis of best practices in one or more of the Member States, the provisions in this directive are applied in a manner which is as uniform as possible and that red-tape is avoided for manufacturers or sales outlets."
"I would like to put forward another three points."
"Parliament had also requested if it could be borne in mind that air-conditioning or other additional equipment can increase pollution levels, that the legal responsibility of manufacturers and dealers should be delineated more accurately and that, as such, managers' cars and cars registered for the day should be included."
"The directive is a mere starting point."
"We now have to gather experience."
"We need to find out whether the environment is really an argument for the consumer when they are buying a car, i.e. whether they decide in favour of an environmentally-friendly rather than a less environmentally-friendly car."
"When the directive is evaluated, we will need to decide whether adjustments need to be made."
"The intention should at any rate be to reduce CO2 emissions as efficiently as possible and to act swiftly."
"This is why I would like to ask Parliament to adopt this directive."
"Mr President, there are many factors which purchasers may wish to take into account when choosing a model of car."
"When I bought my first car my primary consideration was to be noticed in it by the opposite sex."
"Now other considerations such as safety and economy are more pertinent."
"We welcome this legislation because it is important that the information outlined is made available to those purchasers for whom environmental and economy considerations are paramount."
"People in the United Kingdom are particularly interested in fuel economy because of the punitive fuel tax levels set by our Labour Government, which particularly pose problems for people living in rural areas like my own where public transport is often non-existent."
"My first reaction when I saw this directive was surprise."
"Not only have we had such a scheme of publicising fuel economy data for some time in Britain, but most people assume that the existing scheme is the result of a European directive already."
"In fact only Sweden and the United Kingdom have such a scheme."
"It is good to see Europe following Britain' s lead."
"The key to the success of the United Kingdom' s scheme is simplicity."
"I hope that the directive, as outlined in the common position, does not confuse consumers by going further than our scheme."
"My first concern is that there is flexibility for Member States to extend the information available."
"Whilst I realise that there are subsidiarity implications for this flexibility it is also true that by having different information and different formats in different Member States this could distort the single market and confuse consumers who wish to buy in different states."
"Secondly, the directive proposes to compile a top ten list of vehicles according to class."
"How does one define these classes?"
"If it is based on the footprint of the car then we could see small saloons, four-wheel drive vehicles and two-seater sports cars listed together, clearly a nonsense."
"It is also possible that a manufacturer could move a model up to a class containing larger vehicles simply by adding 15 cm of plastic to the front."
"Top ten rankings may also differ in neighbouring countries."
"In welcoming this scheme, I hope that when it is reviewed in 2003, if any of the problems I have mentioned have arisen, these can be addressed."
"Finally, I congratulate Mr Sterckx on the way he presented this to the committee and for his cooperation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this directive forms part of the EU' s overall strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from transport, which is based on four pillars: consumer information, covered by this directive, tax incentives at Member State level, monitoring CO2 emissions from cars and the agreement between the Commission and the car industry."
"The directive does not entirely match Parliament' s expectations in all areas."
"Nevertheless, I can go along with the rapporteur, and would like to thank him for his work."
"We want to see this directive implemented as soon as possible."
"That is why we do not want a narrow-minded debate here today."
"For example, we could talk about whether we need realistic values, as everyone knows that air-conditioning or independent vehicle heating has a huge impact on a car' s CO2 emissions."
"Another obvious question is why, when someone from Denmark buys a car in Germany, or someone from France buys one in Italy, they do not get the same information about its design."
"But we can put that to one side for now."
"We want to have the directive as soon as possible."
"I would, however, like to say something about the centrepiece of the strategy - the voluntary agreements between the Commission and the car industry."
"If we really end up with 140 g in 2008 as intended, that would be excellent."
"However, and Parliament has already expressed its opinion on this at various critical junctures, there are certain risks."
"Parliament, and in particular of course the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which was responsible for this, was not exactly pleased that it was not involved in the work on the negotiations and the agreement between the European Union and Japanese and Korean manufacturers.I think, Commissioner, that once again you clearly need to find a modus vivendi to make sure that the legislature - Parliament - is in future properly involved in the voluntary commitments."
"The directive before us allows consumers to buy a car not only according to its horsepower, but also its CO2 emissions, by referring to a ""top ten"" list."
"While in Bonn people are trying to shirk their responsibility and avoid reducing CO2 emissions, we here are doing things properly, establishing law and giving consumers the option of cutting CO2 emissions themselves!"
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to express my great satisfaction with this initiative, which is clearly an important step in the direction of transparency of information with regard to the environmental characteristics of cars and, in this respect, it will aid consumer choice."
"Nevertheless, I would like briefly to refer to the factor which gives rise to this directive: the energy efficiency of cars."
"Consumption decreased, during this period, from 17.8 to 8.7 litres per 100 kilometres."
"During this same period, the stricter provision of equipment contributed to a 4% saving and the use of a lighter chassis led to the remaining 96%."
"Nevertheless, since 1986, fuel efficiency has increased by a mere 10%."
"In our opinion, this is due to the fact that technological development systems used in the car industry impede global improvements in the product as a result of the high level of specialisation of companies' R and D laboratories."
"These laboratories - which are often physically a long way from each other and lack a coordination and communication strategy between them - invest a lot in improving very specific features of cars, and very little in improving the car as a system for moving from one place to another."
"To this end - and since directives such as the one which we are discussing today have been very well received - I believe that the European Parliament must promote and support initiatives which are aimed at an integrated product policy in which the R and D in design, in this case of cars, receives all the attention it deserves."
"I believe that unless we deal with production in an integrated way, that is, from the moment that the car' s raw materials are selected, through its manufacture, the production process, the use and finally the recycling and final disposal of the car when the buyer is no longer using it, we will never really manage to introduce measures which are genuinely significant in the field of reducing green-house gases."
"I think that only in this way will we ensure that the car stops squandering between 80 and 85% - just imagine! - of the energy before it even takes to the road."
"Therefore, I believe that this list we are talking about of the ten most efficient cars could also be, if we carry on like this, the list of the least inefficient, and in no sense will it be the list of the best."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for about two years now, ever since the Kyoto conference, we have been discussing how our commitments to cut CO2 emissions can be transposedinto European law."
"Consumer information and awareness-raising are the third pillar of our strategy, alongside the environmentalagreement with car manufacturers and tax measures."
"I believe that the common position submitted to us by the Council fully addresses this third requirement."
"It is well balanced and takes account of the main requests made by the European Parliament at first reading - let me say that again, the main points."
"Because we should be really grateful to the Council, and I am not just saying this to get a laugh, that so many of Parliament' s requests from first reading have been weeded out, given that they were adopted in a fit of over-zealousness and did not have my approval."
"Mr Lange, I hope you will not take offence if I say that this request regarding petrol and fuel consumption in independent vehicle heaters and air-conditioning units is one of these."
"If we start trying to limit that certain level of luxury, that element of quality that people have become accustomed to, we will just irritate consumers."
"We should not be deterred by this."
"That is why I am happy that this directive is now somewhat clearer and that requests like this have been taken out."
"I think that we should limit our legislative texts to essential and comprehensible points, and that also applies to this directive."
"This is all the more relevant given that in future we will increasingly have to deal with complex and technical subjects."
"In Strasbourg we have plans for a similar directive on just such technical processes."
"The directive we are discussing is certainly an important part of our strategy for combating CO2 emissions."
"However, I think that a certain scepticism about its effectiveness is not out of place."
"I have my doubts about whether publishing consumption and exhaust gas figures will really influence consumers in their purchasing decisions."
"Consumption figures are important anyway at a time of rising petrol prices."
"In order words, customers will inform themselves out of pure self-interest."
"I also believe that mentioning CO2 emissions has more to do with awareness-raising."
"For me, that is also one of the key points of this directive: raising consumers' awareness of the problem, so that they worry a little more about reducing CO2 emissions when it comes to their favourite toy, their car, and so that this becomes part of their way of thinking."
"Because if we are really to achieve Kyoto' s ambitious targets, then we all need to get involved, not just governments!"
"So what am I driving at here?"
"As the legislature of the European Union, we will in future continue to have no option but to set clear limit values and time limits for achieving significant reductions in emissions."
"Some Member States have limited ambitions in this respect."
"I believe, Commissioner, that we still have some persuading to do together."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for taking on this report."
"I am very grateful to him for that and he has our support."
"I do not think there are any more problems!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of the common position before us is to provide potential purchasers of new cars with information."
"They need to know what the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are."
"Great!"
"Tables, advertising brochures, guidelines, tips, that is all marvellous and Parliament adopted 29 amendments, of which 14 have been included in the common position."
"I would like to take the liberty of praising the Austrian Presidency a little, because I think they were the ones who made this happen."
"I also totally agree with the rapporteur when he says we should not waffle on!"
"We should accept the wonderful job done by the Council and make sure that it comes into force as quickly as possible."
"As someone has already said, there are few of us left, it is late, and we are tired, but perhaps we should nevertheless look at the facts of the case, which are that CO2 emissions from private cars are constantly rising, and will continue to do so."
"So we should not act as if we have saved the planet here today!"
"We certainly have not."
"We missed the boat long ago - or rather we missed a lot of cars."
"We will not save the world with this directive."
"It is necessary, it is important, and I am delighted that we have it, and perhaps we will all have a bit less of a guilty conscience the next time we get into our cars, but we should not imagine that we can really save the world with such minimal measures, even if there are a great many of them."
"We need action of a quite different kind for that."
"I wonder if we will ever adopt a directive along those lines!"
"Mr President, I want first to address the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and, of course, Mr Sterckx, and to praise the latter for his work on this recommendation for second reading and, above all, for the fact that it has been shown in this way that work can be done quickly and efficiently."
"Mr Goodwill has gone out now. Otherwise, I should have wanted to say that the goal must be for environmentally friendly cars also to be able to impress the opposite sex."
"We hope that, one day, this will be the case and that there will be good grounds for maintaining that the car concerned is environmentally friendly."
"We support the rapporteur' s recommendation to accept the present common position without further changes."
"It can also be seen from the recommendation for second reading and from Mr Sterckx' s intervention that the common position takes account of many of the European Parliament' s points of view."
"We consider that consumers should be informed systematically and without unnecessary delays about the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of new private cars."
"In this way, consumers can be helped to make the right decisions."
"True, this is not going to change the world but it can be a small move in a larger strategy."
"Just as Mrs Flemming said, there is certainly a need for further measures in the future."
"We followed the discussions in committee very carefully."
"Even though there were some proposals as to how one might be able to improve the common position, rapid implementation was considered to be the most important thing."
"We are well aware of the fact that, in its current version, the directive is only the first step on the way towards a situation in which the consumer is better informed."
"Here are two examples by way of illustration. Firstly, we intend as soon as possible to develop the directive further by applying Article No 9 in connection with the inspection process and Article No 10 in connection with establishing the relevant committee."
"The Commission' s officials are at present working on the implementation of these articles."
"In the course of the work, we shall in, all probability, be returning to some of the Committee' s remarks."
"Secondly, the Commission also has plans to create an Internet page with information about the fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of private cars for sale within the European Union."
"This demonstrates that we want the consumer to have this information as soon as possible."
"I want to say to Mr Lange - and this is in fact not the first time we have discussed this - that I take this question extremely seriously."
"We must look again at the issue of how the European Parliament is to be involved and also kept informed about the work on voluntary agreements."
"I also want to remind you that the European Parliament, the Council and the Association of European Car Manufacturers all maintained that it was a matter of urgency to reach agreements with car manufacturers which are not members of European associations."
"But, as I say, I take the European Parliament' s points of view seriously."
"I also want to say that I have no plans to introduce proposals for further environmental agreements as long as the issue of the European Parliament' s involvement has not been solved."
"Finally, I just want to say that the Commission is pleased that the common position received such a warm welcome from the rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"We hope that, at the plenary part-session, the rapporteur' s recommendations will be complied with."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m."
"European internal market"
"The next item is the oral question (B5-0032/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to the Commission, on the Commission Communication to the European Parliament and the Council on the Strategy for the European Single Market."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time that I have taken the floor in this House to speak in my capacity as a citizen and would like to say that, for me, the most important thing is to speak as a citizen on behalf of the citizens."
"And normally I have spoken on reports which affected the citizen' s main concerns: the issues of the third pillar, that is, justice and internal affairs."
"But today, reminding you of something I said here during the last part-session - after Tampere the European citizens have received the message that Europe is no longer just a market - I would like to say loud and clear that, with this strategic document on the internal market which has been presented to this Parliament and which I am speaking about today, the citizen is going to have a clear idea of the coherence of that market and the fact that the ultimate and main protagonist of that market is the citizen."
"The ultimate and main protagonist of the internal market is the citizen and the small and medium enterprise."
"Why is there any confusion?"
"It is clear: the internal market is a wonderful achievement, a success story, without any doubt, but it is not perceived as such by the citizens nor small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Today the impression is still that the internal market is the concern of the multinationals, the major companies, the bureaucrats, Brussels, the technocrats who are far from the concerns of the ordinary people, where many initiatives pile up on top of one another without order or harmony, with no guiding ideas, which, in many cases, are perceived as one more nightmare in the onerous task of living in a developed Community or having a small or medium-sized business."
"I believe, Mr President, that it is not only a matter of refuting the idea that everything bad in the Member States comes from Brussels and everything good comes from the governments."
"It is not only that."
"It is something that goes much further."
"Until now, there has been a lot of very good legislation with very clear consequences, but it has been done without a strategy."
"Now the strategy is here and the importance of this strategy is fundamental if we want the citizen to see that the internal market is not just a matter of legislative acts which relate to the four freedoms, but that it affects them fundamentally."
"Therefore, congratulations to the Commission and, naturally, we offer our unconditional support to this idea which seems to us, in Parliament, to be very interesting and deserves to be developed."
"Now for our wishes."
"Firstly, this Parliament wishes to be closely involved with each and every step in the process which is planned for the internal market, with the selection of strategies, the selection of second level objectives and the selection of specific objectives."
"We also wish to be closely associated with the balance given to legislative and non-legislative actions."
"We are in favour of non-legislative actions, since often legislation is not necessary given that sometimes ""soft law"" is enough, but these initiatives should not cause us to lose sight of the fact that we must avoid the false idea of harmonisation and we have to avoid legal insecurity, as well as false expectations about the internal market."
"The same thing happens with the choice between harmonisation and mutual recognition."
"We also believe in the need to establish a fair balance and Parliament hopes that its points of view will be fully taken into account."
"And with regard to the citizens' more specific ideas, we are very much in agreement with this general strategic objective, but we want the citizens to understand their rights better and above all to be able to exercise them in a clear and concrete way."
"We want more efficient and clearer systems for the settlement of disputes which would be better if they were extrajudicial as well as judicial, and all the better if self-regulation policies are created to discipline those markets."
"And, of course, we want the four freedoms to be fulfilled."
"We want the fourth freedom - the free movement of persons, which stands between the internal market and the policies of justice and internal affairs - to be a reality."
"We want, above all, Commissioner, to insist on legal security and, to that end, we are calling upon you to develop an initiative - which is lacking in your strategy - for the creation of a genuine administrative procedural law for all types of infringement procedures, for all the procedures which involve the citizens."
"To sum up, we want Europe to speak with a single voice with regard to the internal market and to act as a model - why not? - in international relations."
"And to this end we need a clear legal framework, a legal framework for the internal market, with principles, which radiates into other policies and by means of which the citizens may have a clear idea of what has been done over the last 50 years and which now, through these initiatives, we believe will have an absolutely guaranteed future role."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mrs Palacio very much for giving me the opportunity of enlarging upon the strategic plan for the internal market and also for the preliminary remarks she has made."
"I would also like to thank her for the congratulations she has extended to the Committee and, indirectly, the services which fall under my remit."
"The action programme is now behind us."
"What we need next is a strategy."
"The Commission' s announcement combines a strategic vision for the long term and priorities for action in the short term."
"The strategy should provide a coherent framework for policy development."
"The aim is to enhance the internal market' s efficiency, benefiting both citizens and businesses."
"We need to make all interested parties, citizens, consumers, small and large businesses realise that the internal market is a good thing for them, that because of it, the conditions can be created for a thriving business world and a competitive position which focuses more on the challenges of globalisation."
"Also, and this might be an even bigger challenge, we need to convince the consumer that the internal market opens up a wider range of goods and services at lower prices without putting safety and quality at risk."
"The integration of fifteen national markets required a new legal framework, a framework which is supported by nearly 1,500 directives at present."
"This work is on-going. There will always be new decisions."
"A number of important measures are currently being discussed by this Parliament, for example regarding e-commerce."
"Your question, Mrs Palacio, highlights, however, quite rightly so far as I am concerned, the increasing significance of measures and initiatives of a non-legislative nature which need to ensure that the agreed rules function well in practice."
"The specific actions are not static or long-term."
"They will be reviewed annually and replaced as soon as they reach completion."
"It is essential that Parliament is involved in this revision in the capacity of co-legislator."
"Actions will be adapted and adjusted largely on the basis of the scoreboard of the internal market which is compiled twice-yearly by the Commission and also on the basis of the Cardiff report on the operation of product and capital markets."
"Also, the Council' s conclusions concerning the Cardiff report, with regard to which agreement will be reached during the Internal Market Council of February or March, will make a huge contribution."
"Input from Parliament running alongside this would be ideal."
"Admittedly, the deadlines are short."
"The Cardiff report will be published in mid-January."
"The Commission will need to table its proposals for new specific actions by April."
"But I am convinced that your institutionalists are up to the task."
"Measures of a non-legislative nature encompass a wide range of activities."
"There will be areas where the Community, invariably the Commission, will be in the forward line and three elements, by way of example, will prove to be useful in this."
"Firstly, the dialogue with Europe' s citizens and industry which provides information on the precise way in which rights can be exercised."
"Secondly, simplification."
"Initiatives, such as SLIM and the business test panel are intended to lighten the administrative load for industry."
"Thirdly, promoting a common European administrative culture with high levels of services for the European citizen."
"We need to encourage national officials to exchange good practices and solve problems swiftly and informally, thus obviating the need for legal remedies."
"The position of Parliament which is, of course, aware of the needs among citizens and within industry, is essential."
"I would like to emphasise this point."
"I promise that I will inform Parliament, maybe through its committees, of the development of this type of initiatives right from the start."
"Another form of non-legislative measures which can underpin and reinforce the operation of the legal framework is self-regulation or, better still, an approach in which regulation and self-regulation are integrated whereby many aspects are laid down in the legislation and alongside this, many groups of interested parties offer solutions upon joint consultation."
"It is only starting to dawn on us what scope this approach gives us in the fast-moving area of e-commerce, for example, with regard to on-line complaints procedures."
"It cannot be left to the legislator, the Union or the individual Member State to deal with these issues."
"We have to join forces with those who have most involvement: consumers and industry."
"Parliament is ideally positioned to initiate the discussion on initiatives of this kind, probably mainly to highlight the concern of the ordinary citizen whose voice is not always heard in Brussels."
"Finally, the new institutional equilibrium established by the Treaty of Amsterdam, requires that Parliament, the Council and the Commission cooperate in the field of legislation."
"I hope that the strategy for the internal market will allow us the opportunity to extend this cooperation to the preliminary stage when the priorities for action will be established and to the implementing stage when it is to be ensured that rules function fully."
"I herewith conclude my response to the question raised by Mrs Palacio."
"Mr President, perhaps you will allow me to say a few words more at the end of the interventions to complete my contribution to this debate."
"Thank you for your time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the Commission for bringing this paper to Parliament so speedily and for informing us about its strategic intentions in such detail."
"Although it is a very general paper, it is still important."
"The internal market itself is a wonderful thing, and has enabled us to make a lot of progress in Europe but, as Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi said earlier, it has not been such a success with consumers and the public as it should have been."
"That is why there really is scope for improvement in our internal market policy."
"In particular, I consider it to be very important - and this is also made clear in a motion for a resolution which we have submitted today - that in future, internal market legislation should be more coherent than it has been in the past."
"In my experience over the last five years in this House, the approach adopted has, unfortunately, always been a rather piecemeal one, failing to recognise links with other legislative issues."
"In my experience this has also applied, particularly so in fact, to consumer protection legislation, where there have very often indeed been discrepancies between various directives, between various pieces of legislation at European level. For instance, this applies to specific cancellation deadlines and periods of protection for consumers: these have frequently been different."
"In some cases there are deadlines or periods of seven working days, and in others just seven days."
"In the end nobody knows where they stand any more."
"This is just one example of a lack of consistency where more needs to be done."
"In any case, I believe that it was a mistake that at the beginning of the last parliamentary term the old Commission did not continue with the work on a European Contract Law - which Mr Lando and his commission had begun - despite the fact that Parliament had made funds available for this."
"We very often have a problem with internal market legislation these days in that there is no framework, no common structure for legislation."
"I think that a process of rational, scientific advance preparation would have helped to ensure far more coherent internal market legislation today."
"I therefore very much welcome the fact that the Commission has addressed the issue of coherence in its paper."
"Commissioner Bolkestein drew attention to the need for this at the joint meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in Strasbourg."
"I also feel that the special attention being paid to improvements in judicial cooperation is extremely important."
"Without better judicial cooperation, and if consumers are unable to have their rights guaranteed within the internal market, the internal market loses half its potential value."
"I am not enthusiastic about everything in this paper and in the motion for a resolution before us today."
"For example, let us take the case of the requirement in the paper that a package leaflet should in future be used to remind consumers of their rights. I think that is rubbish, to put it mildly!"
"There is a big difference between going into a chemist' s and buying a medicine there, with a full explanation of any risks, and simply buying a normal product on the market."
"I do not think it makes sense to explain every consumer' s rights in a package leaflet."
"I would also like to make a few comments about the amendments tabled on this motion for a resolution."
"The Socialist amendments are largely unacceptable to the PPE Group, in some cases purely and simply because they are very Socialist! Amendment Nos 7 and 8 are just two examples of this."
"I think that not even Gerhard Schröder or Tony Blair would be very enthusiastic about these amendments."
"Neither are we!"
"In addition, there are also any number of amendments that look reasonable at first sight, but which we actually consider to be out of place in this paper on internal market strategy, as they relate to social issues and should be dealt with elsewhere."
"For that reason, we will not be voting for those amendments either."
"Finally, let me say something about that old chestnut ""Do we want more harmonisation or do we want mutual recognition?"""
"You really have to answer that question on a case-by-case basis."
"The principle of mutual recognition often has advantages."
"But in cases where it is no longer practical because the systems are just too different, the only way forward is then harmonisation."
"So it is not possible to settle this issue as a matter of general principle - a decision really has to be made in each individual case depending on what is at stake."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we all know that in the world of politics - I am sorry to say this - politicians always find it more attractive to come up with new ideas and at least launch their initial implementation than to complete and improve on existing, tried and tested concepts that do not attract so much media attention!"
"I believe, therefore, that we should be all the more grateful to the Commission for not treating the internal market like an old hat that just has to have a few dents knocked out now and again, but rather as a project that constantly requires new political initiatives."
"With this in mind, I welcome the Commission communication on the European internal market which we have before us."
"I also consider that the four strategic objectives have been very well chosen and the right method has been adopted for evaluating and monitoring them."
"Nevertheless, I think that I can allow myself a few constructive criticisms."
"One of these relates to the structure of this communication."
"I must confess, even though I am by no means a totally inexperienced Member now, that the complexity of this communication, with its strategic objectives, operational objectives, target projects, legislative and non-legislative measures, makes it really hard to follow and to grasp what the Commission is trying to convey to us."
"I hope that the European citizens whom the whole thing is ultimately intended to help can make more sense of it."
"I also think that the Commission is in places too polite when it comes to identifying obstacles standing in the way of the internal market today."
"It seems to me that the Member States' responsibility should be spelt out more clearly."
"The communication also fails to address the system under which the European Parliament is tied in with the procedures and the tight time framework of the so-called annual cycle, to ensure that Parliament' s rights are fully respected."
"In this case it seems that the schedule is dictated more by the Council' s timetable."
"I also hope that the procedure under which we have had to consider this particular communication here in Parliament is not to be a model for future procedure. I say that, Mr Lehne, because it is precisely on account of this procedure that we have not had an opportunity to discuss amendments in committee, and that we have had to follow a procedure not at all typical of this House."
"I believe that we should pay more attention to the fact that the internal market and other EU policies have, to some extent, led to developments which the public regard as absurd or off-putting."
"Some product components are nowadays transported thousands of kilometres across Europe, only for some of them then to be returned to their country of origin. Not only are significant transport costs incurred, but there is something wrong about this whole system, for example with the export refund system or the marking of regional origin system."
"If, in this day and age, the very same pesticide attracts 20% value added tax in one Member State and just 3% in another, whilst fully complying with the sixth directive on value added tax, something is obviously wrong!"
"We should not wait for the great day of fiscal harmonisation to dawn, we should do something about this with all haste."
"I am presenting this as evidence that we urgently need a new strategy for the internal market."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his good lead to us in bringing forward this clear, rational strategy document that helps us to see how the Commission means to bring forward the internal market strategy."
"Thanks also to my colleague Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi for having made such an excellent job of putting together thoughts in a motion for a resolution on this strategy."
"We are very happy with that but we will suggest one amendment: to clarify the position of artists in the Community, in particular in the areas of freedom of movement, establishment and taxation."
"In the main paper we are particularly attracted - as are others - by the emphasis on the need for a coherent approach to Internet regulation and e-commerce; also, intellectual property, distance selling and data protection - taking them all together in order to protect consumer rights and ensure adequate rules of viability."
"Naturally, in our group, we want to see that the achievement of the internal market involves a balance - as you said yourself, Commissioner - between market freedom and the need to protect the environment, consumer health and consumer confidence."
"I should also like to mention our sense - like yours - that the ordinary citizens need to see an increase in the speed and efficiency of infringement proceedings against defaulting Member States where the rights of European Union citizens exercised within the internal market are impinged upon or denied."
"I am very upset, as a member of the academic profession, to see yet again the issue of foreign language lecturers in Italian universities coming forward without yet a resolution after eleven years, after three judgments in favour of the rights of these ordinary citizens seeking to exercise freedom of movement, seeking to take advantage of that fundamental principle of the Union and the internal market of no discrimination on nationality grounds."
"It really is disgraceful that this issue still remains open."
"I hope that the Internal Market Commissioner and his colleagues will make it their urgent business to bring this to an end."
"The Commissioner has shown himself wise and far-sighted in his strategy document."
"I trust and am sure he will show himself no less resolute in pressing home cases which have to be brought to a conclusion speedily."
"Mr President, the internal market idea is based on doing business in a competitive environment without confines where the same rules apply for everyone: a level playing field."
"But I increasingly notice that the interpretation and enforcement of legislation in the internal market differs quite dramatically from country to country."
"One country enforces nothing at all, whilst in another country enforcement weighs very heavily on industry."
"Even the understanding of the outcome which needs to be achieved by means of a certain law can be totally different from country to country."
"I can list many examples: the fresh meat directive, the liberalisation of telecom, environmental directives or the directive concerning slaughterhouses."
"Customs offices too interpret EU decisions completely differently."
"What can be done in one country is completely inconceivable in another."
"A source of discrepancies are the minimum and maximum harmonisations."
"On account of the uniform outcome, I would prefer maximum harmonisations in future, such as in the case of the directive on distance selling or even mutual recognition."
"Any other approach will ultimately lead to a situation which covers so many variations that it will appear as if there has never been an internal market."
"The postal services directive will prove my point."
"In the Netherlands, we naively believe that the directive is one on liberalisation."
"This is completely refuted by the French Secretary of State."
"The aim of the directive is to protect public property."
"This will lead to a situation where the Dutch postal services will be extremely vulnerable to take-overs but the money involved will be earned in a monopoly."
"Indeed, Commissioner Monti stated that it has never been verified whether the ban on cross-subsidy is observed when making purchases."
"There can be very harsh penalties indeed for Member States and companies if European legislation is observed."
"Fair competition is difficult, especially if one time-sharing company observes the legislation but another one does not, for example, and nothing is done about it."
"Since this would obviously create an excessive amount of work for the Court of Justice, the Commission is planning to grant national judges power to rule on exemptions within the framework of article 85, para. 3."
"I can assure you, Commissioner, that judges in Naples and Frankfurt will interpret the article very differently indeed."
"I believe in the internal market, but I am very concerned because I am convinced that the market is threatened in its very core by a lack of uniform enforcement."
"There are too many different transpositions of directives, and as you also point out in your strategy, too many cases of non-transposition and non-enforcement."
"You mentioned the SLIM programme, but Commissioner, the SLIM programme is completely ineffectual."
"Simplified old legislation has a discouraging effect on companies which already comply with old legislation."
"And what you do is to reward companies which never comply with legislation."
"I do not think that we could subscribe to this."
"Besides, SLIM does not even work in itself."
"Enforcement is the priority."
"Mr President, with this document, the Commission has tried to show courtesy towards us."
"In a short space of time, the Commission and Commissioner Bolkestein have presented us with this communication on a strategy for the European internal market."
"Now, as Mrs Wallis has highlighted, the problem is that we are acting at breakneck speed, perhaps because we have little time and we have to move quickly."
"Clearly, the Commission has had little time to draw up this document, and we have had even less time."
"Tomorrow we are going to vote on a motion for a resolution."
"I believe that the Socialist Group will vote in favour of it, but it has introduced a series of amendments which, as you might expect, reflect socialist thinking."
"And here I would like to point out to Mr Lehne that, without doubt, he has not read the Commission' s strategy if he thinks that social considerations were left out of it, because the strategic objective number 1 which the Commission has set is to improve the quality of life of our citizens."
"And within this strategic objective, we should achieve, amongst the operational objectives, the promotion of employment and ensure the coordination of social protection and the broad protection of our citizens' rights."
"Therefore, the socialist amendments aim to fill this particular gap."
"And among the socialist amendments, there is one, which Mrs Wallis highlighted, which points out the special position of the outermost regions, which are totally separated from Community territory, a long way from it and which therefore, in the application of Community law, in accordance with the new article 299.2 of the Treaty, cannot be subject to the same regulations which are in force in the internal market in continental Europe."
"I totally agree with Mr MacCormick' s observations on the situation of artists, which would have to extend to the whole field of intellectual creation, which suffers from a deficit within the European Community, especially in the field of external competition, and I also agree with his observation concerning the need to guarantee the free movement and free practice of the intellectual profession within the European Community."
"And I would also like to point out that Mrs Peijs is very right to say that one of the difficulties which we have today in the Community field is that Community law is interpreted and applied in a different way in each of the fifteen Member States."
"The problem is that the Community has to legislate because, if it does not legislate, the States will legislate for it."
"At the moment, we have a broad set of Community regulations, fifteen sets of national regulations and in many cases, for example in the federal, or almost federal, States, many more."
"If the Community does not regulate, if the Community does not provide a legal framework, this will continue along the worst lines possible."
"I hope, therefore, that after this first Commission communication, the Commission will present Parliament with a strategic programme, with the necessary legislative package, with more time for the Commission and more time for Parliament, but I also hope that, during this legislature, the internal market will become a reality and that, in becoming a reality, it will do so to the benefit of the citizens and the workers and that it will allow for the continued consolidation of this European social model, which I would say at the moment is the envy of those countries which do not belong to the European Union."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the Commission."
"The strategic document which has been submitted to us certainly represents an important change in the single market and extends and consolidates the idea of a single market which is one of the main cornerstones of the construction of Europe."
"Among other things, it gives us a glimpse of a series of scenarios where the single market is certainly also the bearer of new freedoms and opportunities for the citizens."
"I do not want to dwell on some legal subjects which have already been dealt with sufficiently by Mr Lehne and Mrs Palacio."
"I would instead like to talk about some political matters which have not yet been fully addressed by the document but which, I am sure, will be the subject of a debate in Parliament, because it is through these matters that the idea of Europe is developing."
"Firstly, there is the question of how we are going to create a real single market where the States are currently tending to implement protectionist measures - we have seen some cases, even recently and how the Commission intends to make the best use of the infringement procedure, speeding it up and encouraging the citizens and their associations to report the breaches of Community law which occur daily in the various Member States."
"A second area is the use of new technologies."
"The European Union must provide a direct legal framework to allow the free movement and free provision of services and avoid conflicts and obstacles to free movement caused by too great a divergence in the legislation of the various countries of the Community."
"The directive on electronic signatures will definitely be followed by directives on e-commerce and copyright in the information society and on consumer protection in distance selling of financial products and other kinds of products."
"All the European institutions will have to be vigilant so that consistency of the common legal institutions is guaranteed."
"In these areas, a fair balance between public regulation and self-regulation of those concerned will allow the market to function without infringing citizens' or consumers' rights."
"Besides, these new technologies require consumers' trust in order to be fully used."
"Giving your credit card details must not and cannot involve a risk."
"Now we come to a third subject: how the Commission intends to act in the progressive extension of the single market to the applicant states."
"This must happen without calling into question the acquis communautaire and guaranteeing the albeit delicate balance currently in place."
"Applicant states' national markets must become integrated into the Community market smoothly, and it will therefore be necessary to provide for any transitional measures which may be necessary where these countries are not yet ready."
"Our goal, though, must be to help them be prepared right from the first day of accession."
"One final subject: what does this document mean for international economic relations, which will soon have a crucial time in the Millennium Round."
"We are living through a historic time which has no precedent and which calls for a far-reaching ability to adapt to changes, in order to prevent the European model leaving the international arena with its tail between its legs."
"Ours is the time of interdependence."
"Different aspects of economic and social life at a global level are entwined together and with their respective interests."
"Interdependence requires that diversities are taken into account, where possible, in the transition from plurality to unity, and it must be regulated by maintaining a balance in the relationship between the identities, diversities and co-existence of the models."
"The inevitable confrontation with diversity requires the ability to adapt one' s own identity as far as is necessary in order to be able to compete on an equal footing with others."
"So, in the sectors concerned with international trade, we are assessing how the mutual influence of systems on a global level is increasing with every passing day."
"We know that the European model has already been taken as the basis of the transatlantic dialogue."
"We must not allow our efforts to let us be conditioned by other models that are not our own."
"Mr President, Commissioner, any consideration of this communication by the Commission which we are discussing today should take into account the fact that it is a document which is being presented at the same time that the new Commission is starting its work."
"This consideration obliges us to highlight its positive aspects and, to a certain extent, avoid any negative comment."
"It would be unjust, therefore, to describe the document as unambitious, but it would nevertheless have been justifiable to level this criticism at the document if it had been carried out by a Commission which had been in action for longer."
"This situation cannot hide the fact however that this is really simply a document of intentions, which we take note of. Meanwhile, we will wait to see whether these intentions become concrete measures, commitments which involve a time scale for their implementation."
"Then, and only then will we be able to make a more accurate judgement of the Commission' s intentions."
"Amongst the aspects which warrant our special approval, is that of protecting consumer interests."
"If anybody should benefit from the construction of the internal market, it is the consumer, that is, all of the citizens."
"And in this respect, Commissioner, there is a phrase in the communication which worries us."
"It says literally that ""a more intense trade in goods and services between the Member States could lead to additional risks to the consumer"" ."
"This phrase raises the question of the view of consumer protection as an inevitable requirement to impede the free movement of goods, within the meaning of the judgement on Dassonville, Cassis de Dijon etc. In other words it leads us to the principle of mutual recognition, which seems to be very dear to Mr Bolkestein."
"I would like my position to be very clear."
"Mutual recognition is a principle which was important in preventing barriers to the free movement of goods, but it is only partially valid for the construction of the internal market in the absence of harmonised legislation."
"In order to move forward with the internal market, it will be necessary to insist on the principle of harmonisation."
"Once legislation in the field of consumer protection is harmonised, I would not be in a position to make such a statement."
"This is a very important document and indeed I am sorry that there are not more Members here to discuss it."
"The most welcome thing about it is a recognition by the Commission that we are moving now into an entirely new and different phase of the development of the single market from any that we have seen before."
"The first point that I want to make echoes what a number of colleagues have said, namely that this strategy has to be responsive and flexible."
"The corporate by-word now is about reinventing corporations, reinventing what we do."
"And of course the sort of new technologies available to businesses and consumers that many of us have referred to tonight are going to be the engine for making the single market develop even more quickly."
"Really the question I pose to the Commission tonight is whether this strategy is not in fact not ambitious enough."
"I really echo what my Socialist colleague said a bit earlier because we have to consider the newly emerging electronic technologies as being the engine of creating the single market."
"One of the things this strategy has to do is to really encourage businesses and consumers to move and adopt the new electronic commercial technologies as soon as possible because of themselves they will be what creates this single market in the future."
"I remind you, ladies and gentlemen, in reflecting on that, that as empowered consumers start to adopt this technology, that many of the barriers that are put in their way at the moment, the legislation for example on commercial communications, on the way that goods can be presented to customers, are going to become redundant."
"The messages that come directly to people into their homes are not going to be subject to the extraordinary array of diverse and intrusive in many cases regulations affecting commercial communications in the European Union at the moment."
"In future we must trust consumers, we must give them information, we must empower to use the information at their disposal and they will be the people that will bring about this single market."
"There will be new generations of new small businesses coming into existence to exploit and develop that technology that will be there to service these consumers."
"The second point that we must consider is encouraging the development of these new businesses, to encourage new entrepreneurs, to make sure that the traditional ideas of the European social model that Mr Medina referred to earlier do not in fact inhibit the development of making Europe the place that is going to have the sort of energy and excitement that we see currently in the United States in adopting these new technologies."
"So, in welcoming this, I ask the Commission to think about the next step forward, to encourage new technologies and encourage consumers and businesses to use them."
"Mr President, many thanks for allowing me to speak for the second time this evening."
"I would especially like to thank the Members of this Parliament who have postulated their ideas this evening, as well as their criticisms regarding the document which is tabled for discussion this evening."
"I will try to respond to a few points in more detail."
"I will probably not be able to deal with all the points in detail, but I would like to stress, for the benefit of the Members of this Parliament, that both my colleagues and I have carefully taken note of all the points brought forward and I would like to underline that we will make every effort to incorporate the ideas and thoughts prevailing in Parliament into the document at issue this evening."
"I would also like to thank the MEPs who have expressed words of appreciation for the Commission and who have welcomed this new strategy for the internal market."
"The Commission is very grateful."
"The Commission is new in this legislature."
"We have tried our best to work as fast as possible to submit this document to Parliament, thus enabling Parliament to give its opinion at the earliest opportunity."
"Needless to say, criticism can be levelled at many points and this is what some representatives did."
"But I do not agree, on the other hand, with Mr Medina Ortega, who remarked that the internal market should become a reality to benefit all European citizens."
"The internal market is a reality."
"The internal market exists and all European citizens benefit greatly from this in the form of low inflation, low pricing and the large choice of goods and services which they want to buy."
"In other words, I would like to say to Mr Medina Ortega: the internal market is a reality which benefits everyone, especially the consumer, albeit that they may not be sufficiently aware of this."
"As far as this is concerned, it is up to both the Commission and the MEPs to make this even clearer to these consumers."
"A number of representatives, not least Mrs Palacio, have mentioned what is termed these days as ""soft law"" ."
"In other words, these are not legislative instruments but instruments which relate to the use of the mutual acceptance of standards with regard to issues such as ""peer group pressure"" and to the adoption of the best working methods from other Member States."
"This is a key element of this communication."
"We are indeed making efforts to this effect and, as such, we are drawing on the original methods used to complete the internal market, namely the 1992 project by Lord Cockfield."
"There are indeed many advantages to the mutual recognition of standards and we would like to continue in the same vein."
"It is definitely the case that there is a difference between harmonisation and this mutual recognition of standards."
"As far as this is concerned, I share Mr Lehne' s view of assessing on a case-by-case basis whether harmonisation or mutual recognition of standards should be applied."
"Although it is something that has to be assessed case by case, I would like to stress - the proposed resolution, in fact, deals with this in one of the sections - the great importance of the mutual recognition of standards because they work faster, are more flexible in this fast-changing world and because they make sure they meet the requirement of subsidiarity."
"This is something Mrs Wallis remarked on. I could not agree more."
"The right balance needs to be struck, of course, between harmonisation on the one hand and the principle of subsidiarity on the other."
"I think that the mutual recognition of standards meets this requirement."
"According to Mrs Berger, the structure of the document was somewhat chaotic."
"I am pleased that Mr MacCormick claimed the opposite."
"After all, he spoke in English about a ""clear and rational document"" ."
"These are, of course, two conflicting opinions."
"My own opinion is that the document is well-organised."
"There are four strategic objectives, each of which is split up into three, four, five or six operational objectives."
"And then, of course, there are still those objectives which require a practical plan of implementation."
"So with the best will in the world, I cannot see why Mrs Berger claims that the structure of the document is chaotic."
"She does seem to cut ice when she advocates involvement of the European Parliament in the annual cycle set out in the document."
"This to my mind is a very important point."
"I would also like to stress that, every year at the appropriate time for this, the Commission will gladly listen to the remarks and ideas put forward by the European Parliament when, in the course of its annual cycle, it can once again examine the actual target actions close-up and substantiate them further."
"We find the involvement of the European Parliament a matter of the greatest importance."
"This is not only because in the European constitution, Council, European Parliament and the Commission form the three corners of the triangle which is to decide on all of this in a balanced way, but also because the representative body of the people that is gathered here is clearly best suited to interpret the opinions of Europe' s citizens, which is what it is all about, thus enabling the Commission to draw the right conclusions."
"I would, therefore, like to impress on Mrs Berger and other Members of this representative body that we will listen very carefully to the opinions expressed by Parliament when, in the future, they are put forward once or maybe twice a year or through contact on a smaller scale with the Commission."
"I would, furthermore, like to respond to the remarks made by Mr MacCormick on artists."
"I recognise that Mr MacCormick has a valid point when he highlights the situation of travelling artists within a European context - i.e. those working in different countries such as, for example a concert pianist or a dance group - when he highlights the predicament of those who create and propagate the arts."
"I myself would like to make an effort to raise the issue of the freedom of movement within the European Union but also to provide an improved basis for taxation."
"But, as I am sure Mr MacCormick will agree, this is not easy."
"There is no European income tax at the moment and it is not likely that there will be any in the foreseeable future."
"This might be a good thing but, in any event, I share Mr MacCormick' s opinion that the tax situations of artists working in the different Member States require attention and I am quite prepared to look into any objective suggestions made."
"As for lecturers at Italian universities of non-Italian nationality, I can inform Mr MacCormick that it so happens that I signed a letter on this matter today, addressed to an MEP who had lodged the same complaint."
"As far as this issue is concerned, we are aware and it is in hand."
"Mrs Peijs distinguished between minimum and maximum harmonisation."
"She stated that she much prefers maximum harmonisation."
"I agree, in principle, with Mrs Peijs."
"Ideally, we should agree on a maximum level of harmonisation throughout the Union and each country should observe this."
"There is, of course, room for defensible exceptions to the general principle."
"Think, for example, of the social standards which are higher in some countries than in others."
"If we consider that some standards to safeguard, defend and protect the environment are higher and more stringent in some countries than in others, then surely we will not prevent these countries from exceeding the generally accepted standard."
"Indeed, my starting point coincides with that of Mrs Peijs."
"I too favour maximum standards, but we cannot prevent countries from going beyond the generally accepted standard in some areas."
"As far as this is concerned, I think we need to try to strike the right balance between the internal market on the one hand and requirements with regard to the environment or social standards which exceed the general norm on the other."
"She also spoke about the postal services directive, which is a very important point."
"My department and, indeed, I myself, are examining how we can move this issue along."
"It may be premature to give details at this stage but I do agree with Mrs Peijs when she says that it is by no means an ideal situation that companies are bought by certain postal services which have a monopoly position, in other words that some companies are bought by those bringing about a monopoly-like situation."
"We do not welcome monopolies being used to purchase companies which are in the same line of business but which are independent."
"Because then this is a clear indication that the liberalisation of postal services has not gone far enough, or at least that this liberalisation is not applied correctly by some postal companies."
"We have to be very mindful of this because once again, we cannot accept this and this is also one of the reasons that I hope, in the not too distant future, to propose further ideas on how the postal directive can be further detailed."
"I will skip over Mrs Peijs' observations on the decentralisation of decisions in terms of competition, but not because I do not want to discuss them."
"In the dim and distant past, I myself have been involved in policies on competition in the capacity of minister in the Dutch government. Not wishing, however, to encroach too much on the remit of my colleague, Mr Monti, I will not go into this issue any further."
"She closed her intervention with the words ""enforcement is the priority"" . I agree with Mrs Peijs on that score."
"To draft a policy is one thing, to enforce it is quite another."
"This is, of course, also one of the key points of this document of the new strategy, namely that we acknowledge that legislation has been laid down in broad terms but that it is now a matter of implementation, enforcement and monitoring this implementation, so as to enable the Commission to lend its support to the correct implementation of provisions of the internal market by means of infringement procedures."
"My penultimate remark concerns an observation made by Mr Berenguer Fuster, where he states that consumer protection should not jeopardise the internal market."
"The document that we submitted and that is being discussed this evening, attempts in fact, in the first strategic objective, to create a balance between the internal market on the one hand and the protection of consumer and environment interests on the other."
"We have made this attempt and hope that we have succeeded to some extent in creating this balance and hence in preventing the protection of consumer interests from jeopardising the internal market."
"Because the internal market, of course, is also there for the manufacturer and industry although it mainly serves the consumer."
"In other words, if consumer protection were to be detrimental to the internal market, we would shoot ourselves in the foot and this is not what we want."
"And I believe that is not what the Members of this Parliament want either."
"To finish off, Mr President, I really valued the observation made by Mr Harbour."
"I know that Mr Harbour applauds the document on strategy with regard to the internal market."
"I would also like to thank him for attending last Friday' s hearing. In fact, Mrs Palacio gave a very valuable general introduction to that end and I would like to thank her too."
"Mr Harbour stated that the internal market should mainly be responsive and flexible, in other words should accommodate the requirements of the consumers and of the citizens of the country in question and should also be flexible."
"I could not agree more."
"We live in a world which changes at high-speed."
"The new electronic gadgets used in business are well-known, are gaining in popularity and create their own problems."
"The Commission should react to this."
"Will you allow me to impress on Mr Harbour and, in fact, all Members of this Parliament that it is the ambition of this Commission to be responsive and flexible, so that we can indeed, bearing in mind consumer interests, meet the needs at the time as flexibly as possible."
"Mr President, I hope I have not spoken for too long."
"I thank you for your patience and that of the Members. I would also like to thank them for their attention."
"It would be a pleasure, should opportunity allow, to have a further exchange of ideas with this Parliament on this important topic."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received a motion for a resolution, tabled in accordance with Rule 40(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.05 p.m.)"
"Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I have wanted for a long time to comment on the bell which summons us to meetings."
"We are very glad that it is rung, but is it necessary to ring it for several minutes at a time so that we get sick to death of hearing it?"
"Would you mind telling the department concerned to ring it in small doses."
"Mr Haarder, as you know, it only takes a few minutes to decide on important strategies but we need more time for small matters."
"You raised this issue during the last parliamentary term too."
"We shall see if we can do something about this."
"Mr President, I think they did not ring the bell for long enough, and you can see what happened - no one is here!"
"So could you make sure they ring it longer and louder in future?"
"As you know, Mrs Flemming, it is not the bell that makes Members hurry here, it is whether or not there are going to be votes in the House."
"In this case no votes are envisaged, and consequently several Members are working in their offices."
"Mr President, I only wanted to ask Mrs Flemming not to call me ""no one"" !"
"Your clarification will be recorded in the Minutes."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, I refer to Rule 43 and Annex II on the time periods for submitting a question."
"I had already raised this point and the President has kindly sent me a reply which, however, I do not believe conforms to the Rules of Procedure because, if the Rules of Procedure says one week, then one week cannot be understood to mean seven working days."
"Seven days can mean seven calendar days or seven working days, but a week cannot mean this, just as a month, or a year, for example, cannot be considered to mean 365 working days."
"Moreover, the deadline is fixed for the Thursday of the week before the week when the question will be discussed, but given that the questions are discussed on Tuesdays that makes eight working days, in which case the time period is exceeded however you interpret it."
"Then, in my case, the question would have been discussed on the Wednesday."
"That would have made nine working days. In any case, interpreting the Rules of Procedure should not be the responsibility of the Bureau - here a meeting of 22-23 November 1979 is referred to - nor of the Bureau at the suggestion of the President with the agreement of the leaders of the political groups as decided on 19 November 1992."
"There is only one body in Parliament, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which can decide on the interpretations of the Rules of Procedure."
"Therefore, I would like to ask, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, for the matter to be referred to the competent body."
"I think that the President will certainly welcome your proposal."
"In this way, there will be a response that is sure to satisfy both yourself and the rest of us."
"Employment"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A5-0045/1999) by Mr Menrad, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Decision establishing the Employment Committee [COM(1999)0440 - C5-0173/1999 - 1999/0192(CNS)] and on the proposal from the Commission: Guidelines for Member States' Employment Policies 2000 [COM(1999)0441 - C5-0147/1999 - 1999/0816(CNS)];"
"(A5-0046/1999) by Mr Menrad, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission' s draft Joint Employment Report 1999 [SEC(1999)1386 - C5-0215/1999 - 1999/2139(COS)]."
"Mr President, Parliament originally gave me the job of preparing a report on the proposed Guidelines for Member States' Employment Policies 2000."
"The wide-ranging debate and the many suggestions raised in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on employment policy in general encouraged me to divide my draft report in two, with conclusions and a legislative part concentrating on the proposals for guidelines for the year 2000, which the Council of Ministers must adopt in December 1999."
"Here in Parliament we should try to focus on the essentials, so that the Council' s response is not ""less would be more"" ."
"On the day after the vote was taken in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the Council also formally asked Parliament for an opinion."
"A simple consultation was therefore necessary."
"This means that legislative amendments may only be adopted without general conclusions."
"So for procedural reasons it became necessary to present two reports today, one on the Guidelines for Member States' Employment Policies 2000 and on establishing an Employment Committee, and the other on the 1999 Joint Employment Report, which contains the conclusions adopted in committee."
"This second report begins with a positive message."
"The Community created 1.8 million additional jobs in 1998 by means of its employment-policy initiatives."
"However, youth and long-term unemployment are still at an unacceptably high level in most Member States, and, in any case, every single unemployed person is one too many."
"I do not want to look at the conclusions in detail now, but bearing in mind the debate at yesterday' s sitting on the macroeconomic dialogue, I would like to make one point: the European Parliament needs to be more closely involved in preparing and implementing the European Employment Pact."
"We regret that at the Cologne Summit the word ""Parliament"" was not mentioned in the paper on employment."
"That is really not on!"
"We represent the public and are therefore the most important institution of the European Union."
"The opinions of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities are attached to this second report on today' s agenda."
"Both opinions significantly enhanced the work of the Employment Committee."
"I would like to thank the draftspersons of the opinions, Mrs Theorin and Mr Grosch, for their excellent work."
"Many of their suggestions have found their way into both Employment Committee reports,but in order to keep things tight, we have had to make a selection."
"This means that the chances of their being accepted by the Council of Ministers are greater."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities worked very hard on the employment-policy guidelines, and we are now looking at the legislative section, that is at the first report on today' s agenda."
"It in turn consists of two parts, the first on the proposal for a Council decision establishing the Employment Committee, and the second on the Commission' s proposal for Guidelines for Member States' Employment Policies 2000."
"The Employment Committee is intended to play a consultative role in assisting the Member States' coordination of employment and labour market policy."
"I have already mentioned the thrust of my report on the employment-policy guidelines: to concentrate on the essentials."
"It would be wrong to increase the number of guidelines any further."
"Instead, I would like to see practical implementation and verifiability of the guidelines and of the national action plans, based on concrete criteria."
"Simply increasing the number of guidelines will not create one single job."
"Quality not quantity should be the motto of modern employment policy."
"With regard to combating long-term and youth unemployment, effective and continued participation in the labour market can be achieved by switching from passive to active measures."
"Specifically, the percentage of the unemployed offered initial and further training or retraining is to be increased."
"We are seeking a target of 25% instead of the 20% in the Commission' s proposal."
"We need the most modern vocational training available."
"In this case, the existing guidelines need to be adjusted to the changing requirements of the labour market, especially as regards equipping schools with computers and Internet access."
"We need to pay special attention to female pupils and students here."
"A second requirement is access to the capital market, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, which create the bulk of new jobs through innovation."
"Promoting voluntary share ownership models for employees in conjunction with a clear reduction in administrative effort and a determined attack on the black economy could give a boost to job creation."
"Non-wage labour costs need to be lowered, because they have a direct impact on the competitiveness of medium-sized companies."
"Existing or new models for taxes on energy consumption should, however, be checked to see whether they are appropriate for maintaining balanced social security systems in the long run."
"Another means of combating unemployment named in the report is greater flexibility on the part of companies, which involves ensuring that they are provided with information and consulted at the appropriate time, thus enabling them to adapt to change. One way of achieving this is through minimum standards."
"Flexibility is also needed in working hours."
"We need intelligent labour models, such as the ""breathing factory"" concept, in which working time is adjusted in line with the level of activity. Working time is generally - but not always - reduced, instead of introducing a unilateral reduction in working hours without cuts in payment."
"That is no way to create new jobs, it just puts existing ones at risk."
"In the Commission' s draft, the four pillars of the guidelines are kept intact."
"The fourth pillar becomes the most important."
"It involves strengthening measures to promote equal opportunities for men and women."
"Coordination of European employment policy, especially by means of the employment-policy guidelines, should lead to a longer-term strategy of tapping the potential in society for creativity, innovation, entrepreneurialism, willingness to invest and a ""can-do"" attitude."
"Reforms aimed at promoting dynamic competition and flexibility need to be coordinated with the need to maintain but also modernise the social security system."
"That is how I see the European model."
"On that note, I ask you to vote for these two reports."
"Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and also to thank the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who were really working in less than ideal conditions. And by the same token I would like to thank the administration for their support, as this is an important subject, because despite the continuing high level of unemployment, unemployment and employment policy is generally not accorded the position it deserves here in the European Parliament and at European level."
"Why are we so reluctant, when it is perfectly simple to express this issue in terms of quantifiable defined employment policy objectives, in training at least."
"This kind of action would at least have the effect of forcing the Member States to utilise all the resources at their disposal to reduce unemployment."
"And as we are actually talking about consolidating the guidelines here, continuity of the employment-policy guidelines is a good approach."
"But efficient, performance-oriented action is only possible if these guidelines reflect an assessment of results achieved."
"In that way, the process of drawing up the guidelines could take account of a comparison of the best methods found in the individual Member States, so that successful strategies could be applied throughout Europe."
"In this context it is also important, as Mr Menrad has already just indicated, to have access to reliable quantitative data as a basis for comparison and trend analysis."
"There is no miracle cure that will make unemployment disappear overnight."
"It is more likely that a combination of different options and factors will be successful."
"As I see it, alongside training one important option is a targeted reduction in charges in areas which have been shown to create jobs."
"SMEs can play a key role here, as they make an important contribution to job creation and generally have enormous development potential, which must be promoted by creating optimum conditions."
"Amongst these conditions are a simplification of administrative procedures and specific improvement of access to information sources and research programmes."
"The services sector is above all widely recognised as the sector with the greatest potential for job creation."
"The employment guidelines should be an incentive for Member States to create jobs."
"But they should not degenerate into political dirigisme with companies subject to greater burdens than they can tolerate."
"Instead, the objective of the guidelines should be to induce Member States to adopt a proactive employment policy creating an ideal framework for businesses."
"With that in mind, we in any case hope that we will increase the potential to create jobs, with less subsidised public sector jobs."
"The opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is short and to the point, because we thought that was what was expected of us in this case."
"We did not see it as being our role to produce an expert report, or to recite a political creed, but rather to provide the Member States with reliable, correct and simple guidelines and make a contribution in that way."
"Mr President, the employment guidelines for 1999 emphasise that a concern with equality must permeate all action plans and measures which are proposed under all four pillars of the EU' s employment strategy."
"So far, the results have been meagre."
"A very limited number of measures concerning equality have been introduced."
"Few (albeit some) budget resources have been made use of, and few quantitative objectives have been established."
"European women earn, on average, 76 per cent of men' s hourly wages, and their employment rate is approximately 20 per cent lower than men' s."
"It is not enough to make sweeping commitments concerning equality under the fourth pillar in the employment guidelines. What, instead, is required are clear references under all four pillars."
"The opinion I have formulated on the report will ensure that a concern with equality permeates the employment guidelines for the year 2000."
"Most of the proposals which I and the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities have submitted have already been adopted by the Committee, but a small number of central proposals were not adopted, namely Amendment Nos 37, 38 and 39."
"These are now being submitted by a number of groups."
"These proposals require the Member States to undertake to achieve a balance between women and men in any decision making, to ensure that there are as many female as male candidates for committees and working parties within the EU, to improve labour market legislation so that it reflects women' s needs and problems, and to ensure - not least - that those who draw up the guidelines for national employment policies are trained in such a way that they might more effectively integrate a concern with equality into their work. Finally, annual quantifiable objectives are to be introduced in the Member States."
"My opinion is entirely in line with the Amsterdam Treaty which attaches much more importance to equality than did the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Rome."
"Above all, the Amsterdam Treaty describes the achievement of equality between women and men as one of the EU' s central tasks."
"Discrimination against women in the labour market is not only non-productive but prevents the development of women as individuals, of women as a group and of society as a whole."
"Mr President, I would very much like to thank the rapporteur and this is not just a formal thank you."
"He managed to complete an extremely difficult report and a highly important task under adverse circumstances."
"I believe that the report as it stands now is basically sound."
"There is, of course, always room for minor improvements."
"But this, of course, also holds true for what the Commission submitted to us."
"I would like to make two observations in this context, not so much regarding the Menrad report but regarding the report issued by the Commission itself."
"Firstly, I very much approve of the Commission rating the Member States."
"I know that Member States sometimes have difficulty taking the feedback on board but it is very important that this is done, because this spurs them on to achieve greater things than if there were no assessment."
"Secondly, I do feel that there is something missing from the Commission report, namely the demographic aspect."
"This aspect can be split into two components."
"The first is demography in the actual sense of the word and the second is the impact migration and emigration have on the labour market."
"Although there are statistics available for this, which are, in fact, also prepared by the Commission, these guidelines fail to take adequate account of them."
"I would actually like to ask the Commission to reconsider this in future because this is such an important issue."
"Then we had a long chat about the amendments in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"There were dozens and dozens of amendments, a large number of which have been resolved."
"I regret that these amendments have nevertheless been resubmitted, especially since those submitting the amendments largely agreed on the Menrad report."
"In particular, I am bound to say, when I hear my predecessor, Mrs Theorin, that I happen to know that the rapporteur has made every effort to incorporate as many amendments as possible, but it is no longer the case that all amendments as proposed, even if the same idea is repeated two or three times over, should all be included in a report."
"We now have slightly different proportions of majority in this new Parliament."
"It is unacceptable that if the socialist group feels that certain amendments need to be incorporated that these should be automatically included in each and every report."
"We should take a vote on it in that case."
"Quite frankly, the way the negotiations have been conducted, especially by Mrs Theorin, has caused some resentment and unnecessary friction with regard to this report."
"I hope that this will no longer be the case in future so that it will be easier to reach the intrinsically sound outcome of the Menrad report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission' s Joint Employment Report clearly shows that the European employment strategy is slowly paying off."
"Good progress has been made especially in cases where the Member States have reached clear-cut and common agreements."
"But there is certainly no cause for resting on our laurels for the time being."
"There are still too many long-term unemployed with no real prospect of finding jobs."
"Women and the elderly often do not fare well in that same job market."
"Jobs are still badly distributed and investment into services is still very much lacking for example."
"What is more, there are alarming signs that the process which has been in place since Luxembourg is now grinding to a halt due to a lack of European convergence strategy."
"Not all Member States have expressed the same enthusiasm to continue with this process."
"We were therefore disappointed, Commissioner, to see how the proposals with regard to the new employment guidelines 2000 put forward by the previous Commission were lacking in ambition."
"There has been no added pressure in this respect but perhaps we need it."
"My group is not asking for new guidelines either."
"What we do need is to add substance by setting clear goals in the existing guidelines."
"I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the rapporteur for his cooperation."
"It was hard work."
"We had to work fast but I should add that I regret that my group failed to reach agreement on a number of our high-priority points within the Committee and that we have therefore decided, Mr Pronk, to resubmit these amendments as we consider them to be essential."
"I think my group is entitled to this."
"I would like to point a few things out."
"Firstly, under no circumstances should we restrict the European employment strategy to mere following-up of what is happening within the employment policy at national level."
"As far as we are concerned, the European Union should take the matter into its own hands and push for change."
"This is why we would like to see greater substance added to the employment guidelines by setting specific, measurable benchmarks at European level."
"We noticed that a great deal of progress has been made in cases where the Member States had agreed on joint benchmarks, for example with regard to the integration of the young unemployed."
"Consequently, my group would propose three new European objectives for the next couple of years."
"First of all, it seems important to us that we should reach an employment level of 65%."
"This was the gist of Jacques Delors' White Paper and it was, in fact, also the text of the previous Commission in 1997 before the Committee on Censorship apparently took action."
"Secondly, we would also welcome benchmarks for the long-term unemployed and for halving the gender divide."
"Both long-term unemployment and the gender divide between men and women should be halved within the next five years."
"A third important remark regarding our employment strategy is that we should be careful not to fall into the American trap where work and social security are played off against one another."
"We are therefore hoping to create a link within the employment guidelines between creating new chances for the unemployed and new jobs on the one hand and the quality of those jobs and social protection on the other."
"As is the case with European Economic and Monetary Union and, in fact, as is now the case with employment, we are of the opinion that the Member States should be guided by the three most successful Member States."
"So in actual fact we would like a social convergence strategy in addition to the employment strategy."
"In so doing, we would like to make the fight against poverty our priority."
"I have to say, it strikes me as almost incredible that this proposal to set up a Luxembourg process for social security has also been rejected by members of the PPE in the Committee, especially in view of the fact that it formed the very core of the Pronk report which we voted on in the previous Parliament."
"In my opinion, those who take the employment and social security issues seriously should perhaps finally take a stance on the matter."
"Parliament got involved in the process exceptionally late this year."
"This was on account of the elections and the appointment of the new Commission."
"But still, we have made some progress because, as the rapporteur has already pointed out, this year the Council officially asked us for advice for the very first time."
"I urge us not to miss this opportunity of reinforcing the European employment guidelines and at the same of setting up a process of securing quality jobs and good social protection."
"Mr President, employment policy is a national concern, and it shall remain so."
"We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party find therefore, that, with the employment package, a good solution has been found to the problem of how we combine the principle of subsidiarity with a desire to ensure that employment policy is properly coordinated."
"The Member States' reports on how they are complying with the guidelines do not simply explain how the various countries are managing individually and in relation to the others but are also a source of mutual inspiration through which countries can learn about each other' s successes."
"However, precisely how employment policy is put into practice is entirely a matter for the individual Member States."
"A good deal of policymaking in the areas of employment and the labour market belongs at local level."
"What is more, success in employment policy is crucial to sound development in the public finances, and it is reasonable to see the employment package and macroeconomic cooperation in an EU context."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is not, however, in favour of the employment guidelines' containing demands that the various countries organise their employment initiatives in accordance with a specific template and in terms of heavy-handed numerical objectives."
"The individual countries themselves should decide upon the priorities for their employment policies and, in this context, we in the Group of the Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party feel free to take pleasure in the fact that a liberal employment policy which is particularly concerned with securing the correct incentives in taxation and social policy has been proceeded with in most Member States in recent years."
"In the EU countries, cooperation between parties in the labour market - in other words, the social dialogue - follows very different models characterised by different traditions and cultures."
"This process is to be respected."
"And it must also be ensured that the dialogue between governments and the social partners in the labour market does not overshadow the democratic process in the national parliaments and the EU Parliament."
"I want finally to say that, in its report on employment, the Commission has made recommendations to the individual countries."
"That is not unproblematic, and it is very important that the Commission should openly describe the assumptions on which it is making its recommendations."
"Mr President, the European Union' s employment strategy states that the fight against unemployment is being taken into consideration in European-level policy."
"This is desirable in itself."
"It is realistic. For the broad guidelines of economic and monetary policy have a real impact on employment at European level."
"And it is desirable if we wish to curb the sort of competition which is based on reducing social aspects to the lowest bid and also the growth of inequality between regions and between social groups within the economic Union."
"European employment strategy, however, in the form in which it has been laid down, has been progressively implemented since the Luxembourg Summit and is characterised by dubious ideological foundations and a not particularly dynamic conception of institutional practices."
"To hear some people speak, you might wonder why we even need a policy on employment."
"Yesterday' s debate on macroeconomic dialogue showed this: you might think that a policy of monetary stability would be sufficient."
"No one has yet proved the validity of the premise that it would be enough to guarantee monetary stability and overall competitiveness for employment to follow."
"Our last debate in Strasbourg on the subject of Michelin and the restructuring of firms was an opportunity for us to develop our doubts on the subject."
"Once it has been said that European economic policy should have employment as its goal, once this is laid down in law and is proclaimed loud and clear, without ever checking the validity of the affirmation in a realistic and pragmatic way, then the subordination of the social to the economic is being written in the stone of the Treaties, finally reducing the social aspect to the task of managing each and every one of us in our competition for a place in a labour market which is getting tighter and tighter."
"The result of this economics-based, minimalist approach is that any debate on the means of creating jobs, running counter to this liberally inspired dogma, is ruled out, virtually prohibited."
"Is it conceivable that out of twenty-two guidelines on employment, there is not a single one on the effective reduction of working hours."
"Not one is on public investment."
"And even the mention of active support for local initiatives on employment is limited and any attempts to examine the quality and sustainability of jobs created are eliminated."
"We have to deal with the figures."
"It is essential to bring about a reduction in the number of registered unemployed in a Europe where the number of men and women living below the poverty line is itself not getting any less."
"Before mentioning the proposals of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, let me express one fear."
"Some circles in Europe appear to be overcome by a feeling of blind optimism, with their eyes riveted on the upturn in growth and only the officially recorded and registered unemployment figures."
"A considerable number of political leaders seem to forget that many of the jobs created are temporary, part-time jobs, are not chosen, are generally forced on women, and do not always afford the people employed in this way wages which take them above the poverty threshold."
"If we do not seriously evaluate the sustainable and qualitative nature of growth, there is a risk that we will underestimate the efforts which still need to be made in order finally to give the construction of Europe a social aspect."
"This is why we think it imperative to evaluate the success or failure of European employment strategy against the yardstick of the indicators measuring concomitantly the numbers of registered unemployed, standards of living and the quality of jobs created."
"It is only when we increase job security and reduce unemployment that we can see the European Union as representing real progress for its residents in terms of civilisation."
"As far as the Greens are concerned, the selection of an ambitious European employment strategy should instigate a number of actions, most of which are currently ignored by the guidelines proposed by the Commission."
"The commitments undertaken in favour of the young unemployed and the long-term unemployed must be implemented at a faster rate, it is true."
"Job creation must be promoted by combining a number of policies supporting the development of sustainable activities."
"It is fundamental that local employment initiatives are favoured, that the cooperative, mutual and non-profit sector is supported by being guaranteed a status, that the third sector is truly recognised, including by means of public financing, this form of economy emerging between the traditional public sector and the profit sector, based on the creation of socially useful activities."
"Broad consultations and public debate must be undertaken in order to decide upon major public works: public transport networks, energy saving programmes, renovation and construction of housing, projects which create a great number of jobs and which benefit everyone' s quality of life."
"Finally, working hours must be reduced, that taboo subject, which we are not allowed to discuss in Europe."
"We must find the resources to specifically evaluate the initiatives to reduce working hours which are being implemented in any case, in an equitable or inequitable manner, more or less across the whole of Europe."
"And to make real progress, we must really bank on the intelligence of the community."
"It is essential to implement a policy whereby community projects and unemployed people' s associations are acknowledged."
"It is necessary, at the very least, to preserve their rights to allowances and grants in full."
"We urge that you give your enthusiastic support to two amendments contributing towards this, numbers 30 and 31, on which I shall ask the presidency for voting by roll call."
"Finally, institutional practice must be changed so that we really bank on democratic debate and the commitment of all the parties involved."
"We must find legal bases at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference for the whole chapter of social and civil dialogue."
"Mr President, unemployment is one of our really big problems in Europe."
"Even if it is macroeconomic policy which is the most important factor, an active policy concerning the labour market is also very necessary."
"The labour market can no more chart its own course than any other complex systems can, but must instead be regulated and given direction."
"It is just a question of how this is to be done."
"In fact, labour markets in Europe all look very different from each other, and the conditions which need to be present before they can be directed and regulated vary from one market to the next."
"In certain countries, levels of trade union membership are high."
"There, the social partners in the labour market can themselves play the main role."
"In other countries, it is the State and the employment agencies which play the main role."
"Where future labour markets too are concerned, we must perhaps consider strengthening the rights of individual employees."
"When the Commission and the Council now set about devising employment plans and guidelines, these national differences must be taken account of."
"You can have common objectives, but the way of achieving these has to vary depending upon national and regional circumstances."
"What is most important is that the actors at national, regional and local levels want to be involved in a constructive way."
"There should not be any commands coming from Brussels. Instead, we must listen to the actors in the market and develop a dialogue."
"I therefore think it is a good thing that the Commission has now seriously begun to emphasise the importance of local job creation."
"I was very pleased to see that one of the main topics in the so-called employment week conference which is now going on in parallel with our own discussions is precisely the importance of local initiatives."
"This, then, is one of the main themes at this conference."
"Whether or not the Luxembourg process functions effectively will depend in fact upon cooperation between local, regional, national and European actors."
"Where this is concerned, I think that the planning and the tools need to be improved."
"The Menrad report is a good step in that direction, even though I think that it largely accepts the existing form of planning."
"In the future, we in Parliament must be bolder with our proposals and initiatives."
"Personally, I think that the convergence philosophy ought to be replaced by an interest in variation, diversity, experiment and the mobilisation of local resources."
"Workers should not be regarded as an abstract labour force but as active participants who are to be supported and strengthened by the planning process."
"That is, in fact, much more important than individual detailed formulations in the written guidelines."
"Mr President, the enactment of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May 1999 has certainly ensured that greater attention is given to the implementation of a common employment policy."
"The central aspect to the implementation of new employment must be a need to guarantee a fair distribution of job opportunities throughout each Member State through the process of regionalisation and decentralisation."
"This is only correct and proper in the light of the fact that 11 countries out of the 15 are participating within a common, single European currency regime."
"This also takes into consideration the fact that within the workings of an internal market there are still many social problems which exist in both urban and rural parts of Europe and certainly in my own country, Ireland."
"Unemployment is falling within the European Union and in Ireland it stands at a little over 6% of the population."
"However, those people without skills seeking to integrate into the workplace have little or no chance of taking up remunerative and rewarding employment unless they learn a new trade or a different work practice."
"National Member State governments must also take into account the provisions of the new European Social Fund regulations."
"These regulations in essence will ensure that Member States support programmes that take account of the changing nature of work practices, the need to promote entrepreneurship, as well as supporting local job creation programmes."
"This latter point is of particular importance to me and my constituents in the Province of Leinster."
"Local job creation initiatives must be supported by national and European Member States."
"Local communities, from the private, public and voluntary sectors must be allowed to pool their collective talents in an effort to create employment within the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in their respective areas."
"That is why I supported the LEADER initiative both now and in the past and why I support the new EU EQUAL job creation programme."
"This is also part of the process of decentralising the implementation of EU and national job creation initiatives."
"The European Union and national Member States must implement programmes which take account of the ever-changing nature of employment, both in urban and rural areas."
"This also means that we must address existing difficulties which act as an entry point for men, and particularly women, to take up jobs in the workplace, most particularly so in rural areas."
"One such problem relates to the need to provide greater childcare facilities for women who take up jobs in rural parts of my country and indeed, throughout Europe."
"From an Irish perspective I fully welcome the recent publication by the government of its White Paper on rural development."
"The government fully recognises that a strategic programme must be put in place if more jobs are to be created within the small and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of Ireland."
"An intrinsic element of this relates to the need to put in place more expansive childcare facilities heretofore which simply have not been in existence."
"The lack of childcare facilities is a very real and fundamental barrier to women taking up employment in the workplace."
"Mr President, the employment policy is an issue with regard to which the European Union does not issue any binding legislation."
"And this should remain so."
"Indeed, the serious problem of unemployment justifies an approach which creates optimum impact."
"As such, the policy will need to focus on the local or regional job market."
"This approach requires the guidelines to be broadly-based so as to give the Member States sufficient free rein in terms of policy."
"The Commission' s plans to monitor the policy efforts and policy results at national level more closely are well-intended but will probably have the opposite effect, especially if this is done by means of a quantitative approach: counting the number of measures, aid schemes and employment projects."
"Adding the numbers up in this way tells us nothing about the extent, quality and inventiveness of the policy measures."
"Peer pressure amongst the Member States is better addressed by consultation on matters of content, exchange of good practices and focused recommendations which are really what the Member States need."
"Could the representative of the Council explain how the guidelines fit in with other EU policy."
"Just before the summer, the Council turned down a regulation to increase the tax burden with regard to energy and to decrease that with regard to employment."
"However, recommendation no 14 in the present guidelines recommends this very thing to the Member States."
"Why do we have this conflicting approach?"
"Finally, I welcome the insistence on a more family-friendly policy in view of the individualistic tendencies which seem to pervade our modern society."
"At the same time, I fear that as long as our culture adopts the idea that you only count as a human being if you have a paid job, we will be left fighting a running battle."
"The emphasis on economisation within society and the introduction of market forces into virtually all social fields, in particular, have a family-unfriendly impact and put humanity under pressure."
"I would ask the European Commission and Member States to undertake a radical overhaul of their policy."
"Mr President, we are being called on to debate the proposal to establish an Employment Committee."
"Often the establishment of committees is, in reality, a solution which is adopted in order to avoid addressing a problem, or when the ability, the power or the legal basis needed to address the problem is lacking."
"I think that this in reality, the first issue we must address is who must decide on employment policies."
"We have already said that the European Parliament was almost totally excluded in Cologne."
"I think that at least, given that employment policies at European level are already policies that make suggestions, recommendations and push for coordination between the Member States - so there is no actual concrete, decision-making power, which, all things considered, I believe to be positive for the subsidiarity principle, although it is a somewhat limited power - Parliament should be fully involved."
"However, a committee, an apolitical committee runs the risk of being a clearing house where there is the attempt to take the drama out of debates, to find alternative policies in the name of consensus, which is, of course, neutral and non-political, and which I do not think we can find when it comes to employment."
"The system of committees, conciliation and social dialogue must not become a substitute for parliamentary prerogatives."
"It must not become a substitute at European level, but obviously it must not become a substitute at national level either, because when we have social dialogue - which, in reality consists of dialogue between the large workers' unions, often in the more traditional sectors of the economy, and big business - it is often dialogue, cooperation and conciliation which result in the exclusion of those who today remain on the fringes of European economic systems, meaning the unemployed, immigrants and prisoners, and keep all those who are outside the system of guaranteed work outside the insiders' system."
"And, in fact, there is something very important missing in the guidelines on employment policies, and that is immigration."
"In reality we, like the European Union and the Member States, should find the courage to request and promote the entry of hundreds of thousands of people from outside the European Union, as this is the only way that we can fill the jobs with the highest staff turnover rates, because training the manpower, the current workforce in the European Union, is not enough."
"A bold, active employment and immigration policy is what is needed to boost employment in the European Union."
"Statement by the President"
"Mr President, I think the response to the investigation you initiated on the document which did not correspond to what had been agreed is just a little bureaucratic, in the sense that the matter which had been raised concerned a document which had been substituted without the knowledge of any of the signatories."
"This was the issue, so the response has nothing whatsoever to do with the matter raised."
"We are not going to reopen Thursday' s debate now."
"The response is the one I have just outlined, which recalls the terms of the inquiry which I had proposed and which everyone agreed to, which was carried out by the Secretary-General and which gave rise to this conclusion."
"Mr President, is the text which has been presented as the compromise text to the Members of this House the same as that signed by the political groups, yes or no?"
"The answer is no."
"Personally, I find it extremely dangerous that the presidency should be ratifying practices of this type which cast suspicion on the credibility and democracy within the sessional services."
"I refuse to accept your assessment, Mr Flautre, and I would ask you to read the letter that the Secretary-General has given me."
"You can read it, as can all the other Members, and I am sure that when you do you will rethink your last remark."
"Employment (continued)"
"Mr President, I too would like to voice my appreciation of the rapporteur' s excellent work carried out in difficult conditions on a difficult subject."
"Two circumstances have shown us that this is a difficult matter: an almost unanimous joint agreement on the urgency and importance of adopting efficient policies to combat unemployment and for this to happen within a framework where the necessary support for a positive economic process will safeguard social cohesion and the European social model."
"That the conditions are complicated is shown by the way our agreement on these objectives often runs the risk of collapsing when it comes to establishing the solutions and strategies for action."
"I will therefore concentrate on the things that I believe can be strengthened in the future and which can form one of the elements to be discussed in our debate."
"Firstly, I think that, as regards supply policies to boost employment, our intervention, the joint intervention of the Community institutions of the Member States, is important but it is not enough."
"I think there is insufficient coordination between the policies on labour, employment, and managing the job market and the policies which affect structural factors and in the macro-economic framework. There is an insufficient level of structuring and investment in efficient Community institutions capable of managing these processes where it is not enough just to respect the competences and the prerogatives of the national States."
"Regarding this matter, I would mention only one problem for the Members who, on the other hand, always show this sensitivity in particular."
"We consider unemployment to be an evil to combat, certainly not a circumstance to exploit even in the competition between countries' economic systems and production systems for instrumental competition based on social dumping."
"I have never fully understood what is meant when reference is made to a job with a social content but, on the other hand, I definitely do know that a perspective of increasing employment by reducing the fundamental safeguards and fundamental objectives of social cohesion is not possible."
"Finally, as regards active policies on the job market, training and retraining, all important guidelines, I think the level of consensus is insufficient, even on credible gauges of the effectiveness of these policies within national plans on employment, with regard to which the whole range of Community Institutions is, in any case, committed to assessing the successes and results."
"When we abandon compensatory policies and passive polices in favour of active policies, we cannot be satisfied by a casual use of words."
"What counts in gaining qualifications, training and retraining is action."
"When talking about the suffering of millions of people, statistics are often deceptive."
"We cannot allow them to be used as drunkards sometimes use lampposts - as support when they are unsteady, instead of to light up the way forwards."
"Mr President, cooperation within the EU on economic policy has now been taken further."
"EMU has been successful in the sense that, once the various countries had established common goals concerning inflation, interest rates and budget deficits, it emerged that coordination of this kind led to the objectives also being achieved."
"Inflation is now low, levels of interest are low and budget deficits are either low or have disappeared altogether."
"However, cooperation of this kind in the economic sphere is much too one-sided."
"We therefore pursued the question of cooperation in the employment field too, with a view to its having the same importance as cooperation in the economic field."
"This became possible through the Amsterdam Treaty and by the fact that the Luxembourg process had been set in motion."
"Now we are to discuss the guidelines for next year, that is to say for the year 2000."
"The Commission has no doubt been right to base these guidelines upon last year' s and to ensure that no unduly large changes are introduced from year to year."
"We still think, however, that increased clarity in a number of areas would be no bad thing."
"Let me mention a few such areas."
"Firstly, there must be more coordination between the formulation of the economic guidelines and that of the employment policy guidelines."
"Secondly, as Mrs Van Lancker also mentioned, we must have clearer objectives when it comes to increasing the level of employment and reducing long-term unemployment."
"It is important that, in these areas, we establish objectives and have a system of benchmarking for the future so that we can achieve the objectives concerned."
"I want, however, to concentrate mainly upon the social security systems."
"In Amendment No 1, we say that we especially urge that a strategy be created for social convergence which is analogous to the Luxembourg process regarding employment and with the help of which it can be ensured that the goal of social cohesion is given priority in the development of economic and employment policies."
"That is not the first time we have said this. Rather, this Parliament said much the same thing in connection with the Pronk report too."
"It was sensible then, and it is sensible now, to support this."
"Mr Pronk said previously that we cannot always support Social Democratic proposals."
"No, I can understand that, but one might at least support one' s own proposals."
"Those which were sensible a year ago are just as sensible today."
"What is the connection, then, between economic development, employment and the social security systems?"
"In fact, there is a connection in as much as economic stability is necessary for an increase in employment, and high employment is necessary to safeguard the social security systems."
"Finally, does this not conflict with the principle of subsidiarity?"
"The answer is no."
"If we look at the way in which employment strategy has been formulated, the objectives are shared but policy is formulated at local level."
"The same will be true when we aim at social convergence."
"We shall establish a number of common objectives in terms of combating poverty, establishing sustainable pension systems, securing good health care for all and designing a system which stimulates employment. None of this conflicts with the principle of subsidiarity."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. It is imperative that we regard the irrefutable fact that unemployment has fallen by 10.1% to 9.4% as being a positive step forward and that we also regard the employment policy embarked upon by the European Union with its four fundamental pillars in the same light while adding to this linguistic training and the issue of immigration."
"We also believe that we need to assess more thoroughly the creation of conditions at Community level whereby these processes can be monitored and regulated efficiently."
"We also believe that Europe can and must do more, so that the Europe of the euro will be able to function if we construct a social Europe, a Europe of solidarity and a secure Europe with more incisive macro-economic policies, linked to structural reforms which will stabilise and reorganise the States' public finances."
"It is true that employment policies are national policies, but it is also true that they must now be reproduced at European level, because only through conciliation and social dialogue will we succeed in consolidating the European Parliament' s power on employment policy, and this is the policy that will enable Europe, finally and decisively, to have a political, as well as an economic definition."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines rightly stress employability, i.e. the possibility for job seekers to actually do the job they are applying for."
"But we must never forget that this is just a possibility."
"Between this possibility and the reality of the job itself everything will depend on the state of job vacancies in society."
"On this subject, the guidelines speak of enterprise spirit."
"They are right but, in order to flourish, the entrepreneur needs favourable policy, low interest rates, a competitive euro and, above all, he needs to know the relationship between a given business activity and the number of job offers."
"This is the fundamental problem of the relationship between employment levels and growth."
"You acknowledge that with growth at less than 2.4% there was no reduction in employment."
"France is currently refuting this diagnosis thanks to its policy of reducing working hours, which is still too cautious."
"Let us hope that this policy is intensified and that it is extended in a coordinated fashion to Europe as a whole."
"Finally, there is one form of enterprise which is particular good at creating jobs; i.e. cooperatives, associations, the third sector."
"This sector merits a special status, particularly as regards taxation, and this is the subject of the amendments which we are putting to you."
"Mr President, Commissioner, paradox it may be, but the Menrad report has again brought unemployment to the fore within the European arena."
"This is a bad time for employment in Europe, with seventeen million unemployed and sixty million people living in poverty."
"If employment levels have remained identical to the 1994 levels within the Community, this is principally due to the massive loss of job security."
"We are really far short of the target."
"The Union needs to be ambitious in its employment policies, it needs voluntarist and binding policies, breaking away from the destructive rationale that is currently at work."
"At a time when money should be used to meet the needs of men and women, the needs of society, the Michelin case is a symbol of the tyranny of the law of filthy lucre over the economy and over individuals."
"The citizens of Europe are waiting for clear signals from Parliament."
"In order to be effective, then, the guidelines should include quantifiable objectives enforcing job creation."
"Reduction of working hours without reducing wages, without job flexibility or insecurity, should be the order of the day as we approach the year 2000."
"The Union should be ambitious in using money in favour of employment, monitoring public funds awarded to businesses, with a credit policy which penalises destructive practices and promotes job creation."
"Finally, declaring equal opportunities means that we must reject any form of discrimination against women, particularly with regard to wages."
"Mr Menrad has done a good job in difficult conditions, to be sure."
"The report includes many good points, but it does not, in my opinion, live up to our demands and expectations, despite taking a series of amendments debated in the Commission into account."
"It is not surprising, therefore, that a series of crucial amendments have again been proposed here by my own group and others."
"Whether these amendments are taken on board by this House will demonstrate the real will of Parliament."
"Mr President, on behalf of the UEN Group, I would like to voice my appreciation of Mr Menrad' s report."
"I must also say that, although his work does not define a Community law, it is impossible to ignore the importance of Parliament' s voice on a topic which is defined as a Union priority, employment."
"Moreover, I think that Mr Menrad' s report, supplemented by contributions he has had the courtesy to take into consideration, is actually the best possible within the confines of the subject, Parliament' s competences and the constructive methods of Europe."
"Nevertheless, the employment issue is not only found in the laudable work that Parliament can and will be able to do, but in a much broader field, sometimes with additional competences, sometimes with transient contents."
"Parliament' s recommendations and assessments of this subject are, of course, valuable, but there are aspects of this undertaking which seem to conflict."
"Yesterday, we heard the Council and the Commission talk about the impending start of the macroeconomic dialogue, but opinions and indications from this will not be published - this is what we were told."
"But it is not so much this as the rather uncertain spirit which has emerged, full of hope but lacking the desire to coordinate."
"The aim that was announced with the launch of the single currency seems to be to create confidence in the economic policies through the stability of monetary policies, prices and budgetary policies, as well as pay moderation and flexibility."
"And yet, today, the national macroeconomic dialogues have been shifted to a regional level."
"Conciliation has affected the regions and the Union in general and their programming ability, including their use of structural instruments and when devising models of local growth."
"However, I do not think that the Committee of the Regions is participating in the European macroeconomic dialogue, or that there are indicators in the assessment of the achievements of the States with regard to the creation of employment polices at local level, which are often entrusted only to the activism and will of the social partners."
"Moreover, a fundamental role in employment strategies and social integration is reserved for these very social partners, and there is still no clear definition of the role of the social partners in their capacity as NGOs."
"But that is not all."
"We cannot only deal with pay moderation and flexibility for their own sake, because this would misrepresent the nature and spirit of the national dialogues, the maintenance of social protection systems and all the planning instruments negotiated on the subject, sensitive not only to small and medium-sized businesses but also to those sectors that are more compatible with tradition and the characteristics of the territory."
"Taxation and security are certainly not secondary considerations, on the contrary they are more important than moderation and flexibility."
"The hope is to establish an exclusively European model that is more coordinated and more transparent but also more determined where the States, because of their diversity, are not only divided into the strong and the weak."
"Page 13 of the Commission' s report on employment refers to the fact that the level of employment is highest in Denmark, and two other countries are also mentioned."
"We are talking here about the three countries which are outside the euro area."
"This is in itself worth noting."
"I want to latch onto that graceful term ""level of employment"" ."
"This is one of those euphemisms which conceal the problem that, in this richest part of the world, we have 60 million citizens who are living under the poverty line and more than 20 million unemployed."
"It is noteworthy and thought-provoking that the countries outside the euro area have higher levels of employment and, if we look outside the European Union, we find a still higher level of employment, namely in our neighbouring country, Norway."
"The main cause of this problem area of employment, this blemish upon our society, is in fact macroeconomic."
"It is the EMU convergence criteria which, in themselves, promote unemployment."
"When we voted on the Amsterdam Treaty in Denmark, we were told that a number of decisive leaps forward in the direction of actively combating unemployment were being taken."
"We never believed this."
"On the contrary, the macroeconomic reality is the opposite."
"The EMU project creates unemployment and, where active labour market policy is concerned, it is transparently obvious that this presupposes local and national initiatives, and this on the very grounds that the labour markets in the countries of the European Union are organised on such widely different lines that it is impossible to implement anything other than the quite general and non-binding measures specified in the proposals we have before us."
"There are a lot of words, but there is a poignant gap between the words and the reality."
"Mr President, figures for unemployment and poverty in Europe are still disastrous, with 60 million people living below the poverty line, 9% unemployment and 25% unemployment among young people."
"It is not what you might call a positive result, especially if you consider that the slight upturn in 1999 was due, primarily, to an improvement in the economic situation in which neither governments nor the European Union played any part."
"You might even say that, in France, the creation of jobs in retail was achieved in spite of government policy."
"To tell the truth, reading the two Menrad reports, one cannot help thinking that the European Union is attempting to offer first aid, even though it is its own policy which is largely responsible for the social troubles affecting tens of millions of Europeans."
"Since the Treaty of Amsterdam, Brussels has had official, full and legal access to a new area of interference in social and employment matters."
"Indeed, it cannot be repeated often enough that it is its ultraliberal internal policies and ultra-internationalist external policies, its cult of the opening of frontiers and of the almighty market which have brought our economies to their present plight."
"A number of guidelines proposed by the Commission may seem positive."
"Surprisingly, one can even find common-sense proposals in them for a voluntarist family policy."
"But the good ideas are limited to the chapter headings, whilst examination of the detailed measures reveals the true nature of the Union' s action on employment."
"This action is just another pretext to extend the jurisdiction of Brussels to areas where its intervention can be nothing other than harmful - social protection, retirement, wage policy, taxation."
"We will be spared nothing: harmonisation, unification of legislation, alignment to the lowest bid in social terms."
"We can expect loss of job security, the erosion of working conditions, widespread social decline."
"It is indeed time for a change in policy."
"There is much to be welcomed in this report and the messages that it is trying to give and I would join others in congratulating Mr Menrad on the skill with which he has put his report together."
"As British conservatives we share the concern expressed throughout this House that the high level of unemployment in the EU as a whole is indeed a major problem and that a significant decline has to be the aim."
"Specifically we welcome the references to equal opportunities including the old as well as the young unemployed and for the need to promote employment of the disabled."
"We welcome the comments of the EMAC committee that the need for administrative costs and taxes and charges on SMEs to be reduced should be particularly stressed as these represent one of the biggest obstacles to growth in employment."
"We also welcome the general call for a tax review for reductions in fiscal and social security burdens plus red tape, all of which increase unemployment and bear down on jobs."
"However, we do not accept one key conclusion about the single currency, where it is stated to be fact that the implementation of economic and monetary union creates a good climate for new jobs."
"It is not a fact."
"The experiment has just begun and our views on the single currency are well known."
"Finally, we do not accept that it is for the EU to lay down prescriptive rules for Member States on the key issue of unemployment and we regard as very ominous some of the suggestions from Members opposite this morning that the guidelines should become reinforced or indeed binding."
"Different problems in different Member States require different national solutions to create the right climate for their businesses to create jobs."
"So, if and when these guidelines become rules, dictating to national governments what they must do, then we would oppose them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that it is intelligent and necessary to begin this brief contribution to the debate on employment guidelines by congratulating ourselves on the positive European statistics and I would like to show my appreciation for the work of all those who have worked so intelligently so that we may finally have a procedure for coordination in the field of employment, as provided for in article 128 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"But, at the same time, I hope not only to express satisfaction but also concern, because the project and the procedure, in my view, are ambiguous."
"Together with the clear fact that it is very important that the Union has, as one of its objectives, a high level of employment and social protection, we can see that the data shows that there is still an enormous gap between the support given and the needs of those people whose families and themselves personally suffer from the scourge of unemployment."
"And I would describe this procedure as insufficient, not because it is naïve to believe that it is easy to carry out, nor because it is puerile to ask the Commission and the Council to achieve objectives which are beyond their capabilities."
"I believe that it is insufficient because we are still treating the problem as if it were a current problem when, in reality, Europe is suffering from a structural problem of an historic nature, born of a change in production methods, born of an increase in productivity in work which leads to increases in production and wealth which do not result in increases in employment and that this increase in wealth is distributed amongst companies and the workers who are in work, leaving those in a worse situation out of the picture: women, unqualified young people and the long-term unemployed."
"To sum up, it is because we continue basically to believe that the market will resolve a problem which cannot be resolved by the market because it is not a current problem, but rather a problem caused by our model of society."
"And I would like to take advantage of the few seconds remaining to say to the Commissioner - while thanking her for being here - that she should keep an eye on the figures provided by the Governments, firstly, to ensure that those figures are accurate and, secondly, so that they do not continue to provide data on active policies which are actually figures arising from taxes on employment and social welfare contributions."
"We see, although we do not have time to illustrate it, that in the Governments' reports, figures are given on new initiatives on active policies, but they are being financed through taxes on employment and social welfare contributions."
"I therefore think that the Commission should be more diligent so that, so to speak, ""they do not have the wool pulled over their eyes"" and let us see whether, finally, in the year 2000, we may have criteria and levels to measure our objectives, our means and our results in terms of quality rather than just quantity."
"Only in this way will European employment strategy be more than just propaganda in some of our countries."
"Mr President, this is an interesting report and the proposals will no doubt be widely approved by the vote in Parliament, but going beyond the Commission proposals which simply, in my view, go over the Luxembourg process again, there is one question which arises and that is why attention is not focussed on the Monti Report even though it clearly demonstrates that it is the lack of social convergence or fiscal convergence which is costing jobs in all the countries of the Union."
"The message I would like to convey to the Commissioner is as follows: let us not simply stay with the framework as it is presented, with interest in employment fading."
"Let us get back to basics and realise that it is not possible to have a better employment policy if, after the phase of economic and monetary convergence, we do not wish to establish full social and fiscal convergence, with standards common to all the States of the Union."
"I await proposals such as these from the new Commission, knowing, Mr President, that at this time we are to encounter the social objective of the Union, and that means greater social richness and employment which is not based on partial measures but on economic development and on businesses which are fully profitable and reliable."
"Mr President, following on from Mrs Van Lancker, I would like to say a few words regarding the modernisation of the organisation of labour, i.e. job improvement."
"The outcome of the national plans of action in terms of modernisation is very disappointing indeed."
"It partly deals with partnership and consultation of employees and partly with new types of work and working times."
"The then Green Paper on the modernisation of the organisation of labour was an incentive to overcome the kind of labour organisation that is based on strong arm tactics."
"It hardly had any impact at all."
"The reports show that in some countries the low level of participation of people older than 55, women - think of the gender divide - seems to go hand in hand with relatively low unemployment."
"The people' s opinions on their work in terms of stress and all sorts of other phenomena are extremely negative."
"It is against this background, in particular, that the drafting of guideline 16, the modernisation of labour organisation, has been rather disappointing and it is likely that too much is being left for the European social partners i.e. employers to deal with."
"If the next round of national plans of action still does not yield any progress then we feel that stronger measures should be taken."
"I would like to appeal to the Commission to pay more attention to the quality of the work rather than just the quantity of employment."
"Mr President, my views involve some important distinctions."
"For example, I see the enhancement of regional and local employment initiatives and the greater emphasis on equal opportunities for women in employment policy as being positive, although I believe that Mrs Theorin' s criticism in this respect is still valid."
"Nevertheless, I think that the basic positions are inadequate."
"Each one of us has too many unemployed people amongst his or her constituents."
"We should have rejected that old chestnut put forward by the Commission that the unemployed ought to be encouraged, by deregulating the labour market and imposing social constraints, to look for work or seek assistance under employment policy measures."
"I believe that the causes of mass unemployment are essentially structural and socio-political."
"Sweeping references to service sector jobs in the USA make the picture quite clear: everyone knows that these are mainly underpaid jobs with no social security net."
"Anyone who wants to follow this US model is accepting or even participating in the destruction of the welfare state in Europe."
"I also regret that it has become fashionable to ignore macroeconomic analysis."
"As long as financial markets are more lucrative than investing in business, then the problem of unemployment will no doubt remain unsolved."
"I therefore urge you, ladies and gentlemen, to support the amendment that refers to this."
"Mr President, I would like, in turn, to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent contribution and also to thank the administrative staff of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs who, considering the conditions we had to work in, assisted us until late in the evening."
"Thanks to the constructive proposals for employment policies of Member States for the year 2000, proposals based on a fair analysis of the joint report on employment, Mr Menrad' s report outlines the route to be taken for Europe to maximise the potential of its extraordinary human capital."
"It is significant, too, that the report makes mention of demographic trends, as it is true that an ageing continent is a continent which is committing economic suicide."
"The report falls completely in line with the Luxembourg Process, for which, personally, I would have preferred objectives giving specific figures, and it is also in line with our desire to receive the report proposed by the Commission on the annual national employment action plans."
"In this respect I share the opinion of the rapporteur who stresses the need for our institution, jointly with the Commission, to supervise the implementation of European initiatives on employment within Member States."
"It is essential for a transparent and democratic public debate to take place and I have no doubt that if the Luxembourg process took place it was because Parliament was to some extent instrumental in this."
"But what I would like to say is that I consider it to be essential that this strategy which is just beginning to bear fruit should not be obstructed by rigid measures which are not adapted to the interests of businesses or of workers."
"Yesterday, members of the French Parliament met with French industrialists, and they reiterated that they did not want to see rigid and unsuitable measures obstructing this movement in favour of employment."
"Now to the second part of my intervention."
"I would like to stress the role of social dialogue within the framework of this policy."
"Social dialogue must be renewed."
"It is essential for workers to participate in the decisions which affect them and if, at the time, Mr Schweitzer, the chairman of Renault, had consulted the European Advisory Committee, created and proposed by this House, we would no doubt not have had the Vilvorde affair, and we would not perhaps have had the Michelin case."
"Secondly, the voluntary participation of employees in the production capital of their firm is also desirable and urgently needed, as the rapporteur writes in Amendment No 12 to the employment guidelines, for two reasons: firstly, for financial reasons, involving the need to improve businesses' allocation of equity capital, in order to withstand the dictates of the major investment funds and to safeguard employment, but also for a human reason connected with the evolution of jobs in the future, requiring an ever higher level of training and a personal commitment which is only given true worth and encouraged intelligently by profit sharing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank Mr Menrad."
"His report provides a helpful basis which, it also has to be said, has been very greatly improved upon by our shadow rapporteur Anna Van Lancker."
"As for the Liberals who have spoken, I would like to tell them that their theory that Europe does not need an employment policy comes five years too late."
"European employment policy has already undeniably demonstrated its value."
"Various analyses have shown that the Member States have taken many sensible initiatives, that they are taking workers' initial and further training more seriously than before and that new jobs have been created by means of this employment policy, and above all, Mr Brie, in the services sector."
"Our committee does not want to see new jobs in services with pay below the poverty level, as in America - we want quality employment in services also closely linked with production."
"It is possible to criticise the policy adopted up to now, especially the measures taken by Member States."
"We are not being persistent enough in fighting the exclusion of older workers, and it is evident that in all Member States, even in Sweden, women do not participate to the same extent in working life."
"It seems to me that despite the Employment Pact, despite the social dialogue, employers - businesses - are totally ignoring this issue."
"There is an urgent need for them to become involved, and financially too!"
"It is not acceptable for the financing of employment policy to be a matter solely for the Member States and solely for the European Union."
"Furthermore, both sides of industry must of course be involved in the process of renewing and modernising employment in the Member States."
"Involving employees and keeping them informed is a prerequisite for this."
"The Commission needs to play a more active role here, because there is still a great deal to be done in this area, as we saw in last week' s debate on Michelin."
"It is essential for the European Parliament to be involved in the guidelines, that much we agree upon."
"It is, however, also essential, as Anna Van Lancker has already said, to have specific, measurable benchmarks for the guidelines."
"That is why we are tabling these amendments."
"I have to say that I totally fail to comprehend why our Conservative friends do not want to support measurable benchmarks for the Member States, for example increasing the employment rate or achieving a specific reduction in long-term unemployment over five years."
"You will even be helping the Socialist and Social-Democrat heads of government in a way that could scarcely have been expected!"
"Finally, I would like to mention - since our Conservative friend has already told us this - that the euro is probably also a successful example of employment policy."
"All Member States have worked to comply with the stability criteria, as have those countries that wish to join the European Union."
"We also need these specific criteria for employment policy."
"Mr President, the Commission proposal on guidelines for employment policies in 2000 does not really add anything new as compared with previous documents."
"Nevertheless, it does contain some really crucial points, in particular on information systems and the policies facilitating the transfer of these systems to labour."
"It is also right to emphasise, as do Amendments 2 and 3 to Guidelines 1 and 2, that long-term unemployment cannot be fought effectively with State subsidies."
"I would also like to emphasise three limits which we still have to resolve concerning employment policies that the Commission proposal does not adequately address."
"First of all, there is still not enough attention being given to small and medium-sized industry, which has other problems apart from an excessive tax burden, which is typical of large industry too."
"Moreover, the document does not even mention the role of an active credit policy intended to support firms - the European credit system is still light-years away from the American system in this regard - and I think that the endeavours of the European Union and the Member States to redirect it have, until now, been very weak."
"Finally, the main shortcoming of these documents concerns the definition of the role of the regions and local authorities in an active labour policy."
"If we continue to think in terms of macroeconomic planning and we do not start instead with conciliation at local level and between administrators, trade unions and entrepreneurs in establishing concrete development plans based on actual resources, then we will never address the root of the employment problem."
"To this end, Amendment No 15 to Guideline 12 is important, but still not sufficient."
"Several Members have mentioned the need for measures to prevent discrimination against women in employment policies."
"We should be explicit in the guidelines about the measures that can be implemented like parental benefits, childcare facilities and policies to combat sexual harassment."
"We also need to call on the Member States to do more than promote equal pay."
"The directive on equal pay was adopted over twenty years ago but there is still a 28% pay gap so we should strengthen the wording in the guidelines and urge the Member States to adopt measures to ensure equal pay."
"The Commission' s report on the implementation of the employment policies stated that Member States had failed to go beyond token efforts at alleviating gender inequalities."
"Successful mainstreaming requires that the people making policy understand how to implement it effectively."
"So there is a need for training and awareness raising and a better balance of women and men in decision making."
"Research just published in Wales that I represent has shown once again that women are hugely under-represented in management positions at work and do not move up the career ladder as quickly as their qualifications should allow."
"We know this is a typical scenario and it merits specific attention in the guidelines."
"So I would ask Members to support Amendments Nos 37 and 38 which would achieve this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you can see from the reports on employment policies in the Member States, there is a high level of non-compliance with the guidelines on employment, and unemployment is still very high - particularly long-term unemployment - and this affects young people and women most of all."
"This proves that what is essential, apart from employment guidelines, are changes to economic/financial and monetary policies."
"The main barrier to the creation of good quality jobs with associated rights is the existence of a Stability Pact which has criteria for nominal convergence that impose restrictions on public investment and influence economic and social policies."
"What is needed, then, is a change in these policies, so that the priority becomes to establish clear objectives and produce efficient instruments for the creation of lasting jobs with associated rights, and to achieve a significant corresponding reduction in unemployment."
"I hope, then, that Parliament will adopt the proposals leading towards this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the review process facilitates control, and we should, of course, exert that control to a greater extent."
"I therefore think that both aspects covered in the Menrad report are important, because peace and security on the one hand and growth and employment on the other are key policy priorities for the European Union."
"But the review process and target setting release neither the Member States nor the two sides of industry from their main responsibility for employment policy in their countries, because they are specific."
"Benchmarking has been mentioned."
"I would like to add a few thoughts here."
"We are all talking about primarily structural unemployment."
"There are several indicators of structural unemployment: excessively high labour costs, lack of flexibility in working hours and general employment profile, an underdeveloped services sector, an over-heavy state and bureaucratic regulatory burden, slow rates of innovation and long lead times between scientific findings and implementation in production."
"So the first step we need to take along this path is to further reduce public debt."
"In most countries, we are still taking on new debts to pay off old ones."
"That means mortgaging the future, especially for the younger generation."
"We need more scope for the investment required for the future."
"Secondly, we have to combat structural indicators and step up the pace of structural reform, if we really want to bring down unemployment in the long term and not just increase employment figures."
"Thirdly, we need to give innovation in education policy a boost, because many young people, and also the long-term unemployed, cannot find work on the job market with their qualifications, because they are not yet adequately qualified to cope with new developments in technology."
"Fourthly, we must make it easier to start up new businesses, and we should support the small and medium-sized companies that provide and create 80% of the jobs in Europe with a harmonised and coordinated fiscal policy, and remove the constraints on starting up new businesses."
"If we proceed in accordance with the guidelines and these principles, then we will not only increase the number of those in work, but also reduce existing unemployment, and that is our goal."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mr Menrad, had a difficult task and ought to be congratulated on the orderly way in which he has carried it out."
"Most of the amendments express the anguish of us all over the most difficult problem of the single market - the problem of unemployment."
"This has a bearing, although this has not been voiced, on the fate of our democracies because, as history has taught us, democracies are not maintained just by the production of wealth; they also presuppose distribution on a large scale to the large majority of the population which, in today' s society, presupposes guaranteeing employment."
"One of the most interesting recommendations from the proposed amendments is the development of more analytical, comparative, quantitative objectives and parallel statistical data with a view to improving comparative evaluation."
"However, it should be noted that, in acknowledging that unemployment is not just a quantitative but also a qualitative factor, the quantification of the qualitative aspects of employment must be more extensive in respect of levels of income, working hours and special working conditions."
"After all, leaving aside for the moment the actual form of employment, this is by no means unfeasible."
"Qualitative data of this kind are the spirit of our social model and, with this in mind, there should be some means of representing minimum protection and the rate of reduction in the invisible sector."
"Also, employment growth must be linked to the type of activities which do actually stimulate it, because increasing employment using measures adapted to transitory working models is only a short-term solution and a waste of resources."
"In this sense, Amendment No 9 in Guideline 7 is on the right track."
"However, it does not fully accord with Guidelines 1 and 2, which specify vocational training with a view to effective integration into the labour market."
"The amendment incorporates the term ""lasting integration into the labour market"" , which is an improvement."
"The Member States should, however, interpret this to mean that the main part of the programmes should not be based on past activities but on those which aim primarily at achieving a capacity to create."
"One further remark concerning the services sector."
"Guideline 13 rightly mentions the development of the services sector and of industry-related services."
"I believe that a broader approach should have been taken on these issues."
"Developing the service sector can be effected in two opposing ways. On the one hand, we have the development of services within all sectors of production, including the agricultural sector, of which no mention has been made, thus breaking down the barriers between them and, on the other hand, we have the industrialisation of the service sector."
"The former creates wealth and so mention should have been made of services in the agricultural sector, whereas the latter, banks and insurance companies for instance, will lead to job losses and therefore other measures will have to be taken."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the employment problem is not only an issue for the national States, but also for Europe."
"Recognising this does not mean removing the Member States' competences, but asserting that with a broader and more cohesive view of the employment issue we can work with greater efficiency to address one of the most important matters of our time."
"We therefore need an institutional balance split between the Union' s objectives and guidelines and the Member States' free choices."
"The Committee is a first step in this direction, but it is not enough."
"As regards the guidelines, I would like to talk specifically about the part which concerns the transition from school to work."
"This aim is not pursued only by the albeit commendable proposals contained in Guidelines 7 and 8."
"Certainly, it is good that schools are recognised as having a fundamental role in combating unemployment, but there is no reference to the need for schools to operate in the field of planning within Europe as a whole, encompassing the participation of social partners, local organisations and the business world."
"Therefore, the Commission needs to refer to this aspect and undertake to promote support programmes which will encourage this perspective."
"Mr President, for years the European Parliament has been putting considerable pressure on the Member States."
"We are tired of woolly declarations of intent where tough decisions are called for."
"Now, just before the turn of the Millennium, we are reaping the harvest that we sowed at the Luxembourg Employment Summit in 1997."
"Under Christian Democrat leadership we were successful in persuading political, economic and social actors to join the practical battle against unemployment and for new work structures."
"The group pressure predicted actually materialised."
"Who would want to be one of the ones who have not done their homework?"
"Furthermore, there is added value at European level if the two sides of industry can also learn from each other how to develop new concepts and to implement pilot schemes."
"It was absolutely right to nominate Winfried Menrad as rapporteur of the 2000 report."
"All three committees that I belong to concur with much of his excellent work, which was produced under considerable time pressure. That certainly applies to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, with perhaps a few reservations, to the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, where the maxim ""less would have been more"" applies."
"The report indicates that much of the progress will not be sustainable."
"In one case there is a lack of macroeconomic thinking, in another a failure to implement structural reforms, and in the third a lack of coordination between economic and employment policy.There has obviously been an increase in preventive measures such as integrating the long-term unemployed into the labour market, and in active measures such as incentives to seek work or create jobs."
"But what is lacking is retraining leading to qualifications, and training facilities for young unemployed people."
"There is also a lack of part-time work models for older employees who are capable of work and keen to do it."
"We must not forget young people, who need access to practical experience with computers and the Internet."
"In this case the Member States are responsible for providing knowledge about information technology."
"Also, we must not forget those late developers who we need to give a second chance to by opening doors to our education and training systems."
"I am pleased to say that the biggest progress has been with small and medium-sized companies, which are now working in an improved environment for new start-ups, as various administrative burdens have been lifted."
"But we need action on access to risk capital and worker participation in production capital."
"In short, the four pillars of employability, entrepreneurial spirit, flexibility and equal opportunities are stable components of a framework to provide secure jobs in the future."
"My amendment, which has been accepted, seeks to ensure that we firmly adhere to the annual cycle for reviewing the guidelines, so that Member States do not let up in actively promoting employment."
"Mr President, in its document on the guidelines on employment policies in the Member States for 2000, the Commission takes as its starting point a basic consideration: that after its launch at the extraordinary summit, the progress made in the development of the process towards employment has been considerable."
"It states that 1.8 million additional jobs have been created in Europe, and therefore confirms the four pillar structure and the main points of the guidelines."
"We can agree on the need to keep the structure substantially unchanged."
"Nevertheless, despite Mr Menrad' s commendable work, both the Commission document and the European Parliament report could have and, above all, should have attempted more."
"In particular, coordination between the macroeconomic policies and the guidelines for employment must change from being simple dialogue to agreement between the Member States, without invalidating the competences and responsibilities of the States themselves, which no-one is calling into question."
"However, the guidelines and recommendations at European level need to be transformed into concrete, quantifiable objectives which the Member States must aim towards with their own national plans - concrete objectives which define targets that we can gauge in the medium term, converging in terms of employment levels and the reduction of the current gap between the employment of men and women, and also through investments in infrastructure and services and the promotion of youth employment."
"We need to establish quantitative and qualitative indicators."
"It is not a question of a solution at European level, as some fear, but it is, of course, a question of recommending a range of instruments which will effectively allow us to create employment and bring about social cohesion."
"We need, then, to take a giant leap forwards. We need to be bold."
"The launch of the single currency was possible because constraints were set down."
"If we do not do the same for employment we will never achieve sufficient results."
"Mr Speaker, the reform of the Union' s employment policy that began in Luxembourg in 1997 is one of the biggest and most important projects the EU has launched during these past few years."
"Although the main responsibility for the project naturally lies with the Member States, to carry through such a large-scale programme of reform without coordination at Union level would be politically impossible in the single market."
"The European employment policy is, indeed, badly in need of reform!"
"The basic structures of the Member States are the biggest problems."
"High taxes, enormous levels of welfare contributions and an inflexible pay policy often lead to a situation where society becomes demoralised and where work no longer is a financially motivating alternative for the individual."
"The framework exists, however, for bringing about change."
"The single currency offers a splendid environment for the promotion of employment."
"Establishment of the internal market will inevitably add flexibility to the labour market which, in turn, will make the entire European economy more dynamic."
"In addition, the convergence of the economic policies of the euro countries as a result of the single currency offers the opportunity to seek optimal models, a process known as benchmarking."
"A prerequisite of this is, of course, that we have comparable indicators; these have already been mentioned a few times here this morning; and, why not - sometimes we should look for these models outside the borders of the European Union, as well."
"The proposal for guidelines is very appropriate, and in particular Mr Menrad, the rapporteur, has done some excellent work."
"I would especially like to emphasise the importance of the measures taken to improve the employment facilities of SMEs."
"We simply have to try to reduce administrative costs, taxes and expenses."
"At the same time, I would also like to refer to the VAT experiment in the service industries which the Member States, with a few exceptions, do not appear willing to join at present despite the fact that it was duly carried through in the Council, I wish this matter had had a different outcome, at least as far as my own country, Finland, is concerned."
"I also consider it slightly worrying that the proposals for guidelines for the year 2000 are coming under discussion before the tangible actions regarding the old guidelines have been concluded or even started."
"The Member States have committed themselves to implement these guidelines in their own national programmes."
"They must also be given the opportunity to do this."
"Mr President, the Commission and the rapporteur, whom we congratulate for their work, recognise the need to bring to maturity..."
"Given the volume of noise that can be heard, I shall stop to make a point of order."
"The indifference of MEPs and of the Community Institutions must be the reason for the corresponding indifference of our citizens towards Community Institutions; every time that a problem in the area of social affairs is discussed, there is a complete lack of interest..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"As I was saying, the Commission and the rapporteur recognise the need to bring to maturity the guidelines which achieved positive results but which also have some gaps."
"We are far from achieving the coordination of employment and economic policies which article 126 of the Treaty recommends."
"The Commission made appropriate recommendations on the creation of effective work, on small and medium-sized enterprises and employment taxes that we Socialists hope will not weaken financial support for social security systems."
"With regard to the creation of the Employment Committee, we think that it could play a major role in finalising the guidelines and steering them through at local and regional levels, which does not happen satisfactorily at the moment, as well as in including the long-term unemployed and unemployed young people."
"We ask the Members of the European People' s Party to reconsider their position with regard to quantifiable and qualified goals, so that these guidelines become as efficient as we would all like them to be."
"The Commission will have to take into account the proposals of Parliament which, although it has been left out of this process, still bears responsibility for the unemployed: it is essential that Parliament accepts its responsibilities as regards the problem of illegal work and the people who live and work in run-down industrial zones."
"Mr President, the absence at a national level of any real dialogue involving serious commitments is hampering the modernisation of technology and organisation, and the Michelin case is a prime example of this."
"Mr President, I have to speak about matters concerning work, social issues and employment."
"We have the pleasure of Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou' s presence."
"I would like more time to talk about my proposals, so I would like to take her out to dinner, if possible, if she accepts my invitation, so I can speak for more than the two minutes I am allowed."
"I hope to receive a reply, and I will therefore use my few remaining seconds to say that I found the list of proposals from the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities rather odd."
"(Part of the intervention without a microphone) I would like to stress that pensioners and the elderly are happy to give their jobs to young people."
"There are 630 Members here. I am sure that many of us would willingly give our position to young Members."
"Of course, we would not increase the number of jobs but at least we would increase the number of young people who do not have a job, and in this way, they would have the satisfaction they deserve."
"I would like to say that the Member States' endeavours must be such as to place the elderly, who have paid quite enough for their pensions, in a position to leave their jobs to young people."
"In congratulating Mr Menrad on his report I want to concentrate on progress or the lack of it in achieving employment guideline 9, promoting a labour market open to all."
"It is precisely at a time when prosperity is returning to Member States across this European Union that those marginalised from the world of work can and must be helped."
"If that is not achieved now, these victims of social exclusion will be left out altogether for all time."
"The European Commission is quite right in its report to criticise lack of progress on employment for these disadvantaged groups within the Member States and to call for greater mainstreaming in our employment programmes linked to measures to combat discrimination."
"This European Parliament is right in our Amendment No 13 to support the holistic approach and for the development of comparable targets, which I will refer to in a moment and which I call on all in this Parliament to support."
"I welcome the examples in the report, in particular concerning employment of people with disabilities."
"On this morning, when welfare benefits for disabled people are causing great public debate in my own country, the United Kingdom, I welcome our example of the new deal for disabled people which has sought to break down the barriers by providing personal advisers at the local level through what is known as a single gateway to use flexibly both employment and social security budgets with unemployed disabled people to genuinely find the measures which will assist them into work."
"But here, at the European level, we can do more."
"If it has been possible to secure performance targets from Member States in relation to both youth and long-term unemployed people, why do we not seek a similar target to improve the employment of disabled unemployed people too."
"And, if it is the absence of reliable statistics cited as the problem, urgent action for adequate definitions of the information should be called for."
"If we do not do this, perhaps the Commissioner could explain how we can possibly evaluate the success of our policies and how disabled, unemployed people can be helped back into work."
"Mr President, Mr Menrad' s report appears quite correct in giving the modernisation of labour a fundamental role in increasing productivity, competitiveness and therefore also employment."
"Nevertheless, the conclusions have some limits."
"There is competition between the Member States on labour policy and the standards of the European Social Model which does not contribute to the achievement of the objectives which we say we wish to pursue and the conditions which, in theory, are guaranteed."
"When we state that the reduction of the tax burden on the cost of labour must not involve the reorganisation of public finances nor the balance of security systems, we are proposing a squaring of the circle that only strong economic growth can resolve."
"In reality, there is a trend to regain competitiveness by putting some social costs onto family budgets. In this way, though, the social divide will grow and, in some cases, marginalisation and fresh poverty will also increase."
"In any case, Europe risks in particular, in the globalisation of the markets, having to endure competition from those large economies which have invested, and continue to invest, more in technology and research, as well as in professional youth training, that is, in the future of hi-tech industries."
"So I think that Mr Menrad is right when, in his general conclusions, he emphasises the need for the Commission to harmonise the documents on the main lines of the economic policy and guidelines on employment."
"I think that, in this area, the Committee could be a very important step."
"Madam President, I would like to congratulate and thank Mr Menrad on his work."
"I must also say that I listened attentively to, and would like to thank, Mr Grosch and Mrs Theorin for the opinions of their respective Committees on the issue of the Employment Package."
"In my view, the outcome of this two-and-a-half hour discussion is extremely optimistic and it is clear that the European Parliament is following, debating and, above all, making proposals on the extremely sensitive issue of a European employment strategy."
"I would like to stress, since we have heard many opinions and proposals from various MEPs on the role of the Commission as regards setting targets for effective action, that the European employment strategy will support and encourage national policies and, in this regard, we are trying to cooperate as closely as possible with Member States."
"Today, the employment guidelines have been debated in the Committee on Employment and the Economic Committee, and intense deliberations are under way to get them to the Council, where we believe that they will be adopted in full. An official debate will be held on 29 November in the Joint Council between national finance ministers and employment ministers."
"I would like to point out that apparently there is an agreement on how we should draft and implement guidelines for next year."
"There are no major changes, the 4 cornerstones still apply and the changes made to the guidelines are very small and cover 4 points."
"The first is greater focus on the transition from training to work, the second is in the area of information technology where strenuous efforts are already being made, including the forthcoming Commission initiative on the information society, to coordinate the issue of employment with information technology; the third is active involvement at local level, where the Member States should pursue and work towards increasing the role of local authorities and, of course, the role of the social partners."
"Madam President, I would like to comment very briefly on the some basic principles which came out of the Menrad report and which were taken up by many of the speakers."
"The first is that it is clear that successful implementation of the European employment strategy requires a stable macroeconomic framework which is why there is close and continuous cooperation in the whole of the process of macroeconomic dialogue."
"The second serious issue is the issue of indicators and harmonisation of statistical services and indicators of the Member States."
"It is an issue which, as was rightly said, is not technical and is not technocratic, but it is profoundly political."
"It is extremely important yet extremely difficult at the same time to have a monitoring system for the Member States."
"It is one of our priorities and we are trying to make a success of the process of harmonising indicators."
"The next point concerns the concept of lifelong learning."
"We have made some effort here, but it is clear from the recommendations to the Member States that not as much emphasis has been placed on lifelong learning as there perhaps should have been."
"Our goal for the coming year will be to have a more vigorous and better organised policy on lifelong learning of workers in the Member States."
"The next issue concerns information technology."
"There was mention of a target and a proposal for targets at national level in the area of the information society."
"I believe that we can be even more ambitious and set common European targets in the area of the information society because we cannot talk of the convergence of Member States unless there is convergence in the particularly sensitive area of the information society."
"Furthermore, I would like to remind you of the decision taken by the leading States in Cologne to equip schools with access to the Internet."
"I would like to mention the extremely important issue of the development and formulation of policies by local authorities at regional level within the Member States."
"This was also one of the priorities and initiatives of the Finnish Presidency and we believe that the Council will consolidate such an approach."
"Members of Parliament, the proposal for closer cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament to promote the strategy for the European policy has once again been reiterated."
"It is clear that from Cologne we do have specific procedures, such as the spring and autumn procedures, but of course, I am awaiting proposals and practical means of implementing closer cooperation, which should be initiated by the respective Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your contribution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Mr Cappato and Mr Costa have notified me that they did not wish to participate in the vote."
"I take that to mean that they are in fact present."
"Votes"
"Madam President, I would like to inform the Members that Rule 51 of the Rules of Procedure was, in fact, repealed by bureaucratic means."
"This is the Rule which should allow Members to sign written declarations which, if they are signed by the majority of Members, would be directly sent to the institutions mentioned in the declarations themselves."
"Well, in my opinion, this right has in fact been taken from us."
"In Strasbourg, I myself tried to sign Mr Parry' s proposal to transfer Parliament' s activities to Brussels, thereby giving Parliament, finally, one single seat."
"It took twenty minutes."
"No-one knew where the office was, and it turned out to be on the second floor of the Tower, a long way from the Chamber, even further than it was during the last parliamentary term - and that was far enough."
"Now look at the location of the relevant offices for the only signatures we are comfortably allowed, signatures to receive the money for our being here."
"If they hid these offices somewhere inside the parliamentary maze we would probably rebel."
"So I call upon our dignity as Members of Parliament, President, because we need to give signatures relating to politics and political declarations the same dignity and importance reserved for the signatures for our presence here and for our money."
"I now come to my second point."
"Only a Parliament which seeks to shut away political declarations and political signatures in basements, a Parliament which, in fact, is regulated by bureaucratic logic, can allow the months-old situation of discrimination against non-attached Members who have less rights than other Members to continue in this fashion."
"We do not intend to collaborate with this discrimination, and therefore, neither on this occasion do we intend to take part in the votes until this matter..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, during yesterday' s roll-call vote some other Members and I gave our names because our voting machines were not working."
"I have now seen, much to my surprise, that according to the Minutes you did not see my request to speak."
"I would be grateful if you have that corrected."
"Absolutely."
"On the subject, as we are about to begin voting, I would like to tell you that, for our part, we have checked that all the machines are working properly, and I hope that you will check, for your part, that you all have your cards."
"Madam President, I feel obliged to support Mr Cappato' s requests on the assessment of the composition of the parliamentary group."
"If the matter is not resolved, I think that there will be other Members who will not be taking part in the votes."
"I hope this will not prove necessary."
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0042/1999) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the enforcement of provisions in respect of seafarers' hours of work on board ships calling at Community ports (8639/1/1999 - C5-0035/1999 - 1998/0321(COD)) (Committee on Employment and Social Affairs) (rapporteur: Mr Hughes)"
"(The President declared the common position approved)"
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0041/1999) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 93/104/EC concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time to cover sectors and activities excluded from that Directive (8642/1/1999 - C5-0036/1999 - 1998/0318(COD) (Committee on Employment and Social Affairs) (rapporteur: Mrs Smet)"
"Before the next series of votes on the Smet report, could Mrs Smet be given the opportunity to clarify on the record a point which she was not given the opportunity to clarify at the end of the debate yesterday in relation to share fishermen, who are self-employed fishermen."
"Can Mrs Smet confirm on the record whether or not the provisions of this proposal will apply or not to self-employed fishermen, please?"
"Obviously, there is no question of re-opening yesterday' s debate on this."
"Mrs Smet did, however, request that she might be given the floor in order to propose, I believe, that the vote be postponed until the Strasbourg part-session."
"I shall give her the floor immediately."
"Mr President, in response to the question raised a minute ago regarding fishermen, if they are self-employed, they do not fall within the scope of the directive."
"If they are employed by someone else, then the directive will apply to them."
"The request to delay voting until the next part-session in Strasbourg will hopefully enable the last few discussions between the groups to be resolved."
"This is a second reading."
"We still have sufficient time to organise the vote in Strasbourg."
"In consultation with other groups, we would ask to delay this matter."
"Very well."
"The rapporteur has just made a proposal."
"Is there a speaker in favour of Mrs Smet' s proposal to postpone the vote until the Strasbourg part-session?"
"Is there a speaker against?"
"On behalf of my group I would like to propose that we do not agree with the rapporteur' s request to send this back to Strasbourg for voting."
"There are more than enough competent Members of this Parliament sitting in this House to take this vote today and we should go ahead with the vote."
"I would like to support the rapporteur' s recommendation that we defer the vote."
"It is a difficult week with lower attendance in the plenary."
"Some critical amendments in this report will require, of course, 314 votes."
"We have already had one question asked in the House concerning a point of controversy that arose only last night and which might well, because of confusion, jeopardise an important amendment."
"In the light of that it would be sensible to take time until Strasbourg."
"The clock is still ticking with Council, we have time to take it there."

"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0040/1999) on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars (5617/2/1999 -C5-0037/1999 - 1998/0272(COD)) (Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection) (rapporteur: Mr Sterckx)"

"Report (A5-0048/1999) by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade and Energy, on the proposal for a Council Decision concluding the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Russian Federation (COM(1999) 324 - C5-0083/1999 - 1999/0133(CNS))"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as rapporteur I am convinced that the agreement on technical cooperation with Russia is a good thing."
"Nevertheless, I would like to move a postponement of the vote, as a sign that we expect Russia to make serious and concrete efforts to achieve a peaceful solution in Chechnya as soon as possible."
"In saying this, I am perfectly aware that postponing a technical agreement is not necessary the best way of adding force to such an appeal."
"I am also very well aware that this postponement, as unfortunately so often happens, will hit the wrong people, in this case Russian scientists and researchers."
"Nevertheless, although it pains me to do this, after many discussions with Members from many groups and committees I am now calling for us to give a signal, even if it is unfortunately only a very weak one!"
"I gladly agree with the rapporteur here."
"Yesterday, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I argued in favour of being able to give out this signal."
"I am convinced that the citizens of Europe would not be able to grasp why, however well-meant our intentions, we are today approving an agreement when the Russian Federation is bombing Chechnya and even preventing helpless refugees from fleeing."
"Madam President, I gladly subscribe to the rapporteur' s point of view and I hope the other groups will do the same."
"Madam President, in principle I would agree, because what Russia is doing to the Chechen people is disgraceful, but I do not think Parliament is being very consistent, because, a few minutes ago, it adopted an agreement with China, when China has been oppressing the Tibetan people since 1959."
"At this stage, for reasons of consistency, we either vote for both of them or we should have refused both of them."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, I fully sympathise with the concerns of the European Parliament over the gravity of the situation in Chechnya."
"Last night, the competent Committee was given the opportunity to explain the contents of this agreement and whom it concerns, that is mainly the universities and the research community of Russia."
"The Commission believes that this dialogue is progressing in the right direction to develop the procedures and strengthen the forces we want to see in Russia."
"We therefore believe that we would be sending out the wrong message if the agreement in question did not proceed in this direction."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"You have clarified the matter for the House."

"Madam President, I would like to make three preliminary remarks."
"Firstly, I would like to make it clear that the opinion I am presenting represents the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, even if my own views are somewhat different."
"That sometimes happens."
"Secondly, in some cases I am rejecting new amendments, where I think that they add nothing new in terms of content."
"I am in favour of presenting focused proposals to the Council of Ministers."
"Thirdly, there are, of course, other amendments that I am rejecting because of their content, such as Amendment No 46, which suggests reductions in working hours without cuts in payments are the only effective approach."
"I am in favour of flexible working."
"Thank you, Mr Menrad, for your explanations."
"You were kind enough to give us your opinion on each amendment and, as is customary, I shall announce your position to the House."
"Relating to Amendment No 13"
"Madam President, with regard to Amendment No 13, I have nothing against the proposal to take a joint vote on this, but I wish to point out that the German version is incorrect."
"This amendment was also proposed as an oral amendment in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"That oral amendment from Mr Skinner is not included here, nor is Mrs Sbabarti' s statement on the policy with regard to disabled persons."
"This applies to the German version."
"Although the explanatory statement is once again correct, it is wrong in the original German version."
"I would like to see a vote on what we agreed in committee."
"Besides, the English version seems correct to me."
"Of course, Mr Menrad, thank you for clarifying this important point."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Madam President, I have a brief point of order on the basis of Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure."
"In the voting which has just taken place, everyone was able to observe that a number of members of one group voted in a different way to the majority of their group."
"This is indeed perfectly reasonable according to the freedom to vote enjoyed by the Members of Parliament."
"This means, consequently, that it is indeed possible to have independent voting without the group being considered to be lacking in political affinity in accordance with Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure."
"If the same rule applies to the small groups in the same way as to the large ones, or to the large groups in the same way as to the small groups, then I think that the conclusion will not be that the PPE Group must be dissolved on the grounds that this or that national grouping has an autonomous vote in this Parliament."
"But then, in order to be consistent, Parliament should review the decision which the majority thought proper regarding a group which permitted the independent voting of its members and enshrined this in its own rules of procedure, which does not preclude the possibility of political affinities in accordance with Rule 29."
"Report (A5-0046/1999) by Mr Menrad, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission' s draft Joint Employment Report 1999 (SEC(1999)1386 - C5-0215/1999 - 1999/2139(COS)"

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Menrad Report (A5-0045/1999)"
"Madam President, we have rejected the report on the employment policy."
"Together with the Commission, we have established that a great deal is left to be desired in the Member States when it comes to implementing the employment policy, as laid down in the guidelines."
"But we wonder whether the Commission has taken sufficient account of the differences in welfare within the Member States themselves and the large discrepancies in terms of employment between the various regions."
"Take Belgium."
"The unemployment rate in Flanders is 8.2%, that in Wallonia is 24.5%."
"You will understand that Flanders and Wallonia have adopted one and the same policy on taxation and social security but this is inadequate."
"There should be scope for clearly different regional policies to be pursued."
"Regional statistics need to be made available in order to go in this direction."
"I regret that the Commission does not use this regional reality as a basic principle, because I am convinced that both a regional and a European approach are necessary."
"But then in order to do this it is also essential that we have regional figures at our disposal, as those supplied by the Member States distort regional reality."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, although we have all supported the reports on the employment situation, we believe that the unemployment rate is extremely high and that we have failed to find any really effective answers at either national or European level."
"There are many different reasons for this."
"One important reason in my view is that in comparison with Americans, Europeans are risk-averse, and there is also a lack of positive motivation in the public at large, which is needed if good economic growth is to be transformed into a positive employment policy at both European and national level."
"This is also partly a reflection of the fact that, in Austria for instance, we have a very low proportion of entrepreneurs."
"In Austria this proportion is about 8%, the second lowest level internationally."
"For example, surveys carried out amongst school leavers and students about to start work have indicated that 60% of our young people want to become civil servants instead of embarking on an active career."
"A simple analogy would be an employment teamin which out of 22 players, 13 want to be referees and only 9 want to kick the ball, with only two or three players wanting to be strikers, who are, in the end, the key to success."
"That is why we need a better climate."
"We need simpler laws and above all we should not make the mistake - and that applies to this House also - of over-regulation by means of European standards, regulations and directives, which the public see as an obstacle, and which ultimately encourage them to stop taking risks or setting up on their own, avoiding any really active business, and instead, just working in a secure area, which will ultimately lead, as far as economic recovery is concerned, to ..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Madam President, I would like to give an explanation of our vote on the Menrad report, especially as regards Amendment No 31, on which the French Members of the Socialist Group and I myself abstained when it was rejected."
"I would like to specify that it was chiefly the radical nature of the wording which was behind this."
"For, in fact, while we may share the idea that aid and incentives for employment cannot be totally subjected to conditions of rigid technocratic controls which are in danger of excluding one disadvantaged section of job seekers from this aid, our vision encourages us to propose positive and constructive support, rather than supervision, in the procedures which must be implemented, which are still, as we know, difficult ones."
"The practices which have already been implemented for this type of support, especially for the most disadvantaged, show that it is not sufficient to allocate financial aid which would excuse us from having to do anything more."
"This is related, in the final analysis, to the good conscience of someone who gives money to charity."
"But real social support for the objectives to be set with regard to disadvantaged individuals in the context of the contract-based procedures is the only way for support and incentives for job-seeking to be effective, not only for access to work itself but also for the issue intimately associated with this, to wit, the lasting reintegration of individuals who have been totally undermined by the destructive processes of unemployment."
"It was also in this spirit that we previously submitted an amendment on positive approaches which, unfortunately, was not adopted."
"- (FR) Last week I expressed my view of the Michelin case and the absolute scandal of an otherwise prosperous firm proceeding with collective redundancies."
"Today I wish to express my view of the guidelines on employment for the year 2000."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam gives me this right, and I am taking advantage of it to say how important I think it is for the European Parliament to be formally consulted on this matter."
"It is not a matter of adding new guidelines at the present time, when the basic rules adopted in 1997 seem to be working well."
"It is rather a matter of amending them on the basis of the joint report on employment 1999, adapting them to the new socio-economic order."
"The report tells us that there has indeed been progress since 1998, as unemployment has dropped from 10.1% to 9.9% and there are 1.8 million more people in employment."
"But these positive figures must not obscure the serious inequalities and problems which still exist."
"Unemployment among young people, for instance, is around 20%!"
"Half of the unemployed in the European Union are long-term unemployed."
"Many jobs are still insecure and 60 million people are living below the poverty line."
"It is therefore essential to give new impetus to employment strategy in Europe, and to set ambitious goals, such as reducing unemployment by half within five years."
"This can only be achieved by attacking on several fronts at the same time, using energetic, preventative and corrective methods."
"In particular, this requires reform and modernisation of education and training which must be of benefit to everyone, without discrimination based on social environment or on the individual, and which must take technological and IT developments into account, and a ferocious fight against all forms of unemployment and job insecurity."
"People must, at all costs, be prevented from ""getting used to"" being unemployed."
"The unemployed really need support, guidance and motivation in order to be reintegrated into employment."
"Imaginative measures must be found, which can be adapted to the diversity of the situations in different Member States and which respect the dignity of job seekers."
"But beware lest we fall into the trap which some policies create, claiming that, just because they are unemployed, people should take any job going on the grounds that it is better to have a job which is not secure than no job at all!"
"The objective is to enable the unemployed to gain employment which is lasting, with full entitlement to their rights!"
"- (IT) Unemployment is Europe' s main problem, and in Italy the situation is terrible, with unemployment exceeding 12%."
"We must continue to fight unemployment with efficient, incisive measures that are swiftly implemented."
"It is important that in this area, too, the European Parliament seeks the opportunity to intervene democratically in the choices of the European Union."
"The Members of the European Parliament cannot be content merely to be present, as has happened in the past, at decisions made in other places which do not meet the real needs of the populations."
"We do not agree with the document on employment policy guidelines as it draws on the ideas and principles of economic free trade."
"Nevertheless, the European Parliament is proposing some guidelines to bring about equal job opportunities for men and women, on the constant search for dialogue between the social partners and the necessary consultation of and provision of information for workers by firms."
"In our country, Communists are fighting for the law on union representation to be adopted swiftly, and this too is a democratic act for the work place."
"We have noted the European Parliament' s suggestion to bind the tax incentives to firms so that they will really contribute to job creation and not to restructuring and relocation which lead to redundancies, so as to avoid a repeat of the Michelin scandal."
"With limited, inadequate alarm signals being given with regard to the job market, we tabled amendments which were wholly reasonable and responsible."
"But they were not accepted. This is why the Italian Communists have voted against the Menrad reports."
"- (FR) This report is a typical example of the type of debate which precludes political consensus."
"This is an eminently political subject where one can see the conservative right flirting with lack of job security and the forces of the left seeking to establish social convergence, stressing the link between employment, job quality and social protection."
"For the first time the advances of Amsterdam give us the opportunity to be involved in the discussion of the guidelines in the form of Mr Menrad' s report."
"This is why we must insist on objectives which are expressed in definite figures, with a definite timetable."
"Hence the importance of the amendments resubmitted by my group, with the following requirements:"
"1) the combined forces of Member States and the European Union should converge towards a 65% rate of employment within the next five years;"
"2) preventative measures should have the objective of reducing unemployment by 50% within each Member State over the long term within the next five years;"
"3) positive measures should be undertaken to encourage the young unemployed to find a job and to facilitate their integration into employment;"
"4) the deadline of 2002 should be set for equipping schools with computers and enabling students to access the Internet."
"Employment cannot be assessed simply in terms of the creation of jobs."
"It is important, above all, to consider the quality of employment, of education and the quality of training for all."
"It is on this project as a whole that we shall be judged, on quantitative but also on qualitative results, on a new way of living, of life at work and life outside work, and balancing the two."
"Let us accept the challenge, and let us get all the weapons on our side, the side of life and integration."
"- (FR) I am pleased that the Treaty of Amsterdam accords the European Parliament the right to be more closely associated with the implementation of the European Employment Pact and that this House has, therefore, had the opportunity to express its opinion on the guidelines for Member States for the year 2000 on the subject of the fight against unemployment."
"Improving integration into employment, developing enterprise spirit, encouraging the capacity of firms and of workers to adapt, strengthening equal opportunities for women and men, these are the main pillars of this policy."
"In addition to these ambitious principles, we have asked the Council and the Commission to ensure that the guidelines become practical proposals necessitating implementation in the form of practical and effective measures within Member States."
"Indeed, while I am pleased to see the lowering of the unemployment rate on the European scale (9.4% of the working population in 1999 as against 10.1% in 1998), the actual gross figures must, in no way, obscure the human and social aspects of the economic situation which are extremely hard to bear in the most disadvantaged regions of the Community."
"The benefits of growth are not shared by everyone, far from it!"
"Thus, in the French overseas territories, there are dramatically high levels of unemployment: 27% in Martinique, 30% in Guadeloupe, 37% in Réunion."
"Far from being resolved, this situation has, in recent years, been constantly exacerbated, with the unfortunate consequence that every year it is thousands of young people who have all hope taken away from them!"
"To ""have your whole life before you"" , as the saying goes, at 25 without any chance to make plans for the future, no prospects other than unemployment and a minimum subsistence income - surely this is worse than a death sentence?"
"Should we be surprised (or indignant, as some are), in such conditions, at the temptation towards violence which permeates our young people and, occasionally, blows the cover off our social boiling pot?"
"The situation is all the more worrying because it is not the result of the current economic situation."
"It is a situation brought about by our remoteness, our insularity, and the very structure of our societies, their demographic dynamic."
"This means that the traditional remedies have no chance of success: growth returning and lasting in the long term will not be enough for the prospect of full employment to reappear!"
"But this current state of affairs must not be seen as inevitable!"
"Nothing is inescapable, and this is why an imaginative approach must be adopted, and the heart to find specific solutions to specific problems must be found."
"In this respect, the new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, by making a special case of the overseas departments as belonging to the outermost regions of the Union, gives us the opportunity to implement derogations to Community law in the interests of their development."
"It is important to remember that the European Council of Cologne last June had invited the Commission to present by the end of this year a raft of proposals intended to substantiate this new legal basis."
"This is the area where this House must apply its vigilance, ensuring that these measures are characterised by audacity and ambition."
"This is the only means of tackling the problems that these regions experience; it is the only opportunity to avoid disappointing the great expectations of their populations, the extreme points of Europe at the heart of the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean."
"I cannot vote for the report on the guidelines for the employment policies of Member States in its entirety."
"These guidelines do not actually wish to change in any way the situation whereby the economy is dictated by the market and by the multinationals."
"The fact is that the European Union has 20 million unemployed and 60 million people living in poverty and the guidelines do not envisage a single binding measure to prevent redundancies and lay-off plans."
"The only remedies proposed are aid funds for firms, but this aid does not, generally, create jobs."
"The so-called ""employment"" policy will continue to be, at best, restricted to a few empty phrases, or, at worst, it will continue to serve as a pretext for subsidising the employers with non-repayable funds, while no authoritarian measures are going to be taken to prevent major European firms implementing redundancies despite, at the same time, making profits."
"The fact that, in this specific area, the European States of the Union are refusing to bring in binding measures indicate that its prime concern is to sweep the obstacles from the path of big business, and that includes the social obstacles, so that they may maximise their profits and do nothing to put an end to unemployment."
"- (SV) In the discussion of the Menrad report, a lot of important questions concerning equality were taken up."
"I support the proposals which emphasised that young women in particular should be taken into account when educational initiatives for the information society are planned."
"Because I, for reasons of principle, oppose quantitative objectives as part of the employment strategy, I could not, however, support the objective of reducing the difference in wages by a certain percentage within a period of five years (Amendment No 22)."
"Quantitative objectives, especially within the EU, give a false picture of the options actually open to the European Union when it comes to employment, nor are they compatible with the principle of subsidiarity."
"It is good that the Member States should be urged to strive for best practice, but this is not to be achieved by means of quantitative objectives."
"Nonetheless, it is pleasing that a lot of attention is being devoted to the aspect of equality."
"Internal Market (B5-0204/1999)"
"I wish particularly to make some remarks about my reasons for voting on the strategy for the internal market but before I do that could I also say that I voted against the procedural motion to defer voting on the fishing matter because I shall be absolutely unable to visit Strasbourg in two weeks time and would very much have wished to express my solidarity with the share fishermen in Scotland, particularly in the islands and remote parts."
"In relation to the strategy for the interior market, I was very glad that Amendment No 1 was carried."
"My distinguished colleague Mrs Echerer, put this forward in our group to favour the position of artists who have to travel throughout the Community, earning in many different countries."
"I was very glad that the Commission showed willingness to take our point on board."
"Finally, in the debate last night on the whole of that resolution, I drew Mr Bolkenstein' s attention to the points in the report which say we must remove barriers which are preventing the implementation of the internal market."
"I drew attention yet again to the problem of foreign language lecturers in Italian universities whose rights have been denied despite three judgments at the highest level in Europe."
"I hope the Commission, as Mr Bolkenstein indicated last night, is pressing vigorously ahead to prevent this injustice."
"Thank you."
"That concludes the agenda."
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on 4 November 1999."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, since our last part-session, and particularly in the last few days, several terrible catastrophes have taken place, such as the new earthquake in Turkey and the floods in France, both of which have hit hard."
"With your agreement, I would simply like to express, on behalf of the European Parliament, my deepest sympathy and condolences to the victims of these new tragedies and their families."
"Madam President, I would like to add that, on Friday, a United Nations aeroplane crashed. It was carrying 21 volunteers on the WFP programme for the reconstruction of Kosovo and 3 crewmembers."
"I think that we should remember these victims too, and thank these people for the incredible and useful work they did and pass on our condolences to their relatives, as well as addressing the reason that caused this catastrophe."
"I would therefore ask you, President, if you think it appropriate, to hold a minute' s silence as well in memory of these heroes of our time."
"It goes without saying, Mrs Napoletano, that I shall pass on everything you have said and all our sympathy to those concerned."
"It also happens to be the same plane that Mr Swoboda, Mrs Pack, Mrs Nicholson and I took when we went to Pristina."
"It is a tragedy."
"We shall request an inquiry to find the causes of this accident."
"We shall discuss this with Mr Kouchner and once again, you can count on me to pass on all our condolences to the victims' families."
"Agenda"
"I would just like to discuss the issue of Chechnya and our continued support for the Russian Government."
"The genocide that is taking place in Chechnya seems to be ignored by the Western powers and certainly by the European Parliament."
"I want to ask you, Madam President, if you would ask somebody from the Commission or one of the Commissioners to come here to address Parliament and say what exactly we are doing to stop the terrible brutality taking place in Chechnya."
"The Russian Government is being supported by the Western states and in particular by the European Union, and it seems to me that we have a responsibility to bring to the attention of the Russians our abhorrence and our horror at what is happening there."
"Russia has enough problems without confronting Chechnya, and it always strikes me that this House is reluctant for the most part to criticise Russia in circumstances such as this."
"I would ask you, Madam President, to invite a Commissioner as urgently as possible here to tell us precisely what the European Union intends to do on the issue of Chechnya."
"Mr Andrews, I can tell you that your wish has been granted even more quickly than you could have imagined, because the debate on Chechnya has been included on our agenda on Wednesday afternoon and of course we shall hear statements both by the Council and the Commission."
"The next item is the examination of the final draft Agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 11 November pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure."
"Relating to Tuesday: President."
"I have received a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists for the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report to be moved from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m."
"Does anyone wish to speak in support of this request?"
"Madam President, in my opinion it is enormously important that we include the Court of Auditors' annual report in the agenda."
"This yearly best-seller is once more making its appearance, and it would be wrong if Parliament did not organise a plenary session debate on the subject, as the press already know about it."
"Any leak of information is extremely unfortunate, but it has happened before."
"I believe we must discuss this at a plenary session, and not leave it to the lobbying process, as we will be debating it in any case."
"Madam President, with regard to the presentation of the report of the Court of Auditors, it is clear that, at the moment, this report - which previously attracted very little attention - has become an important item in the press."
"Certain Members and groups have expressed their concern at the occurrences of leaks to the press - a concern which I share - and I think that we should ask the Court of Auditors, as well as the other institutions, to respect the time limits."
"But it seems to me that the punishment which some people have tried to impose on the Court of Auditors is absolutely out of proportion because if we remove from the agenda all the issues which have suffered from leaks, we will end up with no agenda at all."
"We have to be more rigorous in our behaviour."
"I believe that the reasonable thing to do, bearing in mind, furthermore, that the report of the Court of Auditors has a series of consequences for Parliament' s activities - and I am thinking particularly of the approval of its management - is to present what has happened to the President of the Court of Auditors and get him to commit himself publicly, apart from giving the relevant explanations, to an investigation to try to control this issue, and to improve the system of distribution and provision of information to Parliament."
"However, in any case, I think that in the end it we will be the ones who are penalised through this behaviour."
"Therefore, I believe that the sensible thing to do is, tomorrow, after the presentation which the Committee on Budgetary Control is going to make today, to present this report to Parliament."
"Madam President, I agree with the two former speakers that this is an annual report of the first rank and of the highest political order."
"It is precisely because I agree that I believe this Parliament should use this occasion to signal to the Court of Auditors its intense disquiet at the fact that a document of substance of the sort prepared by the Court should, whether correct or incorrect in terms of its content, have found its way into Der Spiegel of 8 November."
"This is not the way to do business."
"In a matter as weighty as this it is not right, on whoever' s part - and I do not know who is to blame for this leak - to seek a route which chooses the sensational over the institutional management of this issue."
"We are the body with the political competence to take into account the substantial and professional work of the Court of Auditors."
"It does not make sense that we should now be negotiating with the European Commission, following all the events of the past several months, a new code of conduct which, inter alia, insists that where there are issues of importance the Commission first comes here to tell this House what they are and then to take a procedure, such as the annual Report of the Court of Auditors, and say: there was a leak, it is a bit unfortunate, but let us get on with business as if nothing happened."
"No."
"This is the moment to draw a line and say to the Court of Auditors - whom my group holds in very high esteem - that we have separate functions: they audit and we do the politics."
"One of the tasks between now and December, if we choose to postpone this matter - as was the view of the majority of the Conference of Presidents - would be to invite the President of the Court of Auditors to undertake an extensive investigation as to whether it was to the Court or another institution that the leak could be traced."
"It was the Committee on Budgetary Control of Parliament which began years ago to insist that we should give, as parliamentarians, this report the weight that it deserves."
"In saying ""postpone it"" we are saying we want to take command of what is in it - not to sweep it under the carpet."
"We are saying that from now on there are new rules of engagement, not just with the Commission."
"The creeping propensity to find ourselves, as parliamentarians, on the back foot, explaining leaks that were inspired by one source or another is not the way to do business."
"Let us claim our rights as the institution."
"Let us stop sensationalising the work of the Court of Auditors."
"Madam President, I believe that this issue is self-explanatory in the sense that we already debated in the previous part-session the importance of Parliament adopting the development and implementing regulations of an interinstitutional agreement, which was agreed during the last legislature and ratified by Parliament."
"At that time the possibility arose that the issue would be returned to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs amid the reservations and doubts of some groups."
"No reservation was made; the question has been referred back to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and it seems that, finally, we are going to reach an agreement today."
"I believe that it is an issue of maximum importance not only for the protection of our dignity as MEPs, but also in terms of respecting our promise."
"This is the reason why we have requested that this issue be dealt with as quickly as possible, on the understanding that there may always be reservations, but that these reservations must be justified and, above all, they have to be debated."
"We hope that this can be done today in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"(Parliament agreed to the amendment)"
"President."
"This point will thus be the last to be debated on Wednesday' s agenda and we could then put it to the vote on Thursday."
"Still on the subject of Wednesday' s agenda, the Commission has informed me, on the subject of the debate on Chechnya, which is due to take place between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., that Commissioner Patten will have to leave Strasbourg at 4 p.m. and will therefore not be able to be present."
"At the Conference of Presidents, we asked Mr Verheugen to guarantee that he would attend this debate, and today I have been informed that there is no guarantee that Mr Verheugen will be available and that another Commissioner may take his place."
"I think it is very inconvenient, and I am sure that you do too."
"I therefore propose that we table the statement on Chechnya by the Council and the Commission from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. which would allow Commissioner Patten to take part and which would not delay the other debates because we would in any case have to adjourn the debate on the IGC between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m."
"That is my proposal."
"Madam President, I have a question about the agenda you are proposing."
"On Wednesday, we also have the important Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report."
"How do things stand on timing?"
"Do we have enough time to consider this report as well, given how important it is for the future of the European Union? Both rapporteurs deserve to have a reasonable amount of time devoted to their report."
"Could you comment on this, please?"
"Mr Poettering, as the debate on Chechnya is in any case tabled for 5 p.m. to 6 p.m., we shall have to adjourn the debate you are talking about from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m."
"If we hold the debate on Chechnya at 3 p.m. and then we continue the debate on the very important report that you mentioned, I do not think that any harm will be done."
"I think it would be very inconvenient to hold a debate on the situation in Chechnya without the competent Commissioner for the matter."
"As you know, this is something we have never liked to do."
"Madam President, with regard to the debate on the situation in Chechnya, I believe that the Presidency' s proposal is absolutely reasonable."
"In relation to the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report, so that there may at least be an intervention by groups on such an important report, I would propose that in this case the Questions to the Council be cancelled, and in that way all of the groups could express their view, since this is a very important matter for Parliament."
"Madam President, I would like to support your proposal."
"Perhaps we can state, in order to enlighten everyone on the matter, as we discussed it at the Conference of Presidents, that in the expected absence of Mr Patten, we had suggested the name of Mr Verheugen not in a personal capacity, but because he is one of the Commissioners particularly involved with international affairs."
"Now, on a subject as sensitive as Chechnya, we do not simply want a text written in advance by someone else to be read out."
"Therefore, I entirely support your proposal."
"I think that it is better to move the debate on the agenda and have the opportunity to hear directly from the Commissioner concerned."
"Madam President, your proposal to hold the discussion on Chechnya between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. is, in my view, the best solution."
"Instead of interrupting the discussion on the Intergovernmental Conference, we shall begin the afternoon sitting on that an hour later so that both issues may be discussed properly."
"Thank you for your understanding, Mr Dimitrakopoulos."
"Madam President, I just wanted to say that I am against Mr Barón Crespo' s suggestion that we should cancel Question Time."
"I regard Question Time as a fundamental parliamentary right, which unlike other agenda items is specifically protected in legal terms, and I would like to insist that the full Question Time should be held."
"I do of course understand that there are problems with time, but that is simply because we have relatively little time and a great deal to discuss, and the people who are now complaining about this are precisely the ones we wanted to shorten the plenary weeks a little while back."
"At the time I protested against that unrealistic proposal and thank goodness that succeeded."
"We used to have Council representatives here on two days: Wednesdays and Thursdays, and we had Council Question Time on Wednesday evening."
"That worked brilliantly."
"Somewhere along the line they cut Council attendance to one day, and that is the cause of the problems."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us take one thing at a time."
"We are concerned now with retabling the report on Chechnya."
"I shall give the floor to Mr Leinen, the second rapporteur, and then we shall make a decision on this matter."
"Madam President, I agree that we should have the Commissioner here when we discuss Chechnya."
"I also agree that we should discuss the situation in Chechnya at 3 p.m., but I would like to request that the debate on the Intergovernmental Conference should be taken in one go."
"I support Mr Barón Crespo' s idea of waiting until we have completed the debate and then finishing with the ""Questions to the Council"" agenda item."
"It would be wrong to consider a topic as important as the Intergovernmental Conference in bits and pieces, with a little bit on Wednesday and then perhaps another bit on Thursday morning."
"We should be able to debate this subject without interruption."
"Thank you, Mr Leinen."
"I put to the vote that we move the debate on Chechnya to 3 p.m. instead of 5 p.m."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Now we have Mr Barón Crespo' s proposal to cancel Question Time to the Council, a proposal adapted by Mr Leinen, who proposes that this Question Time could take place during the evening sitting, at the end of the institutional debate, which I think is exactly what Mr Barón Crespo would like to see."
"Madam President, after the debate on Chechnya, the debate on the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report would begin."
"Therefore, what we could do is to postpone Question Time a little."
"I think this is a reasonable request."
"Mr Poettering, I think that the Council would entirely agree with Mr Barón Crespo' s proposal to hold Question Time after the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen debate."
"What is your position on this?"
"Madam President, it is as you have just said."
"I just wanted to be sure that Question Time to the Council would actually take place."
"Mr Posselt is quite right there."
"It is the Members' right to hear the answers, and we should ensure - procedurally speaking - that they can be given to Members."
"Who is in favour of keeping Question Time on the agenda by holding it after the Leinen-Dimitrakopoulos report?"
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"Relating to Thursday:"
"With regard to the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance requests that two sub-items be added to item 3, Human Rights."
"Firstly, the case of Alexander Nikitin."
"Who would like to speak in favour of this request?"
"Madam President, it is very important that the European Parliament continues to support Alexander Nikitin, who is accused of endangering state security in Russia."
"This has been a tradition for us; we have supported him in his trial and followed it on a regular basis, and it has come to our attention that now would be just the right time to adopt a position, as the action will be continuing very soon."
"Thank you, Mrs Hautala."
"(Parliament gave its assent)"
"The Group of the Greens requests that ""Violation of Human Rights resulting from the project to build an oil pipeline between Chad and Cameroon"" be added to the item ""Human Rights"" ."
"Madam President, Parliament has already voted for a resolution on this subject, but there is a problem today: the World Bank is due to make a statement shortly on the significance of the project and we feel that given the implications that it has for the people of Chad and Cameroon, a message from the European Parliament would be welcome today."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"I do not have any amendments relating to Friday, or for the Wednesday or Thursday of the mini-part-session in Brussels."
"(The order of business was thus adopted)"
"Emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants by vehicles"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0043/1999), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, concerning the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 88/77/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from diesel engines for use in vehicles, and the emission of gaseous pollutants from positive ignition engines fuelled with natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas for use in vehicles (5734/1/1999 - C5-0028/1999 - 1997/0350(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Lange)."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this legislation represents the final piece of legislation stemming from the Auto-Oil programme."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we collectively, the European Parliament, have made this legislation a success story."
"We, the European Parliament, can take credit for the fact that air quality in Europe will be significantly improved."
"We have succeeded in securing a 60% improvement in air quality in the future, specifically in cities."
"This did not fall like manna from heaven: we achieved it in the Conciliation Committee."
"Madam President, you were the Chairperson of the Conciliation Committee delegation."
"You led the delegation in which we won this from the Council."
"So we should not hesitate over the last component of the legislation, and we should opt for the Conciliation Committee route in this case as well, because the Council has obviously not dared to make that final leap and has been very cautious on a couple of points."
"The Council has certainly incorporated some important points in its common position, such as the two-stage stipulation of binding limit values, stricter durability provisions for emission control devices in lorries and buses, an on-board diagnostics system, and roadside testing."
"But it has been quite cautious with regard to four particular points, which I think we need to put right."
"The first point is that the Council has deferred the reduction in nitrogen oxides from 2005 to 2008, and has also introduced a second phase for the 2005 stage, so that we now have a gradual reduction."
"To my mind, this makes no economic sense at all, because we know that nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions are bound to follow the same curve, so that if we tackle one of these two pollutants, there is an automatic knock-on effect on the other."
"So it also makes no economic sense to have two different limit values within three years."
"Instead, we need to reduce NOx emissions in one fell swoop."
"Some people say that there is only one technology that can achieve this."
