"The signing of the Association Agreement is an important development and marks the start of a new chapter in our relations with Lebanon."
"Although it refers mainly to intergovernmental relations, the agreement also offers an operational framework for the business community and civil society."
"This agreement is vital to the European Union's entire Mediterranean policy and is yet another step towards the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone."
"I should point out that Lebanon has just ratified both the Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement which comes into force on 1 March 2003."
"Good communications channels between politicians on both sides of the Mediterranean are an important factor in building constructive relations between the ?U and its Mediterranean partners."
"At bilateral level, the Association Agreement makes provision for an EU-Lebanon Association Council, to facilitate cooperation and contacts between the European Parliament and parliamentary institutions in Lebanon."
"The Members of Parliament involved will have to set the framework for this dialogue which, as far as the Council is concerned, will supplement Euro-Mediterranean dialogue in general."
"I welcome the results of the last meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari in June 2002, which highlighted the parliamentary dimension of our cooperation with the countries of the Mediterranean."
"We are currently examining cooperation mechanisms in order to create a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"The European Parliament has started working on just such an assembly, which will include members of the 27 national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"The Euro-Mediterranean summit in Valencia proposed strengthening the parliamentary dimension of Euro-Mediterranean dialogue by creating a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly."
"I welcome the recent meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum in Bari on 17-18 June 2002, which supported the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and decided to form a working party to set up this new assembly."
"For their part, the senior officials responsible for the Barcelona process also agreed to set up a group to coordinate with the Bari working party."
"One of the objectives of the Greek Presidency is to use the dynamics of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in order to strengthen its parliamentary dimension."
"One of our presidency's priorities is to achieve new levels of integration and boost the credibility of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, which is why we are currently examining the cooperation mechanisms and measures needed in order to create this assembly."
"What we want, not to say need, is for the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum to decide at its next meeting in Crete on 27 March 2003 to evolve into a parliamentary assembly."
"If it does, the summit of Foreign Ministers meeting in Crete on 26 and 27 May 2003 would be able to welcome their decision and this new institution could be set up."
"Mr President, the House is considering today a very important resolution on the adoption of the Association Agreement signed with Lebanon in June last year."
"This agreement is not only important for our relations with Lebanon - it is also crucial in the overall European Union-Mediterranean Partnership since it represents another step towards the completion of the grid of Association Agreements within the Barcelona Process (the only agreement still being negotiated is the one with Syria and I am hoping to have the opportunity next month of trying to persuade the Syrians to go ahead themselves more seriously to negotiate an agreement)."
"Lebanon is a key partner in the Euro-Mediterranean structure."
"When Prime Minister Hariri was elected to office in September 2000, he set his government an ambitious deadline - to conclude the negotiations with the European Commission by the end of 2001."
"I am very pleased that he has delivered on this promise and I call upon Members of the House to vote favourably on the resolution, and to endorse the Agreement."
"Parliament has before it, in my judgment, the means to provide Lebanon with a firm foundation for building its future."
"The country has experienced a terrible civil war."
"It has been the victim of outside interference, it still remains vulnerable."
"Lebanon is now grappling with recovery and with modernisation under difficult economic circumstances, faced with poor immediate prospects for peace in the Middle East, smouldering tensions along the border with Israel and the unsettling possibility of a military conflict in Iraq."
"There is broad support in Lebanon for this new strengthened relationship with Europe."
"The Lebanese Parliament ratified both the Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement in December."
"The interim agreement allows both sides to start the 12-year transition period from March 2003, leading to the gradual introduction of free trade."
"This is a clear sign that Lebanon is serious in meeting at an early stage its commitments to opening up large areas of its trade and approximating its legislation to that of the European Union."
"It will also be bound by its engagements on respect for the fundamental principles of human rights and democracy from this date and I want to return to that in a moment."
"The free-trade area will bring about profound changes to Lebanese commerce."
"Lebanon is rightly prized for the entrepreneurial skills of its work force."
"Its economic strategy is already liberal."
"World Trade Organisation membership has been requested."
"The opening of markets and economies will bring benefits through economic liberalisation and increased competitiveness."
"Lebanon will benefit immediately from market access for its agricultural and processed agricultural products."
"And the Union will gain from improved access to service sector industries in Lebanon, once these arrangements have been concluded."
"By signalling Lebanon's commitment to economic and social reform, this Agreement will send a clear and positive message to the international and European investment community of the opportunities for direct foreign investment in Lebanon."
"The successful outcome of the Paris II donor conference in November last year, organised with great commitment and success by President Chirac, suggests that this message has already struck home."
"Of the 18 governments participating, six were Member States and the Commission was also represented at its highest level."
"There is a clear interest in seeing that Lebanon weathers the economic storm of post-war recovery, and reduces its debt."
"The amount pledged to assist in debt relief matched expectations (about $ 4.3 billion were pledged in all)."
"But, the Association Agreement is first and foremost a political agreement, which is why it devotes so much importance to political dialogue."
"The Agreement is a potent expression of shared values and common objectives."
"It is through dialogue that members of this partnership can pursue the shared commitment to achieving peace in the Middle East."
"Our dialogue, and this was a point which Mr Galeote Quecedo referred to, will embrace the fundamental principles of human rights and democracy with an honesty and appreciation born, I hope, out of close partnership."
"Lebanon's pluralist society, embracing numerous sectarian and religious groups, has functioned most effectively when there is consensus, tolerance and open debate - a unique feature in the region."
"We are, however, conscious of the concerns expressed by the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee on specific points of the human rights situation in Lebanon."
"The agreement provides an additional forum for tackling these concerns."
"By ratifying the Association Agreement, the European Union will trigger the important commitments from Lebanon concerning human rights and democracy, migration and re-admission, money laundering, the fight against organised crime and illicit drugs, and judicial cooperation."
"And I know too the concerns which have been expressed about freedom of the media. I can reassure you that the Commission will continue to monitor and follow these concerns wherever and whenever possible."
"The Agreement will also, as the Minister pointed out, trigger Lebanon's undertakings on cooperation in counter-terrorism, set out in the exchange of letters to which he referred."
"Our partnership will extend well beyond trade and politics, and will be wide-ranging, covering areas as diverse as cooperation in the fields of science, education, energy, tourism, the environment and industry."
"Social and cultural cooperation is also central to the Agreement, in terms of rights of workers, and social dialogue."
"Our partnership will be sustained by contributions under the MEDA programme which I hope will be focused, as far as possible, on implementation of the Agreement."
"So we are moving towards our overall ambitions in the southern Mediterranean with the agreement that we have put before Parliament with the Lebanon and I very much hope that we can move on from this to completing the grid of association agreements by successful negotiations with Syria."
"I commend this agreement most warmly to Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, Mr Patten, the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement marks a step forward in our long-standing relations."
"It has already been pointed out several times that Lebanon is a country which has seen 16 years of civil war and which has now managed once again to turn its ethnic, cultural and religious pluralism into the basis for a peace process: it is a country both complex and important, owing to its history and geopolitical position."
"We hope that the closer relations which this Agreement formally marks, will help make this process irreversible and represent further progress in the respect for human rights and the strengthening of democracy and the rule of law."
"It is precisely for this reason that the article in the Agreement which refers to human rights must be taken seriously by the Lebanese authorities and the European institutions."
"Parliament is persevering on this point since the economy and trade must be able to advance at the same pace as advances in freedom, democracy, the role of women and freedom of information."
"We are pleased to note that Lebanon has signed the International Convention on Women's Rights and the Convention against Torture."
"We hope that ratification will follow these signatures and that by continuing along this path, we will see the abolition of the death penalty, Lebanon's participation in the International Criminal Court, the truth about missing persons and a revised legal system which specifies the limits and role of military jurisdiction."
"This process should be supported by the MEDA programme, with clear support for the autonomous development of civil society."
"Another crucial issue is an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and pacification of the region, where a lasting solution can only be found by creating a Palestinian state."
"The Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon was an extremely important event, but peace was not a consequence."
"But it is precisely because peace is never automatic but requires great political will that it is important to state the desire to achieve it, starting with the countries in the region."
"To this end, the tension on the Lebanon-Israel border must cease, Syria should withdraw its military presence from Lebanon and the Palestinian refugees should be given prospects for the future, starting with the provision of better living conditions;"
"I would point out that responsibility for this does not only fall to the host country, but to the whole international community."
"In pursuing this aim, it is therefore essential for the refugees to be able to benefit from the MEDA programme and for Europe, taking all of this into account, to be especially generous."
"Lastly, we hope that the Agreement will support economic reforms and trade, which were already important issues."
"Today's opportunity is, however, also a chance for us to make a more general appraisal of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership - as the President-in-Office of the Council did - following completion of the enlargement process, in the context of the reform process which started with the Convention."
"We must now redefine the enlarged Union's external relations and we must give Europe a more significant role in the world."
"The Partnership, launched in Barcelona in 1995, was created with 12 countries."
"We now have a broader, more systematic view of this process which encompasses the Mediterranean, the Balkans and the Gulf states."
"Secondly we must ask: which policies?"
"President Prodi has often stated: 'Everything but institutions'."
"The European Parliament, for its part, came out in favour some time ago of a Euro-Mediterranean Partnership which includes all the policies which we subscribed to with the candidate countries."
"I would therefore urge us to go further than the - albeit important - decisions of the last Interministerial Conference in Valencia."
"Lastly the institutions: in Valencia - as you, Mr President, pointed out - it was decided to grant the Parliamentary Forum the status of a real parliamentary assembly."
"This change could be truly significant, and to be a success it must take into account the remarks already made on the geopolitical dimension and policies."
"By becoming a true institution, the parliamentary assembly should acquire real powers concerning the decisions which this process involves and should be an active participant in the great meeting of cultures."
"The most important thing is for it to have instruments in order to make real progress in the field of rights, democracy and freedom."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by welcoming the Greek Presidency, which is embarking on its duties here and also the election of a European Ombudsman, who is also Greek. This is all happening at a time when plenary is being led by a colleague of same nationality, which is making this sitting a veritable Greek political Olympiad, which I am delighted to share in."
"Mr President, the European Parliament today has the task of delivering its opinion on the conclusion of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States on the one hand and the Republic of Lebanon on the other."
"This agreement clearly forms part of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership launched by the Barcelona Declaration of 1995, whose progress we have a duty to promote, despite the uncertainties in the political situation in that region with regard to peace and security."
"One of the most noteworthy aspects of the process opened in Barcelona is that it enables complementarity to be established between the dimension of bilateral cooperation involving the Member States with Mediterranean connections, including Spain, France, Italy and Portugal - although Portugal borders the Atlantic, it has significant economic and geographical links with the Mediterranean countries of the Maghreb - and the multilateral dimension taken on by the European Community, which can and must mutually strengthen one another."
"There is no doubt, Mr President, that, to a large extent, the stability of the Mediterranean region, and in particular of the Middle East, depends on appropriate partnerships for economic, political, social and cultural development, for which the Union is particularly suited."
"Other types of problem remain, however, which are today entirely undeniable, especially concerning security and the fight against terrorism, but also concerning the fight against corruption and money-laundering as well as promoting democracy and human rights which, in the particular case of Lebanon, are a cause for concern."
"This is why we believe the questions raised by Mr Brok, the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to be of the greatest relevance and to require tangible and consistent answers from both the Council and the Commission."
"We cannot ignore the fact that the political leanings of the Lebanese authorities are still dominated by Syria and that Damascus has a decisive influence over the position of the Lebanese Government in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, despite the Israeli army's withdrawal from Southern Lebanon in May 2000."
"Unlike Lebanon, whose government has fortunately been moving towards democracy and the separation of powers, despite its obvious institutional weaknesses and intricate political and religious imbalances, Syria is a dictatorship, with a singularly Monarchist bias, which has remained technically at war with Israel since the Six-Day War, with all the dangers that this situation entails for the Middle East peace process. Even worse, it maintains a significant military force in Lebanon, of around 30 000 men, in addition to the 300 000 immigrants there, who work mainly in farming and construction."
"If we add to this presence - or perhaps we should call it an 'occupation' several more Palestinian refugees, who are by and large poor and poorly integrated into Lebanese society, constituting around 3.5 million people, and the presence in the country's parliament of Hezbullah, the extremist movement - since it cannot be called anything else - it is easy to understand Lebanon's delicate situation, to which the Union must be attentive and in which it must play a moderating role in order to achieve peace, security and development."
"This Euro-Mediterranean partnership is all the more important at a time when the Union is enlarging into Central and Eastern Europe and will be focusing the lion's share of its financial resources there."
"We must not forget that Europe is or should be polycentric: it is Nordic, Mediterranean, and Atlantic; it is also ultraperipheral and certainly continental."
"It is, however, by balancing its components and respect for its diversity that it will become a Europe that is more democratic, safer, more developed and definitely more respected on the international scene."
"With the conclusion of an Association Agreement with the Republic of Lebanon, the EU is putting its own political credibility on the line, both internally and externally."
"As recently as at the last European Council, the Council of Copenhagen, the Council again acknowledged Israel's legitimate concerns about her security."
"The Council also committed itself to the fight against international terrorism."
"The two central points of the foreign policy of EU Member States are not compatible with the power base that Hezbollah is forming in Lebanese politics."
"It is not for nothing that Southern Lebanon is known as 'Hezbollahland' these days."
"The party of Allah has been lord and master ever since Israel's military withdrawal from the border area in May 2000."
"This Shiite terror organisation has built up an impressive military presence thanks to the combined cooperation of Syria and Iran."
"Including a large arsenal of missiles within range of the whole of the north of the Jewish state."
"All within easy reach of Lebanese Islamicists who unremittingly and openly advocate the physical destruction of Israel."
"The attention being paid to the depressing situation on Israel's northern border in the present resolution of this Parliament deals with the cause and effects and ignores the political reality in situ."
"This European unease will not upset Hezbollah."
"The party of Allah is simply not mentioned."
"How does the Council view that?"
"I would like to ask the Greek Presidency what steps it intends to take against Hezbollah in Beirut, Damascus and Teheran."
"Diplomatic inactivity gives the EU absolutely no credibility as a peace broker in the Middle East."
"Hezbollah is just as unlikely to be intimidated when it comes to direct and indirect involvement in terrorist activities against the state of Israel, including forming terrorist cells amongst Israeli Arabs and complete identification with the second Palestinian intifada."
"Or, as the secretary-general of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, puts it: the intifada in Palestine now forms their front line."
"In short, if the common fight against terrorism is to have real credibility, the EU must immediately place Hezbollah on its list of terrorist organisations - hence my amendment - and the Lebanese authorities must assert their authority over the whole country."
"Only these measures will have the effect of stabilising the whole region and promoting peace in it, as they simultaneously send a signal to the destabilising regimes."
"A powerful stance such as this would also set the right tone for the negotiations on the EU's future relationship with Damascus and Teheran."
"Otherwise the European institutions would only be paying lip service to the bare fact of Israel's existence and the global fight against terrorism."
"Until such time as the EU shows that it is taking these points very seriously in its relations with these countries, I will vote against an Association Agreement with Lebanon."
"What makes me even more resolute in my stance is that the European institutions are demanding virtually no genuine guarantees from Beirut regarding the observance of human rights."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the EU-Lebanon Association Agreement goes beyond relations with the Lebanese Government and takes on an extraordinary importance within the network of relations based on dialogue and cooperation in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, especially at times like these when the threat of war looms so large and risks undermining the development of cooperation between our peoples and harming the still vulnerable Lebanese Government."
"There have been many years of war with Syria but also with Israel, with external interference and invasions, which have not yet been definitively settled; also a civil war which has devastated social and family relationships, though the International Community's neglect has done damage too."
"Lebanon's rebirth could lie in that strength which previously was its weakness: the intertwining of cultures and religions, rooted in the country but different from each other."
"The Lebanese Government should be acknowledged for having managed to maintain a balance between the parties and for wishing to rebuild a sovereign country in a difficult democratic process, because there are still clear violations of freedom of expression, human rights, social inequality and corruption."
"In particular, I am referring to the situation of the Palestinian refugees, who have been prohibited by law from having any opportunity to work, for healthcare or for travel and it is hypocritical of the Lebanese to assert that this is because the refugees have to return to Palestine."
"In this connection, when developing relations and projects with Lebanon, we have to persevere and find means to ensure compliance with the agreements and commitments which are made, even if the example of the EU-Israel Agreement and Israel's blatant violation of Article 2, certainly do not provide a guarantee that this will be respected."
"I nevertheless consider it extremely important for this step to be taken, in the clear and certain knowledge that it is essential to help rebuild this country; but it is essential that this country is rebuilt on the clear basis of freedom of expression and human rights."
"Thank you for your comment, Mr Brok."
"It is my duty to tell you that plenary's services are already preparing a new list of amendments with this correction and this will be announced tomorrow before the vote on the recommendation and motion in question."
"I have received a motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure on the subject of the debate1"
"In accordance with the agenda - and I would also go as far as to say in homage to the Greek Presidency - we will proceed to the Commission Statement on the Northern Dimension."
"I understand, Mr Patten, that we all have problems with the timetable and I would therefore be grateful if the honourable Members could be as brief as possible, since there are problems with flight connections which affect the Commissioner himself."
"Mr President, I will try to live up to that request."
"We turn now from one end of Europe, as it were, to another."
"The Northern Dimension continues to occupy an extremely important place on the Commission's external relations agenda."
"The Commission has been working hard to implement the Northern Dimension Action Plan that was endorsed by the European Council at Feira in June 2000, and to prepare for a new action plan."
"We are determined to continue to take a leading role in carrying forward this important initiative."
"Last year saw significant progress in all nine sectors encompassed by the Action Plan."
"The Commission's 2002 Annual Progress Report on the implementation of the Northern Dimension action plan presents a complete overview of these results."
"I would like to pick out a few concrete examples."
"The Commission has actively contributed to launching the Northern Dimension environmental partnership, with its support fund for environmental and nuclear projects in Northwest Russia."
"The Commission is by far the largest contributor to the fund, with EUR 50 million over three years, mainly for nuclear-related projects."
"The Northern Dimension environmental partnership is a clear example of how cooperation in the Northern Dimension region can achieve tangible results in very sensitive areas, calling for urgent action."
"In this context much attention is also being devoted to resolving the remaining details of the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme for the Russian Federation, the so-called MNEPR."
"I hope that we are now very close to a solution and that this key agreement can be signed very soon."
"Much attention has also been devoted to the Northern Dimension, energy issues, transport, infrastructure, business and trade cooperation and to cooperation in the fight against organised crime."
"We have continued to support cross-border cooperation through the Tacis programme, with a total assistance to Northwest Russia between 1996 and 2003 of about EUR 122 million, about half of this being for border crossings."
"The Commission has also attached great importance to enhancing the coordination and interoperability between its principal programmes operating in the region (mainly Tacis, Phare and Interreg) in order to facilitate the implementation of joint projects in the Northern Dimension area."
"This has already helped bring about a considerable increase in the number of joint projects being presented for Tacis/Interreg or Tacis/Phare funding in 2001-2002."
"The past year has also seen continued dialogue with the most important actors involved in the Northern Dimension."
"The final agreement with Russia and Lithuania on the issue of transit to and from the Kaliningrad region is a good example of a concrete success in the EU-Russia relationship that should bring benefits for the wider Northern Dimension region."
"We have already provided more than EUR 40 million to the development of Kaliningrad and an additional EUR 25 million is planned for the coming years."
"We are determined to assist the Russian authorities in improving living standards and addressing the challenges it poses to the wider region."
"The Commission has also been closely following the work of the intergovernmental organisations of the Northern Dimension region, including the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS), the Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC) and the Arctic Council itself."
"Building on the positive results already achieved, the Northern Dimension will be further strengthened in the near future."
"In the coming years, the Northern Dimension will have to address the impact of European Union enlargement, and focus on enhancing links with the Russian Federation as a neighbour."
"Two ministerial meetings were organised by Denmark in the last six months, both focussing on the next Action Plan."
"On the basis of Guidelines adopted by the Council in October last year, the Commission is preparing the next Northern Dimension Action Plan for the period 2004-2006."
"We are carrying out an extensive consultation process involving Member States, Partner Countries, and regional bodies, as well as the business world, academia and civil society."
"Our objective is to have a consolidated draft of the Action Plan (which will replace the current one on 1 January next year) tabled by the middle of this year at the latest."
"There is still a lot of work to be done."
"The Commission is willingly taking the lead in preparing this new Action Plan."
"But I want to make it clear that success will require an active contribution of all partners concerned with the region and I am sure that the European Parliament will want to play its part in this process."
"I am certainly looking forward to hearing the contributions which Members have to make in ensuring that the Northern Dimension, which has begun so well, can go on from strength to strength, particularly after the enlargement of the Union."
"The enlargement of the European Union places the countries of the Northern Dimension in a very special and much changed position."
"Everyone is expecting a great deal from this - including strong economic development in particular."
"The greater mutual openness shows that there are extremely attractive prospects for cooperation in the economic, ecological and social fields."
"If we are to benefit from this we will have to change our attitude towards Russia."
"It has already changed, fortunately, but it was not just a matter of course."
"Despite some worrying signals from Russia regarding parliamentary democracy, the acceptance of non-indigenous religions and in particular the continuing war in Chechnya, we must still have a positive attitude towards Russia."
"The politics of the Northern Dimension is therefore part of our two-track policy."
"A policy that does not withhold criticism, however severe it may be, but one that also sounds out and exploits constructive ideas."
"It is very important to implement the various forms of policy in the action plan."
"The European Union's attitude will then be very balanced and multi-faceted, which will also be good for the development of neighbouring regions."
"The way in which this is done is also naturally of great importance, and this is also mostly of a political and cultural nature. Market participants as well as social organisations, for example, will have to play a major role."
"Political integration must always go hand in hand with social integration; this may entail a large number of independent organisations."
"The action plan may therefore also be relevant to the social democratisation of the territories in question - with Russia first."
"The Danish Presidency made great efforts with regard to the Northern Dimension issue."
"Coming from a southern northern country, I appreciate this very much."
"We are assuming that Greece will also feel a sense of responsibility towards the Northern Dimension."
"The focus must be on the exploitation of energy sources, the transportation of energy, possibly including to the European Union, and nuclear waste."
"The delegation to the Russian Duma recently went to the north, where we found out about the serious problems caused by nuclear waste."
"The European Union is one of the major donors, possibly the biggest in fact, but cleaning up is taking place pretty slowly there."
"They are not able to dismantle more than a small number of nuclear submarines each year."
"It is very important for all of us that this is speeded up."
"The territory there in the north is extremely vulnerable, and we will have to accept our responsibility, particularly with regard to Norway and other countries with interests there."
"It is a very good thing - for the people who live there as well - that solutions are also being found for waste water, particularly in St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad."
"In order to make it clear that we are concerned about people, we must also make sure that social questions linked to public health and the like are not forgotten."
"We have seen that there are already numerous councils and forums dealing with the Northern Dimension."
"I must therefore express the hope that their activities will be appropriately coordinated so that they do not overlap too much and hamper one another."
"A budget line for the Northern Dimension has also already been discussed."
"I understand that there are technical problems involved in setting up a budget line of this kind and I would like to know what the Commissioner thinks about this."
"I welcome a new action plan for the Northern Dimension which will embrace three new Baltic states and Poland as EU members in 2004, Russia, with which I support a privileged status in a common economic space one day, and the EEA states of Iceland and Norway."
"I am concerned about the environmental hazards in the far north and I strongly urge the Russians to sign the MNEPR Agreement, as they have agreed to do, on joint action for decommissioning of their spent nuclear fuel rods and warheads rotting in their naval submarines which might contaminate the Murmansk area."
"Negotiations on the accession of ten countries to the EEA were launched in Brussels just last week."
"Enlargement of the EU entails simultaneous enlargement of the EEA in order to safeguard the homogeneity of the internal market."
"There is no justification for the idea that the contributions of the EEA countries should be comparable to those of EU Member States and the Commission's demand for a 22-fold increase for Norway is absurd."
"Third countries do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as Member States; in some cases there is reduced market access due to tariff imposition."
"An example is Norway's loss of free trade in fish with Poland."
"The EEA Agreement is a good agreement but it has its limitations."
"Recent opinion polls in Norway indicate that public perceptions of the Union are changing; that support for membership is growing and will inevitably dominate the political agenda at the next elections."
"I would like also to raise the issue of Belarus, which has borders with four of the Member States that are party to the action plan and, given its union with Russia, might one day become part of the group."
"It is important for the EU to maintain its dual-track approach and pressure for democratic reforms there."
"But notwithstanding our political differences with that country, we are still committed in areas of mutual interest such as the management of illegal immigration and cross-border crime."
"To close this debate, I have received four motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure"
"I was rapporteur for one of the reports on the Erika I package."
"The Erika accident took place on 19 December 1999."
"I believe that the Commission did its work perfectly, because in March 2000 it presented us with this first package of measures."
"Parliament worked on it and, with more delay than we would have liked, we finally achieved a proposal in December 2000 - a year after the Erika accident - on which we had reached consensus with the then representative of the Council, the French Transport Minister."
"The day after that Council, in Parliament, as a result of the actions of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the whole agreement we had reached became deadlocked, and the first Erika package was not approved until a year later (December 2001)."
"And the worst thing of all is that it was not just the Group of the European People's Party that held up this Erika I package, but also the Council, which delayed its common position with regard to double hulls until August 2001."
"While we are facing another disaster, which took place in November 2002 - three years after the Erika accident - the Council and the Member States have still not brought the measures in the Erika I and Erika II packages into force."
"Hence my question: why are the appropriate decisions not taken so that we do not have to suffer another such disaster, and so that the adoption of measures is speeded up with the efficiency that this case demands?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have not answered my questions on the maritime areas located between the Canaries, Madeira, the Azores and the European Union."
"70 000 ships pass through these areas, many of them large oil tankers, real monsters, of 100 000, 200 000 or more tonnes, and at any time an accident involving one of these oil tankers could lead to the economic ruin of many of these islands which are dedicated exclusively to tourism."
"You will understand better if we imagine this in the context of your own country."
"Imagine the results of an accident in the Aegean, or an accident in the Eastern Mediterranean, even outside the territorial waters of Greece."
"What would be the consequences for your islands?"
"Do you not believe, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that the European Union must adopt rules to regulate the maritime areas which endanger its coasts?"
"The United States and Canada have done so, outside their own territorial waters, and I believe that the European Union would have the power to do so."
"I would like to make a brief comment to the President-in-Office of the Council, whom I wish all the luck in the world."
"We need the Council to act more quickly."
"As a result of 1 January and the Prestige disaster, the Spanish State has applied certain more restrictive rules for single-hull ships."
"This has led to queues of single-hull ships entering Gibraltar in order to evade inspections."
"The United Kingdom must not remain on the sidelines, and there must be no free ports, which to some extent are pirate ports, which receive ships in a manner which is contrary to the actions of the European Union."
"For this reason, I would ask you to act more quickly and I would ask that nobody in the European Union should remain on the sidelines when these rules are so very necessary."
"This is not a question, but an opinion which we take note of, but if the President-in-Office of the Council wishes to reply ..."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office of the Council has just called this problem a 'natural disaster'."
"I should like to ask him why he attributes natural causes to a disaster that has clearly occurred as the result of political and therefore preventable reasons?"
"A natural disaster is clearly something quite different."
"This is like calling a crash involving several cars or lorries on a motorway a natural disaster!"
"It is other types of causes that need to be cleared up."
"I feel that the Greek Presidency is getting off to a bad start on this matter if it thinks that this is really a natural disaster."
"I would ask: why are you calling this a natural disaster, which I believe is a complete misnomer?"
"Mr President, I respected your authority at all times, since I did not know whether or not I could ask a supplementary question."
"I wish the President-in-Office of the Council luck and success during this six-month Presidency, and I would like to raise the issue of the Prestige from a European point of view."
"Do you believe that a disaster of this nature, which now affects more than one Member State, whose outcome nobody knows, since we still have a sunken wreck containing 55 000 tonnes of oil, with consequences which are truly tragic for areas of very great ecological value for the whole of the EU, for the heritage of the whole of Europe, and with repercussions for all aspects of maritime law etc., should be dealt with from a European point of view, through the creation of a temporary committee or a committee of inquiry in this Parliament to examine all points of view and to coordinate all types of effort, so that events of this type can never happen again?"
"Question No 3 by Camilo Nogueira Román (H-0847/02):"
"Subject: Erika legislative packages and the 1990 US Oil Pollution Act"
"In the wake of the accident involving the oil tanker the Erika and the series of accidents off the coast of Galicia such as those involving the Polycomander, the Aegean Sea, the Urquiola, and the Cason, why has the Council failed to provide in the two Erika legislative packages for the strict financial guarantees and safety measures required of shipowners and vessels under the 1990 Oil Pollution Act, which the United States was prompted to adopt following the Exxon Valdez accident?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, society as a whole is currently convinced that international maritime traffic is the domain of a predatory form of capitalism that does not have the interests of society at heart and which is even criminal."
"Standards must be established to prevent this terrible situation continuing."
"There are various approaches to solving this problem: one is that adopted by the United States in the wake of the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989, by creating the Oil Pollution Act, in 1990."
"I would recall that the guarantee required of shipowners stands at USD one billion, that the liability required is unlimited and that, currently, Exxon Mobil is being asked to pay USD four billion in compensation."
"Double hulls, coastguards, etc, etc, form part of this approach."
"Another approach is that of the Erika, a piece of legislation that, although a step forwards, is not being properly applied by the Council and the Member States, which prefer to move in the sphere of international mafias."
"On the other hand, there are countries, such as Galicia, which are suffering the consequences and whose populations, including fishermen and volunteers are having to fight the oil slick with their bare hands."
"I believe that the only solution is for the EU to create its own legislation (we could even call it the 'Prestige' law, imitating, in this case, the United States."
"Next, we should surely amend all international legislation."
"I wish to ask whether you will be adopting initiatives to achieve this?"
"Question No 4 by John Walls Cushnahan (H-0871/02):"
"Subject: Recent maritime disasters"
"In light of the series of maritime disasters that have occurred in European waters in November and December 2002, namely the Prestige disaster which continues to produce yet more oil slicks which are devastating the coastline and marine life of Galicia, compounded with the recent collision between the freighter the Tricolor and the Kariba, and the second collision between the wreck of the Tricolor and the freighter the Nicola, will the Council recognise that there is a clear need for a coordinated EU response?"
"Furthermore, given the severe consequences of such maritime accidents, what is the Council's view of the submission that I made to the Convention on the Future of Europe in June 2002 (reference Conv 150/02), calling for the creation of an EU Coastguard?"
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that you recognise the need for a coordinated EU response, but I put it to you that not only does it need to be coordinated, it needs to be comprehensive and backed up by sufficient resources."
"Would you accept that the problem that we face in the seas of Europe is not only about maritime safety and environmental pollution?"
"It is the way in which our seas are used, for example for illegal immigration, organised crime, human trafficking, and indeed the abuse of our fisheries law."
"Would you not accept that we need an adequate response mechanism and that the only way to address the problem would be to establish an EU coastguard?"
"Do you not think we could learn from the United States' comprehensive approach to these problems?"
"There has been much talk in the Council and elsewhere about the problems of dealing with terrorism, yet we forget that such a danger could exist on our seas just as easily as in the air."
"If for example a terrorist attack using chemical, biological or nuclear weapons were to be launched at sea, a coastguard could be the first line of response."
"I disagree with you that it is not within the Council's remit."
"It has always been in the Council's remit to consider ways of addressing the public's fears."
"Citizens are sometimes disillusioned with the EU."
"Would you not accept that dealing with problems that threaten their safety and wellbeing in a coordinated and comprehensive way will help convince them of the values of Europe?"
"I would remind the honourable Members in general that during this Question Time, specific questions must be put for one minute."
"It is not a general debate with more time for explaining positions, because if you speak beyond your allotted time, you will prevent other Members who are waiting from putting their questions."
"I have a list of several who wish to ask supplementary questions."
"In accordance with the order in which they have requested the floor, Mr Ortuondo and Mr Dhaene are before everybody else."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we have spoken here of the fact that the Council has decided to speed up the entry into force of ports of refuge - I believe that this is a correct and necessary measure - and that it has not taken a decision in relation to the European coastguard service."
"I would like this service to be set up as soon as possible, as well as a compensation fund for pollution accidents similar to the one they have in the United States."
"I would like to ask him specifically whether he believes that, for this type of disaster, we also need an emergency pilot plan at European level."
"Do you not believe that we should have a European rapid reaction force for this type of incident, including volunteers?"
"Do you not also believe that we should identify particularly sensitive corridors, so that we can have an emergency plan in each case?"
"Mr President, I am somewhat surprised that the Council has replied that it is not authorised to set up a coastguard."
"It will nevertheless have to make a decision about this."
"Yesterday, Mrs de Palacio said that she would take the initiative on this point and I am still expecting an answer from the President-in-Office of the Council on this subject."
"Will he defend this in the Council?"
"Does he support it or not?"
"I would like a clear answer on this point."
"Mr President, thank you very much for your kind words."
"I have one simple question: does the President-in-Office of the Council intend to visit Galicia?"
"Yes, I am restricted by the Rules of Procedure."
"I am obliged to comply with it, at least as much as you are."
"Question No 5 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0837/02):"
"Subject: Settlement in Cyprus and accession to the European Union"
"An EU working document drafted with a view to the decisions to be taken in Copenhagen has been published in an Athens newspaper (TA NEA 3 December 2002), causing great concern."
"This document, which the newspaper claims is to be discussed in principle at COREPER level and by the Council of Foreign Ministers, refers to the accession of Cyprus and makes provision for two possible scenarios."
"The first envisages accession of the island as a whole, provided a settlement in principle of the Cyprus problem, based on the Annan plan, is signed prior to Copenhagen."
"The second envisages, in the event of Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash not having signed a settlement in principle prior to Copenhagen, the dissociation of the accession of Cyprus from that of the other countries and reconsideration in April 2003."
"The first observation to be made about these scenarios is that they directly link a settlement of the Cyprus problem to accession and, in any event, do not even address the commitment given at Helsinki that a settlement is not a condition of accession."
"What steps will the Council take to implement the Helsinki decisions, which dissociated the accession of the Republic of Cyprus from a political solution to the problem, particularly when it is evident that the stalling tactics pursued by the Turkish Cypriot side have exhausted every time margin for negotiations of substance to achieve a just and viable settlement in Cyprus?"
"Question No 6 by Sarah Ludford (H-0842/02):"
"Subject: Procedural safeguards for defendants in criminal proceedings"
"In the light of the recent events in Greece where the 'plane spotters' (12 British and 2 Dutch) were recently acquitted on appeal of spying charges, of which they had been wrongly convicted by a lower court, does the Council agree that this experience highlights the need for an EU-wide system of safeguards for defendants in criminal trials and more training for judges?"
"Furthermore does the Council agree that, although the ECHR does indeed provide safeguards under Article 6 by providing for the right to a fair trial, the time it takes to remedy breaches by Member States is too long?"
"Moreover will the Council commit to dealing expeditiously and favourably with the proposal for a Framework Decision on fixing common standards regarding procedural safeguards for persons accused in criminal proceedings throughout the EU as announced by the Commission in its legislative and work programme for 2003?"
"Question No 7 by Bernd Posselt (H-0865/02):"
"Subject: Police academy and EU border protection"
"When will the Council finally take a decision on the seat of the European Police Academy, and what stage has been reached in preparations for the creation of a common border police force at the EU's external borders?"
"Question No 8 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0875/02):"
"Subject: Initiatives in favour of SMEs"
"At the Barcelona European Council Member States were asked to speed up the implementation of the European Charter for SMEs and the Commission was asked to draw up a Green Paper on the entrepreneurial spirit and SMEs."
"As part of the Greek Presidency, does the Council intend to adopt specific strategies and measures to give a new impetus to SMEs?"
"Does it intend to urge the Commission to present this Green Paper before the end of the Greek Presidency together with a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the participation of SMEs in existing Community support programmes for SMEs and of the results of such participation?"
"Question No 10 by Konstantinos Alyssandrakis (H-0880/02):"
"Subject: Attempts to overthrow the legally elected President of Venezuela"
"Following the failed coup d'etat in Venezuela, attempts by the economic and political establishment of the country, together with its international allies (USA etc.) to overthrow President Chavez are intensifying."
"The media, which are controlled by the opposition, have mounted a campaign of disinformation, the banks are threatening to cut back their services even to the point of suspending withdrawals from accounts, and the country is threatened with huge fines if it does not deliver its contracted quantities of oil."
"What initiatives will the Council take to thwart the attempt by the external forces supporting the Venezuelan economic oligarchy to overthrow the legally elected President Chavez with the aim of controlling the 5th most important oil-producing country, and to ensure that the verdict of the Venezuelan people is respected at international level?"
"Question No 11 by Efstratios Korakas (H-0881/02):"
"Subject: Intensification of preparations for war against Iraq"
"The USA and the UK are stepping up preparations for an attack against Iraq, transporting soldiers and munitions to the region and preparing the way for civil war by arming all those inside and outside Iraq who might take their side."
"It has been reported that at least six European countries will be used to train Iraqi opposition forces, and the Hungarian Government has confirmed the existence of an official American request to use the Taszar base for training 4 500 Iraqis 'as translators and administrators'."
"These actions are completely at odds with the UN resolutions and cast doubt on the work of the inspectors."
"What initiatives does the Council intend to take to prevent acts by the USA and the UK which jeopardise world peace and to avert a decision by the UN Security Council legitimising the war, thereby meeting the demand by the international and European peace movement voiced at mass anti-war demonstrations?"
"Question No 12 by Ioannis Patakis, which has been taken over by Mr Alyssandrakis (H-0882/02):"
"Subject: Withdrawal of USA from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and threats to world peace"
"Following its unilateral decision to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, the USA has announced its decision to continue developing a national missile defence system until 2004, beginning with the stationing of missiles in Alaska."
"What measures does the Council intend to take to put an end to this development which threatens world peace, especially since Member States of the EU, such as the UK and Denmark, have been asked to contribute to this programme, and the USA has already asked to use military bases and radar installations in these countries?"
"Firstly I would like to wish the Greek minister much success with the Presidency over the next six months."
"It is a big job, and I really wish you much success."
"I would also like to thank you for your very detailed answer, Mr Yiannitsis."
"You made a very long statement."
"I cannot, however, help but feel that you did not write it yourself."
"It is, of course, a statement that has been drawn up following consultation between the 15, between diplomats."
"And, if you will excuse me saying so, it is a statement that has nothing to do with the reality in situ."
"All the reports that reach us - Mr Wuori has pointed this out - refer to a very serious human rights situation."
"We all know that the problem in Chechnya can only be resolved with political consultation, with discussions between people and between representatives."
"I would like to ask the Greek Presidency very specifically whether it believes that it is possible for the Council to take steps in a creative manner to bring about a political solution to the Chechen problem by means of negotiations between all the parties concerned."
"Mr Yiannitsis, I am very grateful for your cooperation with us throughout this afternoon and we will see you for Question Time next month in Strasbourg."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was closed at 7 p.m.)"
"."
"(EL) This report by Mr Pirker, which the Communist Party of Greece voted against, has started the ball rolling for the European Parliament to implement racist and xenophobic resolutions to keep immigrants out of the ?U."
"The Seville Council decided to create yet another repressive supranational mechanism, the European Corps of Border Guards."
"However, the immediate creation of such a corps clashes with the Member States' constitutions, which is why the Commission has decided on a hybrid solution which it refers to as 'common services to control external borders'."
"It has also been decided to incorporate the Common Manual for External Borders - yet another purely police manual - into Community legislation, once it has been revised and made even more anti-democratic."
"Finally, there are even plans to use satellites and radar to monitor the EU's borders, by making use of the Galileo satellite navigation system, while yet another service has been added to the repertoire of monitoring and policing services, the SCIFA+, which will operate as a steering body responsible for coordination."
"What is worrying is that the report adopted by the European Parliament is even more autocratic than the Commission communication."
"The report equates illegal immigration, which it quotes as an example of a current threat, with organised crime, accepts the propaganda about 'new risk scenarios', criticises the delay in setting up the Border Guard etc."
"In the Presidency's conclusions from the Seville European Council in June 2002, the Council called upon the Commission to carry out a study into the apportionment of responsibilities between the Member States and the EU in the management of the external borders."
"This was to take place before June 2003, which is why the results of this study have still not been implemented."
"In the resolution, the European Parliament chooses, in spite of this, to anticipate the study and to ask the Convention to look into the possibilities of finding a legal basis for a European Corps of Border Guards, and the Council to set up such a force."
"We can see that there is a need for closer cooperation in this area but believe that, legally, democratically, financially and in terms of constitutional law, a proposal as far-reaching as this requires a proper study to be carried out as a basis for its being possible to deal with the matter at all."
"A Corps of Border Guards, however temporary the mandate it is given, is, in spite of everything, a new institution and entails a new legal competence for the EU."
"The Commission's communication on the future of health care and care for the elderly, focusing on accessibility, quality and financial viability, provides a useful framework for policy exchange regarding the challenges that all Member States are facing in this area."
"Several years ago we initiated the successful European Year for older people which acknowledged the contribution of older people in our society."
"The Employment Committee's report has considerably expanded this framework."
"I am pleased that the communication is being debated so that the Member States and the public can learn more about the challenges involved."
"The organisation of health care systems, their funding and planning are, of course, matters for the Member States."
"The family, the role of community groups and volunteers who can provide support services and the introduction of a respite care grant for dependent older persons must form part of this health strategy."
"I did not support amendments which failed to recognise the positive developments in relation to care for older people."
"I support the Commission's assessment that the EU has an overall health situation and health care system that are among the best in the world."
"I supported the amendments aimed at promoting cooperation rather than the open method of cooperation."
". (PT) I congratulate Mr Mantovani on the report he has presented to us, which addresses an issue that should be of concern to us all, namely our citizens' future with regard to healthcare and care for the elderly."
"Because this is a communication that achieved the broad consensus of the various parties involved, I should like to reiterate my support for the Commission's conclusions and for the aims proposed for developing practical policies to achieve active ageing and the involvement of all interested parties in defining policies in the field of social protection, inclusion and employment."
"Bearing in mind the need to respond to the problem of ageing in a way that ensures not only economic growth but also financial sustainability, and in line with the strategy adopted by the Gothenburg Council of June 2001, the Member States' targets must be to achieve increased rates of employment, to reduce public debt in order to compensate for increased spending on pensions and healthcare and to reform pension schemes."
"The Council has welcomed the Annan plan as a proposal which may well resolve the Cyprus problem."
"It is waiting for the two sides to agree and, together with the European Commission, is looking to see what aspects of the acquis communautaire might clash with the plan."
"Transitional periods, which are a standard occurrence, even during negotiations with candidate countries, and which are being accepted or may be accepted in this case, and marginal deviations of no particular significance to the acquis, which the European Commission has said it can cope with in order to facilitate a solution to the Cyprus problem, provided of course that both the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot sides agree, could be incorporated into the final solution without causing any particular problems to the dynamics and results of the final solution."
"EBRD activities"
"The next item is the report (A5-0421/2002) by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the activities of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) (2002/2095(INI))."
"Mr President, Mr Lemierre, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by welcoming Mr Lemierre and his colleagues to the European Parliament, and take this opportunity to express my warm thanks to you and the Bank's staff for the extraordinarily positive cooperation which we were able to establish during the preparation of this report."
"The EBRD responded to me with great openness and willingness to cooperate, thus making my work on this report both interesting and informative."
"I was able to hold numerous discussions with representatives of the Bank as well as with project agencies from various countries, which gave me a detailed picture of the Bank's operations, its problems and successes, but also, and to a minor extent, its failures."
"The EBRD is unique among development banks in having a political mandate."
"According to this mandate, its purpose is to foster the transition towards open market-oriented economies and to promote private and entrepreneurial initiative in the Central and Eastern European countries and CIS states committed to the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics."
"It is also part of the Bank's political mandate to promote, across the full range of its activities, environmentally sound and sustainable development."
"In my view, political guidelines governing the activities of other development banks would be desirable as well."
"Having scrutinised its operations, we can attest that the EBRD performs well in fulfilling its current mandate."
"In selecting the projects to be funded, the EBRD prefers to be involved in small and medium-sized projects rather than promoting large-scale prestige projects."
"It shows great willingness to take risks through its commitment to projects which other banks deem too risky, but it does not systematically seek the security of state guarantees."
"A key focus of its activities is developing small and medium-sized businesses."
"The EBRD's micro-financing projects deserve particular mention in this context."
"Yet its high willingness to take risks does not take place at the expense of sound business management, as is borne out by the fact that it has always received the highest rating (triple A) from international rating agencies."
"In my capacity as rapporteur, I would like to make a number of recommendations to the Bank, notwithstanding the positive assessment of its work overall."
"Although its activities focus primarily on the transitional promotion of private and public enterprise, its operations undoubtedly have macroeconomic effects."
"For this reason, an analysis of its operations should include economic data, which has not been the case to date."
"I am thinking especially of factors such as trends in employment, wages and salaries, productivity, company turnover, and so on."
"This will allow comparisons to be drawn between regions where the EBRD operates and regions where it does not operate, so that the influence of EBRD activities on macroeconomic development can be assessed."
"In this context, it should also be a stated aim of the EBRD's operations to achieve synergy effects."
"Pursuing an integrated approach designed to help entire value-added chains in a region can contribute to promoting regional economic and social flows, thus facilitating sustainable development, which - as already mentioned - is one of the tasks defined in the Bank's mandate."
"It is also, in my view, important to encourage the Bank to tailor its policies to local circumstances."
"Each country in which it operates has taken different decisions on its economic structures throughout the transformation process, especially as regards the division between the public and private sectors."
"The Bank therefore should not attempt to operate in the same way in every country."
"It would be a misinterpretation of the Bank's political mandate, were it to set itself up as the herald of ultra-liberalism and set itself the sole goal of promoting privatisation and uncontrolled liberalisation. It does not do so, but I want to point out that this risk must be controlled from the outset."
"My report is a first for the European Parliament, since it is the first time that the operations of the EBRD have been subject to scrutiny and assessment by this House."
"This closes a gap which marked the EBRD out from other banks, such as the EIB, which has been subject to assessment by the EP for years."
"In future, a report on the EBRD will be presented to the European Parliament every two years."
"I think that with this own-initiative report, the foundation stone has been laid for positive and continuous cooperation between the Bank and the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I should first like to congratulate Mr Markov on his report on the activities of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)."
"In our view, the report gives an accurate account of the nature of the Bank's mandate and activities by identifying three features peculiar to it alone."
"Firstly, the Bank has both a political and an economic mandate."
"Secondly, it has implemented a policy of conditionality."
"In particular, this has affected the Bank's involvement in environmental issues, as Mr Markov mentioned."
"Lastly, there is the commitment to both the additionality and profitability of the funds made available."
"This requires the Bank to take on risks private operators would decline."
"The pragmatic approach the EBRD brings to the interpretation of its mandate also features prominently in the report."
"This pragmatism has allowed the Bank to resolve a number of potential contradictions by adapting its political and economic framework to suit the stage of economic, cultural and social development attained by each country."
"It has also made it possible for the Bank to reassess its operational priorities and gradually build the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises or local financial institutions into these priorities."
"In addition, support for strategic international investors has been enhanced."
"This same pragmatic approach has enabled the Bank, with the support of its shareholders, to adjust some of the limits to its mandate."
"For instance, within its general strategy, more importance is now attached to reform of the regulatory framework and to how efficiently it is implemented by local administrations and judicial authorities."
"Mr Markov's report also rightly suggests placing additional emphasis on certain aspects of this pragmatic approach."
"One instance is more careful consideration of the social and political aspects of restructuring the productive sector."
"Another example is the reference to a more active role in the sustainable development of the energy sector."
"A further example is the reference to strengthening the Bank's operations at municipal level."
"I should now like to say a few words about the relationship between the Union and the Bank."
"First, this is an entirely innovative relationship at the institutional level, since the EBRD is the only international institution of which the European Commission is a shareholder."
"This is particularly evident in the Board of Governors."
"The Member States and the Union's institutions together represent a majority when a vote is to be taken."
"Cooperation between the Community and the Bank is another significant feature, and has developed considerably."
"I believe it is now extremely close, and takes many different forms."
"In particular, cooperation was strengthened through the Bank's active involvement in the pre-accession strategy."
"A network of working relationships between the services of the Commission and the Bank in now firmly established."
"This has resulted in a significant increase in that part of the Community budget devoted to supporting or cofinancing the Bank's projects."
"In the early 1990s it was estimated that this contribution amounted to approximately EUR 40 million."
"In recent years, however, it has increased to an average annual sum of EUR 300 million."
"Finally, from the point of view of political priorities, cooperation with the Bank is indeed cause for satisfaction."
"It has allowed us to draw on two fundamental assets for which we are indebted to the Bank, or to make use of them so as to enhance European policies."
"The first of these is the Bank's competence in the region."
"This is due to its extensive knowledge of the current situation in the countries in question."
"The second is the Bank's practice of conditionality, which has often made it possible for the Bank's involvement to serve to promote compliance with European standards."
"This has been the case with regard to the environment."
"In conclusion, I should simply like to emphasise that on the basis of these findings, it appears that the relationship between the Union and the Bank is bound to become even closer in all countries."
"Clearly, there is scope for further development of the Bank's activities in Russia, in other CIS States, and in the Balkans."
"It would also appear that there is scope for further involvement in the candidate countries following accession."
"In this connection, we endorse the view expressed in Mr Markov's report."
"We certainly believe it would be wise to continue active cooperation with the EBRD following enlargement, whilst also working with the obvious partner, namely the European Investment Bank."
"This will enable us to continue to benefit from the EBRD's experience after enlargement."
"It goes without saying that the degree of cooperation and the time periods involved will depend on the EBRD's capacity to respond to the actual needs identified in this area."
"I am particularly pleased today to be able to welcome the President of the EBRD on an occasion which, as the rapporteur has remarked, is the first such encounter and dialogue on these terms between the EBRD and Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lemierre, may I begin by congratulating Mr Markov on a sterling report."
"The EBRD has been, and will be, of great importance to the development of former Communist Europe."
"For many of the countries, the door is now open to membership of the EU."
"This is obviously the best way for them to secure a better social and economic future."
"There are, however, still many countries that are, and will be, outside the EU's internal market."
"If the gulfs between countries and peoples are not to increase further, the EBRD's efforts are perhaps needed now more than ever."
"It is not easy to transform Communist planned economies that have sucked the life out of societies and people and introduce a market economy philosophy."
"We can now see the huge costs for the former GDR."
"I am particularly pleased that the Markov report emphasises free competition and the opportunities provided by the market and highlights, for example, the great importance of small companies to an affluent society."
"We Liberals have especially wanted to emphasise a matter also addressed by Mr Purvis, to the effect that the EBRD must step up its efforts in the EU's new border countries, for example in Moldova and Ukraine."
"Obviously, this must also be done in Russia where the trend is, in spite of everything, in the right direction."
"That the former Soviet empire and its inhabitants should acquire a more secure economic foundation is, of course, of the greatest interest to us within the EU in terms of economics, security policy and also straightforward politics."
"That is apparent from an interesting article in today's Financial Times, quoting Mr Lemierre."
"We also proposed more emphasis on projects that support democratic development."
"When it comes to Belarus, which is perhaps the worst remnant of the old Soviet period and which is without democracy, the EBRD should seek cooperation partners within non-governmental organisations."
"Human rights must always be guaranteed."
"It is therefore good that the EBRD should freeze assets and investments when human rights are threatened."
"Mr Purvis mentioned the Balkans and Serbia."
"There too, I believe that the EBRD's efforts are especially important in a situation in which democracy is very shaky and needs support."
"I also believe it is important to emphasise that the EBRD should be managed in a professional and efficient way."
"The way in which it is organised must therefore be continually monitored, and unnecessary and costly bureaucracy prevented."
"We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party support Amendments Nos 2 and 4, just as Mr Purvis does, but also parts of Amendment No 5."
"I want to conclude by saying that a number of the amendments concern the development of nuclear power."
"This is, in my opinion, a source of energy that is clean and reduces the increasing greenhouse effect."
"It reduces the risks of climate change if it is safe and properly managed."
"I wonder therefore what the Greens have against it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lemierre, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot add my voice to the praise heaped on the Bank by the rapporteur and the previous speakers."
"It is not the task of parliamentarians to pay tribute to banks' investment successes but to check whether this Bank, which is funded from the public purse, complies with the political rules in force in the European Union, namely the rules of transparency, the rules of sustainable development, and the rules of environmental compatibility."
"It is our task to demand that it does so."
"This brings me to my points of criticism."
"Point 1: the support for investment in the BP pipeline for oil exploitation in the Caspian Sea."
"On the contrary, more than one million people have become refugees here over the last ten years."
"Admittedly, this is not an accusation that can be levelled at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development itself, but the Bank does have a commitment to political principles."
"The fact is that this project will not produce a peace agreement, but will simply let the conflict in the region simmer on."
"In effect, that means that the European Union will benefit substantially from the production of oil, but for local people, it will not create the desired peace or prosperity."
"It is also unclear who bears the risk in the event of accidents."
"There are certainly no opportunities for local economic development."
"Transparency, too, must also be improved, especially transparency for the population."
"The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is supporting dubious nuclear projects in Rovno and Khmelnitsky."
"We know that the European Parliament has spoken out against this, because it is not convinced that these reactors can be made safe."
"We also know that they are being built solely to supply cheap electricity to Western Europe, not to resolve the problems in Ukraine."
"This House has therefore opposed any such investment."
"I would therefore like to ask the President how, in that case, the Development Bank has still transferred EUR two billion to EURATOM to make these projects possible."
"Mr President, President of the EBRD, Commissioner, this first decade in the life of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has been marked by highs and lows."
"The Markov report paints a very positive picture, particularly, of course, since it refers to the last few years."
"This is, in many ways, understandable, but in the past, even the recent past - with the Russian crisis and so on - problems have emerged that have led to unsatisfactory or even downright disastrous results, as in the case I have just mentioned of the Russian crisis, which affected the EBRD as well as many other international financial institutions."
"This is probably due to one of the major contradictions that exist in the EBRD's institutional activities: the fact that it promotes market economics using a non-market instrument, that is a loan guaranteed by public funds, having the possibility - also mentioned in the Markov report - of taking risks that other institutions would not take."
"This leads me on to a rather sensitive aspect of the EBRD's activity - an aspect of which the institutions' top echelons are aware, as I well know - which is the risk that EBRD funding may squeeze out private risk capital and the development of endogenous credit in these countries."
"It is a difficult balance to strike, and one which I believe should be given careful attention."
"It is important not to let EBRD intervention end up penalising the growth of a private credit sector."
"Two more points before I close: I think that attention should be focused more and more in future on neighbouring countries and less and less on the countries joining the European Union, precisely because the risk of squeezing out a nascent private market economy in these countries is greater."
"Lastly, I turn to the European Union as the majority EBRD shareholder."
"We invest in the Ukraine, for instance, through the EBRD."
"This is admirable, but we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other through trade restrictions which weigh very heavily on a country like the Ukraine."
"Our two hands need to work in harmony."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lemierre, I would like to begin by thanking you and your staff for your work."
"The balance-sheet is impressive."
"We are pleased that the balance-sheet which you have delivered today gives no cause for criticism."
"Secondly, I endorse your priorities."
"Despite your specific role, I think it is very important, as you have said, that the Bank is also an agency for the implementation of the Commission's priorities, as well as for cooperation with the Commission and the Parliament."
"We must not spread ourselves too thinly."
"We must set priorities in order to be able to fulfil our political and economic responsibilities in the world - for the Member States, the accession countries, and the surrounding countries."
"We cannot adopt divergent priorities."
"I believe that the following points are important. I hope that next time round, you will also report on the impact of your operations in the transformation countries, since it enhances awareness of the Bank's strengths if we have not only a balance-sheet but also information about the macroeconomic effects of its activities."
"Secondly, I think it is important to continue and intensify your work on boosting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We are all aware of the key role played by SMEs in creating and consolidating training places and jobs."
"Our expectation is that you will increase this commitment, especially by strengthening the focus on equity investment for SMEs and supporting the development of an SME infrastructure."
"I would simply point out that in Russia, only 10% of the workforce is employed in SMEs."
"It is also very important that in a week when we have spoken a great deal about the Lisbon process, you are keeping the Lisbon strategy in mind when evaluating projects and enterprises and making this one of your criteria."
"Furthermore, of course, we need a priority headed 'accession countries'."
"However, EU enlargement will not be complete in 2004."
"The issue of the Balkans - i.e. the former Yugoslavia - is important for the European Union, as is the establishment of a security belt, and economic development on the European Union's borders is integral to this process."
"I therefore ask you to continue your policy course and to take Parliament's ideas on board."
"We will support you in this approach."
"Mr President, the EBRD is funded by the taxpayer, which is why transparency must be established in respect of its activities."
"As the European Parliament, we attempted this from the outset during the Bank's start-up phase, and I must say it has not always been a success story; the Bank has also been through some very difficult times."
"Even in Parliament, opinions were divided as to whether we should indeed still have our own bank."
"This too must play a part in today's debate."
"Mr Lemierre, you have described the Bank's task as being a 'classical' general interest service which, however, makes use of private-sector intervention instruments."
"This is undoubtedly an apt description and we must test its activities to determine to what extent this is actually being realised."
"You are undoubtedly in a difficult position because the development of the private sector, as an outcome of successful transformation processes in the states where you operate, fails above all because there is no fully functioning financial sector, which means that the financial conditions for business start-ups and operations are very difficult."
"For this reason, I welcome the fact that you have concentrated 30% of your resources on this sector."
"I also recognise that your activities in the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses are important to a functioning market economy and to the development of democracy."
"However, what is also important is to see how stability can be achieved in these countries."
"How can we facilitate economic growth through investment?"
"That is an issue which constantly occupies our minds in the European Union as well."
"In my view, it is especially important that you can take risks which others cannot take, and that this willingness to take risks does not conflict with sound and reliable management."
"This is reflected in the high rating the Bank has received from rating agencies."
"The Bank is unique among multilateral development banks in having a political mandate."
"Its task is to contribute to a social market economy, democracy, pluralism and the rule of law."
"In this context, you should focus even more strongly on ensuring respect for human rights and democratic principles."
"You should deny support, to an even greater extent than before, to states and companies which engage in unfair practices and in which there is corruption and mismanagement."
"This should also apply to failure to comply with the objectives of environmentally sound, socially compatible and sustainable development."
"The EBRD is still operational in Central and Eastern Europe."
"These states' accession to the EU will open up many investment opportunities, which will not be available to other states."
"For this reason, it is worth considering whether the current division of responsibilities between the EBRD, the EIB and the World Bank should be reviewed, including in geographical terms, despite their clear mandates, for the future success of the transformations in the former CIS republics will contribute not only to economic and political stability in these countries, but will also have an impact on the European Union and other regions of the world."
"The transformation processes in all countries require further joint efforts and financial support, and this includes the accession countries as well."
"However, it is the most underdeveloped countries that pose the greatest risk of instability."
"In my view, Mr President, this is a fresh challenge for the EBRD!"
"Mr President, Mr Markov's excellent report creates the impression that the Bank really is a great success."
"It has been successful at investing - in nuclear safety, for example - in the candidate countries and in the former Soviet republics."
"As the President said, the Bank has done a great job of improving nuclear safety in these countries."
"That is also something for which there is certainly a need."
"The fact is that all these nuclear power stations are veritable time bombs."
"Think of the Chernobyl disaster."
"Safety is so appalling, it is a disgrace that all these power stations were not closed down long ago."
"The Bank is responsible for the fund to be used for decommissioning the Ignalina power station in Lithuania."
"It is a nuclear power station I have visited quite a few times, and safety is so poor there that, following these visits, I am glad that I shall not be having any more children."
"At the Copenhagen Summit, Lithuania promised to shut down Ignalina in 2009."
"There is really something for the Bank to do in this connection."
"A proposal has just been put forward for an investment package that would put some order into the method used for storing nuclear waste."
"The present situation is completely unacceptable. It is a huge mess and, in the longer term, extremely dangerous."
"I would therefore call for the package to be adopted as quickly as possible."
"In the future, we should take a brief look at how the Bank's funds are monitored."
"I should like to call upon the Bank's president to post something on its web site in this connection."
"With regard to the Bank's accounts, it should be noted that these are not audited by any external firm of auditors."
"There is apparently no independent institution that scrutinises the Bank's activities."
"The Court of Auditors has not prepared a report for years."
"The Bank has an evaluation unit that carries out some quite excellent evaluations, but what is missing is an external audit."
"I should therefore like to hear the Commission say what it does to monitor the funds, and I should also like to hear the Bank's president say whether the Bank is more willing to open its doors to external audits."
"Mr President, Commissioner, President of the EBRD, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, allow me to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on his careful analysis of the EBRD's activities."
"The choice of economic activities must combine the local dimension with the international and requires a supply of credit not only to encourage the emergence of initiatives that are well established within a country but also to help them spread to other markets."
"It is certainly the job of the EBRD to do this, but it is even more important to try to do it in countries with little industrial development, which have a greater need for support and revitalisation."
"If, in order to achieve this objective, it needs to take risks and, in some cases, accept unexpected losses, it must not then cut out initiatives and planned investments but rather benefit from new experiences so that it can manage lending more attentively and read the risks more carefully."
"This bank takes an ethical approach to credit management."
"Its institutional commitment is to invest in any country that is inspired by democratic principles and determined to promote a market economy."
"The first time, the bank asks clients for valid projects, with current market prices; it also requires that there should be no conflicts of interest or dominant positions in the operational area to be financed, and that the interests of the local community should always be respected."
"In the public sector, the EBRD calls for the greatest transparency to be employed in order to ensure competition and equal treatment for the market players."
"We welcome and support the rapporteur's views when he urges the EBRD to support small local banks, which, in turn, should focus on small-scale lending."
"At this point, Mr President, allow me to sound an alarm: small bank lending is disappearing or is being considerably cut back."
"This is a matter for concern, because no economic or financial manoeuvre, however good it may be, could replace the support that small banks have always offered to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We must also note that small-scale lending in many Member States and particularly the accession states is being thoroughly neglected; that leads to a daily increase in financial exclusion, which is the existence of serious gaps in the supply of small-scale credit services in the countries with the weakest economies, where a form of discrimination based on geographical criteria arises: red-lining."
"It is up to the EBRD, which has already chosen to operate in countries such as Albania, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Moldova, to help to integrate these disadvantaged economies fully into the international economic order."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lemierre, since its creation, the EBRD has been a shining and undeniable example of the solidarity shown by democratic and developed societies."
"Indeed, this Bank came into being as a result of the fall of the Berlin Wall and its primary aim is to assist the economies of Eastern European countries, which have since opened up to international competition, to overcome the natural difficulties arising from their embryonic development."
"Although it is not officially a Community institution, the Bank embodies the entire philosophy of action that characterises the EU's cohesion and development policies."
"The forthcoming enlargement of the Union to encompass a significant number of countries from the East will deepen and highlight the importance of the financial and technical aid that the Bank has provided and granted to the candidate countries in the pre-accession phase."
"The EBRD's actions must not, however, be cannibalised or cancelled out by the tasks determined and defined for the European Investment Bank."
"What is needed instead is for these two financial institutions to coordinate and collaborate whilst respecting their autonomy and their different origins, despite the very close financial relationship they enjoy."
"This should not, incidentally, be too difficult, given that many of their aims are common, as are the characteristics of the economic actors to which this aid must be directed."
"The recommendations contained in this report, which are aimed at increasing financial and technical aid for small and medium-sized businesses and at prioritising the implementation of financial resources within partnerships, especially in the form of venture capital, and the call for an ongoing commitment to train staff in the bank which can help them better to perform their duties, are extremely positive aspects."
"The European Parliament should, therefore, support the main conclusions offered by Mr Markov, who is responsible for this own-initiative report."
"It is also significant that this debate is taking place in the presence of the President of the EBRD, to whom, ultimately, these recommendations are also addressed and on whose abilities the Bank's success and policies largely depend."
"Mr President, I will be very brief and will just make three comments."
"The first is in response to Mr Blak."
"Not only am I prepared for increased transparency, but I must also say that we are monitored by external auditors and that, of course, the results are made public."
"We are not content with self-examination."
"We seek an outside opinion, we have auditors, their opinions are made public and our accounts are published every year."
"Also, the Bank's Board of Directors is particularly vigilant about its accounts and maintains a dialogue with the external auditors."
"I can also tell you that following various debates regarding certain private companies and the debates on the roles of auditors, we have tightened our rules and, I think, adopted the best practices in that area."
"In particular we have divided the responsibilities properly between the auditors and consultants and improved the discussion between the specialist Committee within the Board of Directors responsible for the accounts and the external auditors."
"My second comment is addressed to Mrs Schröder."
"I think that the examples that were given, which concern two projects that pose extraordinary problems but also have positive aspects, about which the Bank has not yet made a decision, demonstrate quite well what the Bank can seek to contribute: more transparency, more impact on the population and, ultimately, a decision that must be made by the board of directors."
"Once again, the decisions have not been made and I have noted the comments."
"I would like to say that this is probably one of the measures that the Bank can operate: more nuclear safety, greater impact on the population, greater transparency, fighting corruption within projects."
"I think that it is absolutely necessary, and it is also the price of public intervention and what it should achieve if it is determined."
"My third comment will simply be that I have listened to all of the speeches with a great deal of interest."
"I think that these speeches clearly reflect the depth and strength of the institution's mandate, but also the challenges inherent in it."
"Several of you have spoken, fundamentally, about the historical mandate and whether it is up to date."
"My feeling is that it is entirely relevant today: it is very up to date, as long as it is kept going, and your comments will help us to further achieve this."
"That leads me on to a point that is very important to us, the dialogue with all of the governments and authorities in the region."
"We are engaged in high-level political dialogue in each of the states in region."
"There is one challenge that I think is quite essential: applying the rule of law, not so much in expressing its legal regulations (fortunately) but rather in implementing them; improving the legal system and its operation in all the countries in the region remains an absolutely essential challenge."
"This leads me to recall a few of the EBRD's convictions, which it has acquired over ten years of experience, that the market economy cannot work without democracy, that the market economy cannot work without social cohesion, that there cannot be social cohesion without a strong civil society and that there cannot be strong civil society without transparency and fighting corruption."
"These are the messages that we are of course regularly developing at political level, when we assess the situations of the various states with regard to Article 1 of the institution's mandate, but also in the dialogue that we maintain."
"I would therefore like to offer Mr Markov and each of you my own most sincere thanks and those of the institution for your comments."
"They will encourage us to be even more determined in implementing the mandate that we have and to come and explain to Mr Markov and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, in two years time, how we have progressed."
"Mr President, I apologise for taking up more time, but I did not receive an answer to my question."
"Has the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development transferred EUR two billion to EURATOM, yes or no?"
"A simple yes or no will suffice."
"No."
"The answer is no."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0448/2002) by Hugues Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on aquaculture in the European Union: present and future (2002/2058(INI))."
"Mr President, the Commission welcomes this report by Parliament."
"It certainly presents an accurate account of the challenges currently facing European aquaculture."
"The report is also consistent with guidelines contained in the communication from the Commission adopted last September."
"This communication concerned a strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture in Europe."
"The Commission would first like to thank Parliament for its support of a range of new measures put forward as part of the Commission's strategy."
"I refer in particular to the initiatives planned concerning the review of legislation on food safety and health risks, environmental protection, animal welfare, the development of new farming techniques and of high quality species."
"Other measures concern enhancing the governance and organisation of the industry and the development of aquaculture in general."
"Parliament's report highlights the importance that should be attached to research."
"Mr Martin referred to this a moment ago, and the Commission's proposal does so too."
"It is to be hoped that when it comes to adopting the new decisions on framework programme budgetary allocations, Parliament will support the allocation of additional resources to research into aquaculture."
"I shall deal next with the concerns expressed in Paragraphs 10 to 14 of the resolution."
"These relate to the possible impact of genetically modified fish and poliploid molluscs."
"I am pleased to inform the House that the Commission has recently concluded the selection process for a study on genetic engineering in aquaculture."
"The study will encompass all these issues."
"The Commission can confirm that in future initiatives, as requested in the resolution, it will take proper account of the economic importance of all the enterprises involved in aquaculture."
"Due consideration will be given even to the smallest."
"The Commission will also allow for the need to protect traditional practices."
"We have noted Parliament's suggestion, in Paragraph 7, on the advisability of amending the regulations governing the financial instrument, the FIFG."
"We have also noted Parliament's view that the sector requires public financial support now and in the near future."
"The Commission found that some of the amendments tabled do not fall within the scope of its strategy."
"They will require detailed study."
"Further, together with several Member States, the Commission is of the opinion that aquaculture is a new activity which can and must be independent and financially viable."
"The introduction of measures aimed at financing its operational costs would not be consistent with this view."
"Furthermore, we would be severely criticised within the WTO."
"We have also noted Parliament's request for a study on the viability of conserving stocks of wild fish to be undertaken."
"In addition, Parliament has called for the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare and to be charged with drawing up a report on the welfare of farmed fish."
"Indeed, the Commission has already requested the Committee to rule on the slaughter and transport of farmed fish."
"Further, within the framework of existing legislation, the Commission is launching initiatives to deal with problems affecting the market in specific species."
"Sea bream and bass are two current examples."
"The Commission's services met with the Member States and representatives of the sector in December 2002."
"At that meeting we were able to come up with measures to be taken in the ensuing few months."
"To quote some examples, the temporary suspension of public aid for the creation of new production capacity, the launch of a study on the market for bass and sea bream, and the effort to organise a campaign to promote international sales."
"We do not believe that the request contained in Paragraph 15 calls for additional legislative measures."
"There is widespread awareness of the difficulties involved in developing physicochemical and biological techniques to determine the concentration of toxins in shellfish."
"This is also the case regarding licensing the sale of vaccines in Member States."
"All this is dealt with in the communication."
"Nonetheless, we have taken note of Parliament's requests."
"Paragraphs 20 and 29 refer chiefly to the Member States and to Parliament itself, and the Commission agrees with them."
"There is, however, one proposal the Commission cannot support."
"This is contained in Paragraph 28."
"It would involve creating an instrument designed to offer assistance to the sector when it is struck by natural or man-made disasters."
"It is actually within the competence of the FIFG to authorise the temporary cessation of activity and other financial compensation."
"When very serious accidents occur, such as that involving the Prestige, the ad hoc reaction of the European institutions can and must be swift."
"The regulation providing compensation for Spanish fisheries and the Spanish shellfish and aquaculture sectors affected by fuel oil spillage from the aforementioned tanker was adopted on 20 December."
"That was merely a month to the day after the vessel sank."
"The Commission certainly endorses Parliament's suggestion that the professional organisations need to make a greater effort to improve their image, establishing more effective channels of communication."
"In our view, however, this is something the professionals should undertake for themselves, although they could be eligible for support from existing provisions for public aid."
"We do not believe the Commission should be directly involved as requested in Paragraph 35."
"Lastly, the Commission has taken note of Paragraphs 27 and 32 of the resolution."
"These concern the recognition of producers' organisations and the guarantee of fair standards to be applied to European and third-country producers and products."
"These issues call for more detailed consideration in the future."
"Mr President, this report contains a number of contradictions."
"On the one hand there are some very good things in it, to the extent that it addresses the whole issue of aquaculture and sustainable development and in particular its impact on the environment."
"It is also positive in that it considers the very important issue of animal welfare and the question of overcrowding in fish farms, and calls for some sort of stocking densities to be set."
"However, other parts of the report criticise EU environmental and health and food safety requirements."
"It would appear to put business interests first, which is a very dangerous precedent because environmental and health and food safety requirements should come before any business interests."
"It also questions the precautionary principle, on the grounds that this principle would seem to make it more difficult for aquaculture ventures."
"The precautionary principle is something that we must adhere to within the European Union and it must be respected at all times."
"If it makes things more difficult, that is because it is a precautionary approach, it is the way we should approach aquaculture."
"The other questionable aspect of the report is the whole issue of wanting the Commission to promote aquaculture."
"I do not think that this is a good idea."
"There are many problems connected with aquaculture; it seems that people within the aquaculture industry think that it will solve the problems of wild stocks and also those relating to sea fishing and the reduction of sea stocks."
"But it will not."
"Aquaculture gives rise to many problems."
"GMOs are an issue that has been raised already."
"Introducing genetically modified fish into aquaculture is something that is extremely dangerous and should be avoided."
"We also have to address the use of industrial fishing to feed aquaculture."
"It is quite clear that if this industry keeps growing as it is, it will soon outstrip the supply of resources from industrial fishing."
"Whether we like it or not, that is what we are facing, plus the fact that aquaculture is an extremely dangerous industry in the impact it has on the environment."
"Finally, on the matter of consumer confidence, I am very wary of the notion in the report that the Commission should promote consumer confidence in aquaculture."
"The products of aquaculture speak for themselves, and it is wild fish stocks that we should be looking at and addressing here."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, aquaculture is daily achieving greater recognition within the wider context of the fisheries sector at global and Community level."
"Aquaculture is a key adjunct to the extractive fisheries sector."
"It is, however, abundantly clear that aquaculture is beset by a range of problems."
"The latter relate for instance to its size, marketing, the environment and health."
"It is essential to identify all these problems and tackle them at Community level."
"It was therefore particularly appropriate for our Committee on Fisheries to prepare an own-initiative report on such an important and sensitive issue."
"The appointment of Mr Martin as rapporteur was particularly appropriate too."
"He has brought dedication and rigour to his hard work, managing to produce a report that obtained broad support within our committee."
"I am confident it will receive the same support in plenary."
"The report provides a comprehensive overview of the difficulties facing the broad and diverse European aquaculture sector."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Martin publicly on this achievement."
"This report should prove a godsend to the European Union and most certainly to Parliament."
"It marks a watershed in the effort to deal with the many and complex issues impacting on aquaculture, and will prove a splendid work of reference to draw upon."
"Thanks to this report and the earlier hearing with the sector, much light has been thrown on the specific problems."
"Both the present situation and future prospects are clearly detailed in the document."
"We are called upon to do our utmost to ensure that nightmares like the Erika and the Prestige disasters are consigned to oblivion, and that henceforth the protection of the environment and of marine ecosystems has priority."
"The interests of sensitive European maritime and fishing areas must come first."
"That is where fish and shellfish are produced, the ecosystem is preserved and thousands of families earn their living."
"Many other jobs complement traditional fishing practices."
"They are closely connected to the latter and dependent on them."
"I therefore urge you to follow the course outlined in Mr Martin's report so as to ensure that European aquaculture itself remains on the right course."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Martin on his own-initiative report, and on the quality of his work."
"He deserves special congratulations because he has succeeded in achieving unanimity within the Committee on Fisheries, and because of the standard of the hearing he so skilfully arranged."
"In particular, I would like to thank Mr Martin for the speed with which he incorporated into this report the request for ad hoc instrument to be resorted to when environmental disasters occur, regardless of whether they are due to natural causes."
"The current situation in Galicia following the accident involving the Prestige is a case in point."
"The aquaculture sector has been hit particularly hard."
"Aquaculture is an emerging sector within Community fisheries."
"Consequently, it faces many challenges and uncertainties."
"It needs Community support to achieve excellence in production, to innovate, and to enable the ventures to become more competitive and to operate in an environmentally friendly manner."
"Support is also needed to allow these enterprises to promote themselves to consumers and to create jobs in areas where they are most needed."
"The Community must make progress on denominations of origin for high quality aquaculture products linked to specific localities."
"A special section on the promotion of this type of product should be added to the FIFG regulations."
"Amongst other places, members of the Committee on Fisheries visited Scotland and Andalusia."
"Such visits enabled us to gain first-hand knowledge of the problems of the sector and of its potential."
"We were in a position to appreciate the difficulties facing producers on site."
"We met with salmon producers in Scotland and in Ireland, and learnt about their problems."
"We marvelled at the skills displayed by sturgeon producers in Granada."
"We realised the significance of the experimental farming of sea bream and bass in former Roman salt pans in the province of Cadiz."
"We gained an understanding of the marketing problems too."
"Hence our belief that one of the Community's priorities must be to identify new high quality species, and add them to the list of preferential species."
"The development of research at Community level, and the exchange of new practices related to these species and their farming must also be prioritised."
"The Socialist Group would welcome a directive providing for the regulation of organic aquaculture, and taking account of the crucial factors in this type of production."
"I have in mind the use of traditional methods, environmental factors, temperatures and the availability of water."
"Special funding should be made available to assist organic production and the promotion and sale of such products."
"We urge the Commission to take into account the fact that market saturation is not an issue in connection with the rearing of certain species such as turbot."
"This is because the farming of this species is a recent innovation, and is only just being developed."
"We therefore believe the Commission should continue to support the establishment of new facilities for farming such species, and that suitable provision should be made in the regulations governing the use of FIFG funds."
"The Commission had indeed supported some new facilities for turbot farming."
"Even so, given the rapid increase in demand and the relative growth of the industry we believe more assistance is called for."
"Aquaculture is a fisheries sector with great potential."
"It must receive Community support if it is to develop in an orderly fashion."
"First of all I would like to congratulate Mr Martin on the excellent result."
"The problems and challenges surrounding aquaculture were brought to the fore well in his report."
"You can also tell that he did his own research and went to look at the places where this work is being done."
"I do have a couple of comments, however."
"One of aquaculture's most significant problems is its poor image, which is the result of a lack of knowledge."
"We will only be able to eliminate this lack of knowledge if we have clear test data at our disposal."
"The European Union must therefore enable research to be carried out."
"Clarity will result in a better image, and this will enable the sector to solve a major problem, which it must do by means of communication."
"With regard to the finances, the economic viability of the sector is a significant concern in Europe."
"If we want to offer opportunities for long-term economic viability, we must not allow the sector to become addicted to subsidies."
"Self-help is better."
"My starting point is: allow the market to go its own way, start up and drive itself onwards, and the sector should then be able to look after itself."
"Apart from that, we do want to handle the frameworks responsibly, so we must define frameworks and preconditions ourselves."
"This market must be put on the right track."
"Regulation must be simple, clear and honest."
"Removing regulatory barriers will make the market more consistent, more transparent and consequently more efficient."
"This provides better opportunities for competitively priced products, which will also benefit European consumers."
"Furthermore, consumers benefit from food safety and transparency, both of which are particularly important."
"It must always be possible to guarantee food safety."
"We must, however, remain rational in this regard and not make ridiculous demands."
"If something is 100% good, it does not need to be 150% good."
"Let us keep both feet on the ground."
"Imposing excessive demands will pull the plug on small businesses, and they will not survive."
"I therefore call for simple regulation."
"Clear and workable on the one hand, and controllable and enforceable on the other."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will endorse this report."
"I think that aquaculture makes a positive contribution to the preservation of natural fish stocks."
"Mr President, this report expresses a positive position towards aquaculture, which we support, because we believe this will always only be a complement to the fisheries sector and not a replacement for it."
"The report places aquaculture in the context of sustainable development and the precautionary principle, which requires, in particular, full attention to be paid to environmental issues and the production of genetically modified fish to be rejected."
"We agree with the rapporteur's argument for maintaining aid under the FIFG and the participation of the main parties involved, the need for research to be promoted and for an economic instrument to be created to support possible crisis situations in the sector, such as natural disasters."
"Nevertheless, we wish to draw attention to particular aspects and special needs that must be taken account of in this activity."
"Aquaculture must not be compared with any industry other than farming and livestock breeding, given that it has direct consequences for the development of species and the environment, specifically coastlines and alternative land uses."
"Furthermore, opportunities for the intensification and verticalisation of production can present major risks for human and animal health, which must be monitored so as to prevent any type of 'mad cow disease' for fish."
"Hence the need for greater support for research into this activity, for the use of production techniques, hygiene and safety standards, by making the application of the precautionary principle a priority, and for reducing environmental impacts, with specific assistance needing to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Lastly, I wish to inform you that our group supports both this report on European aquaculture, by, Mr Martin, whom I congratulate, and the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, whom I also congratulate, on fishing in international waters, which we will be discussing here today."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to wish everyone here in the House a happy new year!"
"Secondly, Commissioner, I was very pleased to hear your constructive comments with regard to various studies, procedures and approaches."
"It seems there are still positive movements in the fisheries sector after all."
"For 30 years, we have failed to curb overfishing in any real way."
"Demand, the local employment situation, sectoral interests, scientific evidence and national interests have proved to be irreconcilable."
"Indeed, that is why the planned reform of the common fisheries policy turned out to be so limited in scope."
"Stocks are continuing to decline."
"For this reason, fish farming geared towards sustainability is the only sensible option for the future that I can see at present."
"I would like to express my thanks to Hugues Martin."
"His own-initiative report on aquaculture is a particularly good example of the pro-active approach adopted by members of the Committee on Fisheries when there are problems to be solved."
"The relevant communication from the Commission underlines the fact that Parliament can certainly take the initiative on important issues."
"Aquaculture is undoubtedly the alternative to overfishing, which has no future."
"In recent years, as we have heard, it has developed very positively and has created countless jobs in the European Union as well."
"It has become an important industry in coastal regions, offering further potential, which must be fully exploited."
"However, it is not a panacea."
"It is worth looking more closely."
"Fish farming creates similar problems to intensive animal rearing on land."
"Waste discharges, parasites, chemicals, fish feed: these are just some of the key words."
"To cite only one example, the total annual discharge of waste from the Scottish fish farms is equivalent to that of a major city."
"I greatly welcome the operations and success of aquaculture, but I call for sensible, high-quality and sustainable fish farming."
"The focus on quantity at rock-bottom prices merely results in ecological and economic problems."
"It would therefore be more sensible to work towards quality - and, I believe, also towards diversity of fish species, each of which needs specific attention, and that can be expensive, of course."
"As the saying goes, the faster you climb, the harder you fall, and that will not benefit anyone, neither the coastal regions nor the consumers."
"Mr President, Commissioner, aquaculture is the fastest growing sector of world food production."
"There is cause for acknowledging the Commission's proposed strategy for aquaculture and for commending the rapporteur, Mr Martin, for his work and his report."
"In view of the outcome of the December European Council and the restrictions that, in future fisheries policy, it has been decided to impose upon catches, there is a need for vision and joint strategies for aquaculture in the EU."
"The key term is sustainable aquaculture that puts the focus upon employment, consumers and the environment."
"It is absolutely crucial to protect regions with strong fishing industries against job losses, creating more employment instead, just as it is to ensure that consumers have healthy and safe fisheries products of high quality and to ensure ecological balance and a sustainable environment."
"Access to clean water is an essential, but also limiting, factor when we talk about freshwater fish farming."
"This is a reason for stepping up research into increased recourse to recycling and re-use."
"There is a need for the use of antibiotics and medicines to be more closely monitored, and also for a system to be established and data assembled for the purposes of health protection."
"Investment in cleaner production and technology must be promoted and not be hampered by insufficient knowledge of environmental effects and by extensive use of the precautionary principle, the result of which would be differing conditions of production from one Member State to another, leading to a distortion of competition."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is able to support the rapporteur's and the Commission's proposals."
"Mr President, the restrictive measures in the Green Paper on fisheries, vessel scrapping, quotas and so forth have put medium and - even more so - small fishing enterprises out of business."
"I come from an area in Greece with a large number of small and medium-sized fishing enterprises and have seen this for myself."
"At the same time, and this is not unrelated to what I have just said, there is a burgeoning aquaculture sector, which big business is invading in a big way."
"I have nothing against aquaculture, but I am against this sort of unaccountable development, which flouts even basic hygiene and environmental standards and, unfortunately, the more aquaculture is taken over by big business, the greater this unaccountability will become."
"This report reflects the growing importance of this sector."
"It sets out the conditions needed in order for aquaculture to flourish, such as finding sites, applying principles of sustainable use, advertising products, fair terms of competition, introducing certain hygiene measures, protection against the introduction of genetically-modified fish, respect for the environment and so on."
"However, these proposals relate mainly to technical matters."
"They fail to get to the root of the problem and address the issues which will inevitably arise in the future as these enterprises expand, such as serious hygiene problems and anything from unfortunate to disastrous environmental repercussions."
"The capitalist structure and expansion policies of these companies, in which the profit factor rules supreme, are already leading, where aquaculture is concentrated in the hands of big business, to rearing methods, livestock and fish farms which are bad both for public health and the environment."
"By failing to address these major problems, the report leaves small producers, the public and the environment out on a limb."
"Finally, as regards our rapporteur's call on the Greek presidency to prevent Prestige-type disasters from reoccurring, I fear that this call will fall on deaf ears, given that the Greek presidency has never made any secret of its ties with the shipping industry."
"Mr President, I wish to start by congratulating Mr Martin on his excellent initiative, because it presents a new view of creating aquatic breeding grounds and aquaculture."
"As we all know, under the reform of the Common fisheries policy, the Commission has made thorough-going changes to management policies and to fishing fleet renewal policies."
"In particular it has proposed eliminating support for fleet renewal, limiting aid for modernisation and adopting a fleet management policy that makes its restructuring process unviable, even for countries such as Portugal, which have not only reached their targets but have exceeded them."
"This type of measure has drastically affected the size of fishing fleets and, consequently, has reduced their activity."
"The consequences of this policy have represented and still represent a genuine sacrifice on the part of Portugal's coastal communities, which have for decades lived from the sea and because of it."
"It is therefore on their behalf and on the behalf of all Europeans who live from the sea that I am speaking in this plenary, and that I am trying to support solutions likely to keep the economic, social and cultural costs of these Community measures to a minimum."
"These are measures that are extremely fish friendly but appear to hold both fishing and those who have always lived from this activity in contempt."
"I believe that aquaculture can made into something complementary to traditional fishing, on the one hand benefiting from the experience gained by those who have always been involved in fishing activities and, on the other, providing these people with a full professional rehabilitation in the same sector of activity."
"The increasing importance of this sector requires solid investment by the Union, not only in scientific research but also in training and in professional qualifications, in the installation and modernisation of structures and equipment and in health protection, particularly with regard to the use of high-quality meal and oils, to limiting the use of antibiotics and to rejecting genetically modified fish."
"There are approximately 150 Community regulations on aquaculture."
"It is not, however, the high number of regulations that provide guarantees of effective legal protection in this field, but improved quality in the production of Community legislation and in the definition of measures to be adopted."
"This quality can be improved not only by correctly implementing and targeting Community investment, but also by simplifying legislation, making it more coherent and more comprehensible to those for whom it is intended and, consequently, making its implementation more effective."
"These are, in my opinion, elements that are crucial for the necessary change of mentality and of image that even today damage the public perception, especially consumer perception, of this activity with regard to some species of fish."
"Lastly, everyone would agree that we need to amend the regulation on the financial instrument for fisheries guidance under the CFSP, in to order make aquaculture eligible for subsidies for young people's start-up, for small and medium-sized businesses, for promoting the quality of fishery products, for promotional campaigns for their consumption, for establishing environment-friendly practices, etc, etc. This, then, is my appeal to the Commission, in the person of Commissioner Solbes Mira: - and I am sorry that Commissioner Franz Fischler is not here - please do not allow this matter to fall into oblivion and please adopt effective measures to promote the aquaculture sector even more and with an eye to the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, twenty years ago aquaculture was hailed as the solution for declining fish catches."
"The dream was that it would also be able to provide a substantial proportion of the protein requirements of people living in the world's famine areas."
"Like many dreams, however, this one came to nothing."
"The food conversion rate of farmed fish is low."
"To produce one kilogram of fish you do not need four kilograms of feed, as you do for mammals, but only one-and-a-half to two kilograms."
"Unfortunately, a large proportion of this feed has to be made up of animal protein."
"Protein in fish feed comes from fishmeal, which in turn comes from industrial fish catches."
"These are done with a kind of nylon stocking that denudes entire areas."
"They not only catch adult fish but undersized fish as well; they also process cod blood, amongst other things."
"There is therefore little point in talking about cod replenishment plans if you do not restrain industrial fishery first."
"This can be done by quotas, but also by compelling purchasers of fishmeal to look for alternative raw materials such as vegetable protein or zooplankton."
"I appreciate that these alternative raw materials are not readily available."
"It is therefore very important to provide a financial stimulus for research into these alternatives and where possible to encourage it."
"This will be of benefit not only to cod stocks in the North Sea but also to the world's hungry."
"If science can tap these alternative sources of protein, the dream for aquaculture may yet come true."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rich Romans at the beginning of our era, between the first century BC and the first century AD, were the first to breed certain species of fish and molluscs."
"This was practised more, however, as a costly and fashionable pastime than as an economic activity."
"The sea-fish rearing ponds were then greatly admired for their beauty and as a symbol of the prestige that they represented."
"Traces of at least 50 fish rearing ponds dating from the Roman period have been identified along the Mediterranean rim."
"Later on, particularly in the nineteenth century, some countries developed beds of oysters, which were considered - quite rightly - to be a species of food for the refined palate."
"Only in the latter decades of the twentieth century, however, did we see the rapid expansion of aquaculture, in response to the danger of fish resources being exploited to extinction."
"In fact, in 40 years, world fish production has increased fourfold, and today stands at around of 100 million tonnes, and world demand is increasing inexorably, in line with demographic growth."
"Although aquaculture cannot replace fishing in the environment, it is, nevertheless, designed to complement and enhance some much-loved and sought after species that today feature on our daily fish menus and that fishing cannot supply in sufficient quantities."
"In future, aquaculture is bound to grow."
"What is essentially required is bringing to fish production the same changes that farming and livestock breeding underwent, moving from simple hunting and gathering to the creation and production of animal and vegetable foods."
"Such changes are not made, however, Mr President, without problems, particularly of an ecological nature, with regard to consumer health protection and even with regard to the well-being of the fish."
"Mr Martin addresses all of this in a thorough, rigorous and intelligent way in his report, which should become the textbook for aquaculture in the European Union."
"Mr President, I too am grateful to the rapporteur because I believe this report enables us to set down some definitive points: first of all aquaculture as a substantial source of supplementary income, especially for fishermen who live and work in marginal areas; and secondly its capacity for reducing fishing and for preserving our resources."
"A few problems remain, however, especially for small-scale fishing and traditional fishing."
"Conversion to aquaculture should attract aid because it is expensive: financial resources are needed for the initial investment and to get through the first three years, which are almost always unproductive."
"The Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance should include specific, targeted, fast credit facilities, or aquaculture will remain an option only for the well-off."
"The Commission's target of 8 000 to 10 000 more jobs is an ambitious challenge, and it will require a solid commitment to promote the economic profitability of aquaculture."
"Another objective - one which Parliament is particularly concerned with - is food safety, environmental impact and animal health."
"In this respect, there is a need for a code of conduct, with well-defined rules and parameters, and, above all, there is a need to ensure that all products from third countries comply with our standards of hygiene, food safety and animal welfare."
"This is not just to prevent unfair competition, as one might imagine, but principally to make an effective improvement to the quality of our sustainable development."
"Mr President, Commissioner Solbes Mira - who has previously been a Minister for Fisheries and is therefore not insensitive to this debate, despite not currently being responsible for the sector - I wish to address my first words of congratulation to Mr Martin, who has proved once again that he is an excellent MEP by producing this magnificent report, which is entirely appropriate to the current situation."
"Congratulations, Mr Martin."
"This report gives us an excellent analysis of the current state of aquaculture in the European Union and also provides us with important guidelines for the future."
"Amongst these I should like to emphasise the need to draw up integrated environmental management plans for both coastal and inland areas, since the need for such environmental plans has become evident following the recent Erika and Prestige disasters."
"Secondly, the need to increase food safety in order to ensure the health and confidence of Europe's citizens, promoting research and adequate funding of the sector, both for new units and for modernising existing ones."
"It is clear, therefore, that aquaculture has a great future."
"Nevertheless, as a consequence of recent food crises that have beset Europe, consumers have become suspicious of aquaculture."
"It must be stated, however, that intensive production is not necessarily synonymous with the absence of hygienic conditions."
"This is why we in the European Union have a set of standards for technical requirements that do not exist in other parts of the world."
"This means that there is a high degree of monitoring of these hygiene conditions."
"Nevertheless, these rules must be reinforced and improved so that our citizens view aquaculture-produced fish with complete confidence."
"Mr President, when we were discussing the compromise version of this text, all of the groups felt that the step change in the Northern dimension that will take place on enlargement will entail alterations to regional policy."
"Therefore we would like to insert an overarching paragraph at the beginning of point 3, which reads as follows: 'adapting the general approach to the changing situation where partner countries become Members in the EU, noting the specific needs this creates for regional development and cross-border cooperation.'"
"Mr President, the idea is an excellent one and is already incorporated in the jointly adopted motion for a resolution, and thus no longer needs to be added here."
"We therefore do not support this verbal amendment."
"You are against it, Mrs Myller, but if there are not 32 Members of the European Parliament who are against it, the amendment will be put to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0421/2002) by Mr Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the activities of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) [2002/2095(INI)]"
"Regarding Amendment No 6:"
"Mr President, in agreement with my colleagues, I would like to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 6."
"We wish to add something to the second line, namely that as regards the things we do not want the Bank to finance, this relates only to the expansion of the nuclear sector. We would like to insert the following words: expressly excludes any expansion of the nuclear sector from ....."
"That is the oral amendment."
"Mr Posselt, on the matter of the location for the next European Parliamentary assembly, I think it is still too early."
"We should wait a little before taking a specific line or making decisions on this."
"This report has the merit of reminding us of the important purpose of the EBRD, which is to create a market economy likely to strengthen democracy in the countries in transition, which often leads it to run risks and not to systematically seek State guarantees."
"Consequently, it invests where other banks fear to tread."
"The EBRD has been largely concentrating its activities on developing small and medium-sized businesses, developing, on the one hand, aid programmes for local banks, and, on the other, promoting the establishment of banks specialising in providing loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-loans."
"We are pleased that the rapporteur considers the activity of the EBRD to be broadly satisfactory, despite his opinions and warnings about the supposed dogmas of 'ultraliberalism' or of uncontrolled liberalisation, which no one wants to guide the activity of this institution."
"These are, in short, the reasons that have led me to support this report."
"I have voted for this report, because I agree in particular with the views it expresses on the 'positive effect' that the EBRD's activity has had on the economies of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"These economies are extremely weak and lack the mechanisms, habits and culture of the market and of competition."
"In fact, the widespread opening up to capital and the institutions' acceptance of private initiative as a dynamic source of development have had some perverse and worrying effects - which the rapporteur details: a government of kleptocrats and the impoverishment of the population - which must be countered."
"I therefore agree with the suggested response, which is to develop the entrepreneurial fabric of these countries, especially by promoting mechanisms for granting industrial and commercial credit to small and medium-sized enterprises and microcredit for which, as we are shown, there is enormous demand and which enjoys a very high level of return flows."
"In general, I would underline the emphasis that has been put on aims for social cohesion, stability policy, job creation and for effectively improving people's living standards."
"Indeed, despite being a banking institution, the EBRD has some unique characteristics, being bound to fulfil a mandate that goes far beyond merely managing money or making a profit."
"The EBRD must continue to function as an institution that shares the spirit of solidarity and cohesion that are a collective aim of the European Union."
"Hugues Martin report (A5-0448/2002)"
"The current scale of aquaculture in Europe is demonstrated by the 1.8 million tonnes of fish, shellfish and molluscs that it produces, and by the 57 000 jobs that it provides."
"In order to guarantee the sector's future, as the rapporteur proposes, we must take account of aspects such as the following: the drawing up and management of integrated environmental management plans, for both coastal and inland waters; increasing food safety in order to guarantee animal health and consumer confidence, stepping up research in technological, environmental, and health terms in order to find new solutions, and adequate funding of the sector, both for new units and for modernising existing ones."
"This is why, given the evidence of the difficult situation facing many species of wild fish, aquaculture can be seen as a complementary alternative to fishing with a certain future."
"We must, however, overcome the crisis of confidence in aquaculture products, promoting food safety measures and modernising production technologies."
"It is against this backdrop that I support the Martin report."
"- (NL) In the past, the farming of sea fish seemed to be an absurd measure thought up by companies who were looking for new opportunities to tap into a market that would make them big profits."
"As the world population continues to grow apace and the seas are being emptied of fish at an alarming rate, it looks as if the farming of sea fish will probably be inevitable."
"Not in order to tap into a market but as an essential contribution to food supplies."
"Fishing villages on the coast that have lost their old source of income will probably be happy to join in."
"This change is not without risks."
"If we do go down this road, we will need guarantees to prevent accidents and unacceptable situations."
"Sick and deformed fish in overcrowded cages in coastal zones, in other words a new type of bio-industry, is something we do not want."
"Genetically modified fish in such cages can escape and irreversibly change all the life in the sea, for example, by wiping out any natural fish that are left."
"Adding substances that have never been used before to encourage fish to grow fast and thus increase the yield may contribute to further contamination of the sea."
"It is therefore a good thing that we are paying more attention to information about the consequences, protection of the marine environment and animal welfare which is threatened by this industry."
"- (DA) We are abstaining from voting on the overall report by the Committee on Fisheries because, even though the committee's report is an improvement upon the Commission's proposals, we are of the view that, in general, the committee's report is in favour of the further development of the aquaculture sector in the EU."
"Since there continue to be many problems associated with this sector, including pollution, we choose to abstain from voting, even though we acknowledge the sterling work done by the committee."
"The next item is a report (A5-0446/2002) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on fishing in international waters within the framework of the common fisheries policy's external measures [2002/2024(INI)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, there are many endangered stocks world-wide."
"We in Scotland know how painful it is for the fishing industry when crisis conditions are reached, but we cannot solve problems in the EU by exporting them."
"We must seek responsible and sustainable fisheries everywhere."
"The ELDR would like to thank Mrs Miguélez Ramos for her hard work on the dossier; we find particularly valuable the stress that is placed on the need to secure greater compliance with international law and for improved measures against illegal and unreported fishing."
"In this context we agree that the Commission must be resourced in a way that allows it to play a fuller role in regional fisheries organisation."
"We have, however, regularly expressed our concern on two issues."
"First, our fisheries activity at international level, and in particular any agreements reached directly with third countries, must be made compatible with our development policy."
"Secondly, the cost of the external dimension of the CFP is already approaching a third of its total budget."
"This cost is likely to increase if we are serious about fuller participation in regional fisheries organisations and about securing greater compliance with international law."
"It has already been said that each euro invested from public funds generates another three in business terms."
"In these circumstances it seems only appropriate that those vessel owners who benefit from third-country agreements should take on a fairer share of the financial burden involved."
"The ELDR amendments address these developmental and financial concerns."
"We hope that the House will support them and that such issues will be given much fuller consideration in the debate on the recent Commission communication on fisheries agreements with third countries."
"Madam President, as regards fishing in international waters we need a responsible and non-exploitative approach."
"We cannot continue to export our problems."
"I would like this House to support Mrs Attwooll's amendments, which go some way towards improving the report, and my group will definitely be voting for these amendments."
"However, we cannot vote for the report itself, even if - as we hope - those amendments are adopted, because of the underlying policy and belief that we in the European Union can export our over-capacity, and that we have some historic right to exploit developing countries."
"It is true that down the centuries many Member States have colonised other countries and unjustly exploited the weaker and poorer countries of the world, but in the 21st century we should realise that the imperialist approach is wrong."
"We need to look at the social and economic contribution we make to developing countries, and in relation to fishing agreements this leaves a lot to be desired."
"This is not just a Spanish problem."
"To my own shame my own country, Ireland, has the Atlantic Dawn, which is an exploitative vessel."
"Like many other huge vessels - in fact it is worse than other vessels because it is one of the largest there is - it goes to developing countries, acting as if it had some right to exploit the resources of other countries without any checks."
"Despite what has been said about European Union agreements, at least there is a certain amount of control, though they leave a lot to be desired."
"However, when it comes to private agreements, there is no control whatsoever."
"We need to look at our position as regards developing countries."
"I support what Mrs Attwooll has said."
"We cannot say one thing, and then do another."
"Madam President, this report comes before the European Parliament at a time of growing concern around the world about the effects of the European Union's deals with third world countries."
"Not least, the World Wildlife Fund has been very vocal in its condemnation of these deals."
"I am encouraged that even in this Parliament, just one month ago, over 100 Members voted against the Senegal deal."
"To my astonishment I even agree with my own Foreign Office, for the first time ever."
"Even they recognise that these deals are just not working."
"The report is very defensive in tone."
"It claims that EU fishermen 'are not pirates'."
"As to compliance with all the rules, that claim is distinctly at variance with the current report from the Court of Auditors."
"What is most disturbing is that the rapporteur and the Commissioner seem to be arguing that if we did not take up these fishing rights some other nation would and that somehow that might be even worse."
"Even if that were true - and I would not expect to see such a puerile argument - the fact must be that two wrongs do not make a right."
"Let us remind ourselves of what those wrongs are."
"These deals are causing environmental devastation to less developed countries which, in biological terms, is like setting fire to the Serengeti."
"This is a form of European Union imperialism and it is denying development to these third world countries which otherwise could benefit their own economies."
"Furthermore these deals are morally repugnant, in that they directly and indirectly cause the deaths of hundreds of indigenous black African fishermen every year."
"What this report asks us to do is to close our eyes, when in fact people are increasingly beginning to open their eyes."
"That is why we should reject this report."
"I suspect that there will still be a majority in favour, but be aware that people are waking up and will not tolerate these deals for very much longer."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the great interest which you have witnessed in this House today - even though you yourself are not responsible for fisheries - has, I hope, made it clear how much our ideas deserve support, both in the Committee on Fisheries and in the Commission."
"We have made one thing clear today: we do not want fish out of a test-tube."
"We do not want fish only from aquaculture or a standardised packet off a supermarket shelf."
"We want more, even though the facts about our seas are bleak."
"The fish on our plates comes more and more rarely from European Union waters."
"The indigenous supply cannot meet European demand."
"This indigenous supply does not offer an adequate prospect for the future."
"We are therefore reliant on fishing in foreign waters, both in international waters and in the coastal zones of other states."
"I would like to thank you, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, as rapporteur, for taking up this issue in a detailed own-initiative report and clearly identifying the key problems."
"The European Union's fisheries agreements are an important factor both for supply and employment, especially in the regions which depend on fishing."
"Simply rejecting a report, as has just been demanded, cannot be our objective, for we must examine these issues seriously despite all the potential contradictions."
"Nor must we lose sight of the fact that we have exploited our own waters to the point where the stocks are exhausted."
"We need only think of the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"It would be fatal - as one of the previous speakers has said - simply to export these problems elsewhere."
"I call for a sustainable approach to the fisheries agreements and a balanced distribution of use, but naturally also for an economically profitable approach, for I do not want to lose sight of reality. However, long-term public subsidies conflict with this goal."
"It is absurd to justify the irresponsible exploitation of stocks in other waters with arguments based on fleet reductions and market supply in the European Union."
"Ultimately, our key goal must be to safeguard the sustainability of resources, both in European and foreign waters."
"However, in this context, we must genuinely accept responsibility, rather than simply seeking plaudits in the short term."
"This applies especially to international waters."
"Here, prompt action is needed to combat illegal fishing effectively."
"Controls alone are not sufficient."
"What we need is harmonisation of sanctions at international level."
"This can only take place jointly and in a global framework."
"The sanctions must not simply be tokenist."
"I know that the international community's mills - and our mills too - grind slowly, but we will continue to give them grist, and we will keep the wheels turning."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place once the afternoon debates have been concluded."
"The next item is a statement by the Commission on the effect of low-frequency active sonar on marine life."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Commission I should first like to thank the House for the invitation to make a statement on this matter."
"The Commission welcomes this opportunity to emphasise once again how much importance the Community attaches to conservation of the marine environment and the protection of its biodiversity."
"This importance has already been highlighted by Parliament and by the Council in the Sixth Community Environment Programme."
"One of the aims of this programme is to ensure that no further biodiversity is lost after 2010."
"The protection and conservation of wild flora and fauna are also two of the objectives defined in the communication from the European Commission on a strategy for the protection and conservation of the marine environment."
"Cetaceans are a sensitive part of marine life."
"They are certainly at risk from a range of human activity, but it is not always easy to establish a link between such activity and the condition of these animals."
"The Commission is keeping abreast of the current debate on the possible effects of the use of low frequency active sonar on some species of cetaceans."
"It may well be that intense tones transmitted at low frequency do disturb these creatures."
"More detailed research is however called for to establish just how seriously the transmissions affect them."
"Nonetheless, the current uncertainty as to the effects of these transmissions cannot be used as an excuse to avoid taking steps to deal with the matter."
"The Commission is of the opinion that extreme caution should be exercised in the use of this technology in view of the possible repercussions for the marine environment."
"Ideally, the potential repercussions should be assessed in advance."
"Allow me to remind you that cetaceans are protected under Directive 92/43, the Habitats Directive."
"One of the obligations it places on Member States is that the latter should take the necessary measures to prevent these species being disturbed."
"For these reasons and following recent events in the Canary Islands, at the Habitats Committee meeting on 20 November the Commission requested the national authorities of Member States where similar incidents may have taken place to provide further details on the subject."
"We shall now send the Member States a reminder to ensure they respond to our request."
"All the information received further to this appeal will be forwarded to the House by the Commission."
"Furthermore, the Commission is to ask independent scientific bodies such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea to assess the current situation together with available knowledge on the subject."
"It is hoped that more information on the possible consequences of the use of low frequency active sonar for the marine environment can be obtained."
"Only when sound scientific information is available will it be possible to decide on the nature of the measures needed to supplement those already in place."
"Madam President, I wish to thank the Council of Presidents for having included this important issue in the debate, and I would also like to thank the Commissioner."
"It has to be said right at the start that it is completely justified to try and develop a defence system to monitor submarines that use new technology, which are difficult to see using conventional passive radar."
"It is obvious that submarines that cannot be detected with radar are only used by those with hostile intentions."
"We therefore have to keep abreast of developments."
"This is a question, however, of what sort of technology we choose and what its price is in ecological terms."
"The low frequency active radar system developed by NATO known as LFAS can cause whales to stray onto shores and can damage their internal organs, leading to death."
"High decibel and low frequency noise produced by radar can carry for thousands of kilometres in the sea."
"There have been whale deaths in the areas where the United States of America has tested the system."
"In March 2000, 17 whales were beached on the shores of the Bahamas Islands and eight of them died whilst the navy's radar system was being tested in the sea."
"Autopsies carried out on the dead whales revealed haematomas in the brain and inner ear cause by extremely loud noise."
"The US navy itself stated in its report on the whale deaths in the Bahamas that LFAS had been the most likely cause of death."
"In September 2002 in the Canary Islands, and so within the EU area, whale deaths occurred on a scale hardly seen for 20 years, when 15 whales of different species died from haematomas."
"NATO was conducting military manoeuvres in the area involving 58 warships and six submarines from different member states of the alliance."
"The LFAS equipment produces low frequency noise at 1 000 hertz and an average of 250 decibels to comb the seabed from hundreds of kilometres away."
"The effects of loud but low frequency noise on the behaviour of whales and their internal organs are wide-ranging."
"The din can cause permanent damage to the ear bones, and brain and lung haemorrhage."
"The system can muddle the communication system of whales even a long way off from the sound source as it operates on the same low frequencies that the whales themselves use."
"The noise makes it difficult for the whales to orient themselves, form herds, mate and find food."
"The link between radar and whale deaths is actually hard to prove because it is very difficult to track whales and study changes in their behaviour over a long period of time."
"The US navy has carried out an evaluation of the effects of the system on the environment, but reputable American environmental organisations regard it as flawed."
"A federal judge last November prohibited the navy from testing the system in US territorial waters until further notice with reference to the Marine Mammal Protection Act."
"Nevertheless, the navy has a permit from a national authority to test the system for a total of 432 hours in other seawaters until August this year."
"Until now the navy has agreed to test their equipment a long way off from the coast, and away too from known marine mammal breeding grounds and migratory routes."
"Researchers have said, however, that testing is not safe even in the middle of the Pacific Ocean because no one can be absolutely certain as to what the whales' routes will be."
"The system can be used to cover up to 75% of the world's seas."
"It remains totally unclear as to what effect the system would have in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas, where the radar range is from shore to shore and animals would not be able to escape the noise."
"The EU clearly has an obligation to act and ask for information on the system."
"Economic interests are clearly linked to the issue."
"Fishermen active in the EU have been concerned over the last year of the effects of radar systems on fish stocks in their fishing grounds."
"Although fish might be less prone than marine mammals to the harmful effects of the system, obviously the noise of the radar could drive them away and thus harm people's livelihoods."
"Madam President, I want to thank the Commission for its statement."
"On the basis of all I have said we should try to obtain a ban on the use of this radar system until further notice and swiftly discover its effects on marine life."
"It would be best if the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would debate the issue and draft a report on it, on the basis of the Commission's statement we have heard here today and any other data obtained from elsewhere."
"This issue is of growing concern both to the public and to this Parliament, and I think the fact that we were able to attract 60 signatures to our oral question on the subject is a clear testimony to that."
"As my colleague Mrs Korhola has said, there is more and more evidence that suggests that these highly intensive active sonars pose a very major threat to marine mammals and to fish."
"The frightening fact is that this technology exposes them to noise pollution at levels 200 billion times greater than that which we know already disturbs them, and so it is not really surprising that we are already seeing deaths from lung haemorrhages, from hearing loss and disruption of feeding, breeding and communication."
"But this technology also constitutes a breach of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention which requires states to take all measures that are necessary to prevent, reduce and control pollution in the marine environment from any source."
"The time has come, accordingly, for NATO and its members to act, and since European Union Member States make up over half of the 19 members of NATO, the EU has a special responsibility to promote action."
"For the Commission to respond to a written question of mine on 29 November 2002 simply by saying this type of technology needs to be used with caution is not good enough."
"The fact is that this type of technology cannot be used with caution when you consider that, at a hundred miles from the ship which is the source of the noise, this noise can still cause a tearing of the tissues in the air sac, for example, behind whales' and dolphins' brains."
"That is why we want to see an immediate moratorium on any deployment of LFAS by navies of any NATO country and we want a comprehensive and independent impact assessment to take place."
"We also want the US and NATO countries to prepare and make public the studies on the potentially adverse effects of LFAS which are required by law under Article 206 of the Law of the Sea."
"We had hoped too that the Council might have been prepared to make a statement on LFAS here this afternoon as well and I am disappointed that it is not here, but there is a clear role for the Commission as well and I have two specific questions for it: will it agree to conduct a study on the impact of LFAS on the marine environment, and will it ensure that the subject is raised in the transatlantic dialogue?"
"I look forward very much to your response."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (Rule 50)."
"The next item is a joint debate on the following six motions for resolutions on the humanitarian crisis in North Korea:"
"B5-0036/2003 by Mr Ford and Mr Van den Berg, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists: the humanitarian situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea;"
"B5-0039/2003 by Dr Tannock, Mr Gawronski, Mr Perry and Mrs Maij-Weggen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: the humanitarian crisis in North Korea;"
"B5-0043/2003 by Mr Watson, Mrs Malmström and Mr Andreasen, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party: famine in North Korea;"
"B5-0045/2003 by Mr Lagendijk, Mr Turmes, Mrs Ahern, Mr Gahrton, Mrs Schroedter, Mr Wuori and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: North Korea;"
"B5-0048/2003 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities: the humanitarian crisis in North Korea;"
"B5-0051/2003 by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left: the humanitarian situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."
"Madam President, as North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-Il sips his specially imported French brandy and savours his freshly cooked pizzas cooked by two Italian chefs, as he mulls over what he will say to the UN envoy, many thousands of his oppressed subjects, including babies, are literally starving to death as his disastrous Stalinist economic policies have brought the country to its knees."
"Even worse is that many of his people are rotting as political prisoners in re-education camps where they are being tortured and beaten."
"The country outrageously styles itself 'the Democratic People's Republic of Korea', and yet the people have never been consulted, as Mr Kim inherited his mandate from his late dictator father."
"Not only has that country, which is a brutal, secretive, communist dictatorship, repeatedly violated international agreements such as the 1994 one to end its bomb-making uranium enrichment programme, it has also in the past violated every standard of civilised behaviour, from kidnapping Japanese civilians - which the government justified, almost unbelievably, on the grounds of needing language instructors for its spies - to engaging in political assassinations such as blowing up the South Korean cabinet in Rangoon a few years ago."
"It was also responsible for blowing up a South Korean airliner."
"More recently - and this is the reason for my motion for resolution - it has starved many thousands of its people to death due to its disastrous isolationist economic policies and the fact that it has chosen to maintain one million men under arms with an immoral diversion of food and resources to the military, irrespective of the deprivation suffered by its civilian population."
"It remains a failing and rogue state and a very dangerous one at that."
"It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it technically remains at war."
"Consequently, the EU must tread carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid to its long-suffering people."
"Nevertheless, aid donors must still insist on verification procedures to ensure that the food gets through to those it is intended for and is not given to the army or, worse still, resold to raise cash for more armaments or luxuries for its political and military elite."
"North Korea is the biggest humanitarian scandal of our time."
"While the 'Great Leader' lives in the lap of luxury he is literally allowing his own people to die."
"More than two million people are said to have starved to death over the past few years and more than 13 million are suffering from malnutrition."
"Communist misrule has ensured that the malnourished people are left out in the cold and are deprived of proper medical care."
"In this workers' paradise, about 200 000 people are kept imprisoned in re-education camps for political reasons."
"What is more, China is systematically returning North Korean political refugees, knowing full well that inhumane punishment awaits the returnees."
"An appropriate response from the world community is seriously hindered by the nuclear game with which Kim Jong-Il is challenging the world."
"It is not clear whether it is possible to talk to Kim in a reasonable way."
"America's attitude towards North Korea is a model of caution compared with her stance towards Iraq."
"As far as this nuclear threat is concerned, the European Union must fall in line with the United States - insofar as she does have a line."
"Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of an unpredictable dictator are a permanent threat to world peace, and this cannot therefore be tolerated."
"We must also focus on humanitarian aid in order to prevent human suffering from taking on even greater proportions."
"It is a good thing that the Commission is intending to earmark another EUR 9.5 million for women and children over and above the 50 million already spent."
"The question is whether this is enough."
"I assume the Commission is willing to do more should it be necessary."
"I would appreciate confirmation of this from the Commission."
"North Korea has gone from bad to worse as a result of her self-imposed isolation."
"We must look for ways of breaking through this and putting an end to the biggest humanitarian scandal of our time."
"Madam President, there is currently a serious humanitarian crisis in North Korea."
"In bitter winter conditions, the combination of few or no energy sources and lack of food is crippling."
"So the Verts/ALE Group welcomes the Commission's decision to provide EUR 9.5 million in food aid to North Korea."
"But there is a need to reconsider fundamentally our approach to ensuring energy supplies."
"The Korean Energy Development Organisation, KEDO, was unsuited to meeting the country's needs and infrastructure, and this situation cannot be allowed to continue."
"We condemned it and the European Union's approach to the energy crisis needs to be completely overhauled."
"I was pleased to hear Commissioner Patten declare that the European Union will have to develop an alternative energy programme for North Korea."
"We welcome the Commission's position on this, and we look forward to the development of a suitable programme."
"We need to look again at our policy of cooperation with North Korea in terms of a poverty alleviation programme to offset the effects of introducing a market economy, democratic reforms and respect for human rights, and official diplomatic recognition for North Korea by other states as well as the European Union."
"This would open up opportunities for North Korea to access funds from the IMF, the Asian Development Bank and others."
"The key, as Mr Swoboda said earlier in this debate, is to continue to talk, to continue with the negotiations and, above all, to work for a peaceful solution to this crisis."
"Madam President, this afternoon we will be descending into one of the last dark dungeons of the Cold War."
"On the 38th parallel there hangs an 'iron curtain' that is more hermetically sealed than the Berlin Wall ever was."
"Behind it, after the 'Great Leader' Kim Il-Sung, the 'Dear Leader' Kim Jong-Il is now playing the depressing game of the 'Great Lie'."
"In what is virtually dynastic succession, father and son have been sacrificing the people of North Korea to their megalomaniac self-glorification and personal dictatorship for more than half a century."
"Pyongyang has long tried to deny this awful reality."
"The testimony of those North Koreans who have managed to escape has been rejected as lies."
"Satellite pictures provide incontrovertible evidence, however: there really are slave camps for political prisoners."
"Our eyes have been opened very late to the acute danger that the North Korean regime poses - to the international community as well."
"The immediate cause of this was Pyongyang's recent unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty."
"The possible development of North Korean nuclear weapons and the clandestine sale of these weapons, including missile systems, now requires a quick response from the international community."
"I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to make a case for a regional diplomatic approach to the North Korean crisis."
"Incidentally, the international community should emphatically reject Pyongyang's diktat - a non-aggression pact with the USA enforced by the threat of nuclear weapons - out of compassion for the citizens of North Korea behind Kim's 'iron curtain' who have to spend their lives in conditions that are almost impossible to imagine, and also for the sake of their safety."
"Madam President, various breaches of human rights in North Korea have been mentioned here, breaches which offend our moral sense and our concept of civilisation."
"After visiting that country three times, however, I believe the most aberrant, most monstrous kind of breach of human rights is the fact that, if today North Korea held free, democratic elections as we do, the current leader, Kim Jong-Il, would win them."
"This shows, first, the terrible ability of the North Korean leadership to keep their country isolated from any external interference - and in today's globalised world that is not easy - and, secondly, the degree of capitulation and humiliation to which the population has been reduced."
"The violations and violence not only affect their bodies, through hunger and the concentration camps, but also their minds, for they have been brainwashed and left unable to think, as in the Soviet gulags; the North Koreans have been reduced to sheep that follow their leader blindly."
"This barbarous and, at the same time, grotesque regime must be contained."
"I am one of those that believe that the United States' policy is right, especially in the last few days: they have moderated their demands, they have avoided a crisis with South Korea and they have made overtures to China, a key country for resolving the crisis in the area."
"The contribution that Europe can make, that we can make, is only minor on the political front, I am sorry to say."
"We can and must do more on a humanitarian level: we must send aid, certainly, but we must also make sure (as has been said so many times) that it gets into the right hands, the hands of those that need it."
"Despite all the declarations and personal statements given on this, I am not at all certain that there is any guarantee of this today."
"I would very much like there to be, and I would very much like the Commission to be able to give us this assurance."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place once the afternoon debates have been concluded."
"The next item is a joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions on Equatorial Guinea:"
"B5-0038/2003 by Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco, Mrs Carlotti, Mr Martínez Martínez, Mr Obiols i Germà and Mr Carnero González, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists: presidential elections and lack of respect for human rights in Equatorial Guinea;"
"B5-0040/2003 by Mrs Ferrer and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: Equatorial Guinea;"
"B5-0044/2003 by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte, Mr Sánchez García and Mr Gasòliba i Böhm, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party: the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea;"
"B5-0046/2003 by Mr Rod, Mrs Isler Béguin and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: presidential elections in Equatorial Guinea;"
"B5-0050/2003 by Mr Marset Campos and Mrs González Álvarez, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left: presidential elections and lack of respect for human rights in Equatorial Guinea."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we are very concerned about the human rights situation and also by the slow progress of democracy in Equatorial Guinea."
"The trial held last spring, which ended in the conviction of 68 people, showed that there are no legal guarantees that can be backed up internationally, as was clear in the declaration made by this House in June."
"The trial broke off what was slow but positive progress, which is reprehensible."
"However, it should not be forgotten that it is not always the best solution to shut off channels of communication with a country that is in deficit when it comes to respecting human rights."
"We think that we should maintain a critical dialogue, seeking to make gradual progress."
"We need to strongly condemn abuses, but we should also acknowledge steps forward when they are made, for example, the freeing of 120 people who had been in prison for some time on 12 October in honour of the 34th anniversary of the independence of Guinea."
"I am of course aware that this is not enough, but we must recognise that it took place."
"With regard to the slow pace of the democratisation process, it should be criticised that four opposition candidates had to withdraw on the day of the presidential elections due to irregularities in the votes, even though the electoral campaign had run without any serious incidents."
"Of course we cannot forget that members of significant parties are being detained or are in exile, such as Severo Moto, the president of the banned Progress Party, who is in exile in Madrid."
"We trust that the next elections, the legislative elections planned in a few months' time, will be held with more guarantees and freedom."
"Therefore, in the Resolution being debated today the Guinean Government should be invited to take measures to give credibility to its will to make the system democratic, establishing a serious dialogue with absolutely all of the political movements."
"At the same time, the political movements should avoid making speeches like those made by the four candidates who withdrew, which could lead to violence."
"We need to criticise what there is to criticise, but help progress to continue."
"We cannot therefore support this Resolution, because it is simply a head-on attack on the Guinean Government, which could have counterproductive results and not benefit the people of Guinea or lead towards a democratisation process."
"The abuse of power at the expense of the people is the order of the day in Africa."
"When a president is elected with 97% of the votes, the elections are unsound."
"The so-called struggle at the ballot box, which resulted in President Obiang holding on to power, was a farce."
"This is exactly what we would expect from a government that for years has failed to comply with international recommendations to introduce a democratic order."
"The United Nations and European Union missions to observe the elections were not welcome."
"The secretary-general of the largest opposition party was arrested."
"The opposition leaders were subjected to unfair trials in the spring."
"Not surprisingly, all the other candidates apart from the sitting president withdrew from the elections."
"Equatorial Guinea is the umpteenth poverty-stricken African country in which someone is clinging on to power, enriching himself, violating human rights and completely ignoring the international community."
"The European Union must engage vigorously in the political dialogue."
"Any pledge under the ninth European Development Fund is completely out of the question unless the situation improves dramatically."
"Even if this situation does improve, in the context of democratisation or capacity building, this regime will claim that this gives them legitimacy."
"This political abuse cannot be tolerated."
"The opposition leaders and all other political prisoners must be released immediately."
"The elections must be declared null and void, and new ones therefore need to be organised."
"There must be an international investigation into the way the oil companies operate and the president's role in them."
"Democratisation is a necessary precondition for effectively counteracting poverty."
"Poverty in African countries is not only caused by globalisation, restricted access to markets or inadequate aid."
"Many African countries mess things up themselves."
"Equatorial Guinea is one of those countries in which development is stagnating because of the abuse of power."
"Those poor people."
"Madam President, Equatorial Guinea has unfortunately been a negative example of an African country for decades, but sadly it is not an isolated case."
"We must recognise quite clearly that we have a very substantial responsibility here."
"Of course, there are abuses of power, corruption, and dictatorial violations of any attempt at the rule of law in that country."
"That is absolutely correct and we must vigorously condemn them."
"Yet on the other hand, we ourselves have a responsibility, because this country - like many other African countries - has become a pawn in the international competition for resources, and unfortunately, this involves European interests as well."
"The major role played by the oil companies in Equatorial Guinea, but also the diamond trade - and illegal trades such as human trafficking play a part there too - unfortunately destabilise the country as well."
"Ethnic and political conflicts - although these are generally rooted in ethnic conflicts - are exploited in a cynical policy designed to safeguard resource supplies."
"For this reason, I think that paragraph 7 of the resolution is extremely important, for we have a responsibility here, and we also have opportunities to exert influence."
"We genuinely need the proposed report on the oil companies' role."
"I do not endorse the call for an outright boycott and the cessation of all financial assistance."
"As a rule, such measures impact not on the dictators, but - if they have any impact at all - on the people of this already benighted country."
"I completely agree with my Spanish colleague on this point."
"I believe that we must vigorously condemn the abuse of power."
"Nonetheless, we must also seek dialogue with President Obiang in order to achieve a situation in which the opposition can gradually resume its work and the exiled politicians can return home. We must also work to ensure that the planned conference on reforming the judicial system can take place."
"Unless we start with very basic institution-building in this country - as we sought to do in European countries, as in Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, where conditions are far more straightforward and stable - we will never achieve any success."
"We cannot apply European standards overnight in Equatorial Guinea; this will take decades of development, which have yet to commence."
"This is why, as I have already said, the next steps are dialogue with President Obiang, supporting the conference on the judicial system, the release of the opposition, legalising opposition parties, and fresh elections with international supervision. These are the next steps we must take, but it would be disastrous if we now tried to run before we could walk."
"I therefore recommend a measured approach."
"Simply imposing sanctions is not a solution."
"Above all, we should not point the finger at others; we should accept our own responsibility first, and that means examining the role played by our oil companies in what is sadly a very dirty game."
"Madam President, my colleague and friend Mr Ojeda used the term 'in deficit' when referring to the Government of Equatorial Guinea in terms of democracy and human rights."
"In terms that are sure to please Commissioner Solbes, who deals with economic and monetary affairs, the deficit is such that the Government of Guinea is simply bankrupt in this respect."
"Not only is it bankrupt, but it is also continually failing to comply with each and every one of the commitments made, first of all to the European Union and, in general, to the international community in terms of moving towards the rule of law."
"The recent elections were a clear example of the fact that Mr Obiang does not want democracy or human rights in his country."
"An even more dramatic example was the trial of the opposition which resulted not only in political prisoners but also in deaths due to torture at Black Beach prison, which we have condemned in this House on several occasions."
"The European Union has a responsibility towards democracy and human rights in Equatorial Guinea and some of its Member States have a twofold responsibility."
"Two of them are currently sitting on the Security Council: France and Spain."
"I therefore feel that it is essential that the European Union - why not at the suggestion of those countries? - approve a joint action to commit itself to democracy and human rights, and also that it talk to another country that is extraordinarily interested in Guinea, not due to these matters, but because of oil, that is the United States."
"It is therefore highly important that we retain the paragraph of the Resolution regarding a code of conduct for the oil companies, as we cannot allow them to act without one."
"Oil, the great resource that is draining the citizens of Equatorial Guinea, is now the crux of the matter and the source of the strength of President Obiang Nguema's regime."
"The European Union therefore needs to act firmly; let us adopt this common action, let us talk with the United States, let us make an agreement with Washington and let us also call on the oil companies to fulfil their obligations, quite simply to comply with their obligations towards people."
"The Commission needs to assess what is happening with oil in Equatorial Guinea."
"I would even ask for more, I would ask the Commission to consider reopening its office in Malabo."
"The United States are going to reopen their Embassy."
"Why?"
"For oil."
"Let us reopen our office."
"Why?"
"For human rights and democracy."
"The European Socialists therefore entirely support this Resolution, because it will be well received by those who, like Celestino Bacale, the CPDS presidential candidate, who brought thousands of supporters together at campaign meetings, will be able to say: the European Union is with us, like President Cox, who in his time spoke clearly and firmly in favour of democracy and human rights in Guinea."
"Thank you, Commissioner Solbes Mira."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place once the afternoon debates have been concluded."
"The next item is a joint debate on the following five motions for resolutions on Chechnya:"
"B5-0037/2003 by Mr Paasilinna and Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists: non-extension of the OSCE mandate in Chechnya;"
"B5-0041/2003 by Mr Suominen, Mr Oostlander and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats: non-extension of the OSCE mandate in Chechnya;"
"B5-0042/2003 by Mrs Malmström, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party: Chechnya;"
"B5-0047/2003 by Mr Staes, Mr Wuori, Mrs Schroedter, Mr Cohn-Bendit, Mrs Isler Béguin and Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: the situation in Chechnya;"
"B5-0049/2003 by Mrs Ainardi and Mr Vinci, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left: the situation in Chechnya."
"Madam President, unfortunately, the situation in Chechnya really has not improved, despite the efforts to persuade Russia to adopt a rational course."
"We have repeatedly stressed that the fight against terrorism is an entirely justified, indeed necessary, fight."
"However, in the case of Chechnya - and this applies to similar situations in the context of Iraq and other regions as well - we have always stressed that bombs, military aggression and military measures are unsuitable as a means of resolving the issue of terrorism."
"For this reason, we also need to make it very clear to Russia that we are profoundly disappointed that Russia - which is and should be a partner of the European Union - has failed to pursue a rational policy aimed at combating the causes of terrorism as well as terrorism itself."
"We are deeply disappointed that people are being forced to return to this unsafe country and that even the expellees are being forcibly repatriated."
"We believe that every option must be exhausted to achieve a peaceful solution here."
"One such option could be the referendum if it takes place under objective conditions."
"The people themselves should have a chance to express their views, and I believe that it would do Putin's and indeed Russia's reputation good if Russia could revert to, or basically establish for the first time, a rational and peaceful policy on Chechnya."
"Reports from Chechnya are still extremely shocking to us all."
"Russian troops ride roughshod over the people in their fight against the rebel troops of the Republic of Chechnya."
"There are people there living in extraordinarily wretched conditions, both within Chechnya and outside."
"Those who have managed to flee are then forced to return to an area that is really impossible to live in."
"Crimes by the military are inadequately prosecuted, and by bringing this resolution we want to protest against this."
"Grozny is still extremely unsafe, which indicates that the fight against the so-called rebels in Chechnya has not yet come to an end by a long chalk."
"Buildings are being blown up and the people the European Parliament delegation went there to open discussions with are all lying in hospital."
"In that context, the best the Russians could do was to postpone the visit of the European Parliament delegation to Chechnya."
"The official reason for this is perhaps odd, but we hear through diplomatic channels that this is on account of the fact that security there absolutely cannot be guaranteed, something which the Russian state naturally views as a scandal, which it is."
"In that context the OSCE is regarded as a busybody whose mandate should rather not be renewed."
"We also protest against that."
"We definitely want the OSCE's mandate to continue, as the OSCE is absolutely necessary for the provision of aid and for political initiatives later on when observing a possible referendum."
"Another busybody, Mr Erkel, who was the head of Médecins sans Frontières in Dagestan, the territory bordering on Chechnya, has been kidnapped."
"We do not know by whom."
"No ransom has been demanded."
"It is therefore entirely possible that this man has been captured by the authorities themselves, as has happened in the past."
"I have asked the Commission and the Council about this."
"Fellow MEPs in various other parties have highlighted this and are completely behind it."
"We want the Commission to make efforts to find out what has happened to Mr Erkel and to see whether it would be possible to obtain his release."
"Anyway, the European Union must do whatever is possible from a political and community point of view, and the resolution bears witness to this."
"A white list for Chechen leaders, as has been proposed in an amendment, seems to us to be counterproductive, however."
"It is restrictive, and our group is inclined to think that the Danish government pursued a very good policy on this point. They did not need a white list."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is, I believe, the third or fourth debate on Chechnya in one year."
"It shows how determined Parliament is not to remain silent about this war."
"According to reports, our Russian friends are not impressed by this type of debate and are also not impressed by the resolutions we are adopting here."
"I have always been taught that you must always tell your friends the truth, that you must not withhold anything."
"If friends keep quiet in front of each other, they are doing the wrong thing."
"I would like to send this message to our Russian friends."
"The situation in Chechnya is bad. Let us acknowledge that."
"We all know that, and the Russians must also have the courage to acknowledge it."
"Various fellow MEPs have already pointed this out."
"People disappear, people are tortured and relief workers are kidnapped."
"There is a real guerrilla war in progress."
"A dirty war on the part of the Russians, but also on the part of the Chechen rebels."
"The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is terrible."
"Yet the Russians are now trying to force these people to return to Chechnya."
"We all know that this is not a good thing to do during the winter months and is in fact impossible."
"The OSCE is being removed from Chechnya."
"The Russians evidently do not want any busybodies there."
"Just as they are actually preventing us from going there with a delegation."
"They use what I believe to be specious arguments for this in a letter to our President."
"The truth is that they do not have the situation in Chechnya under control at the moment and they cannot guarantee our safety."
"We all know that our Russian colleagues are very dissatisfied with the resolutions we are adopting."
"Nevertheless, the present resolution is very balanced."
"It is a resolution that shows that we in Parliament want a solution and that we really want to make a positive contribution to this."
"I therefore call on our Russian colleagues to resume the dialogue with our Parliament in order to engage with us in an honest and proper way and to ensure that we can ultimately bring the two parties together with a view to reaching a political solution."
"Madam President, please allow me, at the start of today's debate, to express my sympathy for the relatives of the victims of the terrorist attack on Grozny."
"These crimes, which show utter contempt for human life, can never be justified and the perpetrators must be brought to justice."
"Nonetheless, I appeal to those affected and the Russian Government not to retaliate with similar means but to seek a peaceful solution."
"This attack on the civil administration clearly shows that terrorists are not interested in ending the conflict. On the contrary, their aim is the permanent destabilisation of the region."
"I welcome the plan to hold a referendum in Chechnya in March. This is a hopeful sign towards democracy and self-determination."
"Wanting to encourage the refugees in Ingushetia to return home to Chechnya is the right approach, but it is fundamentally wrong to subject them to pressure."
"First, the conditions for their return must be put in place."
"People must feel safe, and they need housing, electricity and food."
"The schools must be open and healthcare must be secure."
"The European Union is willing to get involved here and provide humanitarian aid."
"The Russian Government's decision not to extend the OSCE's mandate is therefore even more incomprehensible."
"What possible political objection can there be to monitoring respect for human rights, providing aid for refugees, and supporting conflict transformation?"
"None, in my view, unless it is seen as intervention in a country's internal affairs rather than as an offer of help in a very difficult situation."
"Or perhaps the Russian Government thinks that accepting help would be a sign of weakness, which it cannot afford for political reasons."
"In my view, this would be a complete misapprehension, but it can be rectified."
"As a member of the European Parliament's ad hoc delegation on Chechnya, I am disappointed about the cancellation of our delegation visit, which had been confirmed with the Duma."
"I am disappointed not only because we naturally wanted to gain our own impression of the local situation - and viewed this as a contribution towards further mutual understanding - but also because a basic political question arises here which has been answered in the negative."
"We were informed that the reason for the postponement is the fact that Ahmed Zakayev had been released from detention in a European country and Parliament had adopted a resolution on this issue."
"I accept that the Duma has a different political viewpoint from our own."
"However, I have a fundamental question. How can one hope to achieve a peaceful resolution to highly complicated issues in Chechnya through a process of negotiation with real opponents if one is incapable of accepting that a friendly institution may have a different political opinion?"
"Baroness Ludford, we must refrain, quite categorically, from comparing National Socialism and the persecution of the Jews by the National Socialists in Germany with any other situation."
"Such comparisons trivialise this monstrous, state-sanctioned violation of human rights, which was unique in history."
"Please do not make such comparisons again."
"Mr President, for the third time in history, a systematic attempt at genocide is taking place in Chechnya. It is being committed by the Russian colonial power in order to safeguard its strategic interests and resources."
"The fact that this is camouflaged as a war on terrorism - even if there is terrorism there - is simply a cynical distortion of reality."
"This is why it is important that there should be unfettered access to the war region so that the facts can be presented."
"We are currently witnessing a situation in which the Russian power is doing its utmost to ensure that this war fades from sight behind a wall of silence."
"First of all, the Commission has so far been unwilling to visit the region. We have discussed the matter time and again with Commissioner Nielson and urged him to visit the region."
"It may be that some influence has already been brought to bear behind the scenes here."
"Then we said that we as a Parliament wanted to visit the region."
"Our parliamentary delegation was then prevented from travelling to the crisis region for a variety of completely threadbare reasons. This was not just deplorable, to paraphrase the mild criticism voiced in the resolution before us."
"We are supposed to have a partnership with Russia. That means that just as our partner Russia has the right and the opportunity to travel anywhere in the EU to gather first-hand information, we expect to have the same free and unimpeded access in Russia's sphere of influence at any time, in line with all the international conventions which Russia has signed, not least in the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"The third attempt to construct a wall of silence around Chechnya was the ending of the OSCE mission and the ejection of an international organisation which had made a major contribution to ending the previous Chechen war through a negotiated settlement."
"It was, after all, under the OSCE's supervision, that President Maskhadov was elected, and, as he is the only representative to have been elected democratically to date, we cannot deny him dialogue."
"Then a German delegation led by Norbert Blüm, the well-respected former German minister, was thrown out as well."
"Mr President, I find this absolutely scandalous, and I think we should be speaking a clearer language here than we have done so far."
"We must make it clear to the Russians that this cannot continue. We want to shine light into the darkness and we want an end to this war."
"Mr President, unfortunately, we are partly responsible for the fact that atrocities and genocide are committed in other parts of the world, because the EU never seriously dares to tread on the toes of powers such as Russia, China, Iran or Israel."
"It ought to go without saying that the OSCE should have its mandate extended, that international representatives should have access to Chechnya and that those who have committed serious crimes in Chechnya should be punished."
"As a Dane, I should particularly like, however, to call for the two amendments to be adopted."
"The EU did not lift a finger when Russia imposed sanctions upon Denmark after we had, quite justifiably, refused, as the only decent thing to do, to allow Mr Zakayev to be extradited as a terrorist."
"This is the kind of situation that neither Chechen politicians nor the Member States should be able to bring about in the future."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the final report on the agenda."
"The purpose of the Community fleet's activity in non-Community waters is to supply the Community market, which has a shortfall in fishing products, and to preserve this activity in the Community's regions that depend on it, which tend, historically, to be least-favoured regions, lacking economic alternatives."
"Despite the fact that Mrs Miguélez Ramos's report is an own-initiative report, it is to be hoped that due account will be taken of it in the Commission's presentation, which we hope it will give in the next few weeks, on its communication on the international dimension of the CFP in the context of the reform of this policy."
"We hope, where this report is concerned, that the Commission communication will support launching the bases for a global analysis of the problems and needs of the European Union fleet in the territorial waters of third countries, focusing on two issues: how to achieve more coherent and more complete participation in the organisations governing international waters, in order to protect the legitimate interests of the Community; and how to secure a higher profile for the international dimension of the CFP within the Union's external policy."
"It actually makes little sense to adopt measures such as abolishing structural aid or aid for scrapping vessels in the context of the CFP reform before defining the future EU position on the Community fleet."
"Hence our support for this report, despite the measures already taken in this field by the Council."
"We have reached the end of the agenda."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 5.05 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 16 January 2003."
"Madam President, I should like to know whether a dress code has been introduced here in Parliament."
"I am thinking of something that happened yesterday during a hearing concerning the Takeover Directive."
"The Chairman of the hearing, Mr Gargani, asked the officers to ensure that all the men put jackets on out of respect for the experts present, as he put it."
"Since my assistant had no jacket or tie on, he was asked to leave the hearing and was therefore unable to do his work, a fact I am very unhappy about."
"I should like to know if there is a new practice in Parliament."
"For your information, I can point out that I am wearing neither a tie, shirt nor jacket."
"As a matter of fact, I am wearing jeans, so I would ask you: do I have permission to be here as an MEP?"
"Mr Blak, I will make inquiries into that matter."
"I note your upset with regard to your assistant."
"Regarding the balance, you are welcome to be here, but after the sitting I would be happy to recommend you a good tailor."
"The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in Iraq."
"(Members on the centre and left held up placards reading 'No to war' and 'Yes to old Europe')"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as always, it is a great honour for me to take part in a sitting of the European Parliament."
"But although it is always a pleasure, I must tell you that today is also a moment of great concern for me."
"(The President cut off the speaker.)"
"Mr Solana, I apologise for interrupting your introduction."
"Colleagues, I think you have made your point."
"I would appreciate it if you would put down your placards so that we can proceed with the debate."
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was saying that I am always happy to appear before you, but today I am doing so at a time when I am extremely worried."
"The international situation is not good and the time has come for us to hold a debate within this institution to consider how the most burning issues currently on the international scene can be viewed, and if possible resolved, from a European perspective."
"I have seen the placards that some Members of this Parliament have displayed very clearly, and I would like to say that unfortunately, or fortunately in other respects, I am talking to you from the point of view of an old Europe, because of my age, but also because of my affection for everything which is represented by the Europe of yesterday, the Europe of today and the Europe of tomorrow."
"Mr President, do not imagine that I am so old, I am going to carry on working and pestering people for a few more years."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, in the short time available to me this afternoon, if the honourable Members will allow me, I would like to discuss four or five points which I believe are essential to a global understanding of the international situation."
"The first is undoubtedly Iraq."
"But I would also like to take this opportunity to debate with you, if only very briefly, the situation in the Middle East on such an important day as this, the day after the elections in Israel."
"I also believe it would be a mistake not to say a few words about North Korea, given the dramatic situation at the moment, and I will end with a very brief comment on the operations the European Union is beginning to plan for the deployment of forces in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"I will begin with the first point: the situation in Iraq."
"As you know, ladies and gentlemen, the General Affairs Council is taking place this week and next week and they are going to be extremely important weeks in terms of finding a solution to the Iraq crisis."
"On Monday morning, for the first time, there was a concertation procedure, in accordance with Article 19 of the EU Treaty, between the Presidency, the troika and the members of the European Union sitting on the United Nations Security Council here in Brussels at ministerial level."
"This is the first time that anything of this nature has taken place; there had been many concertation meetings in New York, but there had never been a meeting here in Brussels at ministerial level of the two permanent members and the two non-permanent members of the Security Council together with the Presidency, Commissioner Patten and myself."
"I would like to say very briefly that in the meeting there was general consensus at least on four essential points which the European Union wishes to defend in all fora."
"I will run through the four points, although the honourable Members know them very well."
"Firstly: we all have an interest in Iraq getting rid of weapons of mass destruction and this is something that all Europeans should agree on."
"One of the most serious problems we are going to face during this century is unquestionably the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction."
"And we Europeans cannot ignore this problem, a serious problem for which a solution must be found."
"Therefore, to try, by every means possible, and in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council, to ensure that Baghdad gets rid of all weapons of mass destruction must be a priority for the European Union."
"The second important point is Iraq's responsibility to cooperate actively with the inspectors."
"You have good knowledge of the report which Dr Blix and Mr ElBaradei presented the other day to the Security Council, and you saw them directly, because the President of the European Parliament had the opportunity to speak with the inspection chiefs by means of a videoconference with New York."
"I also had the opportunity to speak with them subsequently, and I will therefore not insist on this since I am sure that the Presidency has informed Parliament in a clear manner."
"The third point, which I believe is essential to point out, is that we must give all the necessary support to the inspectors."
"The inspectors are the eyes and ears of the international community."
"If they are capable of convincing the Security Council of the situation, I am sure that the Security Council will also convince public opinion of the current situation in Baghdad."
"Therefore, whatever the implicit or explicit requests - and I insist, implicit or explicit - of the inspectors to the members of the Security Council, I believe Europe should help them."
"And there are essentially three types of suggestions or requests that the inspectors could make to us, firstly: that they require more resources, more resources than they currently have, more inspectors and more logistical resources; secondly: they may need more time; and thirdly: they may need more information or more intelligence."
"I believe that the international community should respond positively to these three requests from the inspectors."
"In other words, they should be offered resources, time and intelligence."
"And the fourth point, which I believe is absolutely essential and which must be defended by the Europeans, is that the whole of this process relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and more specifically the issue of Iraq, must remain within the framework of the United Nations Security Council."
"It must be carried out within the framework of the United Nations, which is the institution which must provide the legitimacy for any action in relation to this issue."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, you are well aware of the differing positions expressed by various Members of the European Union, but you also know that there are not just the opinions of the leaders in the European Union, but we also have clear and convincing surveys of the thoughts of the European citizens."
"I believe that the European citizens are clear about two things: one, that they do not want war; and the other, that they do not want dictators in the world."
"And we must make the two things compatible in the eyes of the population, of the citizens of Europe."
"How to make preventing armed conflicts and preventing the existence of dictators compatible is the great challenge facing the international community."
"Our intention as Europeans must be to ensure that Resolution 1441, which was unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council and which was approved unanimously by the Arab League two days later, should become a reality and that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime can disarm without the need for military force."
"Therefore, the countries of the European Union and all of us who serve the European Union will work with all our might, day and night, to try to prevent a conflict and to ensure that Saddam Hussein abandons weapons of mass destruction without our turning to military force."
"As you know, a debate began today in the Security Council on the basis of the report produced by the inspection chiefs 48 hours ago."
"Let us wait and see how that debate develops before taking a position on it."
"As you are aware, yesterday the President of the United States made an important speech."
"I would like to welcome an expression, a phrase, an idea, which was suggested in this speech, which is the idea, the suggestion or the commitment that the Secretary of State, Mr Colin Powell, would appear before the United Nations Security Council to explain the information and intelligence in existence in those countries which have privileged information or privileged intelligence."
"I believe and I insist that the centre of gravity of this process must continue to be the United Nations Security Council and I therefore believe it very appropriate that the information that certain countries currently have should be debated within it and that, if possible, that information should also be passed on to the inspectors."
"You also know that there will be other consultations in the coming days ?"
"(Applause)"
"? and let us hope that the inspectors can have more time to continue their work and, if possible, as I said before, to complete their mandate in accordance with Resolution 1441."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Europe is involved in this process: four Members of the European Union are on the Security Council, one candidate for membership of the European Union is on the Security Council and I am sure that the countries making up that Council will make every possible effort so that what we are saying here becomes reality in the coming days."
"Since you have information from the President of Parliament on the conversation yesterday with Dr Blix, I will not say anything about the comments made and I will move on briefly to the second point I wanted to discuss with you, ladies and gentlemen, which is the issue of the Middle East."
"Yesterday elections took place in Israel, and I believe we must learn at least three important lessons from these elections."
"Firstly, the low turn-out."
"It is surprising - or at least it surprises me - that in view of the situation we are facing in the Middle East electoral turn-out should be so low."
"It is the lowest turn-out since the 1967 elections. That is the first point to stress."
"The second point to stress is the enormous, and very significant, victory of Prime Minister Sharon."
"I would like, on behalf of all of us, to congratulate him on his victory and the victory of his party."
"Sharon's victory is like none other of his previous victories. And I believe we should say to Prime Minister Sharon, on behalf of the European Union, that at this time when he has enormous opportunities to form a coalition government, that he should form a coalition government that concentrates on resolving the problem of the war and finding permanent peace in the Middle East."
"That is the demand that with respect I believe we should make of him since it has been demonstrated that a huge number of Israelis have voted for him."
"The third issue we should highlight and on which we must draw conclusions is the heavy defeat of the Labour Party and the defeat of the Meretz Party."
"The two great parties, which have historically defended peace, which have been the centre of gravity in terms of peace, have suffered damage."
"We must analyse why this situation has come about."
"It will primarily be their job to do this."
"We have seen that the Secretary-General of the Meretz Party has tendered his resignation."
"But, in any event, from a European point of view we must maintain our policy and our policy is still the one contained in the work of the Quartet and the one contained in the road map which was approved in Washington not long ago."
"Once there is a government in Israel, we must mobilise all possible mechanisms in order to speed up a process which will lead to the road map becoming a reality and not just remaining a piece of paper."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have the obligation, as Europeans, to do everything possible to ensure that this process, which will begin following yesterday's elections, will be a process which leads to a good result, and so that the initiatives taken do not meet the same fate as previous initiatives, such as the Mitchell report or the Tenet Plan and other important reports which have been adopted but which have not been able to be implemented."
"My appeal would therefore be that we should do everything possible to ensure that these documents do not remain simply documents in the archives but that they be implemented in reality."
"Ladies and gentlemen, during the short time available to me for this first speech, I would also like to make one or two comments on North Korea."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the situation in North Korea is serious."
"It is difficult."
"As you know, the decisions taken by the North Korean Government are serious decisions and I do not believe they are decisions which should only concern the countries of the region."
"As I said at the beginning, I would insist that the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an issue which affects all of us, regardless of which part of the planet we are living in at this time."
"And we must therefore involve ourselves to some extent in the issue of North Korea."
"As you know, we hold meetings and telephone conversations practically every day with the most closely involved countries in the region: South Korea, Japan, China, Russia, the United States, and in the General Affairs Council on Monday the decision was taken, if necessary, to send a European Union mission to North Korea to present our position and also to cooperate in finding a solution to this dramatic problem which, if things carry on as they are, could lead to the existence of nuclear weapons of mass destruction in part of the Korean peninsula."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will move on to the last point I wanted to mention this afternoon, which is the situation in the Balkans and specifically the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"As you know, at the Copenhagen Summit an agreement was reached on relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance."
"We are currently working so that in March we can for the first time in history deploy a peace-keeping force in that Republic."
"The work is going well, the issues that have to be tackled with the Atlantic Alliance are making substantial progress, President Trajkovski of Macedonia has now accepted the presence of European forces from March and I believe we will be in a position to do that."
"We also want to send a clear message to the countries of the Balkans; our strategy is not to abandon the Balkans."
"Our strategy does not just consist of remaining there, but of them remaining with us, of offering the countries of the Balkans the opportunity to participate in the construction of a wider Europe, so that they may come ever closer to the European institutions and so that they may establish themselves firmly as the important countries they should be in that region."
"The deployment of military force in Macedonia would be the second peace-keeping operation taken on by Europe, since, as you know, since 1 January this year, the European police force is deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a replacement for the police force which was there under the flag of the United Nations."
"Therefore, in a relatively short space of time, we have been able to implement two peace-keeping operations in an area close to our hearts and close geographically to our capitals and to Brussels."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I do not want to expand any further during this first speech."
"I know that the honourable Members will have plenty of questions to ask me."
"But I would like to say that we are living through a relatively difficult time and I would go as far as to say that this is perhaps the most difficult time those of us in this parliamentary sitting, during this period of European parliamentary life, have had to live through."
"It is essential that we Europeans remain strong, clear and tenacious in our positions in order to do everything possible so that this crisis, which currently has so many fronts and so many manifestations, is one that can be resolved through the good will of everybody by means of agreement, dialogue and diplomacy."
"Force is the last resort."
"Diplomacy must always be our method."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, since at the last session of the Parliament in Strasbourg I was able to spend an hour with the Foreign Affairs Committee discussing North Korea under the benign stewardship of my honourable friend, the Member for Westphalia, and since last week we were able to spend two hours with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy here discussing a wide range of issues, perhaps I could now concentrate on Iraq, bearing in mind the limitations imposed on the competences of the Commission."
"I would like to make one remark at the outset: I think it is fair to say that, on the whole, since the Second World War, we have managed to create global institutions and international agreements which have helped make the world a much more prosperous and peaceful place."
"I recall that, at the time of President Clinton's second inaugural address, he was able to boast that there are today more people living under democracies than under tyrannies; we ended the last century with a world which produced as much in two or three years as we had produced in the whole of the 19th century, with incalculable consequences for the living standards of most people."
"This is not a bad record after a century which began so badly."
"Plainly, not everything has gone so well."
"Perhaps the greatest failure in trying to create a global rule-book has been our collective failure to establish an adequate regime for controlling and preventing the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons - that terrible arsenal of unimaginable horror."
"Today we face some of the consequences in three of the world's most worrying trouble spots: in Kashmir, in the Korean peninsular and in the Gulf."
"How can we deal with these problems?"
"This was a point discussed in considerable detail in the Foreign Affairs Committee last week."
"Clearly, we have to mobilise the greatest international commitment and the broadest authority for what we want to do."
"That is why it must be sensible to base our approach in dealing with these problems on the moral and legal authority of the United Nations."
"I think the whole of the European Parliament would believe that it was right to try to do that."
"Everyone knows that, for years, Saddam Hussein has defied the authority of the United Nations over his manufacture, possession and use of weapons of mass destruction."
"In addition, he has an appalling record on human rights."
"In May last year, this Parliament adopted a resolution based on a report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne which outlined the clear evidence concerning the brutal and oppressive nature of his regime."
"The report illustrated clearly how Saddam normally deals with Iraqi citizens, with his neighbours and with the international community."
"We know, for example, that he has used chemical weapons on his own people."
"After years of defying the authority of the United Nations, posing a threat to the region and to the whole world, he was given a final chance to cooperate in disarming his country by United Nations Security Council resolution 1441."
"A team of 260 staff members from 60 countries, of whom 100 are UNMOVIC inspectors, has been working in Iraq since 27 November 2002 under Dr Blix."
"Besides UNMOVIC, there is also the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team under Dr El Baradei."
"Since the resumption of IAEA inspections, 139 inspections have been carried out on 106 sites, including two presidential sites."
"I just mention, in passing, that anybody who has met the inspectors - for example, anybody who has met Dr Blix - will have been extremely impressed by the integrity and professionalism of those leading this UN operation."
"I do not want to pronounce on the debate which is being held today in the Security Council."
"As I am regularly reminded, the Commission is not a Member State."
"We do, of course, contribute to the development of the common foreign and security policy."
"We deploy the instruments within our competence to make it more effective."
"Many of the issues we are discussing go to the heart of the debate about national sovereignty, which some appear to think has been solved by the proposal to create a full-time President of the Council."
"While being clear about the limits of our role, let me however make a number of points."
"First, it must be plain to all that the authority of the United Nations should be a paramount consideration."
"The pity is that in the past we have stood by too often while the United Nations has been defied, thereby exposing ourselves to understandable charges of double standards."
"(Applause)"
"Second, Saddam Hussein must work with the UN inspectors under Dr Blix to get rid of those weapons of mass destruction for which he has not yet accounted."
"We should not forget that the issue at the heart of this crisis is how Saddam Hussein treats the rest of the world, not how the rest of the world treats Saddam Hussein."
"(Applause)"
"We should not forget the sobering comment made this week by Dr Blix. I quote: Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance, not even today, of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace."
"Third, if inspectors can disarm Saddam Hussein, that is preferable by far to any other imaginable cause of action."
"(Applause)"
"Any sensible person should want this crisis to be ended peacefully, if it is humanly possible to do so."
"It would be good for the United Nations if we could accomplish this task without casualty, collateral damage or the daunting consequence of military intervention."
"It would also be good for Iraq, for the region and, I would argue, very good for the world."
"But that does rather assume that Saddam Hussein will now work with the inspectors."
"Unfortunately, we have little evidence even now that he has yet learned that he cannot go on defying world opinion forever."
"I have always believed that the terms of the UN resolution obliged us to face two realities: first, we must make a serious effort to disarm through inspection; second, if the inspectors make it clear that this is a case of mission impossible, we cannot avoid facing up to the consequences."
"The alternative would be the sort of humiliation that would make it more difficult to assert the authority of the United Nations in future cases."
"I believe this to be an exceptionally serious debate and one which is going to have effects not just in this chamber but across Europe and the world."
"It is going to shape the sort of world we live in and pass on to our kids and I do not think it is going to be helped by trading rhetoric."
"Speaking like my youthful partner and friend, the High Representative, both of us have grown younger in these jobs."
"Speaking like him as a proud citizen of old Europe - a part of old Europe which once had a spot of trouble with one of our colonies on the other side of the Atlantic - I have occasionally reflected that if King George had not played his hand so badly, if he had not made such a mess of things, then instead of fetching up as the last Governor of Hong Kong I might have finished up as the Governor of Arkansas or Texas, and then who knows what might have happened!"
"(Laughter and Applause)"
"Speaking as a citizen of old Europe, I would say that we need to remember that it is often wiser to raise a quizzical eyebrow than to return an insult."
"We have to recognise that if we get this wrong and handle this crisis badly, the consequences could be profoundly serious and very long-lived: on the one hand, we could fatally damage the institutions of global cooperation and governance; on the other, we could make the world a much more dangerous place."
"We could weaken partnerships between friends, exacerbate relations with the Islamic world and worsen the prospects for solving crises elsewhere, for example in the Middle East."
"Our ability to work together in Europe is also clearly on the line."
"Needless to say, the Commission will discharge its responsibilities as best it can."
"While I do not believe it is helpful to go into detail about the planning we have done to cater for a serious humanitarian crisis - for example, I was discussing this last autumn in Jordan - I can assure honourable Members that we will react with the generosity for which the Parliament is ultimately responsible and with the commitment and professionalism that the Parliament would expect of us."
"I make this point very, very strongly: it will be easier for us to act, should we be required to act, if we can do so with the authority of the United Nations covering our activities."
"I think I owe it to all those who work for the European Commission in the front line in providing humanitarian assistance, and to those who work for non-governmental organisations, very often in dangerous circumstances."
"If we have to talk in the future about humanitarian activities and about what is described in the jargon as the humanitarian space, then I say strongly to this Parliament that it is far easier and far better to have UN authority covering that humanitarian space than to go ahead without it."
"(Applause)"
"Earlier I mentioned speaking in the last Parliamentary session on North Korea and I will not repeat all that I said to the Foreign Affairs Committee on that occasion, but I do recognise the seriousness of the situation in North Korea."
"I was in Pyongyang with the High Representative and the Swedish Prime Minister almost two years ago."
"I think that we played a useful role, without exaggerating what we were capable of doing."
"In my judgment, the only way this crisis can be resolved is through diplomacy, through expecting more of the DPRK, on this occasion in relation to nuclear promises in response to a greater commitment by the international community to welcome North Korea into the real world."
"Since I think it is only through diplomacy that we can actually resolve that crisis, I do think there may be a role for the European Union to play in the coming weeks."
"That, I am glad to say, was the decision reached by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday and Tuesday."
"I am sure this will not be the last occasion on which we debate soberly these difficult issues, soberly but with a passion which I hope will be sometimes constrained in its rhetorical expression by the grave and serious issues that we are discussing."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner Patten, ladies and gentlemen, if we are to decide between war and peace, we must conduct our debate with the greatest seriousness, but also with confidence in ourselves."
"The wisdom of old Europe, this continent of ours, lies in its capacity for repeated renewal, and we should be telling all those who cast doubt on our credentials, that the policy of uniting Europe is the greatest peace movement on the European continent - old, yet ever renewing itself - and that perhaps other regions in the world will find it an example of peaceful coexistence."
"What I ask, ladies and gentlemen, is that we should respect each other's points of view."
"It is certain that we will come to different conclusions on one thing or another, but each of us expresses opinions founded on his or her own convictions, and then we have to see to it that we take the right path."
"It is quite clear to us in the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats that we have to make every conceivable effort and attempt to secure world peace and peace in the Middle East - in so far as this is the nub of the problem."
"That must be our concern; it is that for which we must work, and the United Nations is the framework within which we must do it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, even if the use of force in the form of warfare may never be more than the last resort, and though our endeavours must be guided by peace, we have to deal with the facts as they are presented to us."
"What we have to deal with in Iraq is a criminal system under a dictator and tyrant alleged to have weapons of mass destruction at his disposal - and that is the problem."
"He is a mass murderer and a war criminal, who, as Commissioner Patten has mentioned, has, in particular, used chemical weapons against his own people, against the Kurds."
"In 1980, he declared war on Iran, and in 1990 he invaded Kuwait."
"I take a thoroughly critical line on the United States too, but, ladies and gentlemen, if the United States had not, at that time, led the coalition that liberated Kuwait, might this same dictator not have been able to include the other Arab countries in his expansionist designs?"
"That, too, is something we must bear in mind today."
"His regime uses its secret services to oppress his own people with violence, murder and terror."
"Ladies and gentlemen, weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein and his regime are a menace to the region as a whole and to the international community."
"Whatever the need to be frank when talking to our American friends, it has to be said that the heart of the problem is not the USA, but Saddam Hussein's criminal regime in Baghdad."
"(Applause from the centre and the right)"
"Ladies, gentlemen, friends, because Iraq, with which we find ourselves dealing in the present situation, is an Arab country, we are also saying loud and clear to the Arab and Muslim world that we want cooperation, we want partnership, and we want friendship - if at all possible - with all Arab and Muslim states, and this must be one of the key fundamentals of European Union policy."
"I wish to extend warm thanks not only to Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten, but also to all those who are working hard in these difficult days and weeks, and I wish to thank the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, for facilitating yesterday's discussion with Hans Blix, from which I learned a very great deal."
"We agreed that this discussion would be confidential - it could scarcely have taken place had we not done so - but I agree, and our group agrees, that many years have passed since 1990, in which the international community has taken no real action against Saddam Hussein, and so, if we are to achieve the peaceful solution for which we hope, we have to keep up the pressure of recent months, which he is now coming to feel."
"This has to be a window for peace; it must also mean - and it is to be hoped that it does - that our American partners and friends have not yet decided on military action against Iraq."
"We have to be open to a truly peaceful solution, which must be reached through the United Nations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must also, however, keep reminding ourselves of the logic involved."
"The discussion we had with Dr Blix yesterday touched on this."
"Logic cannot require the inspectors to travel the length and breadth of Iraq to look to see where something might be."
"It is far more logical for the Iraqi regime to do as Resolution 1441 requires and actually open the gates, so that Dr Blix and his team do not have to virtually grope their way through Iraq with a glimmering lamp."
"On the contrary, as Mr Solana has said and as is stated in Resolution 1441, what is required is genuinely active cooperation by the regime in Baghdad."
"That is what we have to insist on, ladies and gentlemen."
"We hear the President's White House spokesman saying, 'either he disarms or he will be disarmed', and so we urge Saddam Hussein to delay no longer in playing his part in this."
"Let me quote Hans Blix, who said, on one occasion, that 'it does not, to date, appear that Iraq has really accepted the demand for disarmament', and on another, that paragraph 9 of Resolution 1441 requires that cooperation be 'active'."
"Simply opening doors is not enough."
"There are questions that Hans Blix has raised, and which we also have to put before the public: what about the anthrax, which is a biological weapon?"
"What became of the 8 500 litres of it?"
"What about the VX, a toxic chemical weapon on which further development work has been done?"
"If Iraq really has disarmed as it claims to have done, it would have been right and proper and in line with international law for this to have been done under UN supervision, as prescribed by the documents and the resolutions."
"I hope that Iraq will be more cooperative over the coming days and weeks."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on Monday the Council of European Union Foreign Ministers decided, quite rightly, to call for complete disarmament, but we have to take the middle way - and everyone knows the difficult position Europeans are in."
"Our slogan cannot be 'right or wrong, always America!'"
"That is a road down which we cannot go, but neither can we go down the road of saying that, no matter what Iraq's response may be, the Iraqi dictator will go unpunished, and that we will not play our part!"
"To do so would be like saying to someone bent upon murder, 'please don't commit murder, but if you do, there will be no criminal proceedings anyway'."
"That is why we have to keep up the pressure!"
"What we demand of the US Government is that, if our American partners and friends have intelligence derived from secret service operations, this must also be laid out to public view in the Security Council, so that we may really be in full possession of the facts."
"People have to be informed, and so we are very decidedly of the opinion that Iraq must dispose of any weapons of mass destruction that it possesses."
"We want to achieve this through the United Nations, and we want to achieve it by peaceful means!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr High Representative, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I would like to say first of all that we are against war: no to war and no to dictators, and that means we must work actively within a multilateral framework to eliminate weapons of mass destruction."
"The debate we are holding at the moment with our most important ally, the United States, revolves, rather than around the fundamental issue, around counter-productive methods and - as ex-President Clinton quite rightly said ? on erratic methods."
"Why?"
"Because ten years ago, when we were in a coalition with the United States in the Kuwait war, President Bush Senior said that the Iraqi people would sooner or later topple the dictator."
"Ten years later, we must recognise that sanctions have not weakened Saddam Hussein and that we are still dealing with the same issues in relation to weapons of mass destruction."
"We must therefore say that we are in favour of a clear policy of applying pressure on the basis of the Security Council's resolutions."
"War is not inevitable."
"We must work on the basis that peace must be given a chance, but we must not be hasty and of course we must not create situations which may be entirely counter-productive."
"Hence our opposition to a preventive attack and our support for negotiations within the framework of international law."
"Mr President, a unilateral intervention, without the support of the UN, would have devastating effects throughout the Middle East, leading to more suffering, more radicalisation of Arab public opinion and would jeopardise the spirit of coalition in the fight against terrorism."
"And since Mr Solana is going to congratulate Mr Sharon on having won the elections in Israel, I would ask him to add something else, and that is to tell Mr Sharon to stop spurning Europe and to take account of our will for peace and cooperation."
"Secondly, Iraq must comply seriously with the inspection requirements and I would like to thank the President for quickly accepting my proposal to hold the videoconference."
"It was very interesting."
"Yesterday we spoke with a European citizen who was proud to be one, Dr Blix, who asked Europe to take a more active position and who also explained to us, although he did not ask for it, that if the inspections could continue for two more months, as proposed by Mohammed ElBaradei, the Egyptian expert, results could be achieved."
"I believe that that should be the basis for the European course of action."
"Our approach should be the one the President-in-Office of the Council, Minister Papandreu, was able to outline at the General Affairs Council on Monday, in the face of the self-flagellation we always indulge in, by means of an agreement with the four member countries of the Security Council and with Bulgaria, so that there may be a European position which supports the work of the inspectors and so that those inspections may continue."
"I would also like to point out that Dr Blix also told us that between 1991 and 1998 the inspectors were at work."
"If they were working for eight years, why can they not work for two more months?"
"Nobody understands this, and neither do they understand why President Bush is offering evidence now, two months later."
"Why did he not do so before?"
"We must all work as faithful allies and with regard to the statement of Defence Secretary Rumsfeld, who spoke of the old Europe, I must say that those people in our continent who have spoken of a new Europe are the ones who have caused endless disasters in our continent."
"We are not in favour of a new Europe, we are building a united Europe, and that is the aim of our political action."
"And, Mr President, please allow me to refer to an important aspect of the issue on which I would like to hear more clarifications from the representative of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission."
"It concerns the risks of humanitarian disaster, not only in Iraq but throughout the Middle East, with hundreds of thousands of displaced persons at least: who will pay for that?"
"Do we have measures to deal with it?"
"Has the UN considered this?"
"This is an important issue, as is the economic situation, and not just that of Europe."
"The price of oil is going through the roof; it is worrying that the United States' world map of priorities always coincides with the countries which have significant reserves of oil."
"This is not the way to build a future for humanity, and we must also declare ourselves clearly in favour of not having to face an economic disaster."
"Finally, Mr President, we have the right to know whether weapons of mass destruction really exist."
"To this end, we need more proof and more evidence and they will be obtained through continued work."
"The debate is not only on the timetable but on how to move forward in order to prevent war."
"And finally, Mr President, please allow me to use a quote in English from a great American, Mr Madison, who in 1792 said:"
"Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, we are on a knife-edge."
"On the one hand, the Security Council has given the inspectors the green light they wanted to continue their mission in the short term; on the other, the US-British armada in the Gulf is increasing in size by the day, much like the pressure to launch a military attack."
"In this context of great tension where the stakes are so high, any ambiguous political words or action on the war, but also, where applicable, any absence of initiative against the war, actually constitute an advantage for the most aggressive and unilateralist government the United States has ever known."
"A builder's work can be recognised from its foundations, and, in the same way, Europe's ambition on the global stage can be measured in a critical international situation."
"Mr Solana, you seem to welcome the common position of the Fifteen, or in any case of the four countries that currently sit on the Security Council."
"This does not merit such rejoicing."
"The declaration had only just been published when London and Madrid, in particular, were already stripping it of its substance by stating, respectively, that there was a flagrant violation of resolution 1441, and that the extension of the deadline granted to the inspectors should be as short as possible."
"Still others are doing their utmost to find passages in Dr Blix's report to take out of context in order to try to justify military intervention."
"Everything seems to imply that, in the eyes of some, it would not be good news but bad news if Dr Blix were to state that the inspectors had been able, overall, to access all sites easily, to the point of having carried out 300 inspections in 60 days."
"Or if Mr ElBaradei thought it were possible, and I quote 'within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme'."
"Of course there are still grey areas that absolutely must be clarified."
"We will not, however, achieve this through bombs and blood."
"We must speak frankly and on the other hand be far more aggressive in demanding that the inspectors be allowed to take the time they need to complete their work."
"Beware of playing down war!"
"Beware of gradually and insidiously accepting the unacceptable!"
"Let us therefore review everything that Europe has accepted, with little or no reaction, from Ariel Sharon in Palestine over the past two years."
"He does not deserve congratulations, Mr Solana."
"We must resolutely fight his disastrous policy, including for the Israeli people themselves."
"What did Europe have to say about George Bush's new strategic doctrine, published on 20 September last, which magnifies, and I quote, 'the unequalled strength' of the United States and emphasises, and I quote once again, their determination 'to act alone, if necessary [?] pre-emptively' in order to 'further freedom's triumph'."
"What does Europe have to say now in response to the irresponsible statements made by the Secretary-General of the White House last Sunday, implying that the United States would not rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in case of conflict in Iraq."
"Weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed and banned in Iraq, throughout the region, and all over the world."
"We must listen to public opinion."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Blair and Mr Aznar are isolated in their own countries over the question of war."
"There is an overwhelming majority against war in Germany."
"Four out of five French citizens are asking Paris to use the right to veto if necessary to try to prevent the worst from happening."
"On the other side of the Atlantic, a movement unprecedented since Vietnam is gathering momentum, based on the slogan, and how clear it is: 'No blood for oil'."
"(Mr Le Pen: It sounds like Europe in 1938!)"
"Calm down!"
"We are not interested in hearing what you think about it."
"My group would like to be able to state these values, state these requirements in Iraq itself, without the slightest leniency towards the authorities, Mr Watson, quite the opposite - nobody, furthermore, will find in my entire political history the slightest leniency towards this dictator, nobody, which is not the case of certain right-wing governments - ..."
"(Applause)"
"... without the slightest leniency towards the authorities, therefore, and within a population that has already suffered the effects of a criminal embargo for twelve years."
"That is why my group is unanimous, as are my Green and socialist fellow Members, and even Members from other parliamentary groups, in suggesting that a delegation of Members should go to Baghdad from 2 to 6 February."
"There will be more than thirty of us."
"In the same vein, my group suggests sending - and will do so - a delegation to the United States."
"In Baghdad and in New York or Washington, we want to defend an idea of Europe, Mr President, in which many progressive men and women still place their hopes."
"We must not let them down!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we run the risk today of repeating ourselves."
"Personally, I would like to make a suggestion."
"Obviously nobody here today is defending a dictator."
"Those who were communist no longer are, and are not defending any communist dictatorships."
"I also think that none of those who visited Saddam Hussein to deliver nuclear power stations to him, or, for example, like that young American who was close to the Secretary of State at the time, going by the name of Mr Rumsfeld, to deliver chemical weapons to be dropped on Iran, would now do what they did at the time."
"We should take note of this, but the problem lies elsewhere."
"The problem is the credibility of an international institution when it comes to imposing something defined intelligently by a German sociologist: 'Make law, not war'."
"The problem today is knowing whether we are capable of imposing international law."
"In this situation - as Mr Patten and Mr Solana have said - the argument is this: if Iraq does not cooperate, we shall have to force it to disarm."
"You are therefore advocating military intervention in the short or medium term."
"I believe that, within the context of international order, we must define those situations in which we should fight dictatorships and those in which we should use diplomatic means."
"I am indeed saying that I, who, often against my group or other groups, have defended and still defend military intervention in Kosovo and Afghanistan."
"I also believe it was right, once again against the majority of my group, to intervene when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, but I believe that today, Saddam Hussein has not been so weak for ten years or so."
"He is a bloodthirsty dictator who is weak and who is now incapable of attacking other countries."
"That is the distinction in the fight against dictatorships: those which act against other countries and those which do not."
"In fact, with regard to butchery, ladies and gentlemen: four million dead in Uganda, with machetes, not with weapons of mass destruction, they killed each other with machetes."
"What did we do?"
"Who intervened to stop this bloodletting?"
"Nobody!"
"Nobody intervened!"
"So, let us stay calm."
"We have seen millions of deaths, blood, and nobody was interested: there was no oil."
"We took years to intervene in Bosnia: there was no oil."
"So let us moderate our great speeches on dictatorships, and murders, and dying children."
"There is a problem, however."
"Iran now possesses missiles."
"Iran is currently equipping itself with a nuclear arsenal."
"Iran could now attack Israel, Europe, Greece and reach these regions."
"Is anyone suggesting a military foray into Iran?"
"Obviously not!"
"That would be too dangerous."
"Today, North Korea has said it wants to produce nuclear weapons."
"Is anyone suggesting military intervention?"
"Of course not!"
"That would be too dangerous."
"With the arguments developed with regard to Iraq, we are creating a programme of nuclear proliferation."
"We are telling dictators to possess weapons of mass destruction so that nobody attacks them!"
"That is the truth."
"That is why we must step back."
"Fine, the Americans and the English are surrounding Iraq, so Iraq cannot move."
"So we have time."
"We can wait a year."
"We can say that the soldiers should stay where they are."
"At the same time, however, let us show the world what we are capable of."
"Let us solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem while still threatening Saddam Hussein."
"Let us change the agenda and our priorities."
"That said, let us not fool ourselves, if the inspectors are there now, it is because the soldiers are present."
"Let us take advantage of this situation, however, to contain the problem and avoid making war."
"At the same time, let us try to obtain negotiations with the Middle East."
"I believe that Ariel Sharon will form a coalition forcing him to negotiate with the Palestinians."
"First of all he must be forced to let the Palestinians elect their own representatives so that they can negotiate with the Israelis."
"Let us change the agenda."
"Let us find a solution to the Middle East and you will see that the Arab masses will applaud us if we have to sort out Saddam Hussein."
"If initially, however, we first sort out Saddam Hussein, perhaps for oil, without having taken and carried out any initiative in the Middle East, we will not be credible and we will not create greater justice in the world."
"So, 'make law, not war', change the agenda, give us time, stay there for a year or two."
"We will disarm Saddam Hussein, but first of all let us find a solution to the Middle East."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, in our opinion, the essential question now in relation to the Iraqi crisis is how the international community should act in the face of the threat from a dictatorial regime that might or might not have - this is what is being investigated - the capacity to develop or acquire, when they only have access to scarce technical and financial resources, weapons of mass destruction, be they biological or chemical, likely to endanger regional safety and world peace, and potentially to use or supply these to others, particularly terrorists."
"The question is how to deal with an undemocratic regime that has breached and continues systematically to breach its international commitments and obligations within the United Nations. This is also a regime that has imposed all kinds of constraints on its people, demonstrating total contempt for their most basic political, economic and social rights."
"Having said that, the issue is not, as some have said, America's control of Iraq's oil resources, even if Iraq does have the world's second largest oil reserves and on top of that, its crude oil is of the very highest quality."
"This is not the issue, because if it were, we would clearly have to acknowledge that there are also European interests in this area."
"In fact, the European Union is already seeing many Iraqi oil transactions taking place in euros and, due to their volume, these transactions contribute considerably to the strength and stability of the European currency as a means of international payment."
"To take just one example, we could mention the contracts that Russian oil and gas companies have signed with Iraqi companies, which, according to the press, total 40 billion euros (not dollars)."
"Mr President, when we criticise a policy, we must come up with alternative proposals and solutions."
"We cannot simply oppose options that some consider to be warmongering; we must provide a response that is proportionate to the threats made by the other side, in the shape of someone who, in the past, has shown complete contempt for international law and who is still failing to provide guarantees that he will respect such law now and in future."
"We are the first to say that the solution to the conflict must be sought up to the last minute through peaceful and diplomatic means, but we also maintain that the international community, under the auspices of the United Nations, must maintain a firm attitude that leaves no room for doubt as to the need for the Iraqi authorities to cooperate fully and extremely soon with the UN inspectors. If they do not cooperate, they will have to face other means being used to make them do so."
"As a matter of fact, it is worth asking whether dictators who generally rule without any constraint and particularly without the democratic scrutiny of their public, only understand and respect the language of diplomacy, the language that has always been used, as Javier Solana said, when it is backed up and given credibility by the means of coercion available to it, the last resort, as he also said?"
"We support the work of the UN inspectors and hope that they are given all the means and all the information necessary to conclude their task, and I mean all information, even information already available to other countries."
"At the same time, however, we must issue a warning about the need to prevent the Iraqis from indulging in time-wasting manoeuvres in order to put off complying with the UN resolutions without good reason and to ensure that the current status quo remains in place."
"Mr President, we make a clear distinction between Iraq's totalitarian regime and its people."
"As I said, the Iraqi people have been the main victims of the oligarchy governing them and which uses them to achieve its own ends."
"This is precisely why we are calling on the international community to unite on the fundamental issue, for the transatlantic relationship to be strengthened, for the conditions to be established to ensure that we do not see the inspections blocked, constraints put on the evidence given by scientists and officials linked to Iraq's nuclear programmes and that this game of hide and seek with arsenals of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein's supporters is brought to an end."
"If we achieve this, if we unite on the fundamental issue, the conditions might then be created for beginning the process of democratisation in Iraq and for enabling its people to enjoy the advantages of peace."
"Political torment plagued Europe in the last century."
"The ideologically 'legitimised' obsession with power on the part of dictators created millions of victims."
"They certainly did not spare their own citizens."
"Is the parallel with the loathsome regime of Saddam Hussein not obvious here?"
"We should therefore be talking about 'liberation' and not 'war' in respect of Iraq."
"At least that is how Saddam's living victims see it."
"Sadly enough, they cannot count on the unanimous support of the Member States of the European Union in this regard."
"In fact the opposite is true."
"The concept of the containment of Saddam's reign of terror is evidently being fostered in the European Union despite all the extremely negative experiences with Baghdad's Ba'athists over the past 10 years."
"Today this strategy is being continued in the European desire to extend the UN inspections in Iraq."
"That Saddam is again flouting a compulsory Security Council resolution does not spoil the European illusion of Saddam's total disarmament."
"It is first and foremost the inhabitants of Mesopotamia who are the ongoing victims of the international community's failure to appreciate the true nature of Saddam's 'Republic of Fear'."
"Do the Member States of the European Union want to have this on their consciences, particularly given their own painful experiences during the last century?"
"Furthermore, Iraq under Saddam remains a permanent potential threat to the entire Middle East, not least on account of her oil reserves."
"Desperate diseases need desperate remedies, as the saying goes."
"War is awful, but the consequences of an overly tolerant attitude may in time cause more devastation."
"Recent European history should show government leaders their responsibility in this regard."
", chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"(DE) Mr President, representatives of the Commission, Mr Solana, I believe that both you, Mr Solana, and Commissioner Patten have made it clear that the European Union has achieved a number of foreign policy successes of which we should remind ourselves at the present time."
"For if you add up the number of operations the European Union has mounted in Bosnia and in Macedonia, and consider the great burden that European forces in Afghanistan are taking upon themselves, as well as the fact that the European Union devotes three times as much of its budget to overseas aid as does the United States of America, all these important factors are, in my view, things of which old Europe can be proud."
"At the same time, we should also remember that the achievements that this month has seen - the eastward and southward enlargement of the European Union and the consequent extension of the zone of stability and democracy - play a decisive part in making the world more peaceful."
"The primary motive for the enlargement of the European Union is that it will extend the stability zone."
"I think that we should make that point by incorporating this into the integrated approach."
"Hitherto, admittedly, we lacked the ability to speak with one voice when it came to issues of war and peace, a defect dating back as far as last summer."
"For if one says that he will join in whatever happens and another that he will not under any circumstances, that makes it difficult to find a middle way, but thank God we have found the essentials of one with help from the French President and from you, Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it must also be clear in this context - if we are honest with ourselves - that if we are to get our voice heard everywhere, be it in New York, Washington, or Baghdad, it will only be by attempting to work out a common position based on the knowledge that this is the only way."
"This is the road we must take, rather than following others on their celebratory processions, whether these be to Baghdad or to Washington."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my belief that we should now press on with the endeavour that the Council has - God be thanked - set in motion this week, which, for the time being at least, gave us a halfway reasonable position, with the multilateral approach being particularly valued and preferred, and with the attempt being made, within the UN framework, at finding a peaceful solution."
"It must, however, be made clear that this must be kept up to the very end."
"This is a consensus that does not just last for eight days, but one that must be made to work."
"Ladies and gentlemen, any consideration of these matters must of course have as its starting point the view of the international community - expressed, for example, in Resolution 1441 - that Iraqi disarmament must take place, and that Saddam Hussein must play an active part in it."
"Dr Blix, for example, has stated that these conditions have not been met, and so it is a good thing that the efforts of many have gained us a breathing space, time that must be used to find a peaceful solution, by which I mean the dismantling of the weapons of mass destruction - insofar as they actually exist - and the disarmament of Iraq, thus enabling the will of the international community, as expressed in international law, to prevail."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, Dr Blix's inspectors need to have the same information as is held by those who claim they were already aware that there was something there and that they would at some point present the facts to the public."
"In my view, Dr Blix should be told the facts right now, for how are we to explain to the public that a war is inevitable if we do not tell even our allies' inspectors the whole truth, thus enabling them to find what they are looking for?"
"It seems to me that something of a credibility gap is developing here, one that may cause a great deal of damage in days to come."
"It should not, however, be forgotten, when considering this issue, that Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer."
"Baroness Nicholson and I were in an Iranian camp for Iraqi refugees, and I have seen how people had to live there, having been driven from their homes and tormented by Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons."
"The depiction of Saddam Hussein as someone who represents no real danger does not strike me as credible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we should also be clear in our own minds about the real menace of weapons of mass destruction when they are in the hands of people such as Saddam Hussein, particularly if he is to emerge from this conflict as the victor, with all the resulting effects on the region's morale."
"We should also be stating what is to happen once the war is over."
"What form is political reconstruction to take?"
"For how long will Western troops have to remain there?"
"To what extent does this relate to the creation of a new order in the region as a whole, what sort of new order will that be, and at what cost?"
"To date, I have heard no answer to these questions, and I believe that if you are going to go into something, you have to think about how you are going to get out again."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, I will begin with a quotation, one which sums up like no other statement our position on the war against Iraq: 'A preventive war is an act of aggression, and cannot be described as a just war in self-defence."
"For the right to self-defence presupposes not merely the possibility of an attack, but that an attack is actually happening or is imminent."
"Warfare with the aim of averting danger would nullify international law's prohibition of force, promote political instability and, in the final analysis, shatter the foundations of the whole system of an international community of states.'"
"And elsewhere in the same statement: 'Any security strategy committing itself to preventive warfare is in defiance both of Catholic teaching and of international law.'"
"These quotations are from the statement on the Iraq conflict issued, on 20 January of this year, by the Conference of German Bishops."
"As my Christian Democrat opposite number has not made reference to the Conference of Catholic Bishops, I have to do so, and do not think that these statements require anything to be added to them."
"All the time I have known you, Mr Solana, I have regarded you as a great optimist, so when you say, as you have done today, that the political situation is bad, then the political situation is very bad."
"Donald Rumsfeld, the American minister for war, spoke of 'old Europe'."
"All of us who have spoken here today have declared that we belong to this old Europe, and that would not be cause for any further excitement on our part, had he not drawn the distinction between us and the 'new Europe' - those whose opinions are identical with Mr Rumsfeld's and who think along the same lines as he does."
"President Kwasniewski of Poland said in an interview last week, 'If it is President Bush's vision, it is mine!'"
"The Polish President is of course entitled to as narrow a field of vision as he may choose, but there is no doubt that the Polish government - like all the governments of the other candidate countries - is under an obligation to act in solidarity with the European Union, to which they want to belong."
"The candidate countries have decided of their own free will to belong to the European Union, and we wish to welcome them, but, when it comes to issues of war and peace, preventive warfare and the setting-aside of international law, we expect them to be solidly alongside us."
"Mr President, Mr Solana and Mr Kinnock, it is very good that we are having this debate."
"It is a very complex issue, and developments are taking place so quickly that the situation is changing almost from one day to the next."
"This means that any resolution becomes obsolete extremely quickly."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party really appreciates the efforts you are making, Mr Solana, towards uniting the EU around a single policy."
"The Greek Presidency shares this ambition."
"It is no easy task."
"At the same time, it is very clear that the EU is not united."
"In all facets of the Iraq issue we have heard differing views from different capital cities."
"I dare say that it has never before been so evident that the EU has failed in developing a common foreign and security policy."
"For all the fine words and the rhetoric, we stand empty-handed; which is terribly tragic."
"It might be possible to compensate for this if we start now to make attempts to reach agreement on a strategy for what we want to see happening after Saddam Hussein, whether or not there is a war."
"What should be done with Saddam Hussein?"
"What role should the EU play in the reconstruction process?"
"How could peace, freedom, democracy and human rights be guaranteed for the people of Iraq, who have suffered for so long?"
"How is the EU to help in improving the humanitarian situation, and how prepared are we to help the neighbouring countries with the refugees who are already pouring out of Iraq?"
"It goes without saying that we all hope that a war can be avoided."
"It is obvious that the inspectors, under the leadership of Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei, need more time."
"Iraq and Saddam Hussein are playing games with us; one cannot help feeling that they have something to hide."
"Iraq must pull itself together."
"It is Iraq's own responsibility, not that of the UN, to prove that there are no weapons of mass destruction in the country."
"The question of war or peace lies in Iraq's own hands."
"Our view is that the inspectors need more time, a view expressed by many others here."
"When they report to the Security Council again in a few weeks' time, it will be the UN Security Council that will take decisions on what is to happen next."
"Any decisions on a military strike, which might unfortunately be necessary, must be taken by the UN."
"A unilateral US strike would be extremely unfortunate, not only with regard to its consequences for the region, but also because it would harm transatlantic relations a very, very long way into the future."
"Lastly, I must express my regret that individual MEPs are going to Baghdad on their own initiative."
"I am convinced that they are doing so with good intentions, but this will be exploited by the Iraqi dictator to reinforce the image of disharmony in the international community."
"Those who go there cannot influence Saddam Hussein: he has not shown himself to be open to argument."
"Instead, they run the risk of becoming his hostages and getting in the way of the work of the inspectors."
"It is of course up to individuals whether or not they decide to travel, but the European Parliament is in danger of looking extremely ridiculous on the international stage."
"I would advise strongly against making this journey."
"Mr President, I too am inclined to think that we should take a little look back in time."
"Who was it really that created Saddam Hussein?"
"It was the United States, and they used him in the war against Iran."
"When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons of mass destruction against his own people, the United States was informed of the fact."
"An American attack on Iraq would not only be an attack on an individual country. It would be an attack on international law and upon the whole UN system."
"That is why it is important for Mr Solana and Mr Patten to call upon all the Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder in the EU on this matter in order to safeguard international law and to ensure a future for the UN."
"I think that Great Britain and Spain, specifically, should be called upon to show that they too join with the EU in rejecting war."
"It would not of course be a war to disarm Iraq and introduce democracy there."
"Is it at all conceivable that the United States would install a Shia Muslim government in Iraq, reminiscent of the government in neighbouring Iran?"
"Is that within the bounds of possibility?"
"Could one imagine the United States allowing the Kurds their independence?"
"Certainly, not much importance can be attached, then, to the talk of democracy."
"If the intention is to disarm Iraq, then that is the role assigned - rightly - to the weapons inspectors."
"If the desire is to disarm Iraq, it is a question of supporting the work being done by the weapons inspectors and Hans Blix."
"There is of course also the alternative of strengthening democracy in Iraq by removing the sanctions, other than those concerned with chemical and other weapons, including weapons of mass destruction. In that way, it would be possible to strengthen the Iraqi people and the democratic forces in Iraq, as well as democracy and peace for all of us."
"We also have another task."
"It is to ensure that the whole region is inspected and that we obtain a policy for disarming it: not only Iraq but also Iran and Israel."
"In conclusion, I want to state that we must urge Saddam Hussein to cooperate with the weapons inspectors so that we avoid a war."
"I believe that the way forward is through democracy, development and cooperation."
"Mr President, it is chilling to see how the preparations to invade Iraq have gathered pace, despite the extra time given to the weapons inspectors which, of course, we all welcome."
"We are seeing a situation where the most powerful country in the world has made clear its determination to wage war against Iraq, with or without United Nations backing and whether or not the weapons inspectors find any weapons of mass destruction."
"A pre-emptive attack like this would set a new international precedent that has no basis in the United Nations Charter."
"Such a war on Iraq would be immoral, unjustifiable and illegal."
"It would make the world a much more dangerous place, causing more resentment and fuelling more terrorism."
"The victims, as always, would be the innocent civilians: the hundreds of thousands of men and women and particularly the children who have already suffered years of oppression, hardship and sanctions which have put them under the complete control of Saddam Hussein."
"There is already a humanitarian crisis in Iraq and now the people are being threatened again."
"Britain has already announced the deployment of some 30,000 troops and the United States 130,000 troops which are being mobilised in readiness to attack."
"Opposition to this war is growing with every day that passes by groups of people of all ages, from all walks of life, and on 15 February 2003 there are going to be peace demonstrations right around the world."
"Those of us elected by the people in Europe can speak in this Parliament on behalf of so many of them who are saying no to war."
"I have received many letters from Wales and from other countries asking the European Parliament to do everything that it can to try and stop this war."
"Peaceful means of solving the problems have not been properly explored, let alone exhausted."
"It is tragic that if a fraction of the effort made by the United States and the United Kingdom to kindle their support for war had been put into bringing peace in the Middle East, we would live in a much safer and more peaceful world."
"Mr President, all statements - from any government or any government representative - seeking to point out differences between positions or diplomatic shortcomings are unwise."
"Diplomacy should have led us in Europe to formulate joint or, at least, homogeneous positions."
"I therefore regret that, instead of working towards a European position or, at least, mediation through a Council meeting, we have split up and established unilateral parameters and positions which do nothing to further either the cause of peace or the development of a common foreign policy, and a common foreign policy is one of the goals towards which the Convention is working."
"The United States is not the only guardian of peace and justice, nor is it the only country qualified to declare war should that prove to be necessary and unavoidable in the interests of the common good."
"The contrasting statements which have been made in recent days promote the cause of the dictator, Saddam Hussein, rather than the development of what is a problematic peace process."
"I therefore, Mr President, call upon the Council, working together with the other European institutions, to concentrate on creating a climate of more serene cooperation between the countries of the Union, so that we can unite in an agreement and address the increasingly serious problems before us every day together."
"I would like to thank Mr Berlusconi for the mediation initiative he has undertaken in the last few hours and I hope that everyone will work for peace, just as we must all strive to combat terrorism and dictatorships, even if that means declaring war."
"Mr President, no one should be in any doubt that I shall celebrate on the day that Saddam Hussein's regime of terror comes to an end."
"I do not, however, believe for one moment that a war is the correct solution to the problem."
"President Bush believes in absolute good and absolute evil. I, for my part, do not."
"I am convinced, rather, that Mr Bush's, Mr Cheney's and Mrs Condoleezza Rice's interests in the oil industry are significantly greater than their concern for the well-being of the Iraqi people."
"Nor do I entertain any doubts that a war would be a unique opportunity to test approximately 20 new weapons systems, as well as being good for the American arms industry."
"Of course Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions."
"So must Israel too, moreover, and I anxiously await the relevant demands on the part of the United States and the EU."
"All methods other than war must be tried and, if war is unavoidable, it must be backed up by the UN and supported by powerful forces in Iraq itself."
"Let us not forget that the United States was once an enthusiastic supporter of Saddam Hussein and supplied him with some of his conventional weapons."
"Iraq does not constitute any immediate threat, either to its neighbours or to the global community."
"A war, on the other hand, could have completely unpredictable consequences."
"It would fuel increased hatred towards the United States and the West and create a breeding ground for further terrorism."
"There has been no success in improving the lives of the Afghan people, and there would scarcely be any success, either, in improving the lot of the Iraqis."
"The same applies to the sanctions against Iraq, which have merely made it easier for Saddam to oppress his people."
"At a time when people's education is largely left to mullahs and the indoctrination they practise, what, I wonder, would happen if the United States were to use only 10% of the money expected to be spent on the war on providing the Arab world with, for example, free schools?"
"That would be a far-sighted and long-term solution."
"War would be a short-sighted and anything but long-term solution."
"Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, everyone seems to be for peace, saying 'No to war'."
"Can you see anyone saying 'Yes to war'?"
"Everyone - the Pope, the antipope, the communists, the fascists, everyone - is saying 'No to war'."
"What is the alternative to 'No to war', however?"
"Specifically, it is the risk of war breaking out - which you have mentioned - in 15, 20 or 30 days' time."
"What a wonderful success for the European Union: it would appear that the European Union has, at last, achieved agreement on a practical matter, if I am not mistaken, in calling for the inspectors to be given a few more weeks, for them to be given a little more time, a little more money, resources and a little more support."
"Later on, however, after 20 days, will there be a different strategy?"
"What will Europe propose?"
"The alternative to the destruction we call war - how do we, how do you see it?"
"There is an alternative, and it is not peace: peace is what we have at the moment."
"For the time being, we are not at war, as you say, as my friend, Mr Le Pen, says, for whom the value of freedom and the value of fundamental human rights do not exist."
"That is his opinion!"
"We all know the sorts of things that Mr Le Pen can say and the meanings that can be inferred."
"You can all go together: Mr Le Pen went to visit Saddam Hussein 12, 13 or 14 years ago with Mr Fini; now you can all go together."
"I can see some logic in all this."
"We radicals have presented a proposal."
"In the space of four days, we have received approval from 66 countries."
"In Italy, to date, we have received approval from 57 Members of Parliament, half of them centre-left and half of them centre-right, including the former Prime Minister, Mr Andreotti, and other important figures who support this proposal."
"What are we suggesting? What proposal are we now submitting to you too?"
"The alternative is called 'democracy', the alternative is called 'law' and 'rights', the alternative consists of enforcing written international law at last - for, although it is in force, it is not being enforced, as often happens in our country - that international law which, all things considered, has now identified a kind of subjective right to freedom and democracy belonging to the people living in this country, and by 'this country' we mean the world."
"We have the chance to choose what the European Union wants, to choose whether it wants war or not, whether it wants Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq - for, whatever Mr Watson may say, he will leave accompanied, he will essentially have safe conduct as far as his place of exile, and, moreover, I would advise Mr Watson to read the Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court, from which he will learn that, in any case, Saddam Hussein cannot be prosecuted in this situation - but what we can and must do is realise that the UN and the Security Council have a duty to act."
"It is not a question of changing the dictator but of changing the regime."
"That is what is needed in this part of the world, where the gun held to Saddam Hussein's temple, for better or worse, now gives him the chance to make a limited choice between falling in a coup currently being plotted by his closest friends, shooting himself, committing suicide in a bunker, dying in a massacre or leaving the country, as many dictators have done, and being taken to live in exile somewhere else."
"This is our proposal, the alternative to war, as I have told Mr Cohn-Bendit too, and, more specifically: 'temporary government' - in inverted commas - by the UN for two or three years until fundamental rights are established in that country - using Amartya Sen's economics and other methods; there have been temporary governments in Japan, Germany and other places - governments with the task of restoring to the Iraqi citizens and the Middle East the rights which have been taken from them through violence."
"This is our proposal, and may the others rest in eternal peace."
"I believe that we are choosing something different: living in freedom, according to the law, building a life which is worthy of being lived and consists of more than just constant dread of the terror of death."
"Mr President, I would like to join several other speakers in expressing satisfaction at the conclusions of the General Affairs Council and praising those people who have been involved in this agreement."
"But we naturally hope for more and we therefore ask that work continue in order to achieve a fundamental consensus between the European Union's current four representatives on the United Nations Security Council, in the hope that the four will act, at least, in a coordinated fashion."
"But I believe that that consensus demands at least two things: the first is not to publicise unilateral positions but to debate them with our partners and the second is to be loyal - but not copycats - to our natural allies."
"Because although it seems obvious, we must remember that in this conflict the person who is threatening world peace, failing to comply with international law and presenting us with the real risk that international terrorists may acquire chemical and bacteriological weapons is Saddam Hussein."
"And it does not take any great feat of memory to conclude that the only language the Iraqi Government understands from the international community is firmness."
"And this firmness is not credible if we say beforehand that in no event, whatever happens, can the use of force be justified, as the President of my group quite rightly said."
"This is not pacifism, it is demagoguery and irresponsibility."
"In order to genuinely work for peace, what we have to do is act decisively against violations of international law and against repeated non-compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations."
"We believe that the European Union should continue to explore all political and diplomatic avenues in order to resolve the conflict in a peaceful manner, with our allies, as is natural, and also, and in particular, with our friends, the Arab nations."
"I would remind you of the unanimous support of the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council for Resolution 1441, because this is not a religious conflict or a conflict between civilisations - incidentally, it would be good to take this opportunity to relaunch Euro-Mediterranean relations."
"In order to be credible, the European Union must be prepared to make its contribution to guaranteeing and preserving international peace and security."
"The inspectors' reports to the Security Council are conclusive in terms of the non-compliance with Resolution 1441."
"They are not being given the required assistance to carry out their work and they are not being given the evidence to show that weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated, and the simple fact that terrorist groups may acquire these weapons should be cause for alarm on the part of the international community."
"The Iraqi regime today has a new opportunity; let us pray that it takes that opportunity and that we can all prevent anything worse from happening."
"But if the Iraqi Government persists in ignoring the requirements demanded of it, not for just a month or two, but since April 1991, when Resolution 687 was adopted, democratic parliaments such as the European Parliament must demand of the executive powers that they meet their responsibilities."
"Democratic and responsible governments must not make decisions on the basis of opinion polls, which are variable, but by informing the public, engaging in political debate but defending the higher principles at stake, such as international peace and security, not the price of oil."
"And periodically, by means of democratic elections, the citizens will judge whether the governments, and also the oppositions, have made the right decisions."
"Mr President, 72% of my compatriots are against a war in Iraq."
"They have not yet seen any convincing evidence."
"They are concerned about the human suffering, the increasing South-North divide that will increase hatred amongst people and hinder democratisation and solutions in the Middle East."
"The fear is that fundamentalists of all hues will use and abuse the opportunity to determine our world agenda, which will result in the opposite of world peace, stability and justice."
"In a world in which oil prices are rising and the chance of peace is falling, it is the developing countries with no oil that are the main victims."
"The gap will grow."
"The international coalition against international terrorism is being undermined."
"Whoever tries to oust Saddam through war without convincing evidence, without a UN resolution and therefore without public opinion on their side, is undermining the international rule of law."
"Europeans are not at all convinced."
"That is why the European members of the UN Security Council must exert maximum pressure on Saddam to answer Blix's questions without making the mistake of falling into an unregulated and improper war."
"Germany, Britain, France and Spain must all listen to their people and not to the fundamentalist Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz in George Bush's circle."
"There have fortunately been many protests from the American people, and a large number of Democrats have rejected the logic of inevitable war."
"We are looking for allies among the American people, the majority of whom are not in favour of a unilateral war."
"We reject the logic of inevitable war."
"The dictator Saddam must fear the wrath of the whole world, but this must be aimed at allowing him to cooperate peacefully in finding answers and not in another Bay of Pigs or another Tonkin incident."
"And if Bush ultimately comes up with the evidence which he has been repeatedly promising us and which Blix has also urgently requested, that is not a reason for war but, on the contrary, to inspect through the UN and then to tackle and eliminate the problems."
"The power of a united Security Council must bring Saddam to his knees, and we must take time to do that."
"We have the time, Saddam does not."
"A war without convincing evidence or a UN resolution would be an admission of weakness and would really play into the hands of the Saddams of this world."
"Let us Europeans, via you, Mr Solana, the 15 Member States and the Security Council, build on our European peoples' desire for peace."
"That is true wisdom."
"Mr President, may we ask what Mr Solana and Mr Patten are doing to translate into action their professed will to avoid war, beyond reassessing the need to disarm the awful Iraqi regime, beyond formally relying on the Security Council to do so or even trusting Mr Powell to testify as an eye witness that Bin Laden has been bedding with Saddam Hussein?"
"The problem is that the decision to bomb Iraq into a morgue unfit for the dead was taken a long time ago on the Potomac."
"People all over the world have understood this and are angry and are mobilising against it."
"It is all very well to say that we must announce the role of the United Nations."
"But, may I ask, who is demeaning that role and proclaiming every day that, with or without the United Nations, war will be unleashed, probably by 6 March 2003, whatever the Security Council may or may not say?"
"Regarding solid evidence, we do not know for sure if this bloody dictator still has these awful weapons and neither does Dr Blix."
"What the United States is asking from Saddam Hussein, however, is not to prove his innocence but to provide evidence of his own guilt, that is, to put his own neck in the noose to be hanged or be bombed to smithereens."
"If this were a criminal case, it would be thrown out of any court in this world."
"So, to adapt the words of Mr Solana and Mr Patten, there is quite a lot of ambiguity, obfuscation and the undeclared will to follow the warmongering lead of Washington, hoping only that the United Nations will provide the desired fig leaf."
"This, we must say, probably for the last time, is a defining moment for Europe."
"This Union must reclaim the moral and rational initiative and, first of all, save itself from some of its leaders."
"Mr President, we all agree that Saddam Hussein is a danger to his own people."
"But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world, and making their voice heard, consider that George W. Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large."
"There is no justification for this war in my opinion or in the opinion of the protestors."
"I repeat yet again that there is no evidence whatsoever of a link between Al Qaida and Iraq."
"Washington's claims are based on Al Qaida prisoners in Guantanamo Bay."
"We all know what those prisoners are suffering."
"There was never for one moment any doubt in my mind that the United States has been angling for war in Iraq."
"The fact that 1.7 million citizens have died as a result of sanctions and bombings since the Gulf War makes one wonder how much a barrel of oil is worth."
"Make no mistake, this war is about oil."
"We are told by the United States that the oil reserves after the war will be used exclusively for Iraqi reconstruction."
"I say to Mr Bush: pull my other leg!"
"Just look at the United States' contributions to the reconstruction of Afghanistan."
"The European Union is footing that particular bill."
"Society in Afghanistan remains as fractured as ever."
"In my view, the United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security."
"Without the agreement of the UN Security Council, this war would be a breach of international law, would have no legitimacy and would be wholly immoral."
"More than 80% of European people are against war in Iraq."
"Yet they are ignored by American and British leaders who are busy sending troops in preparation for the war."
"So much for democracy."
"I believe that, after Iraq, the Americans will move on to Iran and the other elements of the axis of evil."
"Truly a war of civilisations."
"May God helps us all!"
"Mr President, I belong to that generation of Europeans which has always, not least because of the period of history we have lived through, seen the United States as our champion of democracy and freedom, the country which freed Italy and Europe from Nazi tyranny, the country which, for decades, led the Western democracies in the fight against the threats posed by the Soviet Union."
"I am sad and concerned to see the United States now taking a path which is likely to lose it the moral leadership of the world, although it will, of course, still have political and military leadership."
"Indeed, we have shifted from a firm, rational position in the face of the dangers of Arab and Islamic terrorism and the terrorism of Iraq itself to a situation of unilateral decisions, and we must realise that we cannot accept this situation without undoing decades of progress made in international law."
"What will we do if, in the future, a country such as China or Russia decides it has the right to invade one of its neighbours?"
"Is Iraq really the most dangerous threat or is Korea not evidence of the existence of greater threats?"
"That is why, while confirming our great affection and esteem for the United States, we must now tell it, as its true allies and friends, that it has taken the wrong road and must stop and listen to the international community."
"Furthermore, my regret is increased by the state of Europe, at the sight of a Europe divided as never before, in which the genuine problems - the lack of a political, strategic vision of the world - are starkly revealed and in which the legitimate, rightful diversities of the European countries are made worthless by their inability to agree on joint measures."
"I welcome the Franco-German cooperation, although I do not support all the positions."
"I welcome it because it has always been the driving force of Europe and can continue to be so in the future, but, if we do not want it to be restricted to what is quite simply irrelevant rhetoric, as has been the case thus far, it must be channelled into a position which will result in the creation of a European defence policy in the future, for only when Europe speaks with one voice will it become as influential as the United States."
"Mr President, in the light of the UN inspectors' report to the UN Security Council on Monday, and ten years of Iraq's deception, evasion and non-compliance with Security Council resolutions, it should be clear to everybody here that we are facing a very grave situation in the Gulf."
"The starting point in this whole debate must be that we are representatives of democratic nations."
"Saddam Hussein is a dictator who has no respect for democracy, for the rule of law or for the demands of the United Nations itself."
"As democrats we have a responsibility to explain fully the reasons why it may be necessary to take action in order to uphold the will of the international community, which is that Saddam Hussein should unconditionally disarm."
"This issue is not simply about the work of UN inspectors; rather, it is about disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction."
"These weapons were there when the inspectors had to leave in 1999 - where are they now?"
"There has to date been no evidence of disarmament; and let us never forget: the burden of proof here must be with Saddam."
"In my view, the British Prime Minister has a special responsibility to explain clearly the reasons why we must confront the threat from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction."
"Sadly I must say that, to date, his own government has not been as united and clear on this issue as I feel we in the United Kingdom are entitled to expect."
"We are disappointed at Mr Blair's inability to sufficiently persuade public opinion in the United Kingdom of the need to be prepared to take action, in the face of what is very clearly a real threat to the security of our people."
"In the United Kingdom we have seen during the course of the last fortnight or so very clear instances of the existence of that real threat."
"A collective failure to confront the gravity of the situation with unity and with determination only gives Saddam Hussein succour; not to be prepared to take action - if he continues to obstruct and to lie - would be an open invitation to any rogue state to do anything it likes and still not face serious consequences."
"It would also leave the United States itself, and the United Nations particularly, weak and impotent."
"Clearly, should the situation not improve in the weeks ahead, a second UN resolution may be required."
"That is, however, the optimum option ahead of any military engagement in the Gulf."
"Having listened to General Morillon, I take the view that the international Community still has the right to act without any such new resolution, as the powers are already vested in earlier UN resolutions."
"The position of the French and German Governments in recent days, as well as many of the contributions and demonstrations that have been made in this Chamber this afternoon, clearly show that any prospect of a common foreign and security policy is fallacious."
"I do not make any partisan political point on this, but we are surely fooling ourselves as European Parliamentarians if we believe that we are anywhere near developing a common foreign and security policy or anything like it - we clearly are not."
"In the days and weeks ahead, we need steady nerves and an effective United Nations."
"We must ensure Saddam Hussein understands that his failure to comply with the will of the international community will result in serious consequences."
"Equally, we must also ensure that public opinion in the West and elsewhere understands and appreciates why we must be prepared to take action in defence of the international interest."
"Political leaders must have the courage to face up to such threats; otherwise the credibility of the United Nations itself will be at stake and Saddam Hussein will have prevailed."
"If the western nations had sent a stronger and more unified message to Saddam Hussein from the start and maintained their resolve, then perhaps we would not have to be contemplating military intervention today."
"Mr President, there have been times in recent months when I have felt that we are conducting politics through the looking-glass, where all the norms are reversed and black has become white, so I think it is quite useful for us to get back to basics."
"First of all, the United States of America is a democratic country which twice in the last century was prepared to lay down the lives of its citizens to defend peace, freedom and democracy in Europe."
"Iraq is a country ruled by a dictatorship, where there is neither freedom nor democracy, and whose leaders murdered hundreds of thousands of its own citizens and is known to be a threat to peace and stability in the region."
"It is not the other way round."
"It is also worth remembering exactly what resolution 1441 actually says."
"Paragraph 1 states that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations under UN resolutions."
"Paragraph 4 states that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations."
"Finally, Paragraph 13 recalls that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations."
"Given Hans Blix's report, it could be argued that Paragraph 4 has already been breached."
"Whatever is the case, the UN has to decide what it means by Paragraph 13 and by serious consequences."
"Colleagues who have spoken are right that the future of the UN is at stake."
"The UN cannot make threats without being prepared to carry them out."
"The inspectors need more time and we need more information from the Americans."
"But if further serious breaches are reported, resolution 1441 has to be followed through."
"Failure to do so will only sanction the very illegal activity we have condemned, and it seems to me that some of the contributions today are attacks on UN resolution 1441 which we are all supporting."
"No member of the Security Council should prejudge that debate; nor should they say now how they are going to vote before they see the evidence."
"But we must be clear that, if a second resolution is forthcoming from the UN, we must all support it because that is what we have stated very clearly in our resolutions in this Parliament."
"Mr President, everybody knows that we are currently on the brink of disaster."
"The US Government, taking advantage of the terrorist acts of 11 September, is now imposing State terrorism on the entire world with the aim of establishing its economic and military domination everywhere."
"Not content to allow the Palestinian people to be massacred, to allow 500 000 Iraqi children to die due to the embargo and millions of Africans with AIDS to die due to lack of care, President Bush is going to invade Iraq in order, in particular, to appropriate its oil."
"Who can seriously believe for one second that the United States want to oppose a terrorist dictatorship because it fails to respect UN decisions?"
"We should not forget that Pinochet and Bin Laden were agents recruited and trained by the CIA, that Israel has never applied a single UN resolution and that fortunately, however, nobody is considering bombing Israel."
"Human rights or profits: two weights, two measures."
"That is the choice."
"This war smells of oil, and the majority in this House knows it."
"Without providing any support for Saddam Hussein's dictatorship, it is our duty to pass on the mass rejection of the people which will be expressed in particular in all the capital cities on 15 February in response to the Porto Alegre forum."
"With or without the UN, this war is not ours."
"According to estimates, it will cost almost USD 30 billion, while the UN food programme, under pressure from the United States, has just been reduced to USD 1.7 billion."
"Rejecting the war by every possible means, using the sums allocated to war to eradicate poverty, and allowing the Palestinian people to live in a free State: those are the three imperatives of the moment."
"Mr President, it is vitally important that the European Parliament sends a very clear message that there is no case for military action in Iraq."
"Increasing numbers of people across the EU recognise that such a pre-emptive attack would be both illegal and immoral."
"Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for anti-war demonstrations across the European Union."
"In the United Kingdom, over 160 000 people have signed a petition against war organised by a national newspaper, the Daily Mirror."
"They recognise that you cannot say you are upholding international law by breaking international law."
"They know that a war against Iraq would also be hugely counter-productive - far from fighting terrorism, it is a sure-fire way to fuel terrorism."
"There are alternatives and the EU has a key role to play in promoting them."
"If this conflict is really about getting rid of weapons of mass destruction, there are many other routes we can take."
"We need full implementation, for example, of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Five countries, including Britain, France and the United States, have been in material breach of this particular article of international law for over three decades."
"The chemical and biological conventions could also be strengthened."
"There are many other proposals."
"There are ambitious and controversial agendas, but the EU is uniquely able to propose radical new solutions and it has a duty to do so."
"Mr President, we are all agreed that every endeavour must be made to safeguard peace and that it is the duty of all of us to strive to avoid war."
"I share the anti-war sentiments, but it is precisely in order to avoid war that the international community must identify with the United Nations Organisation and its decisions, thus giving authority to the role of the United Nations."
"The decisions taken by the UN thus far have been very clear, Mr President, starting with the message sent to Saddam Hussein calling for the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction."
"If Iraq does not respect the wishes of the international community, an armed intervention, which, of course, may only follow a UN decision, will be inevitable."
"Now the ball is in the Iraqi dictator's court."
"It is now up to Saddam Hussein to prove to the world that he does not have prohibited weapons."
"If he genuinely wants to prevent war, he must tell the inspectors the truth."
"I regret to say that, thus far, Saddam Hussein has been uncooperative towards the UN representatives, as is shown by Hans Blix's report to the Security Council which expresses clear suspicions regarding nerve gas and chemical bombs."
"I quote: 'On 7th of December, 2002, Iraq submitted a declaration of some 12,000 pages ? [to] ? the Security Council. ?"
"The same applies to nerve gas."
"Iraq promised that the poisonous substance had not been deployed for use as a weapon, yet UNMOVIC has managed to obtain information to the contrary: there are indications that Iraq has produced more than it declared and that nerve gas has been deployed for military purposes."
"I will cite once again the report submitted to the Security Council in relation to chemical bombs: there is a discrepancy of 6 500 bombs."
"I repeat: 6 500 chemical bombs remain unaccounted for."
"Then Iraq has declared that it produced about 8 500 litres of anthrax, which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991."
"Iraq - the report continues - has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction. There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared."
"The report continues in this vein."
"Today, I am pleased to say, Saddam Hussein is isolated."
"In addition to this, the statement made by Mr Putin yesterday calling upon the Iraqi dictator to cooperate with the inspectors, failing which Russia would be forced to change its position, must not be underestimated."
"The pressure on Saddam Hussein must be intensified."
"I am therefore appealing to the Members of the European Parliament who are thinking of going to Iraq to give up their plan."
"Saddam Hussein would use their mission to claim that Europe is divided and that he has some supporters in our continent."
"This exploitation must be avoided at all costs."
"Whether we choose war or peace now depends first and foremost on the decisions Saddam Hussein makes, and Europe must ensure that the Iraqi regime cooperates with the inspectors."
"In this extremely problematic situation, Europe's duty is to use its influence to further peace."
"The Union's document, approved by the Foreign Affairs Ministers the other day, is evidence that divisions can be avoided in our continent, divisions which Saddam Hussein could exploit to gain time and to create further setbacks for the United Nations."
"By speaking with one voice, Europe has persuaded the United States to accept the postponement of war and has given the inspectors more influence."
"The Old Continent can do a great deal to achieve peace, and this is why the initiatives being taken by the Italian Government at this time deserve our close attention and support too."
"The interviews and meetings - held today, tomorrow and on Monday - could prove to be extremely significant, not least in that I believe the Italian Government is conveying messages from the other countries of the European Union."
"The active quest for peace must not, however, Mr President, cause us to forget that we are all committed to safeguarding the values of freedom, tolerance and respect for human dignity, values which suffered attack on September 11."
"It is not just the United States which suffered - each one of us has been affected."
"Now, it is up to Saddam Hussein to prove that he is not supporting terrorism, that he has no dealings with Al Qaida and that he intends to bow to the will of the United Nations."
"In short, it is he who will be responsible for what happens in the coming months."
"Mr President, the High Representative started his speech this evening by saying that we must tackle this crisis from a European perspective."
"All credit is due to him, but we must also acknowledge the work of the Greek Presidency, which played this card determinedly and, thus far, has obtained hitherto unhoped-for results, especially as regards the agenda and the time frames."
"In this connection, I would remind you that Korea, the Middle East and Macedonia were discussed as well as Iraq, for they are all part of a very complex international situation."
"I believe that Parliament will have no difficulty in supporting you, Mr Solana, on the four points you cited as European strategy."
"I would make it clear that, as regards the role of the United Nations, we - the Group of the European Socialists, in particular - want there to be neither excessive rigidity in the implementation of Resolution 1441 nor, should there prove to be a discrepancy between statements and reality, an automatic declaration of war."
"However, to lend credibility to the desire - which you have rightly described as the desire of the majority of the European citizens - to both avoid war and be without dictators, I believe that Europe must have more confidence in itself and be more coherent and, above all, more united."
"More coherent in the sense of believing more strongly in its values and showing some pride in them and more united in the sense of adopting a better thought out, consistent position."
"In this regard, I would like to end with a question."
"Are this document, adopted on 27 January by the Foreign Affairs Ministers, and the coordination of the European Members of the Security Council an indication that the opposing Franco-German and Anglo-Spanish positions will be resolved?"
"Then, what will Italy - the subject of such eulogies from Mr Tajani - do when it has the Presidency?"
"How much continuity can there be between the Greek and Italian Presidencies, given that our Prime Minister oscillates continuously between support for President Bush and what then appears to be a preference for the European position?"
"Mr President, the twisted war mentality that the US administration has developed is extremely serious and warrants the increasing opposition of world public opinion."
"As emphasised by the representatives of many countries at the world parliamentary forum in Porto Alegre, we must call on our leaders to firmly oppose the war and reject the concept of preventive war contained in the new strategic doctrine of the Bush administration."
"The institutions of the European Union, and the governments of the Member States and candidate countries must reject all and any participation in the war against Iraq, including the use of military bases and other facilities on their territory, and reject any participation of soldiers or the provision of military and financial resources, without this implying any support for the Iraqi regime."
"We must also ensure that the embargo on Iraq is ended, an embargo that has caused so much harm to the population, particularly to children."
"What is particularly important are all actions demonstrating solidarity with the Iraqi people, such as visits to Iraq by delegations of Members of the European Parliament and the public demonstrations against the war and to defend peace planned for 15 February."
"We must reject this unjust war, which is clearly a statement of the United States' hegemony, essentially dictated by oil interests and American and British military and industrial complexes."
"Opposition to the war in Iraq is equally crucial in order to put an end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and to the aggression by Ariel Sharon's government and to attempt to achieve, by means of dialogue, a fair and lasting peace."
"Our citizens want peace, so let us all work to make this possible, repeatedly expressing our protests, indignation and rejection with regard to the imminence of a new war against Iraq."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, America is afraid."
"It has been afraid since 11 September."
"It has waged war on every continent. It has little experience of war on its own soil; the last time was in the 1860s."
"Therefore it is afraid, and when a country or a continent is afraid, it can make stupid mistakes."
"America should listen to old Europe, this wise old lady, covered in blood and tears, the old lady that America itself came to save from dictatorship fifty years ago."
"Let America listen to her!"
"This old lady would say: choose security through international law, bow to the decisions of the UN, agree to another UN meeting, which we must demand, for another resolution."
"We know the Americans are the strongest."
"We are forced to take note of it."
"That is no reason to be unilateral."
"That is no reason to stand firm on your own national interests alone."
"It must be said that our fellow citizens can detect a strong smell of oil in this matter."
"Some will say that this is untrue, but they can smell it and they know that three quarters of oil stocks are there, that America needs them, that tomorrow China will need them; they know that these stocks, these resources, must be made available for the development of our countries, certainly, but also the southern countries."
"These are world stocks for everyone, and first of all also for those countries."
"Lastly, a final word to young Europe, our Europe, this young girl that we are creating."
"This will be her hour of truth and we must harmonise the positions of her four Member States and one candidate country that are on the Security Council."
"What took place on Monday is not enough."
"We should be able to coordinate our position to decide together what we are going to do with our two rights of veto in the Security Council, anticipating what might be our future."
"In any case, there is no clear reason to give up, whether with regard to the meeting or the right of veto."
"Mr President, the United Nations inspectors in Iraq are doing a good job."
"If they find undeclared chemical or biological weapons, they have the right to destroy them."
"If they do not find any, their duty is to pass on this information."
"While this process is underway and provided that it produces the anticipated result, Iraq does not represent a threat to anyone."
"In its current situation, it would not even dare to set off a firecracker."
"There is therefore no reason to instigate a pre-emptive war."
"In the next few days, the States of the European Union therefore have a pressing duty to prevent unilateral military action in defiance of international law."
"Resolution 1441 excludes automatic recourse to the use of force."
"It is a shame, therefore, that the ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE should have chosen to be ambiguous on this fundamental point."
"Have they not read the statement from the Episcopalian conference of German bishops, which says, and I quote: 'a pre-emptive war is an attack and cannot be considered a just war'?"
"I do not think the bishops have been manipulated by Saddam Hussein."
"Have our fellow Members in the PPE-DE not understood the churches' call to try everything to prevent a pre-emptive war which, and I quote: 'would remove all content from the principle of non-recourse to force laid down by international law and at the end of the day would weaken the whole system of the Community between the States'?"
"The socialists cannot express better than the bishops what they think of the war cries from the Washington hawks."
"There is still time for the Christian-Democrat Members to recover, tomorrow, at the vote, and I am sure that Mr Morillon, who is a reasonable man, will use all his powers of persuasion."
"Mr President, High Representative, almost everything has been said today."
"I would like to welcome the efforts of the Greek Presidency to resolve the situation we find ourselves in."
"The European Parliament will perhaps adopt a common resolution tomorrow on Iraq, a resolution which I support."
"But I am appalled that the minimal consensus it reflects, which underlines the central role of the United Nations Security Council, is so timid."
"Although defence and security are clearly intergovernmental matters, I believe that world peace and stability cannot be restricted to one pillar."
"You have said, Mr Solana, that the overwhelming majority of Europeans are unambiguously against the war."
"And we, in this Parliament, in order to safeguard European cohesion and our trans-Atlantic relations, vacillate and pay a high price, that of silence, and at times hypocrisy, since we are pretending to believe certain things. We are pretending to believe that the non-existence of something can be proved."
"We are pretending to believe that we are fighting terrorism, when there is every indication that we are going to make it infinitely worse. We are pretending to believe that Iraq is a threat to the world, when actually it is a country on its knees."
"We are pretending to believe that only that country has weapons of mass destruction, when the entire region is a powder keg."
"We are pretending to believe that the 150 000 men amassed on the borders of Iraq are only there to put pressure on Saddam Hussein. We are pretending to believe, as Mr Poignant has said, that this war does not have a terrible whiff of oil and that Bush's real objective is to return Iraq to the Iraqis."
"We are also pretending to believe that democracy can be built by force on a site littered with mines and bombs."
"And we are pretending to believe that we will never be accomplices in a massacre and that the UN, that arbiter of international law, will play an impartial role and is not subject to horrendous pressures."
"Mr President, I am ashamed today!"
"Mr President, Mr Solana, war is never something inevitable that one just has to resign oneself to."
"Man decides to go to war; and man can put a stop to war."
"War can never be the right way to destroy weapons of mass destruction or combat terrorism."
"We are on the verge of a war that would have devastating consequences for the people of Iraq, for the whole region and the whole world."
"In this situation, we cannot stay silent about the legal and moral problems surrounding a war."
"All politicians should analyse what a war with Iraq would lead to."
"Millions of people would be forced to flee - refugees that the neighbouring countries cannot take care of."
"The war could spread to Israel and Palestine, and opposition to the West could grow, resulting in more terrorist attacks."
"Very great humanitarian efforts would be needed for Iraq's 23 million people."
"Is it worth the cost?"
"The war with Iraq is not about Saddam Hussein's dictatorship or breaches of UN resolutions."
"If that were the case, the USA, the UN and the EU would be involved in many wars all over the world: for example, in Saudi Arabia and Israel, to name but a few."
"What it is really about is power over oil and power in the region."
"The United Nations Charter permits the use of force for the preservation of peace only as a last resort, when all other options have been exhausted."
"Only the Security Council can make decisions on this."
"Neither the United Nations Charter nor international law permits the use of force for preventive purposes, however."
"A preventive war is the law of the street, the justice of the powerful, which sweeps aside the international law on which the world is founded."
"The EU must protest strongly against this."
"There is no justification for Saddam Hussein's devastating politics."
"His and all other weapons of mass destruction must go, even those in the USA, the UK and Israel, but we have never recommended that force be used to this end."
"Give the inspectors a decent amount of time, and use the time for cooperation between the EU, the Arab countries, Russia and the UN to find a peaceful solution."
"Mr President, war is a grave thing."
"Erasmus said that war is sweet to those who do not know it."
"I believe we must condemn those who employ hypocrisy, double standards, half truths and total distortions in order to take us to war."
"It is unacceptable to hear prominent speeches which, rather than promoting a genuine fight against terrorism, that is, against Al Qaida, disseminate fallacies about supposed ideologies of power and domination which are equated with militarism, when at the same time the speaker boasts of having the best army in the world."
"A little self-analysis on the part of those who accuse the Iraqi dictator of representing a world of constant alarm and chaos would reveal who really represents an ideology of power and domination and who provokes constant alarm in the world."
"Nevertheless, I believe we should be pleased to see the continuous growth within the Member States of a movement rejecting war, and positions such as that of General Schwarzkopf who, taking the approach of Erasmus, has just accused the Minister for war, Rumsfeld, of undervaluing the army and of relishing the idea of going to war, or such as that of the Democrat Senator Joseph Biden, who has accused Bush of promoting the greatest wave of anti-Americanism for 30 years."
"Furthermore, the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has just said that he is in favour of peace but that he cannot share the responsibility for backing down in the face of those who threaten our security, freedom and democracy."
"I believe that, with sophisms of this type, it is we who endanger our freedom, our democracy and our principles and of course our security, because a society which allows lies and distortions in order to dominate the oil market and indulge in strategic whims of an imperialist nature weakens itself in the medium term and thereby jeopardises its cohesion and security."
"Mr President, I have the justifiable suspicion that with regard to this Iraq crisis, Prime Minister Aznar has made secret commitments of a military nature to the Bush administration."
"I can provide the European Parliament with proof of this in the form of a series of significant public statements by Prime Minister Aznar in Spain, in which he demonstrates through the media his unconditional support for Bush, including for a unilateral attack."
"Does this attitude show loyalty to the European Union?"
"Is this position which breaks European consensus loyal?"
"Are these televised comments by Aznar in which he states that he will back Bush unconditionally in a unilateral attack loyal?"
"Are they loyal, given that we know that that would violate international law and the United Nations Charter?"
"I would also like to make it clear, Mr President, that not even his own country supports him in this, and that it does not support these positions."
"The enormous majority of Spanish society is against a unilateral attack."
"Spain opposed the unilateral attack on Libya and on Panama at the time and now it fully supports the common European position."
"Representatives of the Council and the Commission, has Prime Minister Aznar informed you of his unconditional unilateral support for Bush?"
"With regard to Mr Galeote's recommendations, they would be cynical if they are not first applied to Aznar."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the many honourable Members who have accompanied me during this sitting for their tenacity and perseverance."
"Thank you."
"I would like to speak briefly, without exceeding the time allotted to me, to explain various issues."
"Firstly, there can be no doubt that this is a difficult debate."
"It is a debate which goes to the heart of the European Union's foreign policy and beyond."
"We have a new world situation which may undoubtedly have consequences for the future which are hard to predict today."
"But I would like to say that we must not indulge in a sort of pessimism about the European Union's inability to reach common positions."
"We are talking about such serious issues as war and peace."
"We are talking about something extremely grave; life or death."
"And it is therefore natural that so many Members of Parliament have spoken in very different ways and that the governments have also at times said so many differing things."
"Hence the first consequence; it will be very difficult to take a decision on war and peace, on life and death, by means of a vote on one particular day."
"Peace and war, life and death, belong to the States and one State will never be prepared to allow another State to impose on it the obligation to go to war or, conversely, to impose that obligation to go to war on another."
"I say this within the context of the European Union."
"On the second issue, I believe that if we cast our minds back to the end of August and the beginning of September of last year, I believe that the majority of Members of this honourable Parliament thought, with fear or horror, that we were at the beginning of a unilateral action against Iraq."
"There was pressure, very significant pressure from many countries, the majority of countries of the European Union."
"And we should also recognise the courage of the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, at that time."
"Amongst all of us we managed to ensure that that operation, which appeared to be under way, was brought within the context of the United Nations."
"And in September of that year the Iraq dossier, which was kept outside the United Nations Security Council, outside the framework of the United Nations, was brought to the United Nations."
"And for seven long weeks Resolution 1441 was debated."
"All of this action was unquestionably led by European countries in order to achieve a unanimously approved Resolution."
"It has been a long time since a resolution of such importance has been approved unanimously, and countries such as Syria, for example, and a few days later, as I said at the beginning, the Arab League, the Arab countries, unanimously supported the content of Resolution 1441."
"I do not believe that the Europeans are the only people responsible for Resolution 1441, but it would be pessimistic for us not to say that we have been very instrumental in the existence of Resolution 1441."
"So let us reassess our feelings of pessimism or optimism: our actions have been significant and they continue to be so."
"Resolution 1441 obliged the inspectors, Dr Blix and Mr ElBaradei, to produce a report."
"They were kind enough to speak with the President of the European Parliament yesterday by videoconference."
"The Members of this Parliament are well informed about what Mr Blix thinks. You have an in-depth knowledge of what he thinks, not only from what he has said in public, but also from what he said in that videoconference."
"And all the honourable Members of this House know that Dr Blix, a great European by the way - as he said himself yesterday ?and a man who believes in the values of Europe, spoke to you yesterday with a degree of pessimism in his heart."
"This pessimism was not the result of ignorance, since he is a wise man, who has worked on the inspection of weapons of mass destruction for many years."
"He was somewhat pessimistic because he recognised that there had not been the cooperation he had hoped for."
"He had hoped, with his skill, his experience and generosity, for greater cooperation."
"So, the first consequence we have in our hands, the first report, is a report which does not satisfy us in terms of the cooperation between Saddam Hussein and his regime and the inspectors."
"But despite all of this, we must continue and we have therefore asked the countries of the European Union to give all possible assistance to the inspectors."
"And I insist: what kind of assistance can we give?"
"There are three types: assistance in terms of time, giving them more time; material assistance, giving them more resources if they need them; and assistance in terms of information and intelligence."
"Another achievement yesterday was that the evidence in existence which was not being distributed beyond a certain number of people, some of them amongst Dr Blix's colleagues, will now be discussed on 5 February within the United Nations Security Council."
"The United Nations Security Council is still, therefore, the centre of gravity of the debate, and I believe that the countries of Europe have had a hand in this, not in every respect, but to a very considerable extent."
"There is therefore a dynamic of pressure which must be maintained - and the inspectors are asking us to maintain it ? and at the same time a political dynamic in the debate taking place in the Security Council, which will take time."
"There will be other sittings and no doubt this Parliament will analyse within a few days the reports which will be produced in the United Nations Security Council."
"On the 14 February there will be a second report from the inspectors and we will see how the situation is developing."
"As the honourable Members may imagine, I am in constant contact with many people, with many important countries in the Security Council, and with non-European countries and non-members of the Security Council."
"The honourable Members will remember, because you follow this issue as closely as I do, that a few days ago in Ankara there was an important meeting of the most significant Arab countries."
"I would urge you to read the declaration which emerged from that meeting."
"That declaration is not so different from the European Union's declaration on Monday, quite the contrary, although it is perhaps less forceful."
"We are therefore working in the right direction."
"Will we achieve a good outcome?"
"We will see, but we have a political dynamic which nobody would have expected a few months ago."
"We must therefore continue working, continue cooperating in this way with the other members of the Security Council, we must continue working with the other countries and amongst ourselves so that, at the end of this journey, we may have, as I said at the beginning, a solution to this extremely serious conflict."
"Because there is absolutely no doubt that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is going to be the great issue which we Europeans are going to have to deal with in the coming years and we will have to genuinely take on board the importance of this issue."
"And I believe that we are sometimes not sufficiently awake to the possible consequences of this, but I hope that in this case it is resolved and that the solution is a good one."
"In any event, for my part, I will always be prepared to appear before this Parliament, however many Members are in attendance, in order to try to move forward and overcome the difficulties facing all of us at this historic moment for good or for bad."
"Let us hope that it is for good."
"I have received six motions for resolutions"
"The European Parliament must speak out clearly against war as a means of disarming Iraq, because the vast majority of our citizens is against it."
"The UN has shown the way: by forcing disarmament through inspections and demanding answers to the inspectors' questions."
"All further action must take place within the framework of the UN."
"Human rights remain a dead letter in other countries as well; other countries also have weapons of mass destruction - Iran, Pakistan, North Korea and India for example."
"It is inconceivable that a superpower would be able to unilaterally solve the problem by military means."
"The fact that Iraq has been weakened by the Gulf War ten years ago and has oil wells does not justify making an exception to this."
"There are many other problems waiting to be resolved, such as the Palestine issue, the Middle East, Kashmir and so on."
"It is not only the Kurds in Iraq who are waiting for recognition of their rights as a people, but also those in Syria, Turkey and Iran."
"The pressure on Saddam must be maintained until the regime falls or conforms with the international rule of law."
"Arming a dictator, as the Russians and the Americans but also the British, French and Germans did with Saddam during his war with Iran, is costly in the long term."
"The road to a durable peace must be coupled with disarmament and development."
"The oil in Iraq changes nothing."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the withdrawal of North Korea from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Mr Yiannitsis, the President-in-Office of the Council, has the floor to make his statement."
"Mr President, just three years ago we all hoped that the Korean peninsular could look forward to a much better future."
"North Korea, traditionally isolated from just about every other country and consistently hostile to South Korea, had for some years been in very severe economic difficulties and eventually Pyongyang was forced to call upon the international community for assistance with food and medical supplies and for help in tackling the effects of a series of disastrous floods."
"The international community responded and, in the wake of that, the mood of the regime in Pyongyang seemed to soften, raising the prospect of some change, however slow."
"In South Korea, the election of Kim Dae-jung as president in the late 1990s meant that the economic crisis there was tackled effectively and also resulted in efforts to implement the sunshine policy of trying to achieve normalisation of relations with North Korea."
"The summit meeting in Pyongyang in 2000 between President Kim Dae-jung and North Korea's Chairman Kim Jong-il encouraged hopes of further constructive developments."
"Against that background, the majority of our Member States who had not already done so established or restored diplomatic links with North Korea and agreed to increase assistance, with a promise of more, if North Korea continued its cautious opening to the outside world."
"The high level EU visit led by Prime Minister Goran Persson to Pyongyang in May 2001 was regarded as a further important step that reinforced our nascent dialogue concerning, inter alia, human rights, and brought from North Korea a promise of a continued moratorium on missile testing."
"Since then, however, progress has not been so evident."
"Political level contact between North Korea and South Korea continued, as did family reunions and business contacts, but the promised second summit did not take place."
"Hopes of reconciliation are kept alive, but the patrol boat clash last summer shows how fragile those hopes are."
"With the visit of Prime Minster Koizumi to Pyongyang last August, Japan also took a major step forward in opening up dialogue about normalising relations, nearly sixty years after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea."
"But the admission by Chairman Kim Jong-il that over the years Japanese citizens had been kidnapped and that, tragically, some of the abducted people had died in North Korea understandably caused emotional reactions in Japan."
"All that has generated justified concern, but it is the deterioration in the relationship with the United States that has generated most worry."
"The initial determination of the Bush administration not to follow the policies of President Clinton in relations with North Korea fed Pyongyang's suspicions that the United States was implacably hostile."
"The antagonisms have obviously been increased by the discovery last November that North Korea has been carrying out a covert programme of uranium enrichment in violation of the engagements it undertook in 1994 under the agreed framework, when the Korean Energy Development Organisation (KEDO) was set up to ensure that nuclear energy supplies to the DPRK under international supervision reduced the risk of war."
"We all, I am sure, share anxiety about the developments over the past two months."
"North Korea is now the only country ever to have left the non-proliferation treaty."
"It expelled the IAEA inspectors and said it was restarting plutonium production at Yongbyong."
"Clearly, if North Korea begins to process significant quantities of plutonium for military use, the situation would deteriorate quickly and seriously."
"That reality is understood by all our partners and, of course, not least, the United States."
"This is not however just an issue between the DPRK and the United States."
"It is a regional issue which carries grave risks for both Korea and Japan."
"It is also a crisis with global impact in terms of the non-proliferation worries which it raises."
"Clearly, if the situation worsens, there are likely to be adverse economic effects on the global economy including the European Union."
"The development crisis therefore calls for common efforts by the main partners to find a diplomatic solution which can satisfy the demands of the international community, including the European Union, that North Korea must return to conformity with the non-proliferation treaty and which also gives North Korea the assurance that it will not be attacked by the United States."
"Plainly, if the international community is once again willing to help North Korea to address its enormous internal problems of shortages of energy, food and all other basic needs, this could also assist to get the country out of the crisis."
"But it is also clear that the European Union is not a major participant in the affairs of that region."
"We are of course a significant participant; we have provided nearly 300 million euros in different types of aid to the DPRK since the mid-1990s."
"Our most significant contribution politically is our participation in the KEDO, where we are board members together with the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan, and contribute 20 million euros annually."
"The European Union has also consistently been involved as a humanitarian donor - a role that was symbolised most recently by the 9.5 million ECU emergency food aid package for nursing mothers."
"This is assisted and delivered through the World Food Programme, as much of our humanitarian food assistance has been over the years, and the conditions for doing this are very clearly spelt out in a way that creates very tight monitoring procedures."
"The European Union, for this and other reasons, has some credibility vis-à-vis the DPRK."
"We can consequently raise the question of whether the European Union can find an effective role in persuading the DPRK to see reason and back down from its current threatening posture and in helping to promote a diplomatic solution, particularly in a way that helps the United States and the DPRK to get back to dialogue and negotiations."
"Those were among the issues discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council last Monday, when foreign ministers decided to give a mandate to the Presidency to organise a high level visit to the DPRK."
"The timing, composition of the delegation and modalities are to be decided later and preparations for such a visit can now be undertaken."
"A clear condition, however, is that the delegation must be received by Chairman Kim Jong-il."
"Naturally, in our contact with the DPRK, we will not lose sight of the need for that country to address the human rights abuses that also add to the problem of the dialogue."
"I can report that our South Korean friends have pressed strongly for an EU initiative and there has been general encouragement from other partners."
"The timing of such a visit must however be decided only after careful consultation with the partners concerned and when we are certain that our delegation will be received at the highest level."
"Plainly, we also need to prevent a wedge from being driven between the efforts of the international community to counter the recent DPRK decisions."
"Further contact may therefore be needed with our closest allies and the United States in this case in particular."
"As the situation develops, the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed."
"In the meantime, we hope for the continued and valued support of Parliament in our efforts to foster temperate and constructive attitudes on all sides."
"I would end by saying that the world is not in acute need of more conflicts."
"Mr President, I have been the co-author of two resolutions in quick succession with Jas Gawronski and Jacques Santer, who are experts on this very isolated country."
"North Korea presents one of the most threatening humanitarian crises and military flashpoints on the globe."
"Run by a vain and maverick dictator, Kim Jong-il, whose disastrous Stalinist economic policies have brought the country to its knees, the DPRK is now resorting to nuclear blackmail and dangerous brinkmanship with the world community, in breach of the 1994 framework agreement and other previous binding international agreements."
"Mr Kim has chosen to withdraw from the NPT and to expel IAEA inspectors, and threatens to reactivate his nuclear weapons programme by switching on the Yongbyong nuclear power station, ostensibly to generate electricity, but no-one is really fooled by this as it is really a source of weapons-grade plutonium for him."
"Rather than feed his people, he has chosen to maintain one million men under arms, with an immoral diversion of food and resources to the military, irrespective of the sufferings of the civilian population, many of whom are rotting in political re-education camps or dying of starvation."
"North Korea remains a failing, rogue state and a very dangerous one at that."
"It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it is technically still at war, and it has ten thousand artillery pieces aimed at Seoul."
"I am at a loss as to why out-going President Kim of South Korea is so flattering about his Pyongyang counterpart."
"I suppose the sunshine policy requires a very sensitive approach to such a strange man who has just rebuffed the South's special envoy, Mr Lim, who returned empty-handed yesterday from his trip to the North."
"Also, our so-called ally Pakistan needs to consider the consequences of its actions in its alleged provision to North Korea of uranium enrichment technology in exchange for help in weaponising its Ghauri-2 long range missiles with nuclear warheads by adapting North Korean Nodong missiles."
"Already many are suspicious of the genuineness of Pakistan's commitments in its war against terrorism and the disappearance of the records of Pakistan's relations with North Korea is worrying."
"There are also suspicions that both countries are helping Iran's covert weapons proliferation programme."
"The international community must close ranks against this rogue state and stop it becoming a nuclear proliferator if it is not one already, not only because of the threat posed to the South and the 37 000 US troops stationed there, but also the 40 million civilian South Korean population."
"It also has a track record, no doubt worsened by its desperate self-inflicted poverty, of exporting arms, including weapons of mass destruction, to any willing buyer irrespective of the danger posed to world security."
"In this respect, China and Russia, for once, have a common agenda with the West in preventing a nuclear arms race in the region, which will quickly spread to the South Korean part of the peninsula and to Japan, with very dangerous consequences for the whole world."
"The EU must assess the situation carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid."
"It must also, however, send a very clear and strong signal to North Korea - which, rather surprisingly, listens carefully to our pronouncements - that it will not tolerate nuclear blackmail in the event of UN sanctions."
"It must also urge strongly against any further provocative testing of ballistic missiles over Japan, as happened a couple of years ago, or moving the sealed spent nuclear fuel rods which are currently sitting in water tanks, which therefore would effectively show that they are very serious in their intent to progress to manufacturing plutonium weapons."
"The DPRK cannot pursue a policy of ignoring the collective will of the United Nations and must cease its nuclear proliferation immediately."
"Mr President, while the entire world is currently focussed on Iraq and the Chamber was full when we talked about it just now, it is the case that the attitude of North Korea is perhaps more worrying and that the danger it poses is very real."
"I do not have many real differences with our fellow Members from the PPE-DE on this issue."
"North Korea is withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, refusing inspections by the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and re-launching its nuclear programme."
"And what are we doing?"
"Are we going to threaten war?"
"No!"
"Thank goodness for that and I am glad to see such wisdom."
"I entirely agree with the motion for a resolution."
"I would like to highlight three points from it."
"The first point relates to Pakistan's role in this issue."
"Pakistan is one of our supposed allies, an American ally, which, solely due to the fact that it claims to be fighting terrorism, could, furthermore, without anyone taking any notice, provide North Korea with enriched uranium."
"We find this completely unacceptable and it should be condemned."
"Secondly, I welcome the decision of the Council and the Commission to also view the North Korean problem from a humanitarian perspective."
"From a humanitarian perspective without cutting humanitarian aid, but also trying to find other solutions to the problem of energy, which is a very serious problem in North Korea."
"Finally, the point which is probably closest to our hearts, which is dialogue."
"We believe it is urgent that we initiate dialogue between the seven major powers, which are the European Union, the United States, Japan, Russia, China, North Korea and South Korea, on economic, security and peace issues."
"I believe that it is really this firm dialogue which could lead to a solution to the issue."
"Mr President, only two weeks ago North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it had been a party for 17 years."
"This decision was made in a climate of international uncertainty, especially when weapons of mass destruction are concerned."
"The threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons is grave and we are currently balancing on the brink of war in Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states."
"The North Korean withdrawal is not only a threat to regional stability."
"Destabilising the Korean peninsula would have more far-reaching consequences."
"Neighbours in far-off countries alike have an interest in making North Korea change its mind."
"Besides displaying a lack of respect for international security, the North Korean decision also shows complete disregard for the well-being of an already impoverished population."
"Human suffering in North Korea is immense."
"Every human right is being violated, including the most fundamental of all: the right to live."
"In the past eight years, more than two million people have starved to death in North Korea."
"More will suffer the same fate if donors feel forced to restrict aid as a direct consequence of North Korean withdrawal from the NPT."
"A concerted effort by regional partners and international organisations is the best way forward."
"China, Japan and South Korea along with the United Nations, the EU and the United States should be active in seeking a solution."
"The recent resumption of talks between North and South Korea demonstrates that dialogue is possible."
"Some groups here have worked together to table a joint resolution expressing a reaction to the current situation in North Korea."
"Together we share the view that the North Korean position is untenable."
"Besides condemnation and calls for a change of course, we have underlined the need for dialogue and repeated our position on human rights."
"North Korea must change its decision for the sake of regional and international stability as well as its own people."
"Our joint resolution sends out a clear signal from the vast majority in the Parliament that condemns the current situation and state of affairs in North Korea, but at the same time suggests a course of action which, given the right amount of commitment, could remedy the problem."
"Mr President, US President Bush branded North Korea as part of an axis of evil with Iraq and Iran."
"These unwise words evidently caused North Korea to believe they were on George Bush's hit list."
"The proliferation of nuclear weapons in east Asia opens up an appalling vista."
"This is potentially a much more serious conflict than that in Iraq."
"Already last October, the government of North Korea was reportedly running a secret uranium enrichment programme in blatant violation of the KEDO Agreement."
"In December, North Korea cancelled its membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, expelled the International Atomic Energy Authority weapons inspectors and announced that it would reactivate a nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant producing weapons grade material."
"I believe, however, that KEDO was ill designed from the start, neither addressing North Korea's immediate energy needs, nor delivering technology adaptable to the country's infrastructure."
"The developments on the uranium enrichment programme led the European Parliament in October last year to freeze the EUR 20 million EU contributions to KEDO for 2003, and the US administration to stop its oil supplies to North Korea under the KEDO Agreement."
"It is now inconceivable that Commissioner Patten, as he himself has acknowledged, could come to the European Parliament and request money from the EU funds for nuclear transfers."
"Even if he assures this House that the funding will be used for the non-nuclear components of KEDO, the transfer of such technology is now so evidently dangerous that a complete review of KEDO, deleting the nuclear technology transfers, is necessary."
"I would ask the Commission to respond to this point in particular, and to ensure that the money be spent on a proposal to provide clean energy from North Korea's electricity plants, by reconstructing its ancient conventional energy plants so as to make them efficient, by contributing to the proposed gas pipeline from Irkutsk as well as developing the great potential in Korea for wind and solar energy, bio-mass and geothermics."
"Mr President, the whole world pays homage to the 'Sun of the 21st century', the successor to the 'Great Leader'."
"He only has to threaten and the heads of government come begging for concessions on bended knees."
"This is the vague picture of his absolute rule that millions of North Koreans get."
"How do we find a sensible answer to the real threat from this tyrannical Sun King?"
"The regional leaders appear not to have the power, the will or the opportunity they need to free themselves from the threat of North Korea."
"On the other hand, one cannot expect the Americans to solve this global problem alone."
"The Security Council is the organ designated to act in this case."
"Section 7 of the Charter states that the Council should adopt a resolution that contains clear steps towards de-escalating this dangerous conflict."
"The first objective of the EU delegation to Pyongyang must therefore be to bring about discussions with the UN rather than the US."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see that both the countries of the European Union and Parliament have achieved a common position on the subject of Korea with less difficulty than they had with regard to Iraq."
"I believe that this is proof that the threat of North Korea to world security is seen as greater and more real, as, moreover, both Commissioner Patten and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have said this afternoon."
"Clearly, there can be no possibility of military action to destroy nuclear plant in Korea."
"In his account of the facts with which we who are concerned with these issues are already quite familiar, the Commissioner mentioned a possible US attack."
"I feel that this is to be completely excluded, for it could lead to war, possibly even nuclear war, on the Korean peninsula."
"Therefore, unlike in the case of Iraq, here, a peaceful approach is the only possible way forward, and that could take two forms: the isolation of North Korea or diplomacy and an attempt at dialogue."
"The United States, which favoured isolation at the start of the crisis, now appears to lean more towards dialogue."
"I believe that this is the opinion even of those Members who were here just now but have just left the House holding up placards saying 'No to war', not realising that, in doing so, they are making war more likely."
"Every initiative which supports Saddam Hussein's cause makes him more stubborn and less inclined to bow before our requests and pressure."
"Now, there are two mistakes we must avoid in negotiations with North Korea."
"Firstly, we must not fall into the trap laid by Pyongyang, which is trying to create a division between the United States and South Korea, an attempt which is furthered by the fact that north-south relations have not been very good for some time, to the extent that the outgoing President was moved to describe Kim Jong-Il as a very astute man whereas, judging from what he has done with his country and the way his people, the population live, one might be induced to think the opposite."
"Secondly, we must not give other countries, other potential Kim Jong-Il-style dictators - and they do exist - the impression that one only has to violate the non-proliferation treaties in order to be rewarded with support and assistance from the United States."
"There must, however, be two indispensable conditions in our negotiations with North Korea."
"Firstly, we cannot tolerate the existence of a nuclear weapons programme in that country. Secondly, any agreement must lay down exceedingly rigid, pervasive control measures to prevent North Korea from taking us for a ride once again."
"On this basis, the conference we propose in our joint motion for a resolution would be extremely useful as a European Union initiative."
"I have received six motions for resolutions"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must warn you that we are running late and we will therefore have to administer the debate very strictly."
"Since I have no desire to use my repressive powers, I would ask you to administer yourselves in a disciplined fashion."
"Mr President, to save time, could you perhaps only give the floor to people who are present in the room during the introductions and who are also willing to listen to the answer."
"You might then have fewer problems with the speaking time, and this auditorium would also be better populated;"
"I am embarrassed on behalf of my fellow MEPs because they are not here to listen to the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner."
"Mr President, do the violators of human rights have much to fear and the victims much to expect from the UN Human Rights Commission?"
"I do not think so."
"The most important forum in the world is once again missing the mark by a mile: it is not the severity of the violations that is the deciding factor but the ability to mobilise political support."
"Some countries also manage to repeatedly avoid censure; this produces a distorted picture of the human rights situation in the world and tarnishes the legitimacy of the Commission."
"Regrettably, having a notorious violator of human rights such as Libya as the chairman of the Commission is an example of this."
"It is high time for reform that will prevent these kinds of undesirable developments."
"The European Union can play a greater role in the UN Commission if it is properly prepared, prepared in time, speaks with one voice and is persistent and courageous - in short, if it operates differently from the way it operated last year."
"Europe's abstention in respect of Libya's chairmanship, however diplomatically tactical that was meant to be, is an admission of weakness and creates a lack of clarity with regard to Europe's position."
"In order to exert maximum influence, coordination must take place with the United States on as many aspects as possible."
"I understand that that does in fact happen."
"It is very important to my group that the European Union makes efforts particularly in respect of resolutions on slavery, immunity from punishment, torture, brutal interpretations of Sharia, discrimination against women, freedom of religion, the situation of indigenous peoples and certainly the protection of human rights activists as well."
"We place great importance on the resolutions on the 17 countries in which Iraq, Iran, Burma, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, China, Russia and Colombia are in particular named."
"Selection is inevitable, but that certainly does not mean that all countries that have not been named will get off scot-free."
"I would also like to draw particular attention to the renewal of the mandate of the special rapporteur for Iran, the strengthening of the position of the High Commissioner in Colombia and the approval of special rapporteurs in Chechnya."
"The European Union must integrate the outcomes of Geneva into its policy and resume the political dialogue with the countries concerned."
"As the human rights rapporteur for this Parliament for this year I say: let the European Union do everything it can to restore the authority of this UN Human Rights Commission."
"We cannot do without it, there is no alternative."
"A meeting is only successful, however, if it is feared by the violators and applauded by the victims."
"Mr President, I am a critical person, and I am very sad to have become afflicted in this period with pessimism regarding the future of our world too."
"Over and above our high-sounding declarations of principle, human rights are being violated in far too many countries: Chechnya, China, the African countries at war, Israel, the USA with the death penalty and so on and so forth."
"In this sense, governments are often indifferent towards the work of UNHCR and their recommendations go unheeded."
"Like many of you, I feel indignation when fundamental human rights - the right to life, freedom of thought and movement - are ridden roughshod over in countries professing to be democracies too, and, today, illiberal, death-dealing acts are being carried out in the name of the war against terrorism, although that is not to say that terrorism must not be combated, as in the case of the massacre in Mazar-I-Sharif."
"I would like a measure to be taken in March which would make Israel, for example, which is a signatory State, respect, if not the UN resolutions requiring an end to military occupation, at least the Geneva Convention."
"Collective punishments, the demolition of houses, schools, hospitals, factories and shops, the uprooting of trees, arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial assassinations, vandalism and theft perpetrated by Israeli soldiers, which I personally witnessed in Ramallah, are tragic, daily occurrences in Palestine, like the attacks against civilians in Israel."
"Three hundred and fifty Palestinian children and 80 Israeli children have been killed in the last two years, innocent victims of our failure to act."
"We have the means to do so but we often use two different sets of checks and balances: it is our alliances, not our values, which carry most weight."
"Europe is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"If we are not consistent, first and foremost in the context of European Union affairs, employing all the means available to us, including the suspension of the association agreements with countries which have blatantly violated human rights, how can we be credible as promoters of these rights within the United Nations?"
"We need the provision of enough UNHCR financial and human resources to be able to act more effectively."
"At the March conference, we must take tangible decisions such as sending a peace-keeping force to protect the civilian population in the occupied territories and refusing to allow Israel to obstruct or even fire on humanitarian missions."
"The resolution on which we are going to vote outlines effective, valuable priorities and commitments - such as the operation of the International Criminal Court, human rights monitoring in Iran and the cooperation of the institutions with associations and NGOs from civil society - which will further education and respect in the field of human rights and democracy."
"Mr President, I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to a number of issues, a number of dossiers which have received wide coverage in the international press but which we appear to have overlooked somewhat in our political activities."
"The first concerns an African country which is travailed by daily violations of the most fundamental human rights, Zimbabwe, where a Head of Government and his regime of violent, brutal racism towards the settlers, the farmers of European origin, have encouraged the perpetration of incidents which, along with the attacks on the democratic rights of the local African opposition to this regime, place this country wholly outside the realms of democracy."
"I am dumbfounded by the debate in which our European authorities appear to be bogged down, as if there were any question of allowing the head of this bloodthirsty regime which is brutally riding roughshod over human rights to take part in the France-Africa Summit in Paris in February or the EU-Africa Summit due to take place in Lisbon in April."
"I believe that the Council and the Commission must act resolutely, and I feel that a committee whose very raison d'être is to safeguard human rights must not overlook repeated brutal incidents ?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, Lobsang Dhondup, a Tibetan, was executed three days ago, despite all the appeals made by world public opinion and the human rights organisations, and the approaches of ambassadors of EU Member States notwithstanding."
"Nor did our debate in this House, and the resolution we adopted unanimously on 19 December 2002, have any effect."
"On 26 January 2003, the People's Court in Chengdu confirmed the death sentences that had been passed on Lobsang Dhondup and on the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek."
"They were accused of involvement in an attack using explosives and of sabotaging national unity."
"Lengthy solitary confinement without contact with family or legal representatives is a manifest breach of the UN's minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners."
"Their trial was neither fair nor in accordance with the rule of law."
"A public hearing in open court - demanded by this Parliament among others - was refused on the flimsy grounds that state secrets were involved."
"There was no free choice of legal representation, and public defence counsel were appointed by the court."
"Lobsang Dhondup's execution resulted in immediate protests by the EU Member States."
"It will also be on the agenda of the human rights conversations between Germany and China."
"Great Britain has reiterated the demand for the death penalty in China to be at last abolished, and the human rights dialogue between the EU and China must now at last concern itself with this serious case."
"It is a disaster; while China is trying to cut a credible figure on the world stage, the most basic conditions of the defence of human rights are being disregarded."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and as President of this Parliament's Intergroup on Tibet, I call upon the Council, the Commission and the Member States to intervene without delay and prevent the death sentence with which Tenzin Delek has been threatened from being carried out."
"For decades, this lama has worked in the religious, cultural and social fields - with such manifest success that all hardliners see him as a threat."
"This appalling event can leave us in no doubt that China's violations of fundamental rights should be on the agenda of the Human Rights Convention in Geneva, and the European Union must take the lead in this."
"Mr President, I welcomed the reference made by the Council representative in his speech to a calm, pragmatic position, and I am thinking, in particular, of the need for pragmatic action to call strongly, for example, for ratification of all the international conventions, which are the tools available for the States and the citizens to use to protect their human rights."
"I would like to mention two, in particular, which are considered to be of particularly minor importance: the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination."
"I then feel that we should continue to call strongly for a moratorium on the death penalty, not least in that it has become clear that, resisting any fatalistic tendencies or ideas of inevitable destiny, it is actually possible to persuade some US governors of the worthlessness of this barbaric practice: the fact that the governor of Illinois commuted 167 sentences shows that this is a battle that it is actually possible to win."
"We call upon the European Union, first and foremost, to fight to ensure that there are no off-limits zones in the protection of human rights."
"One such off-limits zone could be the fight against terrorism, which should be based firmly on respect for international humanitarian law."
"Another free zone could be the fact that the Rome Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court continues to be treated by some countries, particularly the United States, as extremely insignificant."
"The authority and effectiveness of this Treaty are in danger of being increasingly diminished by the attitude of the United States and its decision to adopt bilateral agreements with some countries."
"Lastly, Mr President, I would like us to go to Geneva with a conviction which I hope we all share - that the first and highest form of defence of human rights is to avoid the destruction, ignominy and violence of war."
"Mr President, one cannot but agree with the general principles expounded by the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, but what matters is how we apply them and I have three comments to make here."
"First, we should not be mild-mannered psychotherapists in one country and unrelenting public prosecutors in another."
"The criteria applied to Turkey should also apply to Iran and the criteria applied to Iran should also apply to Turkey."
"And while we are on the subject of Turkey, it is about time that Leyla Zana, the woman awarded the Sakharov prize, saw the light of day."
"And it would be an important achievement if that were to happen under the Greek Presidency."
"Secondly, the United States."
"In addition to what the Commissioner said, there is the question of the death penalty in the United States and we need to address this issue in the same way as we have addressed it in other countries."
"And while we are on the subject of crossed swords between the European Union and the United States, I think it is perhaps about time we awarded a Sakharov prize to an American in 2003, the outgoing governor of Illinois, who has pardoned 150 people on death row."
"Thirdly, we must look at new rights being violated by measures against terrorism."
"Mr President, although Member State governments have strongly criticised human rights abuses, regrettably they adopt a different approach in relation to larger countries like China and Pakistan, where there are huge trading and geopolitical interests at stake."
"Our inconsistency is a form of political prostitution and undermines our moral authority in this field."
"I welcome this joint resolution and, as mentioned in paragraph 16, the EU Presidency should support further resolutions on a number of countries."
"I would like to refer to three in particular."
"With regard to China, the strike hard campaign continues to be extremely worrying, having dramatically increased the number of executions in China, often carried out in reliance on insufficient evidence in summary trials."
"Severe restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information persist."
"Pro-democracy campaigners and political activists are often detained without charge and, in some cases, charged with inciting subversion."
"It is essential that the Presidency make human rights a core part of all dialogue with China."
"In the Middle East, I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism, especially suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian extremists."
"But I also condemn the state terrorism inflicted on the ordinary people of Palestine by Israel."
"With regard to Iran, EU leaders had expressed the hope that engaging Iran in political dialogue would strengthen reformist elements and improve human rights."
"Sadly, stoning seems to have been only stopped temporarily, for reasons of image."
"Numerous newspapers are being closed down daily and unfortunately the number of executions has increased significantly."
"The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental principles of the EU."
"It is imperative for the EU to show consistency in its stance on human rights on the global stage and particular at Geneva; otherwise, no one will take us seriously."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the speakers for their comments and observations."
"I think they will be most useful to the Council, as will the references made to a number of countries and regions such as China, the Middle East and Zimbabwe, which not only reflect the Council's position, they also reflect the action being taken by the Council and the Commission on a whole series of issues."
"We are not sparing any effort to persuade everyone we can of the need to implement human rights."
"Of course, what is important in the final analysis is for the pressure we exert to bring about results and not just remain political pressure."
"Of course, I also agree with many of the other comments made but there is too little time to go into them, such as turning our attention to the problems in Africa."
"Before discussing our position in various international fora, I should like to take this opportunity to comment on Mr van den Bos's reference to the European Union's abstention from last year's vote."
"I personally believe that the decision to abstain was not an expression of indifference."
"That would not be in the nature of the European Union."
"It was a considered decision which, it was hoped, would help the Commission on Human Rights operate smoothly under the political circumstances which arose last year."
"I should also like to point out that of course we are interested in abolishing the death penalty, it is one of Europe's crowning achievements."
"This is clear from numerous discussions under way, including with the United States, where a number of agreements, especially as part of the fight against terrorism, cannot proceed unless there is a guarantee that the death penalty will not be applied to people extradited to the United States."
"We take a keen interest in the question of the death penalty everywhere."
"Mr President, I have noted that the issue of the death penalty has been raised by almost every speaker."
"I agree that this needs to be pushed and is an issue which is, in fact, the same in every system, in every country."
"As such, this issue deserves strong attention and more activity."
"In response to Mr Fava's remark - that by defending human rights we can avoid or prevent terrorism - I would also say that I only wish that were true."
"It would be extremely good if this really were the case."
"The world is more evil than that."
"There is extremism and it is not possible to avoid the problem totally by having our own record straight or even having global decency really move forward."
"This involves a number of fundamental problems, but having said this, I agree with the approach expressed in this formulation."
"Certainly, we have to be extremely careful not to damage these ideals by fighting terrorism."
"It is extremely important to maintain that balance."
"On the vote in the Commission on Human Rights, and as a reaction to Mr Gahler's remarks, it is not correct to state that the seven EU members of the Commission on Human Rights contributed to the election of the Libyan chair."
"I would like to mention for the record that this is not what appears from the figures in that vote."
"I have received six motions for resolutions"
"First of all, I wish to apologise, on behalf of Parliament, that the debates have been somewhat protracted."
"We shall take account of the views that have been put forward and shall of course endeavour to avoid this kind of situation arising in future."
"The next item is a continuation of the debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, before commenting on the question of the exploitation of the wealth of the Congo, I should like to say that, by reason of my position, and I speak here for the presidency of the Council, I am obliged to respect the presence and the modus operandi of the European Parliament and I shall do just that."
"I wonder if the European Parliament might find a way of establishing some sort of mutual respect or paying heed to the issues that arise from the functioning of the presidency, bearing in mind that the Greek Presidency will have to go back to Greece at some point within the not too distant future."
"In all events, even if Parliament cannot find a way and cannot abide by a few rules, we shall abide by them, as befits our position."
"Now on the question of the illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Congo, I have this to say: the international community has started to evince a keen interest in the illegal exploitation of natural resources in Africa over recent years, especially where they are used to fund long-term, catastrophic armed conflicts."
"The chairman of the United Nations Security Council made a statement in June 2000 calling on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to set up a committee of experts to investigate the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"This committee was set up and started work in September 2000 and published its final report in October 2002, in which it points out that high-ranking political, military and business figures in Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe, as well as the Congo, are plundering the natural - mainly mineral - wealth of the Congo on a massive scale for personal gain or, in the case of Rwanda, for their country's benefit."
"At the same time, again according to the committee's findings, Rwanda is funding its massive military budget mainly from resources taken from the Congo, occasionally using forced local labour."
"The European Union has refrained from passing a resolution on this recent report by the committee of experts until the Security Council does so."
"However, the European Union is in favour of introducing a ban and of imposing sanctions as and where necessary, preferably through the United Nations Security Council, rather than by individual countries or groups of countries."
"As far as one particularly controversial product is concerned - so-called blood diamonds - both the international community and the European Union have taken specific action."
"To be precise, thirty-seven countries and the European Parliament finalised a certification process for uncut diamonds at Interlaken in Switzerland in November 2002, the so-called Kimberley process, precisely in a bid to fight the trade in illegally mined diamonds from conflict zones, especially in Africa."
"The European Union also adopted Council resolution 2368/2002 on the application of the Kimberley certification process on 20 December, which is when it became operational."
"I should like to finish by pointing out that there is a basic vicious circle here that needs to be broken."
"Internal armed conflict opens the way for the illegal exploitation of the basic wealth of a country and in turn this wealth is exploited to perpetuate the internal armed conflict and the lack of development and stability mechanisms in the country."
"Madam President, Parliament has long been concerned about the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes Region in Africa in general."
"Fortunately, armed conflict in the region has ended. It is now time to launch the process of reconstruction."
"The future of the Democratic Republic of Congo and peace in that country depend on establishing democracy and sustainable development."
"As regards establishing democracy, we trust the Pretoria Agreement will prove an effective measure and will be implemented in sensible stages. The Pretoria Agreement is truly an all-encompassing and inclusive agreement."
"An all-embracing system of democracy can only be established if all associations and political groupings are included in the process."
"This is especially important in the Great Lakes Region where a breakdown in social order was the root cause of the wars that laid waste to the region."
"I welcome the meeting of the General Affairs Council held in Brussels yesterday and also the Commission's decision to send a significant amount of humanitarian aid to the worst affected areas."
"A number of major problems are still outstanding, however. They must be resolved to assure the future of the region."
"Such problems can only be tackled through sound political institutions, once implementation of the agreement is under way. The major problem I have in mind is that of a system of justice."
"Impunity is incompatible with democracy and there can be no peace without a system of justice."
"In this connection, I would like to table an amendment to indent 4 tomorrow. I would like to replace the phrase referring to other places, when these acts have been committed with one referring to other places, including the acts committed."
"The other element crucial to the future of the Democratic Republic of Congo is sustainable development."
"The countries and the companies of the European Union have a key role to play in this process."
"Companies can play their part by adopting an ethical code of conduct demonstrating commitment to sustainable development. Countries can be involved by establishing measures to limit the importation of goods of dubious origin."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists will relentlessly pursue its campaign demanding transparency and ethical standards from multinational companies in the developing world."
"In this regard, we attach great importance to compliance with rules on child labour, the ILO labour standards, the sustainable exploitation of resources and the OECD's guidelines on multinational companies."
"The United Nations report adopts a clear stance on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"We hope Member States, the Commission and Parliament will all insist on implementation of the report's recommendations."
"Madam President, my group has not added its signatures to the joint resolution."
"Of course we too agree that the illegal exploitation of the natural resources in Congo must be strongly condemned."
"Of course we too agree that people and companies who enrich themselves from war must be stopped and punished."
"We therefore welcome the fair analysis, the first in the hundred years since the plundering of Congo began."
"It is, therefore, quite simply a shame that the report is so sloppy and that it contains so many unfounded accusations and inaccuracies."
"This list of shame could have been an historic precedent, a warning to all leaders and business people who unscrupulously exploit the misery of millions for personal gain."
"Instead it has become a weak, contentious document based on rumours and war propaganda."
"Indeed, it has created an amalgam of illegal and illicit activities, and the persons and companies named in it were never heard, let alone given the opportunity to defend themselves."
"This is why the report was weighed and found wanting by the Security Council this week."
"The mandate of the experts was extended by six months."
"The Security Council is absolutely right to urge that all the named countries institute their own investigation on the basis of which legal action can be taken."
"We have submitted an amendment to this effect."
"Even more fundamental, however, is the question as to how illegal exploitation can be avoided and counteracted in the future; in other words, how a new stable and democratic order can be established in Congo that will ensure that the country's resources are exploited in a controlled and sustainable manner in order to benefit the entire Congolese population."
"The United Nations bears a colossal responsibility for this."
"It is to be hoped that the Security Council will also search its conscience, review MONUC's mandate, increase the number of troops and do everything necessary to speed up the application of the peace accords and the installation of new structures, so that in a few years' time it will not be faced once more with the realisation that Congo is still being plundered."
"Madam President, as a Belgian, this resolution appeals to me particularly because Congo used to be a Belgian colony."
"Other countries too in old and new Europe are, however, guilty of plundering the natural resources of Africa."
"It is simply not acceptable that this is still going on."
"It is now no longer the old mother countries but, deservedly or undeservedly, European companies who are named in the UN report."
"Europe must in any event take measures, because we have a collective historic responsibility."
"I have just returned from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil."
"I also listened to the Africans there."
"They are expecting a lot from Europe - for example, reparations of a kind."
"A committee of enquiry has been set up in the Belgian Senate which will look into the illegal trade in raw materials in the region of the Great Lakes."
"The main issue for Europe is that the Commission should propose a directive on the control of European companies that operate outside the European Union and that this directive should be quickly made law by every Member State."
"On the other hand, a control mechanism for the exploitation of raw materials in Congo must be set up."
"The United Nations has a more urgent assignment here than in Iraq."
"Madam President, much of the United Nations report refers to the role of Zimbabwean interests and gives startling evidence of how the actions of Mugabe's corrupt henchmen impact not just on their own people but also on neighbouring countries such as the Congo."
"The Mugabe regime is a criminal racket and a major factor of instability, not just in southern Africa but, as the report makes clear, in central Africa as well."
"The report describes the conflicts fought over minerals, farm produce, land and tax revenues by criminal groups linked to the Zimbabwean armed forces which have, for example, transferred at least five billion dollars' worth of assets from the state mining company in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to companies under its control."
"It is ridiculous even to think the Zimbabwean government could be asked to investigate its own activities."
"The report not only provides evidence of the involvement of Mugabe in these activities, but names a numbers of other senior Zimbabweans, four of whom are subject to the EU's restrictive measures but four of whom, to my astonishment, are not."
"The political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe is worsening with serious implications for the security situation."
"Two days ago, the United States government issued a travel warning urging United States citizens to consider departure from Zimbabwe."
"Is it not therefore bewildering to the oppressed people of Zimbabwe that two European governments now seek to delay the renewal and dilute the force of the travel ban and other restrictive measures that the European Union has put in place against the Mugabe regime and which are due to expire on 18 February 2003?"
"Is it not deeply offensive that one European Union government has invited Mugabe to a summit conference in Paris?"
"One reason why our measures have been ineffective so far is that they have not been rigorously enforced and their scope is too narrow."
"This is not the time to be reducing pressure on the Mugabe regime; instead, international action must be intensified."
"May I ask the President of the Council and the Commission, in accordance with the clearly expressed wishes of this House over a year or more, to insist that sanctions be renewed unequivocally and that the EU measures be extended to include all of those involved in this racket in Zimbabwe and the Congo."
"The European Union must be determined and consistent in its tough policy in relation to the Mugabe regime and see this matter through, for the benefit of all Zimbabweans."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad, but true, that if Iraq had nothing but dates, war against Baghdad would not even be on the agenda, even if the country were ruled over by a dictator."
"If the Congo did not possess such an incredible wealth of natural resources, Africa would have far less in the way of problems."
"The United Nations report has spelled out, albeit with perhaps insufficient clarity, the shameful forms of greed that give rise to the illegal exploitation of this wealth."
"The global community must find ways and means of putting a stop to this exploitation."
"There is a lamentable lack of responsibility, not only on the part of criminal elements, but also on the part of governments who would rather line their own pockets, and also in European business circles."
"European enterprises must be made aware that the unscrupulous exploitation of Africa's natural resources is not a petty offence, and so Europe's policies must set a good example."
"Illegal actions must be punished, and commercial undertakings must be made to comply with a code of conduct."
"Madam President, Mr Rod asked if we found his choice of words a little too direct."
"I certainly do not think the terminology was incorrect."
"We need to work on a much broader basis on the issue of transparency and the principles of licensing."
"I just came back from Angola and the discussion about creating more transparency on oil revenue for the government is an extremely important matter."
"Even if there are not conflicts as such, progress in this area is important also for economic reasons."
"In the event of conflict, it becomes totally brutal and perverse."
"Mr Gahler related what we discussed here to the broader issue of Africa, mentioning also the coming summit in Lisbon."
"One conclusion is that raising these problems with our friends in Africa collectively injects serious substance into the debates we can have at summits such as the one in Lisbon, which is one good reason why we have to ensure that the summit is a success."
"We can use those types of meetings to push these issues."
"Of course, this will be more effective if we have a clear and clean conscience ourselves."
"This is not just an issue in the form of a narrow debate."
"I definitely regard the link to using the OECD principles relating to this as a way of advancing transparency in relation to the issue."
"For the Commission, this is of the utmost importance."
"It is not enough to look at the public budget in a narrow sense when we talk about governance in our partner countries."
"I would mention, by way of example, the good effort which is now being tried out in the funding of the oil pipeline in Chad."
"This has now been incorporated into a framework of strong conditions governing transparency and the use of the revenue from that pipeline, in the context of the discussions between the World Bank, the IMF, ourselves and the government of Chad."
"This is just to illustrate that there are many things that it is possible to do in this."
"But definitely the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo is the worse of them all."
"In connection with this debate, I have received five motions for resolutions, submitted in accordance with Rule 37(2)"
"The next item is a report (A5-0002/2003) by Mr McCartin, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action taken by the Commission on the observations accompanying the decision giving discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 2000 financial year (Commission) [COM(2002) 696 - C5-0610/2002 - 2002/2189(DEC)]."
"Madam President, we granted a discharge to the Commission in April 2002 but we raised quite a number of questions in our motion for a resolution."
"The Commission has responded with a hundred comments and answers and explanations in a 60 page document."
"We now report in the follow-up, in our comment on the Commission's response."
"We underline once again that the Commission under the Treaties has an obligation to make available to Parliament all the necessary information."
"It is on this basis that Parliament can examine and investigate all the transactions so that the discharge is not only a procedure, but rather a substantial assurance to the European public that Parliament supervises on their behalf and that a rigorous and thorough investigation is carried out."
"In its work, Parliament relies heavily on the Court of Auditors' annual report and its special report."
"This forms an important basis for the issues that we raise and investigate."
"I believe that, in recent years, the Commission has tried very hard to supply Parliament and the European public with all the information necessary to produce a valid and fair assessment on how the budget is spent."
"In the on-going reform process, the Commission is moving in the direction of a system of control and accountability."
"This has, I believe, been said by the President of the Court of Auditors in this House."
"The Commission is moving towards a system of accountability which will compare with the highest standards of the Member States."
"An important point made again in the follow-up to the report is that 80% of the budget is actually administered by the governments of the Member States, while the Commission has final responsibility."
"A satisfactory outcome can only be achieved with the full cooperation and efficient administration of the individual governments of all Member States."
"The biggest problem still existing, as identified in our discharge motion for resolution, is the fact that, in the administration of the budget for the year 2000, there was under-utilisation of resources in the order of 14%."
"Again, we have commented on the recurrence of the same problem in the 2001 budget."
"This of course is a failure in the budgetary procedure but various comments have been made by different people and we have asked for a simplification of the regulations."
"I believe, however, that what is necessary is a simplification of regional policy and the bringing about of economic and social cohesion."
"The cohesion fund and the structural funds will have to be tailored to a more simplified policy if we are to pursue an efficient regional policy, particularly in the enlarged European Union."
"This is not a policy that is in transition but rather a policy that we will have for the foreseeable future, particularly with the imminent enlargement, and we must simplify the whole policy so that these funds can be spent."
"We also took note of the failure of the Commission to collect from the national governments money unduly paid and we note an outstanding amount of EUR 2.2 billion."
"We are dealing with viable, solvent democracies and while we have to note that the age profile has become lower - the debt is not as old as it used to be - nevertheless, there is no good reason why EUR 2.2 billion should be outstanding."
"The question has also been raised in our follow-up about the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor."
"We have to underline once again that this is the policy of the Parliament; the Committee on Budgetary Control has called for it, with the support of Parliament, on many occasions."
"The national governments do not pursue the obligations to investigate frauds and abuses in relation to European money with the same efficiency that they apply to their own national budgets."
"While that persists, we will persist with our call for the appointment of our own prosecutor, who can look after our own resources and be seen to do that."
"Madam President, honourable Members, Mr McCartin, last November, I had the opportunity to present to you the Commission's report on the measures we took following Parliament's resolutions on discharge in respect of the 2000 Budget."
"Mr McCartin has just mentioned that it ran to sixty pages, a fact that I had forgotten."
"I could describe to you in detail the many action plans that the Commission has conceived, implemented or already brought to a conclusion in its spheres of activity, which are very wide-ranging."
"The Commission attaches the greatest importance to Parliament's resolution - which now exists in draft form - on this report, and I am glad that the present resolution acknowledges the Commission's efforts to improve its financial management, and the steps it has already taken."
"In general, the draft resolution encourages the Commission to press on with the efforts it has made to date."
"At this point, I would like particularly to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for his good cooperation with the Commission."
"I would also like to thank him for the speech he has just made, for the substantial amount of time and effort he has expended on the report and for the in-depth attention he has devoted to it."
"Let me now briefly set out again the main steps that the Commission has taken with a view to improving financial management."
"I would like to start by discussing the implementation of reforms."
"The Commission has introduced a range of new instruments - what is termed 'activity-based management', APS, that is, annual political strategic planning, and the annual management plans."
"In 2002, the Directors-General, for the first time, submitted annual activity reports, which also specifically included financial management."
"I am unable, at this juncture, to list all the measures, but, among the priorities for 2002, I would like to give a special mention to the adoption of the new Financial Regulation and the drafting and adoption of the implementation provisions, along with the new financial regulations for the European Development Fund and also for the agencies."
"The new Financial Regulation reinforces the Budget principles, something constantly urged by the Court of Auditors and, I believe, something essential in a Financial Regulation."
"It gives the authorising officers an enhanced role and, above all, gives greater responsibility to the individual actors in financial activities, with the rules for procurement and the award of grants being tightened up and made uniform."
"These are just some of the essential points."
"Another priority for action in 2002 was the closure of the technical assistance offices, which we had the opportunity to discuss at the last meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"In order to make its internal financial management more efficient, the Commission has also, with the budgetary authority's support, introduced a wide range of measures to modernise and improve public services, and, in particular, submitted to the Council proposals for a new version of the Staff Regulations."
"In addition to that, decisions have been taken on administrative and disciplinary measures, and we have set up the Commission's Investigation and Disciplinary Office - IDOC for short."
"Another aspect of crucial importance to financial management is the Commission's restructuring of its external service."
"In order to better approximate programme planning to political priorities, we have drawn up strategy documents relating to countries and regions, and the management of the project cycle as a whole will from now on be the responsibility of a single body, EuropeAid."
"The Commission has also stepped up the so-called deconcentration of powers in the administration of external aid, transferring them to its delegations in order to guarantee more speedy and, above all, sounder implementation of financial aid."
"A second complex issue that I would like to deal with is that of the Budget surpluses, which Mr McCartin has also mentioned."
"The discrepancy between the payment forecasts for 2001 and the payments actually made by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund resulted, in essence, from the programmes for the new planning period having completed their initial phases rather more slowly than had been expected."
"An additional factor was that the payment forecasts submitted to the Commission by the Member States are often - if I may put it diplomatically - very optimistic."
"In the course of the Budget year 2002, the Commission had frequent occasion to remind the Member States of their obligations in this regard, in doing which it gave particular emphasis to the importance of estimates being as reliable as possible."
"Let me, furthermore, follow Mr McCartin in making brief reference to the simplification of the rules of the Structural Funds."
"One of last year's priorities was to make the utmost use of the opportunities for simplification without going through the entire decision-making process, in other words to have recourse to whatever was administratively feasible."
"With the general simplification of regulations and procedures in mind, the Commission has had recourse to a range of horizontal and sector-related initiatives, and it will now examine more closely, in the course of an ex ante evaluation of the effects of proposed legislation, which regulatory instruments are the best suited to the achievement of political objectives."
"The Commission will also draw up a comprehensive report on the realisation of its objectives - broken down by policy area - and will forward it to the Council and to Parliament."
"Recently - just before Christmas - the Commission also adopted a communication on improving the recovery of financial incentives provided in error from the European Budget."
"A task force, set up by OLAF and the Agriculture Directorate-General, is now at work dealing with the issue, mentioned by Mr McCartin, of what one may term the claims backlogs in the area of agricultural policy."
"I would like to underline the importance of the establishment of the internal audit service, which will monitor the control systems as well."
"I would like to conclude by mentioning that, in the Commission's view, our two institutions' framework agreement on the forwarding of confidential information has proved its worth and has - in accordance with the requirement for transparency - made it possible to provide Parliament with confidential information when the latter has requested this."
"Tomorrow, my fellow-Commissioner Neil Kinnock will be putting before the Commission his latest report on the state of play as regards reform."
"This report had been called for by Parliament, and I think that it, too, will be a sound basis for discussion in the current discharge procedure."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr McCartin's follow-up report on the Commission's management during the 2000 financial year, identifies clearly a number of issues which have caused debate and concern within the Committee on Budgetary Control. Under expenditure is one of the most important."
"The figure for 2001 was 16%. This situation should be prevented by improving the assessment of budgetary needs and the evaluation of running policies in order to optimise value for money for the European taxpayer."
"The problem of under expenditure is most worrying in the case of Structural Funds, in view of their objectives and of the important needs they address. Most recipients find the Regulations too complicated."
"In my view, applying the Regulations in a more flexible way could prove a solution to this difficulty. After all, the Structural Funds have a direct impact on citizens."
"As the rapporteur has requested, we should receive regular reports on progress in this area."
"It is essential to improve management of the recovery of unduly paid funds in order to improve budgetary control."
"The fight against fraud must be strengthened too. OLAF should report regularly on its actions, and should cooperate more closely with national courts of auditors and with the budgetary control authorities of Member States in order to assist the Commission in its work."
"We will support the amendment tabled by Mr Blak aimed at improving access to documents. This would facilitate the work of the House."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the aim of this report is to assess the Commission's implementation of the European Parliament's recommendations."
"This is a useful exercise that will add effectiveness and credibility to our work and on which I congratulate the Commission and also our rapporteur."
"I should therefore like to review the main issues concerning the common agricultural policy that I raised in the discharge of the 2000 Budget, whilst reminding you, as required by Rule 9(1) of our Rules of Procedure, of the fact that I am an olive-grower."
"The high risk and even the practical impossibility of effectively monitoring the operation of the export refunds system was our overriding concern at the time."
"We are pleased to note that, in his first annual report on the general activities of the European Union, the Director-General for agriculture has corroborated our viewpoint, in expressing his two main reservations about the Budget for this mechanism: firstly, that the Commission has reduced and simplified the system of refunds in the beef and veal sector and, secondly, that it is committed to gradually reducing the use of these mechanisms in line with negotiations at the World Trade Organisation."
"We feel bound, nevertheless, to regret the maintenance of export refunds for sugar for European countries from which we import sugar freely, because this seems clearly to be asking for further instances of the same roundabout fraud already detected in the field of butter."
"We note the Commission's intention to invest in the research and development of means to detect the falsification of oil, but we are unhappy that we are still spending absurdly high sums and imposing extremely expensive schemes on national and regional administrations, and also on oil producers, to monitor the number of olive trees, without any concern to prevent fraud, in total contrast with the lack of means to prevent and combat the large-scale fraud against the Community Budget, consumers and farmers that the falsification of oil represents."
"The same scenario or worse can be seen, incidentally, in the wine, dairy and most livestock product sectors."
"I still find it unacceptable that farmers who exceed their milk quotas are heavily fined and yet nothing is done to penalise dishonest companies and criminal networks that produce dairy products without milk."
"To conclude, I must state that the Commission's refusal to name companies who are given export refunds and other subsidies on the pretext that this would contravene the provisions on the protection of the individual is totally unacceptable."
"This is a concept of citizens' rights that operates only in the interests of multinationals and large business concerns and which does not exist to protect consumers or even farmers, who are frequently the victims of a diabolical and destructive bureaucratic machine."
"Madam President, Mr McCartin has drawn up an excellent report on matters that Parliament focused its attention on when it granted discharge for 2000. I wish to express my sincerest thanks for that."
"The way the EU budget is implemented is still unsatisfactory."
"This is particularly true of the way the Structural Funds programmes are implemented, which does not meet the requirements of good administration any more than it does the expectations of the public."
"The situation only got worse from 2000 to 2001 and the trend continued into 2002."
"In 2000, EUR 6.5 billion in Structural Funds appropriations remained unspent, in 2001 the figure was 10.5 billion, and last year it was 8.1 billion."
"The amount in unpaid commitments in respect of the Structural Funds has grown to EUR 66.7 billion, which is the equivalent of the budget for two years."
"The situation is very alarming."
"The Commission has been totally incapable of improving its administration: indeed, the situation is entirely beyond remedy."
"The EU's structural policy has to be thoroughly reviewed; this programming period threatens to be a real catastrophe."
"The review of staff regulations that began in 2000 and is still going on is one of the most important of the reforms."
"In the opinion of my group it is important that the staff regulations should support the key objectives of administrative reform: improved efficiency, clarification of staff responsibilities with increased accountability, and the downward delegation of power."
"It must be the obligation of every official to apply the whistle blowing procedure where necessary."
"On the other hand, everyone must also be accountable for his or her actions in the sense that people must face the consequences of making groundless personal accusations."
"The European Union must not become a place of espionage."
"There must be a more natural and swifter way to claw back EU funds paid out for no good reason."
"The present system is unwieldy and arbitrary, as is shown in the report by Jan Mulder, which we are to discuss next."
"Unfortunately, the Member States and the Commission are often on opposite sides of the negotiating table, even though they should really be on the same side."
"I think the practice initiated by Mr McCartin of providing yearly follow-up with regard to the reports on discharge is appropriate, because it brings a long-term quality to Parliament's monitoring of the Commission."
"Madam President, Commissioner, this report sends out an ambiguous signal."
"The rapporteur is giving the European Commission a pat on the head instead of the urgent stimulus that is needed to drastically improve management of the EU budget."
"This report makes the European Parliament dependent on the goodwill of the Commission instead of championing the interests of the many tax payers who want to see value for their money."
"I was not happy to see that the Commission is stating that most of the irregularities and fraud involving EU money take place in the Member States themselves."
"That may be so, but the Commission has the duty to manage the EU funds and is ultimately responsible for them."
"Virtually all special reports from the European Court of Auditors contain the comment that European regulations are too complex and too vague, objectives are not clearly defined and control systems are deficient."
"We must be able to approach the Commission on these issues."
"Compare this with the board of directors of a multinational denying responsibility for the efficiency of business activities that take place away from their head office."
"I have yet to encounter a shareholder who would accept that."
"It is obvious that the way the budget is managed by the Commission leaves much to be desired."
"The enormous structural budget surplus, a milk quota rule dating back to 1984 that is still not working properly, the uncertainty about the effectiveness of most of the structural measures, the deficient bookkeeping that is a source of problems including the claiming back of amounts from EU funds that have been paid out in error."
"I could easily fill up this list with other examples that show that the European Commission still has a great deal to do before there is any chance of receiving a positive Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors."
"Madam President, Commissioner, may I quote something?"
"When the great surpluses in the 2000 Budget year came to light, the Budget Commissioner, Mrs Schreyer, was quoted as saying, on 30 May 2001: 'Such a large surplus is an exception."
"It means that, in the 2001 Budget year, the Member States will be required to remit markedly fewer own resources to the European Union, 81 billion etcetera instead of 90.9 billion."
"I regard this as thoroughly good news for the Member States.'"
"End of quote."
"We know, Commissioner, that this was not an exceptional occurrence."
"The problem with this Budget surplus - for that is what we call it - is that the surpluses get bigger the longer the period lasts, or so we have been able to establish so far."
"So there is something intrinsically wrong with the system."
"It is not good news for anybody if we are not in a position to establish the reality of Europe's Budget."
"I am not going to stand up in front of the taxpayers and say, 'I stand for a Budget totalling EUR 90 billion, provided that only EUR 80 billion is actually spent!'"
"That is not good budgeting!"
"It is not you alone that I blame, Commissioner."
"I know that you are doing all that you can."
"We too, as the budgetary authority, have to do something, as do the Member States, but I tell you this: no Parliament with any self-respect, and committed to Budget reality can sit by and watch these things happening."
"In future, we will have to adjust the amounts and figures actually spent against what was originally planned, or the other way around."
"In the long term, that is just not on."
"In the long term, our citizens will not stand for it."
"That is the crucial point about this discharge procedure for the year 2000."
"As I have said, things got worse rather than better in 2001."
"This is something on which we have to work together."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is a report (A5-0447/2002) by Mr Mulder, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the reform of the procedure of the clearance of accounts [2002/2149(INI)]."
"- (NL) Madam President, when we look at the European agricultural policy, two things catch our eye."
"Firstly, it takes up almost half the budget - that is a widely known fact."
"Secondly we can state fairly generally that this policy is not held in particularly high esteem in Europe."
"I think that something needs to be done about this."
"Perhaps the proposals Mr Fischler made last week can improve things."
"I think that we must also ensure that the agricultural accounts are above suspicion."
"Now, agriculture is part of the European budget for which there is a special procedure for auditing the accounts - the clearance of accounts, as it is known."
"Every year, between EUR 600 million and EUR 800 million is claimed back from this budget of approximately EUR 45 billion."
"The big question is whether this is enough."
"Since 1996 we have had a new procedure that more or less involves closing the accounts annually and taking long-term decisions on the conformity of these accounts, in other words about the question as to whether this budget has been properly executed."
"In 1996 a conciliation body was set up to resolve any conflicts between the Commission and the Member States, and accreditation of the paying agencies responsible for execution and payments in the Member States was introduced."
"That is being left to the Member States."
"What experience have we had since 1996?"
"Firstly, following in the footsteps of the Court of Auditors, we can draw the general conclusion that there is a mixed system that is relatively satisfactory - but that is as far as it goes."
"There is clearly room for improvement."
"What improvements do we want to see?"
"We would like the decisions on discharge to be more clearly based on one specific financial year."
"At the moment these decisions still relate to different financial years, and that is ambiguous."
"In 1996 we also expected that everything would take place a lot more quickly, but that has clearly not been the case."
"With regard to the conciliation body, we had hoped that there would be fewer cases before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, but that has also not been the case."
"If a specific paying agency keeps making mistakes, the Commission should, in my opinion, have the opportunity to withhold payments for a couple of months until it is satisfied that the paying agency is functioning properly."
"The Commission might say that this does not tally with the system of proportionality and that the penalty is much too great."
"We are certainly not arguing for all payments of agricultural subsidies to a specific country to be suspended, however; what we are saying is that if things continuously go wrong in a certain sector, the Commission must be able to stop paying the money into the Member State's account until the situation improves."
"The control of agricultural subsidies is particularly important in view of the enlargement of the European Union."
"The system that will soon be used for making payments is the IACS system."
"We can see from the reports from the Court of Auditors that this system is not yet operational in any of the current Member States."
"We hope, as does the Commission, that it will be operational in a few months' time."
"We also note that Greece still does not meet the conditions despite having been a member for so many years."
"It is therefore all the more urgent that the Commission propose a firm approach to this matter and thus also refuse to pay the money if these things are not put right."
"We also think that it is a shortcoming that there is still no discharge arrangement for an increasingly more important part of the European budget, namely rural development, as there is for the 1 A part of the budget."
"Now I would like to touch on another of this Parliament's pet subjects: we would like to know from one year to the next which points can be said to have been improved."
"We are familiar with the DAS methodology and could envisage getting indicators about the size of the percentage error in the dairy sector or the tobacco sector, for example. This is something that Parliament has been wanting for some time."
"We would then be able to check from one year to the next how much improvement there has been."
"This evening the Council is conspicuous by its absence, which is highly regrettable given the importance of this subject."
"We would like to see the adoption of Parliament's proposal of about a year ago, to the effect that the period of time allowed for corrections should be extended from 24 to 36 months."
"In conclusion - again in the context of enlargement - we think that it is high time the Commission created ways of controlling agricultural subsidies better by paying them in advance so that we can avoid errors instead of having to correct them afterwards."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder on his excellent report and on the work he has carried out on the clearance of accounts."
"I must also extend these congratulations to Mr McCartin."
"We have, in fact, attempted to work, albeit holding different political points of view, in a direction that I believe is necessary to support a thoroughgoing reform of the common agricultural policy."
"In any event, I think it would be a serious mistake to see the clearance of accounts merely as an activity whose success can be measured according to the profits made."
"The need to recover funds from the Member States is primarily more an indication of failure than of success, because it demonstrates the poor functioning of the systems of farm subsidies."
"This is frequently due to the enormous complexity of these systems and the disproportionate bureaucratic burden that they impose both on the administrations and on the farmers themselves."
"Secondly, we must consider that the clearance of accounts in situations in which the Member State replaces food-producing or farming companies is an abusive form of State aid that distorts the rules of competition in a particularly unfair way, benefiting those who defraud the public purse and causing those who act honestly to suffer."
"Thirdly, the forms, processes and criteria with which this clearance of accounts is undertaken do not always appear to be as balanced as they could be."
"We note, for example, that with regard to the mega-scandal of butter falsified by the Neapolitan camorra and marketed by various European dairy companies, the Commission gave an answer only a few days ago, to the effect that, more than two years following OLAF's submission of its allegations, nothing has yet been done, with legal confidentiality continuing to be invoked as the reason for doing nothing."
"This is not acceptable."
"Lastly, I should like to refer to the establishment of an incentive mechanism of 20% for Member States to recover funds from the economic actors, which appears in principle to be a good idea."
"I feel, however, that the way this is being carried out by the Commission is unacceptable: we are quite horrified to hear that the Commission cannot tell us how much it has spent on this incentive, it cannot tell us what Member State institutions were given these funds and whether the legal conditions necessary to recover them were properly checked."
"This is a situation that we find totally unacceptable and we hope that the Commission will remedy it as soon as possible."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have before us Mr Mulder's report on the reform of the procedure for the clearance of accounts."
"This reform seeks to prevent the long delays in clearance decisions, which have been criticised frequently by the Court of Auditors."
"The first is an annual audit on the revenue and the expenditure of a single financial year. The second is a series of multiannual compliance audits intended to verify the substance of transactions and compliance with Community legislation."
"In addition, a conciliation procedure was introduced."
"Despite the difficulties entailed by this procedure, it has been shown to increase the responsibility of Member States, although it has not been as effective as was anticipated."
"The Conciliation Body has not been sufficiently effective either. It has however contributed to the overall improvement in the clearance of accounts."
"This report highlights how the procedure for clearance of EAGGF accounts requires further improvement. It puts forward a series of suggestions to this end."
"My group will therefore fully support the report."
"Finally, I would like to congratulate Mr Mulder on his report."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my broad support for Mr Mulder's own-initiative report on the reform of the clearance of accounts that has been approved by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"I am also of the opinion that it is still too early to deliver an opinion on the validity of the new system, because its complexity and the limited capacity of response of the Community's administrative institutions make it impossible for a definitive assessment to be given."
"It is noteworthy, however, that the European Parliament, political body par excellence, is concerned, on its own initiative and in line with the specific rules for studying proposals, with the way in which resources common to all of Europe are allocated and with the outcome of this allocation."
"The reform we are now studying must be developed, to enable information facilitating multiannual comparisons to be made available to the monitoring bodies in good time."
"This responsibility falls to the Commission, something that the rapporteur, Mr Jan Mulder, does well to point out, setting this in appropriate terms."
"I also share the concern and the recommendations of the rapporteur when he examines the strengths and weaknesses of the accreditation mechanisms, the implementation of financial corrections, the control of expenditure allocated to rural development and the new problems that will inevitably arise with the functioning of the Union under enlargement to twenty- five countries."
"We must also remember that the policy's primary focus must always be the allocation of financial resources, especially when dealing with less highly-developed countries."
"It is crucial that the management systems of the applicant countries are defined and integrated, promoting and developing both the delegation of powers to the Sapard agencies, and shortening the chain for implementing aid instruments."
"We cannot overlook the fact that the CAP is currently a potential source of equality and absorbs 47% of the Community budget, which requires the use of specific auditing and regulatory procedures."
"Lastly, I believe that, regardless of the current quantitative results of the conciliation process, this process must continue to be used and extended, because it is precisely by implementing it that all the advantages and disadvantages of a political consideration and decision on the implementation of Community funds can be exploited and validated, reserving for the judicial system the exclusive right to act on the fraudulent use of funds made available to Member States."
"Madam President, the report we have before us is certainly excellent. As I already said within the Committee on Budgetary Control, I can but support it."
"Crafted with meticulous attention to detail, it consists of two clearly differentiated parts and has two distinct aims. Firstly, there is a critical and rigorous assessment of the reform."
"Constructive criticism is applied to the deficiencies of the latter. These include the division of the clearance procedure, the structure and activities of the Conciliation Body and the financial corrections applied."
"The shortcomings are detailed in a constructive manner however, and solutions are proposed."
"Secondly, the rapporteur expresses rational and legitimate concern about the immediate impact of enlargement, which is nearly upon us."
"This concern relates especially to the consolidation of the Integrated Administration and Control System in all Member States."
"Everything should also be in place for this system to be implemented in the candidate countries as soon as enlargement takes place."
"The lessons learnt about the SAPARD programme are also cause for concern."
"In my view, the critical assessment and concern detailed in this report constitute a timely warning. We should heed it."
"I therefore welcome the report wholeheartedly."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the flexibility he displayed during the proceedings in the Committee on Budgetary Control. His approach ensured that the report was adopted unopposed."
"This represents a considerable achievement."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is a report (A5-0004/2003) by Mrs Korhola on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending, with regard to public participation and access to justice, Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC [PE-CONS 3676/2002 - C5-0598/2002 - 2000/0331(COD)]."
"Madam President, the proposal now before us is the second of three directives that aim to bring legislation in the Member States in line with the Århus Convention."
"Just as with the first directive on access to environmental information, the third reading has now taken into account the result of conciliation, which represents Parliament's position very clearly, and which meets the minimum requirement in the Århus Convention fully and even goes beyond it."
"The Council adopted many elements from Parliament's first reading in its common position, in the same way that Parliament was able to adopt many elements from the common position."
"We thus set out to achieve conciliation with considerably fewer problems than there were with regard to the first pillar."
"On the other hand, just these few issues caused huge problems, owing to differences in approach."
"The Commission proposal and the Council's common position are rooted in the 'quick fix' principle, while Parliament had hoped for a broader, horizontal approach."
"Obviously, however, it is not Parliament's aim to defend its position to the letter, but instead ensure that there are no grey areas left in EU legislation where public participation would be justified but impossible owing to some blunder on the part of a legislator."
"During conciliation we were able to find a two-stage solution to the problem."
"On the one hand, the requirements concerning public participation in line with the Århus Convention are to be included in new Community legislation from the outset."
"On the other hand, existing legislation and the field covered by the directive are to be reviewed on the basis of the experience gained during the first six years of its application."
"During conciliation the Member States undertook to promote practical opportunities for public participation."
"Authorities will be encouraged, for example, to inform the public about decisions taken, and the reasons and considerations upon which they are based, and public participation processes."
"The time limits for participation in decision-making at the various stages must be reasonable, so that the public can prepare and participate in decision-making effectively."
"In addition, authorities will be encouraged to promote environmental education of the public, which will also undoubtedly be in the authorities' own interests, in that the extent to which people participate effectively can only improve through education."
"The matter of public participation in the updating of permits was of particular significance."
"The parties involved in the conciliation process wanted to find the right balance in this matter."
"On the one hand, the public could genuinely participate when it is vitally important to check the operating permits of installations and factories, such as when there is a danger of an increase in the amount of environmental harm being done."
"On the other hand, an authority could check permits without any public participation when implementing acts and regulations where it is genuinely not a matter of discretion."
"I think we have succeeded here: the public can participate when decisions on the environment are actually being made, but the importance of a precious instrument for participation is not being inflated by asking the public to participate in routine decision-making."
"What was for Parliament an important victory in principle, albeit small in scope I suppose, was when during conciliation a process for exclusions relating to national defence projects was adopted."
"In accordance with the Århus Convention, projects relating to national defence may be excluded from the scope of the directive only on the basis of case-by-case decisions by the Member States' authorities."
"After decisions are taken following public participation the public must naturally be able to evaluate them."
"In conciliation we arrived at a solution that is satisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned."
"The public right of access to information about the reasons for granting or refusing a permit is to be endorsed and the authorities required to provide the public with practical information, if required, about access to administrative and judicial review procedures."
"It should be mentioned in particular that, in order to ensure the result of the conciliation procedure does have an effect, the Commission has undertaken, in a statement to be annexed to the directive, to submit in the first quarter of 2003 a proposal for a directive concerning the implementation of the Århus Convention as regards access to justice in environmental matters."
"We can therefore be confident that the ratification process of the Århus Convention on the whole will make headway in the Community without undue delay."
"I would like to thank the Commission, the Council and especially Denmark, the country that held the presidency, now transferred to Greece, for their excellent levels of cooperation during conciliation and in the unofficial discussions that preceded it."
"I heartily recommend that Parliament endorse the results of the conciliation procedure in tomorrow's vote."
"."
"(SV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am naturally very pleased that this directive, which the Commission proposed around two years ago, is now going to be adopted."
"It supplements the Directive on environmental information."
"With it, the EU is taking a step closer to the implementation of the Århus Convention."
"The principles of the Århus Convention are very important, because the environment does not have its own vote, so to speak."
"Decision-making on environmental matters must, therefore, be open and transparent if we are to afford the environment sufficient protection."
"The scope of this directive covers fundamental requirements for public participation in decision-making on the environment."
"This directive establishes a necessary common framework that also covers matters with a cross-border dimension. The details are left in the hands of the Member States, however."
"This is important, because public participation must be at the heart of all levels of administration, and the forms it takes must be adapted to decision-making at the various levels."
"The directive covers, on the one hand, important plans and programmes to be drawn up in accordance with our environmental legislation, and, on the other hand, decisions on activities that can have a significant impact on the environment."
"These activities are covered by the Directive on environmental impact assessment and the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control."
"These two directives are now being supplemented with provisions on public participation and access to justice in accordance with the Århus Convention."
"By 'public participation' the directive means that the public must be informed about the activities in question and its own right to participate."
"The section of the public affected is to have the right to comment on a matter at an early stage."
"Lastly, public bodies are to take due account of the outcome of public participation when making decisions and make their decisions known."
"The directive also contains provisions on reviewing the legality of decisions that fall within the scope of the provisions."
"I should of course like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Korhola, for her intensive work on the directive, and express my gratitude to her and to the members of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee for the efforts they have made towards reaching this agreement, which has made it possible for us to adopt this important act tonight."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one of the complaints most frequently made by the citizens concerns their limited role in representative democracy."
"It is precisely in the area of the environment that people's dissatisfaction has been most deeply felt."
"We are all aware of cases in which, when confronted with certain projects or installations, the citizens feel compelled to express their right to be indignant in the streets or in the courts."
"This indignation increases exponentially when many of these projects with unacceptable environmental impacts are funded under the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds."
"It was therefore very important that, in the wake of the Aarhus Convention, the Commission has legislated on public participation and public access to information."
"I therefore congratulate the Commissioner for the Environment."
"Greater public participation will not only give greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions but also enhance the quality of these decisions."
"This proposal for a directive on public participation in drawing up certain environmental plans and programmes is a good example of how the citizens' participation in politics can be made more democratic."
"I also congratulate our rapporteur on the work she has done in Parliament and also in the Conciliation Committee."
"I should like to highlight three main results of this Conciliation."
"Firstly, the fact that NGOs should participate fully in the debate on access to information in this process; secondly, the fact that all Community legislation has to explicitly define conditions for public participation; and thirdly the mandatory participation of the public in cases considered to be significant."
"Lastly, I welcome the announcement made by the Commissioner that we will have legislation on citizens' access to justice before the end of 2003."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the results of conciliation overall are good and worthy of our support."
"The aim of the directive is to harmonise Community legislation with the Århus Convention."
"It has already been said here that the directive will fully entitle the public to participate in the decision-making process right from the start, especially as regards planning and the implementation of programmes, the environmental impact evaluation process, the prevention of pollution, and the reduction in pollutants in general."
"It will also allow the decision-makers to take the views and concerns of the public into account when making decisions."
"This will obviously and quite properly increase the transparency of the decision-making process and help to increase public interest in, and knowledge about, environmental issues."
"The requirements concerning public participation in line with the Århus Convention are to be included in future in relevant Community legislation from the outset."
"It is also important that authorities should also inform the public about the reasons for their decisions to a much greater extent."
"It is important in general too that on many points it is required that the information given is supplied in language that is clear and that the authorities help the public to understand the information that is available."
"It is also good that public participation is to increase in the most important areas of all, that the public right of access to information about the reasons for granting or refusing a permit is being endorsed, and, once again, that authorities will be required to provide correct, clear and explicit information."
"On this basis I believe we can expect the public's inclination to have an influence on environmental issues to grow."
"Madam President, I have to say that we welcome with interest, almost with some enthusiasm, the decisions taken recently which have now been included in these documents on public participation - one might almost say, playing on words, at least as far as Italian is concerned, 'private participation', for the word 'public' usually refers to public structures or institutions whereas, here, it is intended to denote the participation of the citizens, of associations - in this process: a process which is not new today but was already present in previous acts of the European Union and in the context of which an evaluation had been set in motion, within certain constraints, of transparency, of objectivity and of the citizens interest in environmental issues being dealt with in a certain way."
"We are now faced with something more, something different, and that is positive."
"Indeed, what is happening through this process?"
"We hope that the impetus to act - starting before the moment of decision-making - will come via those who are closest to the region, to the town, to the environment, and that it will then be taken up, transformed and handed back down in the form of guidelines, requirements and, if necessary, constraints, regulated through these rules by those with the authority to do so."
"Basically, we must give the citizens the ability to act in a sector which does, indeed, concern them, which concerns even those who do not want to be involved, for the consequences of environmental damage affect the citizens first and foremost."
"I must point out, in conclusion, that it will not, however, be at all easy to harmonise the different national laws with European requirements and directives."
"The debate is closed."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Wallström and the Commission, and also Mrs Korhola, for their constructive cooperation, because it was I who led Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee on this subject."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is a report (A5-0003/2003) by Mrs Hautala on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 98/70/EC [PE-CONS 3677/2002 - C5-0608/2002 - 2001/0107(COD)]."
"Madam President, I will now present here the final appraisal of the directive on fuel quality, which we originally adopted in this House in 1998."
"At the time, as a result of a fairly heated debate and decision-making process, the European Parliament managed to push through the world's most stringent quality requirements for fuel in road vehicles."
"We quarrelled particularly with the oil industry about whether there was a need to lower sulphur levels in petrol and diesel fuel."
"We actually had to put forward an enormous number of arguments to get the reform through that would reduce the sulphur content of diesel and petrol to a considerably lower level than it was then."
"This turned out to be a very strategic and wise move."
"Lowering the sulphur content of fuels will perhaps have proved even more important when we try to reduce air pollution."
"The essence of this reform, which we in Parliament are today getting prepared for the home straight, is now that by 2009 only petrol and diesel fuel which is, in practice, virtually sulphur-free will be permitted to be sold in the European Union."
"This will be very important in that we will really be able to purify car exhaust emissions to a greater extent than before."
"The reason why this reform is more important now than the previous one, however, is that car manufacturers are continually developing engines which are cleaner and which produce fewer emissions."
"These new engines, like direct injection engines, for example, will inevitably need these sulphur-free fuels."
"We should be satisfied with the end result."
"We succeeded in getting the Commission and the Council to agree that sulphur-free fuels would be on the market by 2009, bringing forward the time frame by two years."
"I would say, if predictions can be made here, that this situation will come about earlier than this anyway because many Member States have realised that this process can be speeded up substantially by granting very small tax concessions for cleaner fuels."
"I might perhaps say that Sweden and Finland were the countries where this was realised earlier on and clean fuels were brought onto the market very swiftly."
"In 2005 this directive will be reviewed. It is to be decided then whether there can in fact be sulphur-free diesel fuel by 2009."
"As rapporteur, I am only sorry that with this general solution we have not decided now that sulphur-free diesel fuels will be on the market in 2009."
"I think this interim evaluation in 2005 only complicates matters, but we did not succeed in getting this through in Parliament at second reading."
"The suspicion has arisen that the production of sulphur-free diesel fuel would mean increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions."
"I, however, believe that it would have been quite possible to introduce this reform now as any disadvantages of sulphur-free fuel production are offset by the fact that new cars are coming onto the market at a faster rate than ever and carbon dioxide emissions are becoming fewer as a result."
"The re-evaluation in 2005 will also involve discussion on how sulphur-free or low-sulphur fuels for mobile machinery can be brought onto the market."
"This was perhaps the most problematic issue of all in the conciliation discussions."
"I myself would say I am fairly satisfied with the end result, which is that sulphur-free fuels will be introduced for tractors and other mobile machinery by 2009."
"I do not believe that farmers will have to pay a very great deal more for this as costs in general will ultimately fall."
"Madam President, I wish to correct one thing in the documentation. It says that Parliament adopted one amendment at first reading."
"This is not true."
"I would like it recorded in the Minutes that Parliament adopted 36 amendments at first reading."
"We shall check that and make sure that it is correct."
"."
"(SV) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is good that we have reached agreement on this directive: it forms an important part of our overall strategy of reducing air pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases."
"Directive 98/70/EC will enable us to ensure that the sale of leaded petrol is phased out."
"Once the new directive has been adopted, it will pave the way for the introduction of zero-sulphur fuels, which will be available throughout the EU by 1 January 2005 at the latest."
"Sulphur in fuel can impair the effectiveness of several existing and emerging technologies, such as three-way catalytic converters, oxidation catalysts, NOx Storage Traps and particulate traps."
"That is why it is so important to phase in zero-sulphur fuels."
"The phasing-in of zero-sulphur fuels will be complete by 1 January 2009."
"The manufacturers will thus be able to exploit the full potential of technologies in reducing the emission of pollutants, for example, nitrogen dioxide and particles constituting a serious threat to air quality and human health."
"The adoption of this directive is really good news for health and the environment in Europe."
"I would therefore thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and all the Members who have contributed to the adoption of this act."
"Madam President, work on the amendment of this Directive began over a year ago."
"We have finally reached an agreement and I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala on such a satisfactory outcome."
"We encountered a number of difficulties during the first reading, but I believe we have now reached compromises acceptable to all."
"As we heard, this amendment will mean that trade in diesel and petrol with a sulphur content exceeding 10mg/kg will be banned from 2005."
"The ban will be implemented gradually, with a total prohibition coming into effect from 2009."
"I think this is a good solution and a good compromise. Whatever your point of view however, although this measure will improve air quality, the production of the new fuels will undoubtedly cause an increase in emissions from refineries."
"If the production and sale of new fuels do not go in tandem with renewal of the fleet of vehicles, there may be an overall increase in carbon dioxide emissions. Considerable costs would be incurred too, as it is much more expensive to produce these fuels."
"It is therefore important for the Commission to assess the progress made. In 2005 it should also revise the date after which only low-sulphur diesel may be sold, especially where diesel agricultural tractors and road vehicles are concerned."
"This is because diesel vehicles are replaced far less frequently than their petrol counterparts and their fuel consumption is relatively low. There is a risk that the improvements in air quality we all hope for may not be achieved."
"Finally, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the biofuels Directive, I have to say that I think the Commission should authorise biofuel mixtures in excess of 5% as a matter of urgency. It should propose new specifications on levels and new testing methods for biofuels and for fuels used by the inshore fleet."
"Several makes of car are currently able to run on mixtures exceeding 5%. There are however, no technical standards relating to vehicles of this type."
"Though the latter are not set in stone, they ought to be met. If countries are not able to use biofuel mixtures, it will be very difficult for them to do so."
"Biofuels significantly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and are a useful way of improving air quality."
"I would like to end by congratulating the rapporteur warmly once again, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Congratulations are due also of course to the Commission and the Council."
"Madam President, I am last but not least and I hope I shall not take three minutes."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group, I would welcome the results of the conciliation."
"The decision to move towards low sulphur diesel across the Union should mean an end to the noisy, smelly, expensive and rather larger diesel engines and other off-road vehicles that disturb our air quality, the peace of our environment and communities."
"We recognise the importance of taking into account the possible economic and social consequences of this change, in particular for the agricultural industry, and therefore welcome the sensible transition periods given and the encouragement of appropriate tax incentives."
"We hope this will encourage bringing about change in a painless way."
"We also support the need for an on-going review of the situation to ensure progress does not give rise to social or economic problems."
"Therefore, on behalf of the Socialists, I would recommend the report to the House and thank the rapporteur for all the work she has done, as well as all the other people who have been involved in this long process."
"We hope that we will now see some genuine results from our endeavours."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.12 p.m.)"
"World hunger and the elimination of barriers to trade with the poorest countries"
"The next item is the Commission statement on world hunger and the elimination of barriers to trade with the poorest countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there is nobody here who cannot see that the world is divided by a gulf separating those who have food from those who are hungry, those who can read and write from those who are illiterate, those who have access to healthcare from those who are not entitled to this."
"There have been countless statistical reports. The most recent, the report by the World Food Programme, warns us that 38 million people are likely to die from lack of food, drinking water and medicines in the coming months."
"Yet we must openly admit that the international community is not yet doing enough."
"This is not the central item on our political agenda, as it should be. This is not the main criterion considered by the Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the G8 in their actions."
"If we do not change our approach and speed up our action, if we do not succeed in regulating the globalisation processes with environmental and social sustainability, the historians of the future will judge our civilisation very harshly for this failure."
"Let us focus on the diseases related to poverty, on malaria and tuberculosis. Let us consider AIDS, a scourge which has already claimed 25 million victims, let us remember the 14 000 people throughout the world who contract the HIV virus every day."
"Prevention is essential but it is not everything."
"It will be difficult to find excuses in the future for the fact that we do not succeed in treating 95% of the people suffering from AIDS."
"It will seem a real crime, considering that modern medicine can do a great deal to change AIDS from a terminal disease into a chronic condition and, in particular, to reduce the risk of transmission from mother to child."
"Therefore, the European Union must put active pressure on the United States so that an agreement can, at last, be reached to exclude from intellectual property rights and patentability those drugs which, if used freely, will save the lives of millions of people."
"This would go hand in hand with the intention to give a greater financial undertaking and with this draft regulation, which we hope will be adopted without delay at first reading."
"Similarly, the decision to grant free access to the European market to products from less developed countries is important."
"The European Union must now shoulder the responsibility of expressing the principles and positions we are discussing today in all international fora, starting with the World Trade Organisation."
"Only thus, with a new form of governance on a world-wide scale, with greater participation and transparency, with practical decisions and measures, will we be able to combat hunger and poverty and win this challenge, the greatest challenge facing mankind."
"Mr President, since the attention of the world is focused on the huge crisis of Iraq, it is the duty of Parliament and of all people of good will to shift considerable attention back onto the issue of combating hunger, as the European Parliament is striving to do today, not least in the light of the - I am sad to say, disappointing - results of the most recent summits, the most recent international talks."
"Quite frankly, I would include among these the difficulty of converting a genuine impetus generated by many non-governmental organisations for rapid change and for a policy of assembling critical voices into a positive drive for change and reform, and, in this regard, I would refer to the recent statements of the President of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, who both calls upon the institutions to do more and calls upon civil society to direct its critical gaze at the shortcomings of globalisation in a constructive way, setting substantial goals."
"I would point out that it is right, including in the instrument before Parliament today too, for greater attention to be given to the dreadful situation in some parts of Africa, particularly Ethiopia, where some millions of people are in real danger of losing their lives."
"It is clear to all - and the document we are about to adopt illustrates this well - that the situation can only be improved by correcting and modifying the structural errors and dreadful inadequacies of many governments which have continued to channel their money in the wrong direction, despite the fact that experience has shown, in the light of the facts, that it is necessary to change their approach in order to eliminate the root causes of poverty, the root causes of hunger and malnutrition and the lack of information whose consequences are an appalling health crisis and the denial of education and training to tens or hundreds of millions of people."
"Moreover, it is clear to all that, in many cases, barriers to trade are another key factor which needs to be eliminated."
"That would bring more freedom and, therefore, greater competition and more opportunities in addition to urgently-needed humanitarian measures."
"This is what the European Parliament is striving for, and I believe we must all support it today."
"Mr President, the world's food situation is indeed tragic and is growing increasingly serious."
"Millions of human beings live in extreme poverty and every hour of the day many die of hunger."
"It is therefore crucial that rapid and far-reaching measures are adopted in order to put an end to this situation, which must surely weigh on humanity's conscience."
"It is therefore crucial that we adopt structural measures that are capable of preventing conflicts arising. It is equally crucial to follow up these fundamental measures with emergency measures to save lives now."
"The emergency humanitarian aid that has been provided to date has proved to be inadequate, where both food and medical supplies are concerned."
"We must, for example, provide a more substantial response to campaigns for high-risk areas, such as the awareness-raising campaign 'Hunger in Africa', launched by the World Food Programme."
"We must also support timely initiatives such as those launched very recently by the new president of Brazil, Lula da Silva, both the initiative intended to eliminate hunger in his country, with the programme 'Zero Hunger' and the other initiative presented in Davos, which is of a universal nature and calls for an international fund to be created to combat poverty and hunger in the countries of the developing world."
"It is equally crucial however, as I mentioned previously, that fundamental measures are adopted, breaking first of all with a model that has proven to be inadequate and unfair, which places the least developed countries in an inferior position and treats them shabbily - particularly by claiming that everything can be resolved through trade - which perpetuates an unfair system of trade that attaches sole priority to economic growth and ignores the importance of a fair distribution of the wealth that is created."
"We need a new world economic order, in particular one that contains profound changes in the bodies that are today crucial and which have guidelines that are out of kilter, such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank."
"A definitive solution must be found to the problem of debt and it is particularly necessary to ensure stable prices that compensate for the traditional forms of production in the least developed countries, mainly in the primary sector."
"Priority must also be given to food sovereignty and food safety, in particular by guaranteeing that natural and human resources are harnessed and that people have access to land and water."
"Mr President, this resolution contains a long list of excellent observations and proposals."
"There is almost no aspect of the problem that it does not discuss."
"That being said, we must, however, state that our arrangements so far have been quite inadequate."
"We also state in this resolution that the gap between developed and developing countries became wider during the 1990s."
"I think it important to emphasise three shortcomings of the resolution."
"First of all, no mention is made of efforts to reduce the birth rate in the developing countries, given that poor countries are quite obviously in no position to create economic growth that can keep pace with the very rapid increase in the number of inhabitants of these countries."
"Secondly, the resolution contains no discussion of the internal states of affairs that prevent people in the developing countries from living in freedom."
"We recoil from removing those dictators who destroy people's living conditions and the structures of their countries."
"We want to have clean hands, and we believe that everything can be achieved through diplomacy, but we have to observe - as the resolution does too - that a great many of the countries whose populations suffer hardships quite simply do not have the freedom that is necessary for people to be able to change their situation. During the Iraq debate yesterday, we again saw very clearly that we do not want to make a point of removing these dictators by means other than words and diplomacy."
"Only the United States is prepared to remove the oppressors by force."
"Thirdly, our resolution indicates the need to reduce tariff barriers, but we forget to say that we lack credibility because our agricultural policy entails our dumping products on the poor countries' markets, so destroying their own agriculture's potential."
"Our civilisation lacks, as it were, the basis for appearing 'worthy of imitation', because we cannot implement in our own countries the economic and political changes that are a basic condition for changing the trade situation and for our being at all able to improve the disastrous situation the world is in."
"It is disgraceful that we are in no position to take more far-reaching decisions in this area."
"I hope that everyone who votes in favour of this otherwise excellent decision today will be consistent and vote against the EU budgets that authorise the agricultural subsidies so damaging to the developing countries."
"Developing countries that are in crisis are a good reason to call for more attention to be paid to the food shortage and its relationship with trade."
"The resolution deals with problems that lie at the root of the crisis of which the food shortage is the persistent result."
"The global economic recession is certainly taking its toll."
"Economic decline hits poor countries hardest."
"This concept is extremely relevant to the relationship between hunger and trade, although it is not mentioned in the joint resolution."
"This omission soon results in poor countries being shown up as being insufficiently willing to liberalise or as having domestic structures that are too weak to cope with healthy economic development."
"In addition to this cause of acute food shortages, I would like to mention another external factor: the debt problem."
"Was debt cancellation not agreed in the context of the 'jubilee year' 2000?"
"No more than half of the debt cancellations promised in 2000 have been realised to date."
"This is directly linked to trade, as exports are often used to pay off foreign debts."
"As long as a country is not free of this burden of debt, therefore, there will be constraints on the impetus that trade can offer for development in the country itself."
"Thirdly, there is the risk of going over the top in the quest for liberalisation."
"The resolution asks for developing countries to be given the leeway to make their sectors sufficiently strong before tackling international competition, and rightly so."
"Prescribing one-sided protection measures is going too far, however."
"This request for a sensible method and degree of liberalisation shows the sense in controlling the WTO process, a point that the resolution is right to touch on."
"It would be better if this control was carried out in a national context rather than by international institutions."
"The minister is, after all, responsible and approachable."
"The European Commission may be an important player in Europe, but this does not change the principle: the WTO members determine the course of trade liberalisation."
"Responsibility therefore lies primarily on that level; it is also most clear-cut there and forms part of national policy with which the citizen can identify. Conversely, this clarity is much less evident in international bodies with a large number of players and interests, such as a parliamentary assembly."
"Fourthly, there are of course also factors that fall under the sphere of influence of developing countries themselves, such as good management and a strong economic structure."
"A greater diversity of export products forms part of this."
"The ACS Agreement has not yet resulted in this diversification in the exports of the least developed countries."
"I would like to find out what the European Commission's strategy is with regard to actual diversification and what efforts it is making to achieve this."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner has arrived, as I would like to address this question to him."
"Another point of ongoing concern is HIV/AIDS and the disastrous effects this has on the body, social relationships and the economic structure."
"In this regard I would specifically like to ask to what extent the European Commission uses the highly preventative effect created by marital fidelity."
"Incidentally, is the Commission willing to allow the scope for this in its policy on the basis of the highly successful results achieved in various African countries where this forms part of the information strategy?"
"Finally, I would like to say that the resolution is to a certain extent bogged down in highlighting problems and does not mention any strong approaches to their resolution."
"Because of the balanced approach to the issues in the problem, the resolution nevertheless gets my support."
"The Commissioner has, at last, arrived, having survived the traffic jams."
"I think the best thing is to let him listen to the rest of the debate and then give him the floor at the end to comment on the speeches he is able to hear now in the House."
"Mr President, I am very happy to hear what Commissioner Nielson has to say, although I feel that we should have been talking to Commissioner Lamy today."
"In a question I submitted to the Commission, endorsed by several of my fellow Members - whom I would like to thank - and which has led to today's debate, I focused on the problem, which we have addressed in the past and are continuing to address in part, of the link between trade protectionism and world hunger and poverty."
"You see, I believe that opening up the markets is, in political terms, more costly than granting aid."
"In today's debate, too many plans are being addressed, in my opinion; it would be better to concentrate on this issue and press the Commission in this regard."
"Opening up the markets means challenging the market positions of extremely strong lobbies, particularly the agricultural lobby in Europe and the United States, the textile lobby in Europe and the United States, and so on."
"This type of policy is much more difficult, I repeat, than policies to grant aid, something which probably no-one - and I mean taxpayers - realises; but it is by opening up the markets, much more than by granting aid, that we can give hundreds of millions of people real, lasting opportunities to escape from hunger and poverty and lay the structural foundations, including legal foundations, for economic growth, and civil growth too, in a spirit of freedom and democracy."
"In this regard, the European Union - and this is why I am happy to listen to the Commissioner - is not doing enough, it has to be said; it is going through the motions with the United States, but it is not doing enough: it did not do enough in Doha and it is not doing enough in the proposal on what are known as the modalities for the negotiating round concerning trade in agricultural products, which will follow Doha, maintaining excessively high protection levels and still including tariffs which will be reduced too far in the future."
"This resolution is a compromise resolution, and it is showing the consequences of this: suffice it to say that the operative part contains 27 items."
"That is to say it sets out the sum total of human knowledge on world hunger, AIDS, poverty and so on. It retains some important points, in particular the Commission's request to step up the implementation of the 'Everything But Arms' initiative by the end of 2003."
"We have been striving, commendably, to liberalise our markets in all products, except arms, for the world's 48 poorest countries, but we have said that for three basic products - bananas, rice and sugar - we will delay abolishing duties until 2009."
"If abolishing duties has a purpose - and it does - in the fight against poverty, then please let us do it now."
"Mr President, the European Commission's Everything But Arms initiative was and is an important breakthrough that enables the poorest countries to gain access to the European market without quantitative or tariff barriers."
"Unfortunately this proposal was seriously toned down for rice and sugar at the time and was postponed following pressure by the European sugar industry and sugar-producing countries."
"It is still important to realise that a country like Mozambique, which was completely dependent on food from elsewhere as a result of an endless civil war, is now able to provide her own food thanks to good internal distribution."
"This has to do with the construction of water systems, good environmental management and the participation of local farmers."
"With external help, the local systems were repaired after the floods."
"In short, a success story."
"The link with European agricultural protectionism is nevertheless very distressing in this case as well."
"Under normal circumstances, Mozambique would earn as much from her sugar production on the world market as she now receives in international aid."
"The situation is not normal, however, as consumer prices are artificially high in Europe, and are therefore ruining the world market."
"This naturally requires a restructuring of our industry, including a social plan."
"Our refusal to break through our protectionism structurally undermines poor countries' own food supplies."
"It is complete lunacy if the final stage in this vicious circle of hunger consists of dumping our surpluses on the markets we have already undermined through low world market prices."
"We must continue to buy from the regions themselves as an absolute priority, even if the price is slightly higher."
"In short, our proposals to turn Doha into a development round require more than the current Commission proposals."
"The Commission has proposed cutting export subsidies by 45%, but in Doha we were talking about abolition."
"Forty-five per cent is only a start, and things must go a lot faster."
"A one-third cut in tariffs is not enough either, and the Commission's proposal to get tariffs on agricultural imports from developing countries down to zero must go further than just half of these imports."
"This is of great importance when it comes to bridging the gap between the developed and the developing world."
"It goes without saying that good governance, a good regional agricultural policy that does not throw everything into exports but concentrates first on local self-sufficiency coupled with regional trade, are likewise indispensable."
"The help of the EU is very important in this regard."
"Europe now gives with the one hand and takes away with the other."
"Protectionism."
"It is high time Europe started making a difference and really started cooperating with these countries."
"Mr President, the statistics in relation to world hunger are indeed staggering."
"By the time it takes to discuss this topic, almost one thousand people will have died of hunger somewhere in the world - the majority of them in Africa."
"At the present time, there are about 800 million people in the world who do not have enough food and this includes 300 million children."
"Perhaps the most frightening aspect of all of this is that the situation is not improving."
"On the contrary, over the past decade, the gap between rich and poor, between the 'haves' and the 'have nots', between the well fed and the hungry has grown even wider."
"We, who are fortunate enough to be born into a part of the world where there are no food shortages, drought or famine, have a moral responsibility to work towards a more just world."
"I do not refer simply to food aid."
"I accept that the EU is the world's largest donor of development aid."
"We need to look at the root causes of poverty and hunger so these can be tackled and thereby eliminated in the long-term."
"In terms of creating a fair trading system, the EU has made a significant contribution with its 'everything but arms' initiative."
"We have committed ourselves to fully eliminating the customs duties applied to the export of the world's 48 poorest countries."
"I would certainly hope those parts of the rich world that still maintain such barriers will be strongly urged by the Commission to adopt a policy such as we have done here within the European Union."
"Sadly, there are many parts of the world today that are not self-sufficient, and we who have developed the techniques must share our technologies and our experiences with developing countries."
"There are many excellent examples of the positive and successful work of the NGOs for example and other voluntary agencies in this challenging area and, in my view, this work must be fully supported into the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the statistics are now arriving thick and fast regarding what is, to say the least, a tragic situation."
"Apart from the figures, though, I think that we should be shocked by the trend revealed by these statistics: this population which potentially has a death sentence hanging over it, despite the efforts of mankind, continues to grow."
"According to the statistics, it has more than doubled in the last 30 years, and this is what should really concern us."
"Furthermore, in addition to these people, to those who are in danger of dying from starvation and malnutrition, that is it seems, more than 30 million in Africa and 800 million in Latin - central and south - America, there are the millions of AIDS victims who each day truly represent a historic blot on the conscience of global society, which is unable to provide the necessary amount of resources during aid interventions and which is unable, above all, to make pharmaceutical multinationals forego patent fees and royalties, at least for emergency products."
"This endemic situation of poverty, hunger and disease is accentuated by the acute economic and social crises which have trapped these countries in a downward spiral from which there is no escape."
"The undertaking by governments and private parties to making these countries self-sufficient no longer suffices, and is barely coping with circumstances, with the daily emergency."
"The economies therefore contract under the burden of public and international debts."
"In order to tackle this emergency, as we know, the European Union has opened up its markets - in addition to expressing its solidarity - and has granted direct aid, but it is not enough: the efforts of many governments to limit or cancel debts incurred in the past by these countries does not yet go far enough."
"In this connection, I would like to point out a development which has been overlooked to a large degree: during the G8 Summit in Genoa in July 2001, at the initiative of the Italian Government, the summit of the most developed countries was preceded by a meeting with a large group of representatives from countries with public debt, starvation and poverty problems."
"Well, this was not a merely symbolic or ritual gesture: that day, almost a third of the large, huge public debt of these countries was discharged."
"Unfortunately, this result went unnoticed because of the rioting in the streets which attracted all the mass media's attention."
"Lastly, I would like to say a few words, in these appalling circumstances, on the valuable, irreplaceable role of the NGOs in all the Community and non-Community countries, which have always been on the front line in this war against starvation and death from malnutrition and AIDS."
"The Commission really must substantially boost programmes devoted to them."
"It must be said that, by themselves, these volunteers are achieving measures which are of a much higher quality and is much more convincing than those of all the western governments, and, above all, that they manage to put much more enthusiasm into this work, providing resources and solidarity, firm in the belief, Mr President, that no-one can feel free and happy if the others around them are not free and happy too."
"Mr President, others have spoken about rich and poor countries, about the prosperity we have in Europe and the quite contrasting conditions in lesser-developed countries."
"Mr Bautista Ojeda was speaking about that just a moment ago."
"As Europe today revels in its economic success and prosperity, we need to consider at what expense it has been to other parts of the world, and the consequences for these counties."
"Part of our success and prosperity today is the result of our policies of the last and the nineteenth century when imperialism went to other countries around the world, and we are now reaping the consequences."
"We can do far more about this than we are actually doing at the moment."
"The difficulties manifest themselves today in Europe in the pressure for people from less developed countries wanting to migrate to Europe, and in people fleeing from some of the countries that are so desperate not just because of their economic situation, but also their lack of democracy and violence, and seeking asylum in the west."
"We can do more by helping those countries."
"It is not just about huge amounts of development money; the aid needs to be sustainable."
"One thing that we can do to help those countries would be to look again at our common agricultural policy - looking to reform that."
"At the moment, we are dumping subsidised goods on lesser-developed countries, which does not help their community, economy or farmers at all."
"We protect our own agricultural community in Europe at the cost of other countries."
"Whilst we are subsidising our agriculture, farmers and poorer people in countries all around the world are going under because they are unable to compete."
"So we must look at the common agricultural policy."
"We must work with the WTO to make sure that the standards and the conditions that they set do not contribute to poverty."
"We can do more then we are doing at the moment."
"Mr President, there is enough food in the world to feed everyone."
"Naturally, it would help if crop yields were higher - but this is not, I repeat, not the essence of the hunger problem."
"Free and in particular fair trade also helps, but that is not the essence either."
"The essence is the distribution problem."
"There is no hunger in countries with a parliamentary democracy, even if they are poor countries."
"The political rulers know that they can be voted out."
"With political dictatorships it is different."
"Take Zimbabwe, for example."
"The link between democracy and the absence of hunger was established by no less a person than Amartya Sen, the winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, from India."
"The best solution is the promotion of democracy throughout the world."
"This aspect is too often lacking in the European strategy."
"Finally, if we were to do away with 5% of the world's military spending, we would have enough money to achieve the United Nations' millennium goals."
"Mr President, the gap between the rich, the poor and the poorest countries of all has been growing since the 1990s."
"Removing the barriers to trade on products from developing countries on the part of the EU has not visibly improved the situation in third countries, although the EU is the largest export market for agricultural products from the developing countries."
"One drawback of the European Union's policy on developing countries has been the promotion in many places of autonomous production in those countries."
"At the same time the export of heavily subsidised European agricultural products is harming or destroying local production."
"Besides removing barriers to trade we also have to promote the spread of fair trade products in the Union."
"The Commission has supported information campaigns for fair trade products, but at the same time has said their high prices will only fall if demand for them grows."
"The EU should calculate the threshold price for fair trade products and raise the threshold prices for other products from developing countries."
"A drop in fair trade threshold prices would help them to sell in the EU. That in turn would increase the volume of production in the developing countries."
"Then production would move more in the direction of fair trade."
"At the same time the Developing Countries Fund should be used to support in particular the farms that go over to operating under the fair trade sign."
"Low-interest loans and development aid should be granted to develop these farms so as to organise training and education programmes for those who are left jobless, especially women."
"We make donations and organise collections to prevent famine, but often forget that it is we who cause those famines with the import duties we impose."
"Member States should also favour fair trade products in public procurement, with increasing demand resulting in lower costs and lower retail prices."
"Global crop production cannot be increased by making the amount of land available for cultivation greater."
"Scarcer water resources also have an impact."
"Increased large-scale irrigation is no longer possible."
"If food production cannot be increased we must change the basis for its distribution as well as our trading relations."
"Apart from the uneven distribution of food, one of the reasons for famine that might be mentioned is often an unstable political situation."
"At present the seriousness of the famine in Sub-Saharan Africa is specifically due to the fact that conventional humanitarian aid can no longer be used to prevent a catastrophe owing to political instability in the region."
"The capacity of governments for confronting this crisis is totally non-existent."
"Famine must be averted through social remedies as well as political and economic ones."
"Often it is mainly women who suffer from famine."
"Although women produce more than half the world's food, according to an estimate by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation, they nevertheless have the poorest prospects of owning land, being granted credit, studying and enjoying their social rights."
"Parliament's political groups have drafted a joint motion for a resolution on the statement by the Commission."
"There is therefore very firm political backing for aid for the victims of famine and for financial support for the developing countries."
"This should also be visible in the policies of the Commission and the Council."
"My worst fear is that once again in issues relating to the developing countries there will be fewer deeds than words."
"That must not be."
"Behind theoretical speech there is a whole real world."
"They are real people, not dummies."
"They have a pain threshold."
"This must not be forgotten."
"Mr President, it is a sad day when you realise that, after fifty years of development aid, not one country has escaped the underdevelopment and poverty trap."
"Many maintain that globalisation is the root cause of the state of the economy in the poorest countries."
"The truth is that the North's protectionist policy has helped to strangle crucial sectors in the South."
"The contention that poor countries can achieve the same levels of income as rich countries without international trade, without incoming capital and investment, is quite simply nonsense."
"If the poor countries make do with what is in their coffers or wait to develop their own technological capabilities, it will take them forever."
"There is no such thing as true progress in a society where few become richer and many become poorer."
"Hunger and abject poverty mainly affect women, making sexual inequality a huge barrier to development."
"Over the last decade, the number of women living in absolute poverty has risen."
"This is linked to reproductive health problems, because it is the poorest women that have the least access to health services and the most unwanted babies."
"Nearly all of the half a million women who die from maternity-related causes live in the underdeveloped world and they die, not because they decided to become mothers, but because they are poor."
"The probability of a woman dying in these circumstances is less than one in three thousand in the developed world, compared to one in nineteen in Africa."
"These figures prove that the benefits of globalisation have still not reached that many people."
"Continuing poverty is holding back this process through open trade."
"The only solution is to overcome our two main enemies: the resistance of numerous political leaders in the North, who refuse to tear down barriers to the free movement of goods and people, and the resistance of numerous political leaders in the South, who refuse to give their people basic political, economic and human rights, without which there can be no development."
"Mr President, I would like to express my thanks for the way you have handled my unfortunate problems getting here this morning."
"I would start by saying that I find it both important and remarkable that across party lines everybody is basically in agreement in describing the problem and in pointing out what needs to be done."
"This is important, even though one Member did remark that I might not be the right Commissioner to deal with this debate considering the kind of problems that are involved, and in particular the trade issues."
"Well, we all have to face the reality that coherence starts at home."
"In the Commission we have achieved a much better situation in terms of working across different sectoral views and lines, and concerning the balance between the global issues of development and trade today I am convinced that this Commission is working in a much more organised and predictable way, and reflecting more basic orientations, than previous Commissions."
"I think Parliament itself should do more to ensure that the nice, correct analysis presented by all parties here is representative of the whole House."
"The dark forces of agriculture in Europe are not only working in certain governments."
"This game is also going on in this House."
"If we talk about fisheries, farm policy, agricultural reform in Europe, the acceptance of whether or not 'everything but arms' should be subject to the modifications concerning sugar, rice and bananas, all this would be lacking in impact if everybody thinks this is only a task for the Commission."
"We all have a responsibility."
"Much as I welcome everything I have heard, and I am sure what I did not hear was of the same genre, and appreciate your encouragement, it would be more in terms of Realpolitik to return that message to Parliament itself and ask for a partnership that delivers these attitudes also on those policy areas where we have difficulties."
"As I say, I share the analysis."
"A few remarks concerning figures: at the World Food Summit last spring, I offered the analysis that approximately 80% of the people who are really starving in the world do so because of conflicts."
"The problem of food insecurity or the inadequate mix or quality of the food is bigger than the number of people who are, in that sense, really starving."
"It goes without saying that all these problems are directly linked to poverty."
"I have just returned from a week in Zambia and Angola, and in Zambia in particular we were able to have a close look at the reality on the ground, visiting food distribution centres and support services for subsistence farmers and so on. Everything that has been said here about the relation to trade policy, access to our markets and the need to diversify agricultural production and the economy in these countries is true, but it is also true that there is a sort of de-linkage from all this affecting the very poor subsistence farmers."
"They are not anywhere near a monetarised economy and do not have anything interesting to offer in terms of cash crops."
"They do not get services as such."
"This is the hard-core category of poverty and it is their food insecurity that really creates the picture we are trying to do something about in the current crisis in the Horn of Africa."
"This is a long-term structural effect showing that neglect, poverty and marginalisation are the real problems."
"More trade, the big global discussion, does not immediately help these people."
"It is another layer, so to speak."
"Now what we are trying to do in the southern African food crisis makes a lot of sense compared to those simply dumping surplus maize, a sort of opportunistic marketing if you will, into those countries."
"So far, and this is a figure we can be proud of, 99.1% of what the European Commission has been providing in the southern African food crisis has been bought in the region."
"This makes sense."
"In fact, we are performing the role of a catalyst to develop a market in the region, to give the right signal to producers, those producers who participate in the monetarised formal economy, who produce for a market and not just for themselves and the neighbour, if he is even worse off."
"But there is a de-linkage between those actually playing in a market as agricultural producers and those simply feeding themselves, if they can."
"The main problem is the marginalised, very poor group who cannot survive if there is more than one year of bad rain because then they cannot prepare the next season."
"In terms of money and resources, this is not very challenging or problematic."
"The big problem is to move them into something that reaches somewhat outside their own non-monetarised subsistence economy."
"The discussion on 'everything but arms' should be continued in the manner we are doing today."
"Of course, we are not at the end of these discussions in the Doha track and I would strongly urge Parliament to keep up the pressure and input that I have heard today."
"A lot of work needs to be done before we can aspire to earning the headline of being a development round."
"To Mr Souchet I would say that the food sovereignty notion makes a lot of sense but sufficiency is not the only way to do it."
"Singapore, for instance, is not self-sufficient in food production, which shows that there are other possibilities, but for the category of countries we are talking about here I have to agree totally that this is a good way of defining the challenge at national level."
"But to say that protectionism and the right to subsidise agricultural production is a good idea is something I would warn against."
"It is more important to open up between neighbours, also in this area."
"Any way of stimulating the emergence of market mechanisms regionally is a key to getting things rolling."
"Mrs Kinnock's remarks about the economic partnership agreement negotiations highlighted the need to make our ACP partners more aware of their responsibility in moving this agenda forward."
"The phytosanitary constraints, and different elements such as capacity building on trade negotiation, are not really a problem in terms of money made available."
"The real problem is to define adequate, good, specific fundable projects and ideas."
"For phytosanitary standards in fisheries we also have ongoing large programmes."
"We are pushing to have a central help-desk organised in the Commission to which all problems can be directly channelled so we can fight the battle for a decent reaction in the Commission."
"We hope to see a flow of ideas from the reality out there which can materialise in fundable actions."
"That is the architecture of how we would like to accelerate what we do here."
"Mr Santini said that NGOs did more than all the western governments together."
"I agree that NGOs are extremely important, especially in the area of humanitarian aid but also generally."
"But please do not shield the public from the raw information that, when we add all the different budget lines together, the Commission is channelling about EUR 1 billion annually through NGOs."
"They sometimes have great difficulty, and are extremely shy, in telling the public how they are funded."
"When MSF received their well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize, I sent them a telegram of congratulations in which I also told them that, as the provider of about 50% of their economic basis, I felt entitled to extend even warmer congratulations to them, and would also hope that our partnership could be reflected in the way in which MSF present themselves to the public."
"Unfortunately, I never even received an answer."
"That does not change our relationship but I urge Parliament to help me insist on some reality when it comes to visibility."
"It is difficult for our own public to understand what the money is really used for when it is shielded in this way."
"One remark for Mrs Schierhuber, who said that fraud in development aid is a problem."
"It is reckless for me to say no, but most corruption and fraud has to do with fat contracts, with management or mismanagement of oil revenue, diamonds, illegal logging and other heavy stuff."
"In the case of our development cooperation work, it is not that big a problem."
"I admit that, technically, fundability is here to stay, as it provides more flexibility in the budget."
"That being said, our general track record and ability to trace and document is quite good."
"You remember when the Ivory Coast was playing around with money and the hammer fell."
"They paid back and that is how the piano plays."
"I should like to dispel the notion that development cooperation in itself is a problem, as this is not the case."
"It is also why following and delivering on Monterrey is important."
"We have reach the point as regards the quality and handling of development cooperation where it is meaningful, in fighting poverty to say that more of the same is right."
"Finally, I should like to say to Mr Santini that if Italy were to move from the previous and current level of 0.15% of GDP for development assistance to the 0.33% in 2006 called for in the Monterrey decision, such a contribution on the part of Italy and other Member States below the current average of EU partners would make the most interesting and relevant response to the discussion here today."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for a resolution"
"The real global scandal of hunger in the world forces us to react."
"In that sense, the European 'Everything but arms' initiative is to be welcomed."
"The example of the coffee crisis, however, demonstrates that this is not enough."
"This raises the question of stabilising the prices of raw materials."
"We must also think about how to guarantee that the profits from trade in these products do end up solely in the pockets of the multinationals who control the market, but that they are also redistributed to the farmers."
"Tens of thousands of people, including those who were at Porto Alegre, have proclaimed their desire to see a world that is more fair."
"The Brazilian President, by declaring that his priority is 'Zero Hunger', has generated an enormous feeling of hope."
"The European Union must respond to this aspiration and to those hopes."
"In order to do that, it must accept its obligation of solidarity, for example by abolishing debt and introducing a Tobin tax, but also by preserving the freedom of the developing countries to organise their public services in spite of the pressure of the negotiations carried out in the context of the GATS, and by preserving their freedom to choose whether or not to accept GMO seeds."
"The next item is the debate on report (A5-0394/2002) by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation on aid for poverty diseases (HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis) in developing countries (COM(2002) 109 - C5-0100/2002 - 2002/0051(COD))."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, who has worked tirelessly to secure adoption at first reading and has also exercised great skill in tackling the substance of this matter."
"Our proposal for a regulation on poverty diseases was adopted last March."
"The Commission places high priority on health questions and development, and has presented a programme of action to counter HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."
"I think we are agreed on the importance of improving health in developing countries."
"As regards the regulation, we have had lengthy and constructive debates on issues including inter alia the TRIPs Agreement but it is the financial issues, which have proved most difficult."
"I would just remind you that the reality of budget support linked to results in health matters, and indeed education, logically forms the missing link in these discussions."
"As we move on and improve on indicators, I feel confident that we will build up a more robust consensus between Parliament and the Commission when it comes to demonstrating what we are in fact doing in these areas, even if the method of doing it cannot simply be described by referring to budget lines as such."
"The situation is improving and I just wanted to reiterate this point in the ongoing discussion."
"The Commission can accept all the amendments voted by the Development Committee, as they strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation without altering the main objectives."
"There are also some up-dates made to references in the Commission's original proposal which we are happy to accept."
"These amendments reflect constructive collaboration between the Council and Parliament and the Commission."
"The rapporteur has now submitted an amendment presenting a proposal for EUR 351 million for the years 2003 to 2006."
"I am of course sympathetic to the proposal to increase the funding but I must tell you that we have not been able to find the necessary resources within the Community budget."
"If this point has to some extent been a casualty of any shortcoming in communication between the rapporteur and my services, then I regret that, but I must make it clear that a sum of that magnitude is not within the lines of the budget."
"We, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, have agreed substantial increases for this budget line in 2003 compared to the 2002 budget line for HIV/AIDS."
"During the December Plenary Session, an amendment was adopted which increased the 2003 budget allocation to EUR 80.35 million."
"A financial declaration agreed by the three institutions specifies that EUR 42 million is to go to the global fund and the remaining EUR 38.35 million to the programme for action."
"The Commission continues to see health issues as a priority and is determined wherever possible to find resources to improve health, whether through health sector programmes or budget support linked to improved health indicators."
"We will also propose a further substantial contribution from the EDF for the global fund against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must point out to you that a further 26 minutes of this debate remain. Provided we keep to the timetable, there is time for all the groups to have the floor for the time requested."
"I am sure you will understand that I need to be very strict over speaking time."
"I would ask you all please to remain silent out of respect for the speaker, otherwise the debate will become much more complicated."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and, as you said, speaking on behalf of the Budget Committee, we are largely supportive of this report."
"However, there are one or two amendments that cause some difficulties."
"As the rapporteur stated, Article 28 of the new financial regulation requires that any proposal submitted that has budgetary impact must be accompanied by a financial statement and an evaluation."
"This report does not do so with respect to the new figure of EUR 351 million, so my committee will only be in a position to support this report if the rapporteur tables an oral amendment to this effect."
"I hope that all the groups in this House will support this approach because objecting to the oral amendment will only lead to referral back and delay."
"Moving on to this figure, we have to recognise the constraints in the financial perspective that we have at the moment."
"Unless we use the flexibility instrument, it will be very difficult for us to meet the amounts stated."
"So it will have an impact on other policy areas within heading 4 and my plea to all parties is that, when we move on to this stage, this should not be done at the expense of other policies affecting the poorest countries."
"We do not want to give with one hand and take away with the other."
"This is precisely what the Development Council states: any funding should be additional."
"Personally speaking, I welcome whole-heartedly the contents of the Commission paper and the rapporteur's proposals, and I applaud the fact that the EU has led the way in this area."
"HIV, tuberculosis and malaria are the world's greatest killers and are the most serious diseases affecting the world today."
"Nearly six million people have died."
"So much EU funding is used for intangible issues, and I hope we will support this report."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague Anders Wijkman for an excellent report which took him seven months to complete, but he battled his way through it and I am very proud to be associated with him in this work in the Development Committee."
"We have called this report 'Diseases on poor countries' and we have focused on Africa, where 28 million people are HIV positive, and on the potential increase in these dreadful diseases in India and China, as well as TB and hepatitis B. But these are no longer diseases of poor countries because of our global inter-dependence and the fact that, for example in the United Kingdom alone, 115 000 settlers are now coming and living in our country and we are allowing 100 000 asylum seekers to come into our country."
"HIV rates have increased by 100% in the United Kingdom in the last year to 5 000 cases."
"TB has increased by 200% to 7 300 reported cases."
"The London Borough of Brent now has a higher rate of TB than China and twice that of Brazil."
"26 300 hepatitis B infections were reported in the last four years in London alone."
"One person in 50 in east London has hepatitis B - the same level as in Nepal."
"So why the reference to poor countries?"
"No: this is a global epidemic where we are inter-dependent, and what we do to help the people in the developing countries to eradicate and stop these diseases is also going to have an enormous impact on how we and our children are going to live in Europe."
"I think we need to establish the connection between development and what happens in our own countries, and I now want to ask the Labour Government to act on this before it is too late."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to compliment the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, on his outstanding report."
"Poverty-related diseases are a serious threat to the development of poor countries, and we have the important task of helping these countries fight these diseases."
"The World Fund, for example, is a very useful tool for tackling the combating of disease on a global level, and at the moment it is being suggested that the EU contribute EUR 35 million to it."
"There are calls to increase this amount."
"Despite the useful work they do, I myself do not endorse this directly."
"I think that it is very important to first take a look at what happens to the contribution."
"We must have the guarantee that the money will be spent properly and efficiently."
"Transparency plays a major role in this."
"I therefore wholeheartedly endorse the rapporteur's proposal to include the actions financed from the World Fund in the Commission's annual report."
"I myself also believe that the pharmaceutical industry has an important role to play."
"Not only must they offer affordable prices, they must also be willing to share their know-how with partners in developing countries."
"A win-win situation."
"By producing products locally, they will be contributing directly to combating poverty, increasing knowledge and fighting disease more efficiently, as the products will already be with the potential customers."
"So there will be fewer logistical problems, and the TRIPs do not have to be an obstacle to this, given the Doha Declaration."
"Finally, in order to ensure that we can combat poverty effectively, I would also argue for more attention to be paid to informing the population."
"It is extremely important that patients realise that once a course of treatment has begun it must be finished."
"How often do you hear the complaint that a patient with malaria has contracted a resistant variant because he stopped his course of treatment too soon out of ignorance."
"We must pay the necessary attention to this as well."
"Information and education must be spearheads in our development policy, also in relation to combating poverty-related diseases."
"The pharmaceutical industry can make a formidable contribution to this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, my compliments to Mr Wijkman for his excellent report and its tangible contribution to the fight against poverty-related diseases, a report, moreover, adopted by the unanimous vote of the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"This is further confirmation of the need to speed up the adoption, which seems to be possible at first reading already, of this proposal for a regulation so that it can be swiftly implemented, in line with the European Union's responsibilities to developing countries."
"This is certainly a substantial contribution - albeit not to a large enough degree - to the recently constituted Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, a fund strongly called for by the Italian Prime Minister too during the G8 Summit in Genoa and - I would add - which was made available in record time compared with the time which these things usually take."
"I am afraid, however, that the situation is still alarming and there is no time to lose: we still can and must do much more."
"I will not tire of repeating, once again, that we need a coordinated approach between policies on development cooperation, research and health in the fight against these diseases, including through developing third countries' health systems."
"Everyone is aware of the facts, and among these I would highlight this one: each day, between 12 and 14 thousand people contract the AIDS virus throughout the world."
"As Mr Deva rightly said, this is a disease which has now also arrived on our doorstep: just think of the thousands of children in Romania who have contracted this virus."
"Therefore, although this is a global problem, it nevertheless affects developing countries in particular."
"So while the budget represents the main obstacle to the adoption of this proposal for a regulation as amended, I would like briefly to consider a key element: the issue of drugs, their cost and access to treatment and medicines."
"How can it be that, even now, only 10% of both public and private research is dedicated to studying these diseases which are responsible for a good 90% of disease in developing populations?"
"I wonder what became of my request, which I submitted along with Mr Tajani more than two years ago, which called in this very forum for the urgent drafting of a common plan, in conjunction with the pharmaceutical manufacturers, that focused more on combating poverty diseases."
"Given the scale and cross-border nature of the phenomenon - now on our doorstep - these poverty diseases call for a systematic response from the whole international community."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to confine my remarks to the subject of HIV/AIDS."
"The World Population Report for 2002, which has just appeared, contains some shocking figures."
"On average, 14 000 men, women and children die of this scourge every day."
"It is now the commonest cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa."
"To date, more than 60 million people worldwide have become infected and around 22 million of them have died."
"Of the 40 million persons infected, 95% live in developing countries and nearly three quarters of them in Africa."
"Out of 580 000 children below the age of 15 who have died from AIDS, 500 000 - almost 90% - lived in Africa."
"I could continue with these statistics of misery indefinitely."
"This catalogue of disasters is not only the sum of millions of human tragedies, however, but it is something that affects whole societies."
"Life expectancy is falling, education is severely affected, agricultural output is declining, and the social and economic fabric is being eroded."
"Plans for fighting HIV/AIDS must not be confined to the health aspects."
"What is needed is an integral strategy with wide-ranging education and prevention campaigns."
"Those who are already infected are entitled to the best possible treatment."
"We carry some responsibility for that."
"It is also up to us to provide the necessary knowledge, awareness and, of course, the necessary resources for prevention and treatment."
"Because once a person is infected, that cannot be reversed."
"In Sierra Leone I saw large posters on streets and squares with the blunt message: Aids kills! malaria and tuberculosis can be cured, AIDS cannot."
"AIDS can be avoided, however, and that is worth every effort."
"Mr President, congratulations to the European Commission for making the programme for action against communicable diseases with its legal base in this area a priority."
"Also to the rapporteur, Mr Wijkman, for fighting for sufficient resources to meet the challenge with our full support from the Socialist Group and, of course, to those governments in developing countries that have been prepared to challenge taboos and to patient groups in those and other countries who set an example of the sort of change of attitude required, both of whom prove that the battle against HIV/AIDS can be won."
"But shame on the Commission for seeking to get the UN global funds on the cheap."
"Shame on this Parliament for voting against increases in funds devoted to reproductive health, which is integral to the fight against the spread of HIV."
"Shame on the pharmaceutical companies, who pretend to cut the cost of essential medicines when speaking to us in Europe but who fail to deliver in sub-Saharan Africa where the need is greatest."
"Mr President, Commissioners do talk to each other and sometimes even write to each other."
"I maintain that what we have achieved in this field of communicable diseases represents a good illustration of the Commission working across the different areas of responsibility."
"This initiative would never have been launched and achieved its results without that work attitude."
"As to the issue of further research into these diseases, this is also reflected in what my colleague Mr Busquin is doing, and the Sixth Framework Programme for European Research places greater emphasis on this research in order to accelerate it."
"I agree that the pharmaceutical companies are not doing enough in this area from the point of view of global poverty."
"It is interesting to note that the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation has recently announced the availability of 200 million US dollars by way of a competition fund to prompt pharmaceutical companies to attract that money for accelerated research into malaria, TB and AIDS, but mainly malaria."
"We will work with them and are of course already in contact with them, as this makes sense."
"I would once again point out that when, as in this instance, Parliament is trying to raise additional funds for these activities, this is of course a welcome development."
"As a Commissioner, I have to tell you that the Commission does not print money."
"We have to work within the constraints of the budget and the perspective as defined by the budgetary authority as a whole."
"So I repeat: we cannot accept the amendment regarding the EUR 351 million."
"Thank you, Commissioner. On behalf of the House, I must apologise for the continual murmuring."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11 a.m."
"Mr President, last year Parliament adopted a new version of our Rules of Procedure."
"Rule 63a(2) of the amended text states: 'When the committee responsible amends the financial endowment of the act it is considering, it shall request the opinion of the committee responsible for budgetary issues'."
"While working on this report, the Committee on Budgets was consulted, but at an early stage before the budget amounts had been finally agreed upon."
"We managed to reach agreement with the Council and with the Commission about an increase in the budget early in January."
"Ideally, the Committee on Budgets should have been consulted again at a later stage and I am sorry this did not take place."
"To remedy the situation so as to comply with the Rules of Procedure, I am proposing an oral amendment both to the legislative text and to the resolution."
"I have of course discussed the amendment with the chair of the Committee on Budgets, Terry Wynn, and he agrees."
"Thus, a new sentence should be added to the text in Article 10 and Amendment 42, reading: 'The annual allocation is subject to agreement of the budget authority on the appropriate means of financing under the financial perspective or through the use of the instruments provided by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999'."
"Mr President, consequently, we would add the following to the resolution: 'Considers that a financial envelope of EUR 351 million is compatible with the ceiling of heading 4 of the financial perspective only if the budget authority decides to reduce other policies or through recourse to the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999'."
"Mr President, I would just like to clarify, in the light of the remarks I made earlier this morning, that the Commission cannot agree to the EUR 351 million, given the realities of budget constraints as they are."
"Mr Wijkman's reference to an agreement with the Commission services early in January does not cover the reality concerning the Commission's ability to accept this amendment."
"Mr President, because I was looking behind me to see that everyone was voting, I failed to vote myself."
"I vote against."
"We will make a note of that."
"Someone once said 'I am their leader, I must follow them!'"
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution"
"We will ensure that all language versions correspond."
"Before the vote on paragraph 13:"
"Mr President, in the light of current events, could Burma - or Myanmar - also be included on the list of countries cited as examples?"
"Mr President, given that, despite worldwide protests, including protests from the European Parliament in December, a Tibetan was executed by order of a Chinese court four days ago and the same fate awaits a highly respected lama, I ask the House to agree to a motion going further than proposal No 8 from the Greens and Non-attached Members."
"I propose adding the following to item 16:"
"'condemns in the strongest terms the execution of the Tibetan Lobsang Dhondup on 26 January for alleged political crimes and calls for the immediate setting aside of the death sentence on the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek'."
"Thank you for drawing that to our attention."
"Once again, we will ensure that all the language versions correspond."
"(Parliament adopted the joint resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0052/2003) tabled by Charles Pasqua on behalf of the UEN Group, on the illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo"
"(Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0053/2003) tabled by John Corrie and Thierry Cornillet on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, to wind up the debate on the Council and Commission statements on illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo"
"Before the vote on paragraph 4:"
"The wording of the Spanish text currently refers to when action is taken with a view to appropriating natural resources illegally. We wish this to be replaced with a text along the following lines: including action taken to appropriate such resources illegally."
"Mr President, I would merely like to suggest that we have an oral amendment as a first indent, stating: 'having regard to the United Nations Security Council resolution 1457 to extend the mandate for a panel of experts investigating the legal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for another six months'."
"Mr President, what an honour!"
"I have had the pleasure of Your Excellency also hearing my explanations of vote."
"In addition, I have discovered that, in today's explanations of vote concerning Iraq, I will be heard by another great leader, who will be giving an oral explanation of vote."
"I therefore welcome Mr Marco Pannella, who will be speaking about Iraq."
"A great leader listening to Mr Fatuzzo: naturally, I am pleased about this."
"With regard to the Mulder report, I would like to explain what 'liquidazione dei conti' [clearance of accounts] means in Italian: 'liquidazione' means 'dissipate, remove, liquidise; 'conti' is a title held by the nobility; therefore, 'liquidare i conti' means 'to get rid of the aristocrats'."
"So might this be a report against the monarchy?"
"While I was daydreaming about this over a coffee this morning, I spilt my drink on my trousers."
"Might this report - which, in reality, seeks to recover EUR 2.245 million defrauded from Europe - also just be a dream?"
". (PT) I welcome the outcome of the conciliation process, which I believe to be extremely satisfactory."
"This proposal is of considerable importance, not only for the average citizen in the street but also for the Community's environmental policy, because it provides for public participation in the drawing up of certain plans and programmes for the environment."
"At the same time it attempts to harmonise Community legislation, thereby representing a significant step towards the European Union's ratification of the Aarhus Convention."
"The authorities are thereby instructed to inform the public on the decisions they have taken and of the reasons and considerations that have led them to take these decisions. The authorities are also to be informed on the processes of public participation and how to promote environmental awareness amongst the public, thereby providing incentives for the citizens actively to participate in solving environmental problems."
"Therefore, free access, transparency and the dissemination of information about the environment will become a fundamental right of any citizen who is interested in the quality of the area in which he or she lives and works."
"As a matter of fact, some recent disasters have clearly shown that the citizens have an increasing right to manage their risks, to speak out and to request and demand commitments to safeguard their interests in areas such as the environment and health."
"I voted in favour of this Conciliation Delegation Report but with some misgivings."
"The planning process is a key element of sustainable development as, because it covers land-use, it sets the physical framework for the way in which we live."
"Unfortunately, this agreement does not fully follow the Aarhus Convention as it does not allow the public to be fully involved in the development of policy which frames planning decisions."
"As the drafter of the opinion from the Petitions Committee on this proposal, we made the point that many petitions arise from the failure to consult adequately at the strategic stage."
"This is another democratic deficit."
"As an advert from British NGOs said when commenting on changes to English and Welsh planning law: 'Here's the new nuclear power station."
"What colour would you like the gates?'"
"Neither do they allow for third parties to be involved in the full process."
"This potentially removes expertise from the procedure and does not fulfil the sustainability objective of all of us having responsibility for our environment."
"Overall, however, I welcome the inclusion of the granting of certain operating permits in these Directives and the great accountability required of decision-making bodies."
"Hence my positive vote."
". (PT) I welcome the outcome of this conciliation process, which concludes the preparation of the second of three directives on environmental citizenship."
"I wish to reaffirm the crucial importance of public control in the field of the environment, and I even feel, as I stated on 18 December last, on another report by the same Member, that access to information and the right to participate in environmental matters must today be considered to be a standard prerogative of citizenship."
"I advocate a real citizen's control of our environmental heritage."
"It is worth pointing out that this directive seeks to integrate principles first put forward in the Convention adopted in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 (during the Ministerial Conference 'Environment for Europe') into the Community legal system."
"This Convention enshrined access to environmental information and suggested greater public participation in decisions having an effect on the environment, thereby achieving more substantial effects from the rights laid down in the Stockholm Declaration (1972) and in Article 1 of the Rio Declaration (1992)."
"Lastly, I have voted in favour of the report because I also wish to highlight that there will now be guarantees amongst other things, that the public will participate in authorising plans and programmes on waste management, pollution of the atmosphere and the protection of water against pollution by nitrates, and projects that have a significant impact on the environment, such as new airport terminals or certain military projects."
"Still on the subject of this morning, Mr President, as I left the hotel in Chaussée de Vleurgat where I am staying here in Brussels - it was 7.30 in the morning - it was snowing."
"The snow was falling in large flakes."
"'What a beautiful sight, a fairytale landscape!' I said to myself."
"Then I said: 'Mr Fatuzzo, you have to vote for Mrs Hautala's report calling for quality petrol, which will give us a better environment in which to live."
"Who knows then,' I continued, 'whether with this report Mrs Hautala can give us, throughout Europe, a fairytale landscape in which to live, like that in her region, Finland.'"
". (PT) I welcome the outcome achieved by the Conciliation Committee and congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work."
"This directive is crucial to the fight against atmospheric pollution since, by acting on the standardisation of engines and on fuel quality, it makes a reduction in car emissions and consumption possible."
"What is of particular importance is the link made, as a result of the European Parliament's work, between this directive and the drawing up of a new national and Community fiscal policy for fuels."
"The environmental costs must be borne by the economy and fiscal policy is one of the most effective instruments to achieve these aims."
"(PT) I broadly share the rapporteur's concerns about the environment as well as her commitment to the common project. I have therefore voted in favour of the report."
"I would, however, emphasise that the need to genuinely ensure, in Community as well as in national terms, geographical coverage that enables the effective marketing of fuels with a maximum sulphur content not exceeding 10mg/kg (PPM)."
"Unless this situation is achieved, we will face many problems and issues that will inevitably be worse for the most remote economies."
"I would lastly highlight the importance of tax incentives as a way of promoting fuels with lower sulphur content, which will certainly be an effective way of promoting their introduction."
". (PT) This report won my vote because it demonstrates the importance of speeding up the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of reducing poverty in the developing countries."
"These diseases kill more than five and a half million people every year, have destabilising effects on society, and compromise the work and the progress achieved over the last few years in social and economic development."
"HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis require a global and coherent response, which will cost considerably more than the financial and human resources available to most developing countries."
"Action in this field is in everyone's interest and should not be seen simply as a development aid issue, but as contributing to improving health and reducing poverty in the developing countries."
"We must, therefore, adopt a regulation on this matter, which aims to improve the overall provision of healthcare and measures of prevention, to reduce the costs of essential medicines and to step up research."
"I voted for this excellent report but deeply regret the lack of final agreement on the budget allocation."
"These diseases are major killers but they need not be."
"Three things are needed to change the situation, as the report makes clear."
"Firstly, clean water and sound nutrition."
"The EU must ensure that its agricultural subsidies and trade practices do not undermine local food production."
"Secondly, investment in the necessary infrastructure to deliver healthcare."
"All Member States must change the balance of the IMF and World Bank to ensure that any financial restructuring does not threaten public funding for healthcare and education, which are closely linked."
"Thirdly, drug treatment must be accessible and affordable: we must keep the pressure on the USA to stick to the agreements made on TRIPS, patent rights, production and differential pricing."
"We need to increase our funding to ensure that people can survive these diseases."
"The devastation caused by HIV/AIDS is well-known but TB is increasing and malaria remains endemic."
"The necessary measure to combat these diseases would lead to an overall lifting of the quality of life for some of the world's poorest people."
"I support the rapporteur and his efforts to increase new funding."
"In Europe we thought that tuberculosis no longer existed, and we were all completely unprepared for the development of the new disease AIDS or the increase in malaria heading in our direction on account of global warming."
"We now know that these diseases are continuing to spread and are creating huge numbers of victims."
"About 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV/AIDS, a billion new cases of TB are expected over the next 20 years and 40% of people run the risk of contracting malaria."
"In Sub-Saharan Africa the average life expectancy has dropped to 47 years, mainly because many young people are dying and children are having to grow up without parents."
"Under these dramatic circumstances those people who generally want to extend freedom in the market and restrict government support are also agreeing to a significant European contribution to the World Fund to combat AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria."
"Leaving it to the market has only resulted in there being no medicines available for those who need them most: the poor in the developing countries."
"This proposal, which received unanimous support in the three committees concerned, recognises the failures of the market as a tool for combating these three widespread diseases, which are particularly prevalent in the developing countries."
"This is a significant step forward."
". (PT) I welcome Mr Wijkman's report and his proposal for a regulation."
"Our commitment to combating easily communicable diseases, paying particular attention to poverty-related diseases, such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and to improving levels of vaccination and healthcare by funding health programmes by the more developed countries, is crucial. Equally important is removing barriers, such as licences and patents, to access by developing countries to pharmaceutical products and international partnerships for developing new generations of products."
"It should, once again, be pointed out that 70% of people infected with AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa."
"(PT) The three epidemics referred to in the report affect mainly the poorest populations. By way of example, 90% of the 40 million people infected with the AIDS virus live in a developing country and 70% of these in sub-Saharan Africa alone."
"The re-emergence of cases in new forms - one billion people at risk of contracting the virus by 2020 - and the return of malaria in areas from which it had been eradicated, causing one million deaths per year, and with 40% of the world at risk, destabilise entire societies and deal a harsh blow to the social and economic development of these countries."
"A specific initiative in this field is therefore called for, delimiting the framework of Community action, in order to maximise the impact of action and to provide it with an overall budget of EUR 300 million for a period of four years, until 2006."
"We agree with the broad philosophy of the initiative, which is based on the medical and social need to combine prevention and care and which must also consider the increase in the budget for research and development, which is tragically low. This would strengthen infrastructures and health systems and link the field of reproductive health with the ongoing concern for maximum complementarity."
"For all these reasons, I felt bound to vote for this report."
". (PT) I supported the main thrust of the report and of the amendments that were tabled, bearing in mind the urgent requirements of a challenge that absolutely everyone agrees on: to combat the diseases of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, which are linked to poverty in the developing countries."
"I must, nevertheless, make some specific comments."
"Firstly, with regard to the coordination of this action in the field of what is known as 'sexual and reproductive health', it must be emphasised how crucial it is that potential partnerships are established on the basis of a serious approach to health and with bodies that are not seeking to promote an ideological agenda."
"At the same time, given the increasing seriousness of the scourge that is AIDS, we must keep an open mind, free from ideological preconceptions, about how the development of this disease is monitored, so as not to perpetuate mistakes and to detect, support and disseminate the most effective methodologies, even if they move away from the prevailing trend - as appears to be the case in Uganda."
"Lastly, European cooperation both with United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and with NGOs working with these, does not mean that the implementation of Community funds should not be closely monitored, as should the rigour, seriousness and appropriateness of the actions that are funded. In fact the opposite is true."
"This report is too important, Mr President, for me to decide how to vote without consulting the elderly people and pensioners who, through the Pensioners Party, by voting for me, have brought me to this important Parliament."
"All of these pensioners said to me: 'Mr Fatuzzo, Mr Fatuzzo, Mr Fatuzzo, what a short memory many MEPs have, what a short memory many people have."
"They have forgotten when, during the Second World War, the United States, Great Britain and other States saved Italians, Germans, Japanese and so on from many dictatorships and many dictators, who should be overcome before they cause harm and before they commit their many injustices, which we are all aware of.'"
"Mr President, we have just heard the latest act of that great opera 'Così fa Fatuzzo'!"
"More seriously, I sit here as a representative of Scotland in the European Parliament, and we have had the opportunity to debate and vote on the substance of the issue of the Iraq emergency."
"Our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have also done so."
"Those at Westminster, shamefully, will be denied that opportunity even if a decision is made by Tony Blair to commit their constituents to war in Iraq."
"My commitment to this Parliament's resolution of this morning is unequivocal, above all as to its central point."
"There can be no lawful armed invention in Iraq without express United Nations authority."
"It is not enough for George W. Bush or Tony Blair to be satisfied that there has been a material breach of resolution 1441."
"Only if the Security Council so finds, and only if it resolves that action is to be taken, may action lawfully occur."
"I am glad to see that the article by the Prime Minister in today's Times effectively confirms that."
"We look to the United Nations inspectors to oversee effective disarmament by Iraq or to establish its clear breach of the resolution."
"They will need time for that."
"If this is old Europe, then old Europe stands up for the rule of law and for the peaceful resolution of conflict wherever possible."
"That is surely right."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with this vote, the European Parliament has obtained three results of a similar kind: firstly, the pursuit of the Munich Policy, whereby peace is made with dictators and war is made with our democratic countries; secondly, the attempt to divide Europe and America, the United States; thirdly, the attempt to divide Europe - they are Ollenhauer, not Adenauer Germans, they are not Schuman but Debré and anti-European Gaullist French citizens."
"These are the three characteristics."
"We say: 'Freedom for Iraq!"
"A free I-raq!'"
"European Parliament, the Americans are right: you represent an old Europe."
"We will change you for the sake of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and thus peace, but not the communist, nationalist, clerical, fundamentalist or 'rest in peace' kind!"
"Mr President, I voted with determination against the resolution on Iraq - which was adopted with the votes of a red-green coalition - on behalf of that young Europe of free peoples that certainly do not identify with the old, compromise politics and false, hypocritical pacifism where eyes are closed to the dreadful risk to European security posed by Saddam's regime, which threatens us with a true clash of cultures."
"Some amendments were rejected which sought to strengthen a text that portrays a cowardly and defeatist Europe, certainly not the Europe of the Battle of Lepanto, where the Pope was on the right side."
"Under the circumstances, it is Europe's moral and political duty to instead make a stand for the freedom of peoples and against the imminent threat - a threat posed by terrible weapons of destruction - of Islamic terrorism, which has secret links to Saddam's regime."
"Mr President, I want to say that I think today's resolution on Iraq is very important because it reaffirms that we want to go down the United Nations route."
"It is a pity that we could not get a big majority in this House to send a clear signal on behalf of the whole Parliament."
"But I wanted to focus on the Middle East."
"We did, in an amendment, stress the importance of the Middle East peace process to getting a solution across the whole of the Middle East and peace across the region."
"It is regrettable again that we did that in an amendment because without a peace process, we will never see an end to the serious disruption in the Middle East."
"We in this House should push the Israelis and the Palestinians to get back to the negotiating table and push the United States to take an active part in making sure there is a Palestinian state created and that there is a long-term solution in the Middle East."
"We must not forget this while we are talking about the crisis in Iraq."
"We must not lose sight of it because otherwise we will never have peace in the long-term."
"- (NL) Oil is essential for countries that waste a lot of energy, especially America."
"Iraq is rich in petroleum."
"That is why there is much more interest in the problems in that country than in the injustices in other dictatorships."
"Saddam Hussein is a cruel dictator."
"The Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south would have a better life if he stopped interfering with them."
"Nevertheless, these terrorised population groups never win the support of the outside world to enable then to separate from Iraq."
"America in particular, which used to be on friendly terms with this dictator, wants to keep Iraq together at any price."
"The USA is very keen to have a friendly regime that guarantees the continued supply of cheap oil."
"We must not bomb these people, who are already disadvantaged by sanctions, further into Saddam's hands."
"More and more people in Europe and America are demonstrating under the slogan 'No blood for oil'."
"Unfortunately America cannot be restrained any longer, but Europe must make sure that it does not become an accessory."
"The United Kingdom, Italy and Spain are threatening to go along with the creation of destruction and streams of refugees."
"It is important for the European Parliament to speak out against a war that serves neither human rights nor the elimination of weapons of mass destruction, but only control of the oil wells."
". (PT) My position on the Iraqi conflict is clearly expressed in the speech I gave in yesterday's plenary sitting."
"An explanation of my vote is nevertheless needed, which I can only give through this statement."
"Both the PPE-DE and the UEN felt it was necessary to table a set of proposals for amendments to the compromise resolution in order to balance the call for the conflict's peaceful resolution, with which of course we agree, with maintaining adequate pressure by the international community, specifically the European Parliament, on the Iraqi regime, which we believe is a basic requirement for achieving this goal."
"To be specific, we did not feel we could vote for a resolution that ignored Iraq's ongoing and serious breaches of the UN resolutions, or which did not mention the fact that what is at stake in this argument is guaranteeing the preservation of international peace and security, or even linking the Iraqi regime to international terrorism and to the real danger that terrorist groups could be the recipients of arms of mass destruction produced in that country."
". (PT) I have ultimately voted against this report because I am disappointed at the vote on successive amendments."
"My vote was determined by the fact that some improvements tabled by my group, all of which were balanced and in the interests of a free Europe were rejected, and amendments that clearly fall in line with the interests of Saddam Hussein's regime were adopted."
"It is worthy of the utmost condemnation that the majority has in this way betrayed the spirit of the very compromise that will guide the laborious drafting of the joint text."
"This vote might well be celebrated in Baghdad and has, to this extent, at least one positive aspect: it highlights the deceptiveness of the argument of those who are rooted in an archaic left-wing ideology and have boundless rhetoric that appears to condemn but in fact simply plays into Saddam Hussein's hands."
"It is a paradox that this resolution, which consequently loses much of its virtue, should have been adopted by those who, even in yesterday's debate, called Saddam Hussein, amongst other things, nothing less than a 'dictator and murderer' - and yet do not follow this harsh and accurate verbal condemnation to its logical conclusion."
"The final vote, in fact, contains a perverse paradox."
"Many Members will have voted in favour because they believe that in doing so they are preserving world peace."
"If it has any effect, however, particularly the effect of being celebrated in Baghdad and of weakening international political pressure on Saddam Hussein, this vote might have brought us closer to war."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group supported the compromise resolution on North Korea."
"We believe it is an important issue and I concur with my colleague, Mrs De Keyser, who spoke earlier."
"We are concerned about human rights in North Korea, as we are about human rights in the European Union, but we should recognise the fact that when Goran Perrson, Mr Solana and Mr Patten visited North Korea back in May 2000, there was an agreement that we would have a human rights dialogue with that country and that dialogue is ongoing."
"We are obviously critical and concerned about possession of the technology for uranium enrichment by North Korea."
"It could only make a delicate situation worse."
"Yet, there is little if any, attempt to impose sanctions against General Musharaf in Pakistan, who is responsible for counter-trading such sensitive technology for missiles."
"After all, it is not just North Korea that is outside the remit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty; we have Pakistan, India and Israel, all of which have nuclear weapons."
"The situation on the Korean peninsula is potentially far more dangerous than in Iraq."
"Here the passage from peace to war would put millions of lives at risk."
"Much has been made of the DPRK's secret acquisition of uranium enrichment technology in breach of the spirit, if not the letter, of the 1994 framework agreement."
"It is by no means absolved, but the faults are not entirely on one side."
"The 1994 framework agreement promised to deliver from the United States normalisation of relations, the end of the embargo, two light water reactors as part of the KEDO project and in the meantime 500 000 tons of heavy fuel oil per annum."
"In fact, nine years on, normalisation has not taken place, the embargo has not been lifted, the light water reactors are seven years late and, of course, the US strong-armed first Japan, then the Republic of Korea and then the EU into cutting off the supplies of heavy fuel oil."
"Then it was surprised that the DPRK did exactly what it said it was going to do and threatened to open its Russian-designed Yongbyong nuclear reactor which like all such reactors is capable of producing weapons grade plutonium."
"We want to talk."
"We want to negotiate."
"We welcome the proposed visit by Solana, Patten and the Presidency."
"This time we hope it will involve Parliament."
"Last time round, we were told it was a small delegation - it turned out they took 75 journalists. When we pointed this out to the Commission, they said next time around they would consider involving Parliamentarians."
"Finally, I would like to draw attention to paragraph 8."
"This calls for a permanent EU delegation in Pyongyang and, more importantly in the short-term, for the EU to convene seven-power talks on economic assistance, security and disarmament in the Korean peninsula including North and South Korea, the US, Japan, China and Russia."
"This offers a way forward for the future."
"Mr President, at the end of the Mobuto regime the then Conférence Nationale in Zaire published a cutting condemnation following a committee of enquiry about 'les biens mal acquis' - wealth acquired through crime."
"A condemnation of the plundering carried out by the Mobuto regime."
"After bloody wars with more than two million casualties in the NDRC and hundreds of thousands in Rwanda and Burundi, the fighting continues."
"It is therefore extremely important to find out how this has happened, and it has to do with the fact that, despite the peace treaties of Lusaka and Arusha, the wars are being waged by plundering the mineral wealth which should really only benefit the people of Congo."
"Foreign and domestic plunderers cannot, however, do this without the active cooperation and the culpability of big companies that are respectable over here but guilty over there without our doing anything about it."
"I therefore call on the international community to assume its responsibility and not to leave it to this committee of enquiry but to actively work out binding codes of behaviour to which multinationals must adhere so that peace may finally come to the Great Lakes region and so that those hundreds of thousands of people really have the right to life."
"That is because, with all this talk about war that we are obliged to wage, Africa remains forgotten."
"Mr McCartin's report aims to cut fraud and deceit in the use of European funds: there is too much fraud, too much deceit against Europe."
"I was wondering this morning on my way to the bar for a coffee - which I have already mentioned several times today - how to explain why I voted for the McCartin report."
"I closed my eyes for a moment and saw the Beagle Boys walking along the European Parliament's corridors, and then I had a brainwave. I knew how to explain why I voted for the report and, above all, that I should make a suggestion."
"I suggest that Europe ask the Beagle Boys - that is, the fraudsters themselves, those who cheat us out of our money - how to avoid being deceived in the future, paying them in the usual way, on a payroll, the fair amount that they deserve."
"This is perhaps the only way to combat the fraud against Europe's budget."
"And now, bon appétit!"
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 30 January 2003."
"Last Saturday, Mr Joseba Pagazaurtundua, head of the municipal police in a village in the Basque country in Spain, was shot dead by a terrorist."
"On my own behalf and on behalf of this House, I have already conveyed our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to his family."
"Mr Pagazaurtundua was an active member of the Socialist Party."
"He was also an active member of the Basque citizen's initiative, ¡Basta Ya! - 'Enough is enough'."
"¡Basta Ya! won the Sakharov Prize in 2000 and Mr Pagazaurtundua came to our Parliament to attend the Sakharov prize-giving ceremony at that time."
"By murdering him the terrorists have shown once more their denial of the right to life and their contempt for the right to freedom of political expression."
"After this latest affront to decency we, in the European Parliament, wish to say today that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the victims, with their families and with those who are combating terrorism in Spain."
"I ask you, please, to observe one minute's silence."
"(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday, 30 January 2003 have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"To the best of my knowledge a moderate degree of flexibility is shown."
"It is, however, a matter of concern that the Rules of Procedure be strictly applied."
"If, as a result, an amendment needs to be made to that effect, let us do that."
"Subject to that observation, the Minutes are approved."
"The final draft agenda as drawn up pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 6 February 2003 has been distributed."
"The following change has been proposed:"
"WEDNESDAY:"
"I have received a request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to include in Wednesday's agenda, without motions for resolutions, statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Iraq ."
"If this request is accepted the debate on Iraq could be included on Wednesday from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m."
"The other debates that afternoon would continue from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Council Question Time would therefore be cancelled."
"Mr President, my group has drawn up this request not just in view of the development of events, but essentially in view of the fact that the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Simitis, has called an extraordinary summit, which may be held next Monday."
"And we believe it is very important at this moment - and this is the approach my group has taken throughout this debate and we believe it must continue - to try to achieve a united and decisive European position in order to ensure, essentially, that the war is not inevitable and in order to achieve a disarmament process - in relation to weapons of mass destruction, in the case of Iraq - which takes place under international pressure under the auspices of the United Nations."
"This is our objective and we believe it is important that Parliament can hold a debate so that you can speak for us at the summit next Monday."
"Mr President, I do not want to oppose a debate on Iraq, but your proposal involves cancelling Question Time in order to have one, and I very much want to put my opposition to that on the record, taking as I do the view that every individual MEP's right to put questions - enshrined, indeed, in the treaties - is one of the most important parliamentary rights, second only to the right to vote on legislative texts."
"We are becoming accustomed to important matters - it is always important matters - ever more frequently reducing or doing away with the time available for questions."
"I ask you to put a stop to this practice."
"Questions to the Council used to be held at 9 p.m., or from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m., and for ten to fifteen years that worked perfectly, until the Council decided it was tired in the evenings and had to leave, so that Question Time was moved to the afternoon, and since then, Question Time has been cut back or moved, always to make room for other items of business."
"I ask you to take a long-term approach to this problem, and to sort it out."
"Mr Posselt, your observation was more a point of order regarding Question Time."
"I specifically asked the House to take account of the fact that if we add the debate as requested, it would have the knock-on effect you mention."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"We now come to the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I wrote to you with regard to the Sandbaek report and a possible referral back."
"However, within the last hour there have been developments and I have no need to raise the issue here."
"Wonderful!"
"That sets a great example for the one-minute speeches to follow."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I should like to ask you to write to President Bush and the Governor of Texas to protest against the execution by lethal injection of the British citizen, Jackie Elliott, last week, despite mounting evidence that he was innocent of the crime for which he had been convicted and was on death row for 16 years."
"There were numerous protests from the United Kingdom and people in prominent positions, and there was new evidence from police reports that pointed to other more likely suspects for the 1986 murder of which he was convicted, as well as urgent requests for crucial DNA testing."
"The Texas authorities pressed ahead with the scheduled execution, despite the fact that a number of key legal appeals had still to be heard by the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals."
"His local Member of Parliament - a senior cabinet minister - led the protests."
"This signals to the world a curious sort of respect by the American justice system for the rule of law and human rights."
"Let us at least ensure that such injustices do not go unnoticed."
"Mr President, you promised to investigate the matter of the dress code that an Italian MEP attempted to introduce during a hearing in Brussels."
"At the same time, you recommended that I obtain a good tailor, and I hope you are satisfied with the result, for the bill will be sent to yourself."
"Mr Blak, it is too soon on a Monday for me to rise to such a challenge."
"Mr President, something extraordinary happened at the end of the last part-session here in Strasbourg, when, for the first time in many years, a written declaration was supported by an absolute majority of this House."
"The statement, signed by 320 Members, demanded that, in future, the President of the Commission be elected by this House and no longer by the Council."
"The breakthrough was achieved by the 313th and 314th signatures, those of Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Poettering, whom I congratulate on their last-minute courage."
"It is my belief that it will strengthen our delegation to the Convention and help get it to accept this demand."
"I wish to request that you forward this position - now an official one taken by Parliament - to Mr Giscard d'Estaing."
"There is now some hope after all that it will dawn even on the President of the Convention that the head of Europe's executive has to be elected, not behind the Council's locked doors, but in this House, the people's open forum."
"We can do that, Mr Leinen."
"Mr President, I know Mr Leinen to be an upright and honourable colleague."
"It could well be, though, that, for a change, he had an ulterior motive for the form of words he had drafted and wanted to make my life difficult."
"So I will take this opportunity to reiterate what I told Mr Leinen when he was guiding my hand to where I should sign."
"I told him, 'If I sign, I do so not as Chairman of my group, but in my own name, modest person that I am.'"
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to draw the attention of the House to a joint statement by the Communist, Workers and Left Parties against the aggressive war on Iraq."
"The statement, signed so far by 60 parties from five continents, notes among other things, that: 'aggression against Iraq, which is based on the new US doctrine of pre-emptive strikes, threatens to destabilise the whole region and bring grave consequences for human civilisation as a whole."
"It poses a huge threat to international peace and the system of international law, and creates a precedent for other arbitrary acts of aggression.'"
"The statement concludes: 'we must stop the aggressive war on Iraq."
"We must oppose any form of European support for the war or participation in it. We demand that our countries do not provide the United States with military or other facilities to carry out its aggressive aims'."
"The question is, what will the European Parliament do to avert a war, in conformity with the wish of the overwhelming majority of the people of Europe?"
"What will the European Parliament do to ensure that no Member State provides any assistance to the United States if they follow the path of war?"
"I will submit a copy of the full text of the joint statement to the Secretariat."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I want to welcome the fact that we have decided to hold a debate this week on the continuing developments in relation to Iraq."
"It is clear that a peaceful outcome to the current crisis is still possible."
"Dr Hans Blix and Kofi Annan have made it clear that if they are given sufficient time and if they get full and active co-operation from the Iraqi authorities, then war can be avoided."
"There are therefore grave responsibilities on us all to persuade the Iraqi authorities to give this full and active co-operation."
"There is also a grave responsibility on us all to ensure we demonstrate that international law applies to us all, and not just to Iraq, and to ensure that the United Nations is given its full legitimacy in the current situation."
"I would appeal to the President of this Parliament and the Political Group leaders of this Parliament to issue a joint statement to the Iraqi authorities and the Member States this week, urging that Iraq co-operate fully and that we operate entirely through the United Nations, thereby ensuring that international law prevails."
"Mr President, I would like to raise a very serious issue, to talk about a very serious situation, that of Cambodia."
"Despite the seriousness of the anti-Thai riots that have taken place in Cambodia, and Mr Hun Sen's responsibility for these events, or at least the management thereof, nobody knows whether the political groups have decided to address this matter at our next sitting."
"I think that Parliament should intervene, however, rather because what is at stake here is democracy, the consolidation of democracy in Cambodia."
"Consequently, I would ask you, Mr President, to kindly send a letter to the Cambodian Head of Government to tell him how important the European Parliament and the European Union in general consider this situation to be."
"I have also asked the chairman of the delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN, Mr Nassauer, to invite the Cambodian ambassador to Strasbourg this week."
"I hope he will be able to come."
"I believe we should support this country if we want to avoid the risk of a counter-revolution."
"Mr President, I have just been in Uganda where I was made aware of the terrible tragedy that is being played out in the northern part of the country and that is being totally ignored by the international press."
"The conflict is taking place between the Ugandan army and the revolutionary movement, the Lord's Resistance Army, which daily abducts a large number of children."
"Approximately 800 000 internally displaced persons are living in wretched conditions in refugee camps."
"The situation in the refugee camps is now so desperate that many people are attempting to return to their villages only to find that the revolutionaries have burned and destroyed their houses and fields."
"A growing number of atrocities committed by the army against the civilian population is also reported every day."
"I should like to call upon you to contact the Presidency with a view to the implementation of an EU initiative that might help solve this conflict."
"Mr President, I am taking the floor because I should like to warn you that your good name is being misused in the Danish media."
"They are saying that, at the Conference of Presidents where we had a video conference with Hans Blix, you said that the latter was warning us against sending a delegation to Iraq."
"Now, we both know, because we were present at the relevant Conference of Presidents and both participated in the video conference, that that is not the case."
"I think you should have an opportunity to say so, because anyone reading the Danish newspapers would believe otherwise."
"Your name is, then, being used in that connection, and this is something I think you should perhaps do something about."
"I can do something about that now in making it clear that I have made no statement about the views of Dr Blix or about sending a delegation with regard to this Parliament."
"On 5 February, the International Court of Justice in The Hague delivered its verdict in a case brought by the Mexican Government against the United States of America, a case concerning three Mexicans, ?in fact, fifty-four \u8722\'2d but three Mexican citizens in particular: Cesar Fierro, Roberto Ramos and Osvaldo Torres, who have been sentenced to death and are sitting on Death Row in Oklahoma and Texas."
"Whilst we are of course opposed to the death penalty in any country, there is more to this case than that, as the three Mexican citizens were prevented from receiving the help that is lawfully their due, in the shape of consular support from their own government."
"The authorities of the State of Texas reacted in an even more diabolical way, stating that the Court of Justice could not stand in the way of the executions."
"This is something about which the European Parliament has, of course, a certain tradition to live up to, and I commend to your consideration, along the lines of the attempt made earlier by Baroness Ludford, the possibility of writing to the governor of Texas about this."
"Let me, in addition, take this opportunity to endorse what Mr Dupuis has just said with regard to the situation in Cambodia."
"The democratic opposition leader Sam Rainsy has now gone into hiding, accused of plotting to bring down the government."
"There is of course not a shred of truth in this, and I think that we should do something about this as well."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Joseba Pagazaurtundua, whom I knew personally."
"Human damage cannot be repaired."
"It is impossible to evaluate human suffering."
"Could the last victim of the ongoing conflict in the Basque country become the final catharsis for its solution?"
"The European Union's own history provides recent examples of nations overcoming deep-rooted conflicts."
"We shall endeavour to set up a momentum of awareness."
"I support all those who are eager to work constructively together towards real peace for my homeland."
"Nevertheless, this goal cannot be met without the strong commitment of the international community."
"Our failure on this approach has meant a further descent into renewed clashes."
"I am sure that a virtuous circle in favour of political dialogue will bring reward and results."
"A change of gear in the European Union's strategy is necessary and urgent."
"Mr President, I will recall the words of Mr Leinen by pointing out that, at this time, the majority of this Parliament is in favour of the President of the Commission being elected by Parliament, which represents a substantial advance, because two years ago the majority of Parliament voted against this initiative, and is also evidence of the progress the European political union is making."
"It is good to remember this at a time when there may be a humanitarian disaster in Iraq and when, for this reason, there is an attack by the United States with allies within the European Union, and allied with States which wish to join the European Union, against the idea of the existence of a political union present throughout the world."
"And I would draw this Parliament's attention, since this is the place where the political notion of Europe must progress, to those who are attacking us by means of internal allies."
"Mr President, we have just heard from the lips of Mr Gorostiaga a defence of murder as a method for resolving political conflicts. I believe this is entirely unacceptable."
"I would add something else: a colleague of Mr Gorostiaga, the Mayor of Andoain, has refused to condemn this murder before all his citizens."
"I do not therefore accept this kind of argument."
"And I would say that, at this time, in the Spanish Basque Country the problem is not that there is a political conflict, but that there is a group who believe that murder is a legitimate method."
"And, since we are in the European Union, I draw your attention to the fact that in the Spanish Basque Country, which is the most autonomous of the European Union's autonomous regions, municipal elections are planned in which many citizens cannot participate since they are in danger of being murdered, like Joseba Pagazaurtundua."
"Mr President, we have just been horrified to hear a member of an organisation which encourages, shelters, feeds, protects and funds the terrorists who have just murdered the person for whom we have held a minute's silence, call for dialogue and peace."
"Mr President, there are times when cynicism can reach such a degree of moral degradation that it is truly amazing."
"Mr President, I would like to say solemnly here in this House that the presence of Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso in this Parliament degrades the European Union, it brings shame on this House, and words cannot express, while the body of an honoured public servant is still warm, the nausea, disgust and repugnance the presence of this individual in a House of democracy and freedoms causes me."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would like on my own behalf and on behalf of many members of my group who were on the delegation to Iraq last week, to express our disquiet at media reports of you claiming we were being duped and manipulated by the Iraqi regime."
"We were accompanied by many members of the media, who surely were not also being duped and manipulated. Their coverage shows quite clearly that we spoke out against the regime, that we insisted on full cooperation with the weapons inspectors and that we brought up past issues such as the gassing of the Kurds."
"In my opinion, this is questioning the credibility of the large number of Members of this Parliament who felt it necessary to go to Iraq because Parliament itself would not send an official delegation."
"I fully agree with Mr Barón Crespo that murder is no solution to political conflict."
"That is why many of us went to Iraq."
"We believe that murder is no solution to political conflict and that we must do everything we can to ensure a political settlement."
"It is very disturbing to hear you, as President of this Parliament, criticise us in the media and question our credibility."
"You did not hear me, Mrs McKenna, but you may have read something in one Irish newspaper."
"Since it was not a quotation of what I said, if you have a problem with it, I suggest that you take the matter up with the sub-editor concerned and not with me."
"Mr President, this part of the sitting is usually dedicated to recounting the litany of horrors perpetrated in the world: massacres, breaches of human rights, torture and the violation, in general, of the most basic principles of civilised life."
"Today I would like to sound a contrary note and welcome something that has happened recently in Mozambique."
"A journalist, Carlos Cardoso, was murdered there for having blown the whistle on a corrupt group of individuals close to power."
"It was thought that the legal system would not be able to bring his murderers to justice. The legal system did work, however, and his murderers were convicted, with stiff sentences."
"This means that Mozambique, where until recently a war devastated an entire country and threw an entire people into poverty, now has democracy and the rule of law."
"Consequently the Mozambican authorities and legal system must be supported and encouraged."
"Now, Mr President, I wish to mention something that has happened here."
"I am reminded of what Fernando Savater, to whom we awarded a prize, said, recalling Chateaubriand: 'I know of no one more cowardly, more servile and more contemptible than a terrorist', and I would add 'or those who protect terrorists'."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to something regarding which the Member States here in the European Parliament do not enjoy equal status."
"Parliament's Visitors Service is its calling card for the public."
"Each Member State should have its own permanent official working in the service, who speaks the language of that Member State and can explain to visitors how Parliament works."
"Parliament has now taken the decision not to have a permanent official who speaks Finnish."
"Finnish will be the only language not used by any permanent official to give explanations to groups of visitors regarding the work of Parliament."
"This, I believe, is discrimination against one Member State and one language."
"It is not in the interests of Parliament if all languages do not have equal status and if one language is merely catered for by temporary assistants or officers, instead of having senior officials telling visitors what happens in Parliament."
"I hope you will be able to do something about this situation and that the Finnish language will enjoy equal status with the other languages."
"Let me check the details and I will get back to you with the results of my enquiries."
"Mr President, on a point of order, tens and thousands of people around Europe and throughout the free world, including the United States, will take to the streets next Saturday in protest at the proposed war in Iraq."
"It is important that we do not let this day go by without acknowledging the initiative taken by Germany, France and Belgium in proposing further United Nations intervention in Iraq to consolidate the search for weapons of mass destruction in that country."
"The people of Europe recognise that they are protesting not against America, but against President Bush and against war."
"It is very important that this day should not go by without our acknowledging this initiative."
"Mr President, the leaders of the USA and Britain, unfortunately with the connivance of many - if not all - of the governments of the members of ???? and the European Union, are moving towards all-out attack on the Iraqi people, with incalculable consequences both for them and the rest of the world."
"To justify their attack, they have submitted unsubstantiated and obsolete evidence to the UN, provided by the CIA's 'evidence is us' department or lifted from PhD theses or bugged telephone conversations in the 1990s, as the US ambassador to Greece admitted to the press the other day."
"This is their excuse of an argument for committing a terrible crime against the long-suffering Iraqi people who, as I had the opportunity of seeing for myself last week, have paid a heavy price over the last 12 years for the 1991 bombings, the embargo and the tyrannical dictatorship of Saddam Hussein."
"We speak for the overwhelming majority of our citizens taking to the streets day after day, when we say: No to war and the embargo against Iraq!"
"Respect for the right of the Iraqi people to determine their own future!"
"No more using the UN to legalise force!"
"This crime can be avoided."
"The problem is whether the European Parliament will abandon its indulgent, Pontius Pilate approach and come out clearly against this criminal war."
"Mr President, as part of the mission of the unofficial delegation in Iraq, I was able, along with three other Members, to go to Makhmour in the Northern part of Iraq, which is under Iraqi sovereignty, close to the autonomous Kurdish zone."
"Makhmour is a refugee camp for Turkish Kurds, of whom there are around 10 000."
"Because of their support for the PKK at the time, they were unable to find refuge in the autonomous zone and, in the event of war, they are likely to be the first victims."
"That is why they want to go home, to their Turkish mountains."
"I would ask Parliament, and I would ask you personally, Mr President, to write to the Turkish authorities, asking them to readmit these villagers whose village was destroyed more than ten years ago."
"These people want to go home, and they will be the first victims if they are unable to do so."
"That is why I think this request is fully justified."
"I would ask you please to supply the full details on that matter to my office."
"Mr President, I had not intended to ask to speak today."
"Political freedom involves allowing the expression of opinions that we find disagreeable."
"Today, I hear speakers who are unwilling to hear a Member of this House say what his electors expect of him."
"I think that Mr Gorostiaga has been elected to show that there is another side to what others are saying concerning the Basque country, and that is what he is doing, whether we agree with him or not."
"I might add that I have not heard him inciting people to commit murder, something that marks a line which none may cross, but I do plead for tolerance for divergent opinions with which we do not agree."
"It is only on that basis that Parliament is able to function."
"Mr President, on a point of order, two Members have raised the question of comments attributed to you in both Irish and Danish newspapers."
"You said that those comments were not correct."
"You advised us to contact the sub-editor of the Irish newspaper concerned."
"It is my experience that the Independent Newspaper Group, in which these comments appeared, does not accept clarifications or corrections from those of us who do not agree with its political line."
"Therefore, Mr President, could you contact the editors concerned in the Independent Newspaper Group and ask them to carry a correction of the remarks you made?"
"No, I will not do that."
"What they put in as a quotation was correct."
"What else they carried, by way of opinion, was not mine."
"I can assure you that what they included in quotation marks was true, but the words that were used here by one of the Members about you being 'duped' are not words that I used."
"I am not prepared to deal with the matter in those terms."
"(Mr De Rossa: 'It is a point of clarification')"
"No, it is not a point for plenary."
"You may take it up with me privately."
"I am not responsible for issues that are not quoted."
"(Mr De Rossa: 'It is your responsibility...')"
"I will not accept responsibility for what is not a quotation of my own."
"That is the end of the matter as far as I am concerned."
"(Mr De Rossa: 'I will pursue this matter')"
"You can pursue the matter if you please, but I will not waste my time on it."
"I apologise once again to colleagues who were on the list to speak, but we have overrun the time allocated."
"That concludes the item."
"On behalf of Parliament I welcome to our official gallery the Committee on Energy Policy of the Danish Parliament, the Folketing, and its president, Mrs Madsen."
"We are very pleased to see you here."
"I hope that your meetings and your time with us in Strasbourg will be productive."
"Thank you for coming."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the World Economic Forum (Davos) and the World Social Forum (Porto Alegre)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the World Economic Forum met in Switzerland and the World Social Forum in Brazil."
"I wonder why they met in parallel, and thousands of kilometres apart, rather than together."
"The European Parliament's debate today, with its joint discussion, gives a good example, as these two subject areas do not absolutely have to be in contradiction to each other."
"If we want to make use of the opportunities afforded by globalisation and to minimise its risks, we need to be prepared to think in an integrated way rather than score points off each other."
"This combined approach is in line with the ecologically responsible market economy, which is our model for the political order."
"We are in favour of the market, but the market has its limits when it comes to the areas of social responsibility and environmental sustainability."
"This joint debate accords with the strategies we formulated in Lisbon and Barcelona, and with our principle that business creates work and that everything that creates work is society's business."
"In his closing address, Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the UN, called for a war on poverty."
"We share the belief that globalisation must go hand in hand with great efforts at fighting poverty."
"Our resolution therefore lends weight to our endorsement of the goals of the United Nations' millennial declaration of war on poverty and calls on the Commission to submit an annual report to us on what progress has been made worldwide in the war on poverty and what contribution we have made to it."
"We are drawing closer together."
"State borders, time zones, distance and size divide us less and less as time goes on."
"We are becoming ever more dependent on each other."
"We bear ever greater responsibility for each other in global terms."
"When others are stricken, we are affected."
"Globalisation is happening, and what matters is that we make good use of the opportunities with which it presents us and minimise its risks, across both hemispheres."
"This is where we need Europe to have more clout on the world stage."
"We need a world economic and social order that is fairer and more just."
"Issues relating to the global social and economic order are matters of European domestic policy in the same way as European policy is part of national domestic policy."
"We need Europe to be stronger and more determined."
"Our continent has an answer to worldwide globalisation - that answer is Europe."
"We have to do our homework for ourselves."
"The Lisbon strategy is the right way ahead, but we have to turn from its lofty aims to the clear definition of specific objectives, laying down timetables and responsibilities."
"On our continent too, a place must be found for our common objectives in all government programmes and work programmes."
"That is why we emphasise the fact that the potential of the internal market has not yet been exhausted, that unemployment rates are too high and that we have to put all our efforts into reducing them here as much as anywhere else."
"We call on the Council to require every single Member State to undertake budgetary and economic reform along the lines recommended by the ECOFIN Council."
"Lisbon and the Internal Market are the tools we need in order to respond to globalisation and to discharge our obligations to the world at large."
"Mr President, to the statement used as the leit motif or motto of Porto Alegre, 'Another world is possible', we should add the issue of whether the world, with its current tendencies, without changes or reforms in view of globalisation, can develop in a peaceful manner."
"The events of recent months are not exactly cause for optimism in this regard."
"Just as the strategic mantra of the Cold War was deterrence, that is, the threat of mutual destruction, now, within a plural and contradictory framework, it appears that the belief is arising that the dominant concept must, in a disturbed and dangerous world, which is increasingly insecure, be that of prevention."
"Nevertheless, we are seeing a growing and increasingly visible conflict over the form effective prevention policies may take."
"On the one hand, we see the response of a form of globalisation resulting from deregulated market capitalism, the unilateral leadership of the strongest and the new doctrine of preventive, dissuasive military action and ad hoc coalitions."
"On the other hand, we see increasingly large sectors with very opposing ideological positions, but which agree that, in view of the globalised world, the response must be a multilateral policy of democratic rules, global reforms and peace, particularly in view of the threat of terrorism, stating that what we essentially have to do is remove the sources of hate and humiliation in the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that, in the face of this emergence of a world public opinion demanding reforms of globalisation, we need a realistic vision, broad consensus on reform and concrete and financially viable initiatives."
"Europe has a vital interest in this issue."
"It must exert a world influence and be fully aware of its global responsibilities."
"Its original raison d'être was peace, following the devastating wars of the twentieth century."
"Over the last fifty years, it has perhaps been the first effective supranational response to the challenges of globalisation."
"In order to pursue this development, we must establish ourselves as a global player, with a more united and powerful foreign policy, despite all the current difficulties, because these movements, this global civil society, is increasingly demanding a Europe, a united Europe, and we must not disappoint."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying how pleased I am that these two global forums have run their course without violence; we have experienced rather different ones."
"I would like to put forward a few points on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party."
"The first is that there is still large-scale and persistent poverty in the developing countries despite all the developed world's pledges to halve poverty by 2015, and our good progress towards this has come to an end."
"As I see it, this is another area where there is a major role for the private sector."
"This is not about the major international concerns always transferring production to the countries where wages are lowest in order to reduce their production costs."
"This is about their consciously seeking partnerships with local firms and organisations."
"By investing in local trade and industry, by making sure that they make good social provision for their employees and that men and women receive fair wages, they can contribute a great deal to the fight against poverty."
"Corporate Social Responsibility is not only a splendid expression but also of fundamental importance."
"This must of course be exercised on a completely voluntary basis and from the bottom up."
"So I call on business too to be as socially responsible as possible when making investments."
"The ideal is that business at a national level should implement this in all its policy areas."
"A second point that I want to make has to do with the importance of education in combating poverty."
"Here, too, the private sector can do its bit."
"By deliberately using their own know-how to support local vocational training, this sector can give the people a better education."
"In the long term, this will also be of benefit to their own personnel policy."
"In all this, I do not, of course, want to play down the part played by the developing countries' national governments and by the international community."
"Human rights must always be nurtured and promoted."
"These include good working conditions, along with democracy and good management, for which the developing countries' national governments are themselves responsible; they must take action themselves, even though the developed countries can give them support."
"Through constructive policies in their own countries, in which the environment and freedom of access for everyone to all the basic amenities, such as water and land, have a major part to play, they too can contribute to spreading prosperity on a fair basis."
"It is to be hoped that the outcome of both forums will be that these points are taken on board, and then we will perhaps have a better chance of reducing poverty, if not by 50% by 2015, then by an amount not too far from that objective."
"Mr President, I was able to be in Porto Alegre and can indeed confirm that the large number of participants, the diverse regional nature of these participants and of the organisations they represented and also the richness of the debates and of the proposals and conclusions drafted and adopted in the course of the work undertaken there on the main issues of the day established the World Social Forum as an unparalleled expression of social movements and, in general, of world civil society."
"As the Secretary-General of the United Nations quite rightly said, these factors confirmed the event especially as a crucial and undeniable milestone in the quest for solutions to the enormous challenges facing humanity today in the various plans put forward and also in creating a real alternative to the neo-liberal model."
"Held once again in Brazil, but this time coinciding with the election and inauguration of President Lula da Silva as President of that country, and since he was one of the major driving forces of the World Social Forum, this event was, of course, influenced by these factors. These factors today represent new and more promising prospects, especially demonstrating a new attitude that represents a clear break with the status quo that has prevailed in recent times."
"The need to give substance to a new world order of progress and peace, proclaimed by President Lula da Silva in Porto Alegre and also in Davos, was of course the central issue in Porto Alegre and probably represents the greatest challenge we face today. Consequently, and as was made clear there, the United Nations must be given a new boost and a new profile."
"It is also crucial to thoroughly change, reform and readjust basic methods and guidelines, in particular of some of the key instruments of the current world order such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation."
"Nevertheless, coming at a time when absurd US intervention is being planned for Iraq, the World Social Forum was able, clearly and in line with the will of the broad majority of world public opinion, unequivocally to affirm its rejection of such a war."
"Porto Alegre was not, therefore, by any stretch of the imagination, merely a critical counterpoint to Davos."
"In its three versions, it established itself as a fundamental pillar in the construction of a real alternative to the neo-liberal model that Davos broadly represented. This model is inextricably linked to the situations of social injustice, iniquity, division and crisis that we are seeing today."
"For this very reason and while Porto Alegre grows and is accepted, Davos, which is extremely elitist, is increasingly redundant and caught up in the contradictions inherent in the model it advocates and in the damaging effects it has."
"Solutions to these crises were sought unsuccessfully in Davos, because there was no consideration and even less analysis of the underlying causes of this crisis."
"Attention was focused on economic growth, but the importance of the fair distribution of wealth that this growth should provide was overlooked. What was omitted in particular were the damaging effects that the primacy of the market causes, especially in terms of deepening the North-South divide, of increasing poverty in the world and of environmental degradation."
"It therefore comes as no surprise that President Lula da Silva's speech in Davos should have caused such ripples."
"I hope that it does considerably more than this in future."
"As a matter of fact, in this context, I would say that the European Union can and must contribute to ensuring that it does."
"Mr President, this was the last time the Porto Alegre Social Forum and the World Economic Forum will take place on the same day."
"The Porto Alegre Forum took place against a backdrop of active opposition to and protest against the possible war with Iraq, and the Economic Forum in Davos discussed the future of the world in an atmosphere which one very authoritative commentator described as more regrettable than ever."
"I feel that, from this point of view, it is extremely significant that dialogue, which has thus far been greatly lacking between these two events, was represented by the presence of the Brazilian President, Mr Lula da Silva, who, in both cases, upheld the need for huge structural reform - the kind of reform that he has undertaken to carry out in his own country - of the world economic system, wholeheartedly condemning the empty principle of free trade at all costs, which only actually applies to the poor countries since the wealthy countries can afford to be protectionist whenever and however they want."
"Not least for all those who firmly believe that the role of the Union on the international stage is not just to be a vassal but to endeavour to bring about democratic globalisation, it is clear that the election of President Lula da Silva and his government is cause for hope and huge expectations, as you will certainly have noticed, Commissioner Lamy, since you were in Brazil in the days immediately following Porto Alegre."
"At Porto Alegre, the movements confirmed their mission to become a kind of outpost for an attentive, active world public opinion, and this was quite clear, not least to the 700 members of parliament who were present and agreed on an agenda which I feel is worthy of mention here."
"First and foremost, active opposition to the war: four members of the Brazilian Parliament took part in the much-criticised delegation to Iraq, and there was very broad support for the initiatives seeking to instigate parliamentary debates all over the world, in addition to the demonstrations due to take place on 15 February."
"The challenge, however, which we feel to be particularly important for our institution and the European Union is the Cancún conference and reform of the international financial institutions."
"On this matter, unlike the situation as regards the question of Iraq, Europe does have some clout, and you, Commissioner Lamy, represent it with great authority."
"Europe can make a difference."
"What we are asking from you is simple and important: transparency, not least towards Parliament, in terms of the negotiations you conduct, and the possibility of open debate at least as regards basic decisions on investments, agriculture and the liberalisation of services."
"There is no need to shy away from this."
"We need to have the courage to uphold positions which are sometimes uncomfortable but which can make it quite clear that the European Union is not blindly following the lead of the United States but takes its responsibility towards the world seriously."
"For instance, Commissioner, please do not backtrack on the agreements you committed to at Doha on medicines and TRIPS."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I will not repeat what I have said before on the subject of globalisation and the so-called neoliberalist model."
"I will endeavour to go straight to the point. The point is that what we can do, what Europe can do to respond to the many undeniably rightful demands is fight on one particular front, the open, most sensitive front, for North-South relations, and to free, or create the conditions which make it possible to free, hundreds of millions of people from hunger and poverty."
"We must fight on the front of protectionism, starting with the slogans, with the many things which have been said even in this debate."
"When we say that the wealthy can indulge in protectionism in any event, we are saying something that is undeniably true, but we saw at Doha that, for the wealthy countries, protectionism means introducing social clauses, environmental clauses, talking about food safety and using these instruments - and we were reproached for this at Doha by Indonesia, Brazil and India - for protectionism."
"'Do not give us your milk, do not give us your agricultural products, please, because your giving us milk and wheat represents unfair competition for Peruvian farmers ?"
"Do what you are asking us to do: open up your markets ?"
"Open up your markets ? trade means work."
"If we cannot market our products we will have more unemployed men and women.'"
"These were the words of the Peruvian President, Mr Toledo, to us a month and a half or two months ago in a formal sitting in this Chamber."
"We must respond."
"In this connection, I would like to take advantage of the presence of Commissioner Lamy to say that the modalities for the post-Doha agriculture trade round presented by the European Union do not go far enough."
"We must be bolder."
"We must not continue to let the United States carry off the prizes for genuine liberalisation of the agricultural markets."
"The United States adopted its Farm Bill last spring, sending out a lamentable signal of protectionism and farming subsidies - as they had done with respect to trade - with regard to its internal market, but, in the area of foreign trade, putting forward a proposal which goes much further than the European proposal."
"I believe that, on this matter, Europe must - if everything we are saying is true, if all the attention we are claiming to pay to the countries of the developing world where others are not is genuine - be much more courageous."
"This is a practical political decision that we have to make, in the knowledge that there is a price for going against protectionism."
"Not everybody agrees that these are good principles: there will be opposition from the textiles lobby, the farmers lobby."
"Do we have the courage to do it or not?"
"The Economic Forum and the World Social Forum met concurrently, reflecting the split between the outlooks they represent."
"The venues for each were also symbolic: the Economic Forum met in the ski resort of Davos, the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, in the midst of a continent in full-blown economic crisis."
"Yet, in my view, opinions do not have to be so sharply divided."
"It is unfair simply to equate globalisation with an unbridled cross-border capitalism that is to the advantage only of multinationals."
"Those who were called anti-globalists have themselves understood this, and now call themselves alternative globalists."
"I think that general free trade still always offers the best guarantee of economic growth in all parts of the world, even in the poorest."
"The European Union is the best example of this."
"The thoroughgoing economic integration of Europe by means of the internal market and the opening up of our internal borders have already made it possible for us to live in what is at present one of the wealthiest parts of the world."
"It is this unique model of true globalisation that we have to take out into the wider world."
"There is certainly no way back."
"As the European Union, we have an important part to play in this debate."
"We must endeavour to bring the speakers at Davos and Porto Alegre together in an attempt to persuade them that liberalising world trade is an equitable way of improving living standards and bringing greater prosperity to the whole world."
"Mr President, I wish, first of all, to talk about something that is of concern to us all: the issue of war and peace, which was addressed in Davos and Porto Alegre."
"In Davos, it was discussed because of the effects of the economic situation of the war against Iraq that the United States and its allies have decided on."
"Without denying the disastrous effects on the world economy of the militaristic decisions of George Bush, what was at the heart of the proposals made in Porto Alegre against the war and in favour of peace were the serious political and humanitarian issues raised by the United States' aggression."
"We have a situation in which ultraliberal capitalism, which can be seen as the domination of globalisation by the most powerful States and the huge multinational corporations, is leading the world towards disaster."
"Especially today, we are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster in Iraq, causing the death of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, amongst the poorest and most needy members of Iraqi society, especially young people, with the United States counting on the complicity and action of its European allies."
"Mr President, we must remember that the governments of the United States and of some Member States of the Union, against the beliefs and wishes of the majority of European citizens, are reaching the point where they are calling into question the model of European political integration that brings with it the awareness of another form of globalisation, which is more human and egalitarian and which demonstrates greater solidarity."
"The United States even want to destroy the idea of a constitutional political Europe with an independent role in the world."
"The other issue I wish to raise, Mr President, concerns international maritime traffic, the safety of our seas and of our coastal communities."
"The World Parliamentary Forum presented this problem as one of the main concerns of the 'old world' school of thought."
"The European Union must attach priority to resolving this problem, which today particularly affects Galicia and other European countries, from the Spanish State to France."
"The sea represents life itself."
"We cannot allow it to be owned and contaminated by a greedy, irresponsible and corrupt form of capitalism that enjoys the complicity of some European States."
"I therefore hope that the European States and this Parliament take the decisions that are needed to prevent the destruction of the sea that gives us life and sustains us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by congratulating the European Parliament on having scheduled this debate on the differing, if not outright antagonistic positions of the Davos Economic Forum and the World Social Forum of Porto Alegre."
"I have taken part in both forums and know what I am talking about - in Davos, around twenty years ago, when I was Prime Minister of Portugal and had to negotiate hard for a loan from the International Monetary Fund. In Porto Alegre, I have taken part for the two last years as a Member of the European Parliament."
"The last Social Forum, which took place last January, was particularly significant, as has already been said, for the number of participants, around 100 000, who had come from all over the world, it was significant for the around 1 500 NGOs and other civic associations that were present and, above all, for the quality of the speeches."
"Incidentally, it was not only the World Social Forum that took place in Porto Alegre: there were also other forums such as the World Forum of Judges, the Local Authorities Forum, the World Education Forum, the World Independent Media Forum, and the World Parliamentary Forum."
"This World Forum in Porto Alegre gave rise to a new sociological phenomenon: global citizenship, which means people getting together as part of a network, freely and regardless of their political parties or religious or secular affiliations and fighting, in a peaceful and orderly way, for their rights and for what they consider to be fair."
"This is an important civic and participatory form of activism, which will continue on every continent with the meeting of various regional forums, since the next World Social Forum will be held in India."
"This year, the Porto Alegre World Forum was attended by a unique personality, the recently elected President of the Republic of Brazil, Luís Inácio 'Lula' da Silva."
"In his extremely coherent speech to a crowd of hundreds of thousands of listeners, he explained to the Forum why he had accepted an invitation to attend, following the Porto Alegre Forum, the Davos Economic Forum, which some of his supporters found hard to understand."
"It was not so hard to understand, however: Lula explained to the audience of politicians, businessmen and experts gathered at Davos, and I quote 'that his war was different; it was the fight against hunger and poverty, for access to better education, against diseases and epidemics such as AIDS, not the war against Iraq or to call for higher rates of growth at the expense of unemployment and of greater poverty'."
"Curiously and paradoxically, his speech, which was the same at both forums, was characterised by sincerity and truthfulness, and perhaps this is why it was applauded so loudly in Davos, considerably more than Colin Powell when he defended the inevitability of the war against Iraq."
"Even when they are defending interests, people also have a conscience and this is what drives the world forwards, even in these current troubled times."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am delighted to see that you give equal status to Porto Alegre and Davos."
"The Greens, like Mr Désir and a few others, we who were behind the Porto Alegre parliamentary forum, are delighted to learn that alterglobalisation is beginning to find an echo among you."
"I believe that President Lula has, indeed, taken the right step, because he came to present first to Porto Alegre what he was going to defend in Davos, in other words, the reconstruction of a fairer economic order."
"I feel that this democratic, socially aware, political move is a step along the right road: civil society should have its say first and then the decision-makers of the global economy."
"Market capitalism cannot continue to be the dominant form of politics."
"I would remind you - even if this is perhaps a sophism - that democracy and politics normally take precedence over economic considerations."
"It is vital to prove this, as that would also make it possible to avoid a pre-emptive war such as that proposed by the Bush government, which is largely subservient to multinationals which have a far greater need for oil than for ideas."
"Lastly, these same multinationals want at all costs to reappropriate sustainable development and the common goods belonging to all mankind such as water, air and energy."
"It seems to me, however, that in Cancun, Commissioner, you should help us to defend our idea of globalisation."
"It is right that we should concern ourselves with current GATS negotiations, because they represent quite a risk, and it is right that the southern States should know that we support them with regard to each individual's right to food, drinking water and breathable air."
"Mr President, Davos and Porto Alegre are in different continents, but in them global problems were dealt with along the same lines."
"Business resources and entrepreneurship combined with the know-how, skills and legitimacy of the rest of civil society can provide lasting solutions to the problems of globalisation."
"The average cow in the OECD countries receives two euros every day in state aid, while more than two billion people live on less than two euros a day."
"More than a billion people have to get by on less than one euro a day. That is such a small sum of money that it does not even meet the basic requirements of international human and fundamental rights."
"The right to life cannot be separated from the right to food, water, health services or work, and the right to have an opinion cannot be separated from the basic rights of a civilised society."
"These rights are what the economy is built on."
"Human rights are not a luxury which we can afford only when the economy is growing: they are a necessary prerequisite for companies' viability and stability."
"In Russia, for example, conditions for business cannot improve significantly without some fundamental adjustments being made in the implementation of human rights and in the law."
"At present in Russia it is possible to solve problems informally with reference to arbitrary, unwritten and ever-changing laws, which only adds to corruption."
"It is therefore in the interest of companies too to be involved in the implementation of human and fundamental rights."
"One way is participation in the UN Global Compact."
"Under this scheme first proposed four years ago at Davos by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, a company commits itself to nine simple basic principles in the area of human rights, labour standards and the environment."
"Furthermore, in the EU a framework for the social responsibility of companies has been promoted, but alongside voluntary action we need binding legislation."
"We should show up those companies operating in the EU, which either here or elsewhere have contributed directly or indirectly to human and fundamental rights violations, by naming and shaming them."
"In addition, we should develop suitable sanctions to impose on companies which are guilty of, or have contributed to, human rights violations and corruption outside the EU."
"Businesses ultimately have enormous influence whatever the community, region or state they are located in."
"The day business genuinely decides to fight against corruption and human rights violations is the day globalisation will mean and consist of something quite different from what it does at the present time."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for a long time it was claimed that the movement, which began in Seattle before continuing in both Porto Alegre and Florence, was the expression of an anti-globalisation that was ineffective in the face of the allegedly effective modernism of the world liberal economy, represented by the Davos Economic Forum."
"Davos, where the elite were to meet, against Porto Alegre, where popular opinion would meet."
"The theory is now belied by the facts."
"While the Davos Forum seems to be unsure of itself and on the defensive, the global social movement, that of the citizens, meeting in Porto Alegre, does not hesitate to enter into the dysfunctional world of the elite of Davos and the strength of its proposals is based on civil public force."
"In the face of environmental deterioration, the NGOs that take part in the forum propose the internationalisation of environmental protection and universal sustainable development."
"In the face of the exploitation which often results from a market economy with no restrictions, the trade unions propose the globalisation of social rights, in particular through universal respect for the seven fundamental work standards laid down by the ILO."
"In the face of unilateralism and the return to the policy of pre-emptive war, the World Social Forum proposes global political and social mobilisation in favour of peace."
"With regard to the WTO and GATS trade rounds, the Social Forum outlines the territory of universal public goods and declares them world common heritage: water, health, energy and culture are thus included in the list of inalienable rights."
"Lastly, in the face of the flagrant inequality with regard to hunger, it was proposed in Porto Alegre to implement better global redistribution of wealth, in particular through cancelling the debt, but also through taxing capital transfers for the benefit of development."
"At Porto Alegre, in the face of the discredited image of Europe that the United States wants to disseminate everywhere, another Europe was also discussed, a Europe about whose shortcomings we have no illusions but which many envy us, a Europe that is a model of successful integration."
"These are the specific proposals arising from the Porto Alegre Social Forum, where only popular opinion meets, Commissioner."
"I am sorry."
"The main question remains, however: how will we in the European Union, in the Commission, receive these proposals?"
"Could we imagine, more broadly speaking, that these hopes might be included in our European political agenda for another kind of globalisation, our kind of globalisation?"
"Mr President, the fact that I was in Porto Alegre and not in Davos is not the only reason why I feel that, of the two fora held at the end of January, the Porto Alegre Forum was certainly the most important."
"It outlined a range of constructive proposals for world policies on the environment, peace and freedom of expression and combating hunger and disease."
"It is particularly important that the European Parliament should take into consideration what was said at the Forum regarding the forthcoming World Trade Organisation meeting in Cancún."
"We know that an agreement on services is planned, but we do not yet know which services will be covered by the agreement and made subject to the rules of free international trade."
"The Forum and, I believe, Parliament's concern is the possibility that the services to be liberalised might include certain essential social services such as education or health and certain essential public commodities such as water."
"Any subjection of such services to market rules would be a breach of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Nice Charter and other formal international treaties."
"The Commission must give Parliament prior notice of the list which it intends to propose and uphold in Cancún, so that it can assess it and express the views of the European citizens on these extremely sensitive issues."
"The Forum also recognised and welcomed enthusiastically the possibility that the European Union should become a model for other structures of supranational and regional democratic governance, first and foremost as a means of limiting conflict and establishing peace."
"From this particular perspective, it is no coincidence that the Porto Alegre Forum was held in Brazil and that President Lula da Silva has now intervened."
"Indeed, not only can the European Union become the model for a similar political initiative in Latin America, but its very existence and independent international structure will benefit from a decisive boost in a world in which, thanks, not least, to President Lula da Silva and Latin America, multipolarity is developing, although that multipolarity is currently under great threat from the intention of the United States and some of its most faithful allies to declare war on Iraq unilaterally."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have been in Porto Alegre, the civil alternative to Davos, which was discussed earlier."
"It would be preferable not to have two opposing fora - one economic and one social, one governmental and one civil - each calling for completely different political orientations for the future."
"In Porto Alegre, local authorities, members of parliament, trade unions, non-governmental organisations, judges and teachers proposed - perhaps idealistically - that another world is possible, and not just possible, but necessary."
"In Davos, directors of multinational companies and ministers concluded that the key elements for the new world economic agenda are the real value of companies in view of the volatility of their share values, trade as a fundamental instrument for sustainable development and the principles to govern the activities of the multinationals."
"In other words, the distance between the citizens and the people with real power is only increasing."
"During these two minutes, I will just give a couple of examples: in Davos there were references to AIDS, but there was no reference to the need for pharmaceutical laboratories, whose investments in advertising and marketing are double their investments in research, to open up their patents to developing countries."
"Another example: it is considered that commerce is an important factor in development but there is no reference to reciprocity in the opening up of markets."
"The protectionism of the rich countries, including the European Union's agricultural policy, has a negative impact on development."
"I believe, Commissioner, that Europe must be a model for reducing the distance between each position."
"The economic order promoted in Davos must be accompanied by a social and political order such as that called for in Porto Alegre."
"The participation of European parliamentarians in Porto Alegre is a good symptom, but the European Union's partnership with citizens' movements must go further."
"We urge the Community's institutions to join in with global campaigns on access to water, agriculture, food safety and public services."
"We also ask the Commission to support the creation of a world fund to combat hunger and poverty."
"Mr President, those who have taken part in our debate this evening cannot, I believe, fail to be struck by the similarities between the views of the Members speaking on both Davos and Porto Alegre."
"The first are Mr Karas and Mr Obiols i Germà, who both, in a way, asked us the same question: is it possible to seek, on a global scale, this domestication, this capitalist government that Europe has cultivated on its own soil for over 200 years?"
"Could this social market economy with which you all, with very few exceptions, credit Europe, be a project for the world?"
"I believe that the response could be affirmative."
"This could be our response, with a certain number of conditions."
"The first is accepting that sustainability in the economic, social and environmental sense can be a genuine common project, and it is that sustainability that is the real basis for stability and security."
"If we agree on the first point, the second condition to be met is undoubtedly to form alliances on this subject with other parties in the world, and I find the concept of global public goods mentioned by Mrs Zrihen and Mr Désir interesting in that respect."
"Then, clearly, the third condition is to succeed in providing our planet with the system of governance it needs."
"Undoubtedly that system will have to be more comprehensive than the measure available to us today, which is both partial and unbalanced."
"On this point, I agree with what both Mr Miranda and Mr Moreira Da Silva said."
"It is clear from the wording of all these conditions that this is unlikely to take place without a Europe that is more solid, more united and more involved than today's Europe."
"In any case, that is what I think I understood on hearing Mrs Frassoni's statements and, on this point, the Commission agrees."
"Much remains to be done, as Mr Désir said with regard to the IMF proposal, and I agree with him on that point, even if his interpretation of the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services continues to pose us a few problems here or there."
"However, that is a discussion that I will also have to have with Mrs Auroi and a number of others."
"Much clearly remains to be done, and I believe that the consideration of the current geopolitical situation, whether in terms of Iraq or the Middle East, reminds us, if this were necessary, that the objective of a common foreign and security policy - which is inextricably linked to the projects that you would like Europe to implement in the field of globalisation - is still a long way off."
"I shall now speak on a number of more specific points."
"I agree with Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mrs Korhola about the importance of companies' social responsibility."
"Private initiatives might come from the world of business to achieve better management of globalisation, just as, furthermore, there might be citizens' initiatives on what President Suarez called citizen and social mobilisation."
"This is proven, in particular, by fair trade and by consumer movements in favour of labelling that is environmentally friendly or promotes better social conditions for production."
"We are quite aware that, in these areas, nothing will be done without mobilising society itself."
"As regards the role and intervention of the parliaments and democratic control, Mrs Frassoni, you are aware of the Commission's position on the place that this House, this Parliament, should occupy in this kind of debate, particularly where multilateral trade issues are concerned."
"We would refer you to the Convention, which once again must rule on this point."
"Let us hope that, on this point as on others, the Convention will be more productive than the last intergovernmental conference."
"I shall not dwell on agricultural issues."
"We will come back to them in the debate that is to follow."
"With regard to the technological gap to be overcome, Mr Wijkman, you are correct, and I believe that we in the Commission agree on the fact that our public aid to development should, in a number of cases, be reoriented or reviewed."
"As regards the service industry, the Commission's proposals are now on the table."
"Your Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy may take them up under the conditions of our institutional agreement."
"These same proposals are also on the table of the Council of Ministers."
"Thus, the time for public debate has begun, and I personally am delighted."
"To end this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure"
"The next item is the Commission Statement on the 'Authorisation of generic medicines at WTO level'."
"Commissioner Lamy has the floor once again."
"Mr President, this debate is an opportunity to discuss with you the work taking place in the World Trade Organisation on access for developing countries to medicines at an affordable price."
"As you know, the members of the WTO have not been able to find a solution within the time set, which was the end of 2002, to the problems encountered by developing countries which do not have the capacity to produce medicines, since the debate concerned that exact problem following the agreements signed in Doha."
"The European Union has put a great deal of effort into searching for a solution."
"We are adopting, and that has always been the basis for our position, an approach which, on the one hand, allows reduced-price medicines, including generic medicines, to reach those who need them, and on the other, allows the pharmaceutical industry to continue to invest in research."
"We would like to reach a balanced result, first of all because we need to solve what is a substantial, in some cases tragic, social problem in many developing countries, and secondly because this situation clearly weighs heavily on the climate of trust that needs to reign around the table of the WTO in order for progress to be made in the Doha negotiations."
"We have therefore worked very hard to try to find a solution that is both legally sound and sustainable, by refusing a moratorium on the regulation of differences of opinion as a solution to this question and rejecting any ideas of derogation from the outset."
"We do not feel that either of these two methods fulfils these two conditions of soundness and sustainability."
"We therefore cannot accept the current situation which is either failure or half-measures such as the moratorium, even though this half-measure provides a temporary solution."
"The Union's position remains the same."
"We need to find a multilateral solution as quickly as possible, a sustainable, fair, solution which provides a sufficient degree of legal security for all the players to be able to join forces."
"That is why we have fully accepted the draft agreement of 16 December that was on the table."
"We found that it was reasonable and balanced and that it fulfilled the Doha mandate, and that is why, like the overwhelming majority of the members of the WTO, we were won over by it."
"The problem of scope as regards the various types of health problem still remains."
"We know that only the Americans have been unable to join the consensus on this point."
"This situation, I have said this publicly and I repeat it to you now, is deeply regrettable, and this obstacle must be overcome."
"It is clear to the Union that the Doha mandate is intentionally broad and that we must respect this."
"In case of a serious public health problem, and I reiterate the terms of the Doha Declaration, the WTO mechanism allowing generic medicines to be imported can and must be activated."
"We are therefore seeking an agreement that can go further, given the scope provided by Doha, including the assumption henceforth recognised by all that diseases such as AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and a whole list of others would be covered as a general principle, and that is why we have suggested involving the WHO, which has undisputed experience in the field of public health."
"We did so on the basis of a list which I would like to specify is neither exclusive nor restrictive."
"We feel that the use of the system should not be limited to the diseases on this list."
"There must be no misunderstanding on this point."
"For any other serious public health problem, in the event of doubt over the basis for the measure, a member of the WTO could request a medical opinion from the World Health Organisation."
"This possibility of requesting an opinion should allow the United States to overcome their reticence with regard to the use of the system by developing countries."
"This would simply be a non-restrictive opinion."
"There again, I would specify that this would in no way constitute an attack on the sovereignty of the Member States in the field of public health."
"We all know that the role of the WHO is, at least currently, purely advisory."
"Our objective, in placing this proposal on the table at the beginning of January, has been achieved."
"Discussions have begun again."
"Our proposal acts as a basis for these discussions and we are going to do all we can, as we have over the past few months, to convince the members of the WTO of the need for a compromise that is as close as possible to that of 16 December."
"We must make progress."
"Too many countries need to import low-cost medicines."
"We know that the temporary measure that enables them to do so today is not permanent, and from that point of view we do not want to and cannot disappoint them."
"Mr President, this evening we will identify what are probably the two make-or-break issues for the next WTO round in Cancun - TRIPS and public health and agriculture."
"Developing countries' perception of our good faith, good will and sincerity towards them will be tested by our attitude to these two issues."
"As we know, binding agreement was reached in the form of the Doha Declaration, paragraph 6 of which highlighted the difficult issue of WTO members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector, who could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing under the TRIPS agreement."
"The Council for TRIPS was asked to find an expeditious solution to this problem."
"Commissioner, we welcome the efforts you have made and the backing you have had to get this implemented."
"In an innovative and welcome suggestion you enlist the aid of the World Health Organisation."
"If the intention is not honoured, the new constraints would violate the spirit of the Doha Declaration and would show bad faith."
"I am sure you are right - and we have had discussions about this - to reject a moratorium on disputes or, indeed, a derogation."
"Neither is an adequate solution."
"The behaviour of the United States, not just on this issue but also - and far more seriously in some ways - on the issue of Iraq, is becoming increasingly difficult to understand."
"Indeed, the only possible explanation is its politicians paying undue attention to the financial interests of pharmaceutical companies who paid for their election."
"They have come up with only a unilateral solution and a narrow list."
"This is inadequate!"
"Two deadlines have been missed already, and there is a real risk of deadlock if the efforts which we have channelled through you come to nothing."
"Concerns which have been raised, for example on the diversion trade in generic medicines, are being tackled."
"Hence the regulation by the Council of Ministers."
"Let us welcome your proposal of 7 January."
"It is a multilateral solution which enlists a reputable and widely trusted agency, the World Health Organisation."
"As you said, the solution must be lasting, fair and legally viable."
"The conflict should be examined on the basis of the guideline that public health has primacy over patents."
"We cannot overestimate the importance of finding a solution to this issue. I wish you very good luck, Commissioner."
"Mr President, in this debate it is perhaps worth citing once again what the Doha Declaration actually says."
"I quote: 'The TRIPS agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health', and it: 'can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO members' rights, to protect human health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all'."
"It is worth bearing in mind those words and repeating them for the record, particularly for the consumption of US observers."
"I doubt they are listening right now, but perhaps we can send them a copy of the Minutes of this stimulating discussion later on."
"The US position is not just contrary to the spirit of the Doha Declaration: it directly contravenes the letter of the Doha Declaration."
"As such, it is a slap in the face for all developing countries which invested so much hope in the Doha Declaration and in the objectives of the Doha development round."
"It represents a spectacular assertion of narrow and misguided commercial interests over the greater prize of a development round itself."
"It is worth making that clear because if you then consider the commercial interests at stake, it becomes even more incomprehensible why the US is single-handedly blocking agreement in this area."
"I would now like to quote a press release from the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations."
"It states that: 'over 95% of all medicines on the WHO drugs essential list are off-patent, and studies show that there are relatively few patents on AIDS drugs in Africa'."
"In other words, that statistic alone suggests there is very little commercial risk for either the European pharmaceuticals industry, or the US industry itself."
"It is all the more frustrating to watch these deadlines being missed - even applying the logic of their own commercial self-interest - as a particular sector in the US blocks progress in this field."
"My group strongly supports the initiatives taken by Commissioner Lamy and the European Commission."
"We sympathise with his position and ask why it is that the US pharmaceuticals industry seems to have been able to marshal US government support in backing its irrational reaction to the EU proposal."
"Unilateralism with a reason is just about comprehensible."
"Unilateralism without any logic whatsoever is unforgivable."
"Mr President, I would also like to express my group's support for the good work of the Commissioner aimed at providing a satisfactory solution to this conflict which has arisen in Doha in relation to the United States' position."
"I would like to point out several inconsistencies: as a doctor and a teacher, I am aware of the range of reports presented each year by the World Health Organisation, which always cite the famous Horowitz vicious circle, according to which illness creates poverty and poverty creates illness."
"We therefore have to break this vicious circle by helping to eradicate diseases - amongst other things - because the eradication of disease increases economic capacity and that helps to put countries in a position to produce, to have their own industry, and helps to provide access to these medicines for the people who need them."
"We are therefore talking about a duty in which we have a high degree of responsibility."
"It is also regrettable - as other speakers have said - that the unilateral position of the United States in this regard is having a bearing on one of the most negative aspects of the process of neoliberal globalisation we are suffering, which consists of increasing inequalities and hindering and weakening the situation of the countries with fewest resources."
"We therefore have to understand that it is the European Union, which is based on a desire for peace, development and solidarity, which can introduce elements to ensure a rebalance within the context of this neoliberal process of globalisation which is under way in order to provide it with the elements which - as has been said during the previous debate - arose from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre."
"We therefore believe that the European Union's efforts to make the World Health Organisation an organisation with the authority to be able to indicate the necessary health situations at any particular time to be appropriate, and we therefore support Mr Lamy's position."
"Mr President, I am amazed and saddened that this matter should be back up for discussion."
"In November 2001, the developing countries were rejoicing in the Doha Declaration, which authorised them to have recourse to compulsory licences for public health reasons."
"There is just one cloud on the horizon: countries with no production capacity must have the medicines they need manufactured in another country and a company may only manufacture a medicine if 51% of its production is intended for the national market."
"This problem in paragraph 6 should have been solved before the end of 2002."
"It has still not been solved."
"In the meantime, the American pharmaceutical laboratories, who are the main financial backers for the Bush campaign, have returned to the attack."
"The proposals made by the United States or the European Union, which are each more restrictive than the last, have resulted in failure."
"Today, the Trips Council is proposing to return to the previous wording allowing recourse to compulsory licences in urgent cases, a solution that proved inapplicable and led to the Doha Declaration."
"The objective of paragraph 6 must be to ensure that countries with no production capacity can genuinely use compulsory licences."
"On the contrary, however, some proposals create discrimination between first-class countries with a production capacity and second-class countries with no production capacity, which are, in fact, the poorest countries."
"The former will be able to use compulsory licences to manufacture any medicine that responds to a public health problem that they themselves have identified, whereas the latter will have to prove that they are experiencing a national situation of urgency."
"Although, in theory, all countries may have recourse to compulsory licences, in practice, the poorest countries will have to fight to have urgent situations recognised, obtain their licence and have their medicines manufactured."
"This proposal is unacceptable and I would ask you, Mr Lamy, to propose a solution that is genuinely beneficial to developing countries so that health takes precedence over profit, as you yourself said so well."
"Mr President, the crux of this issue is very simple."
"It is that there are 42 million people in the world today suffering from the AIDS virus, yet we have the technology and the treatments available to combat diseases such this."
"However, people in the developing countries cannot afford to pay the exorbitant prices for the medicines needed to treat sufferers of AIDS and other diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis."
"If we are to provide these medicines to those who need them, we have to override the intellectual property rights of companies who have patented the technology to combat these diseases."
"We can achieve this by reaching an agreement between all contracting parties at the level of the World Trade Organisation."
"The crux of the discussions is the relationship between intellectual property rights and public health issues."
"If developing countries can be given the right to distribute these much-needed medicines to their own people on their own licensing terms, then the cost of these medicines will be substantially reduced."
"We all recall the much publicised court case brought by 40 pharmaceutical companies against the South African Government on this issue."
"We have a moral obligation to support the effort of finding the way to provide urgently needed medicines to people in developing countries."
"This is a matter for the World Trade Organisation, but progress, I regret, is far too slow."
"Last November, the European Union presented a compromise proposal to the WTO ministerial meeting in Australia to find a solution to this important matter."
"However, it now appears that the US Government is just not satisfied with the terms of this compromise."
"The US Government believes that too many diseases are included in the European Union's proposal."
"Too many diseases are included they say, when in the meantime people are dying from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."
"Over three million people will die from AIDS this year alone."
"The technology is there to provide suitable treatment to sufferers of this disease."
"Intellectual property rights will have to be put to one side so that we can alleviate the suffering of millions of people who will die needlessly, if we do not find an urgent solution to this issue."
"On a separate but related matter, I have called on the members of the international community many times to increase their budgets to combat the AIDS epidemic."
"In fact, debt relief programmes must be put in place for developing countries with high levels of AIDS sufferers."
"Mr President, in the multilateral spirit of world solidarity and the global coalition against international terrorism immediately post 11 September, we in Europe, under the inspiring leadership of Commissioner Pascal Lamy, have gone all out to build bridges, to win the USA over and to make Doha a successful development round."
"Ultimately the deciding factor turned out to be developing countries' access to cheap medicines without paying for patents, either by their own production or by importing them."
"Ultimately the political breakthrough came."
"All developing countries can now establish when they are having a serious health crisis or problem and nothing is preventing them, not even the TRIPs agreement, from buying or producing cheap medicines."
"That applies to all developing countries and all medicines."
"There are no restrictions, and no external prior approval is needed."
"The assignment was to round this off in a legally conclusive text."
"This should have been done in December 2002, but it failed because the USA, in my opinion, was no longer adopting a multilateral position."
"I believe President Bush trampled all over the Doha agreement in favour of his own pharmaceutical industry."
"Commissioner Lamy, you have always told us that you are negotiating on behalf of the whole of Europe and that you accept the European Parliament as possessing powers of democratic control and codecision."
"Well, this is an important point for the Group of the Party of European Socialists - and, when I listen to my fellow-Members, for many other groups too."
"We should like to say that you enjoy our full support, but we do not wish to bow under pressure from the USA any further."
"So: this far and no further."
"We want no restrictions on countries, no restrictions on the types of medicines, nor any prior approval by an external authority."
"That is naturally a little different from the advice from the WHO."
"We do support stringent measures to protect our own European market against dumping, however."
"With more than 90% of AIDS patients in developing countries, we want Europe to unambiguously decide which side it is on and to strictly limit itself to a solution in line with the political Doha agreement."
"We urge other groups in this Parliament to vote accordingly."
"The interests of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria patients worldwide must be at centre stage."
"Not commerce."
"Necessity knows no law."
"The TRIPS agreements must not be a limiting factor."
"As the PSE Group we are convinced that if this point fails, Doha will be keelhauled and Cancun will have failed before it even starts."
"Then there will be no development round!"
"And that is the last thing that the world will permit in the current, very serious crisis."
"That is why we are taking this clear stance."
"Having heard my fellow-Members Mr Wijkman, Mr Clegg and Mrs McNally and many others, I think that Parliament is on the point of making a clear judgment and giving Commissioner Lamy, who, as he has understood, enjoys our full support, a powerful mandate."
"The arrangements made in Doha are crucial for allowing people in developing countries better access to medicines, particularly those for diseases associated with poverty."
"My group is of the opinion that Commissioner Lamy has taken some excellent initiatives with a view to making healthcare more easily accessible, including in the poorest countries and specifically in those countries that do not have their own production capacity."
"I would, however, like to put forward one criticism, although I agree with all the things that have been said here."
"Access to medicines is not only a question of money."
"There are two other issues that I would like to raise."
"Firstly the infrastructure in the countries concerned, and in this case I am talking about distribution and about which people in those countries get access to these medicines."
"Distribution means that there must be an infrastructure, something that is completely absent in many poor countries."
"What is even worse: this is not a priority for the regimes in the countries concerned."
"For example, a person taking AIDS medicines has to take them up to three times a day every day."
"This means that they have to stick rigidly to their treatment regime and that distribution channels are therefore needed to ensure that the patients concerned can always obtain their medicines."
"If this does not happen, the remedy will be worse than the disease, because people will become resistant to these diseases and that will ultimately work its way through to Western countries as well."
"Then new medicines will have to be developed."
"That is my first point."
"My second point is that regimes are often, in fact, corrupt."
"In such cases it turns out that the only medicines that are made available are the ones we have exported to these countries at low tariffs or the ones that can be produced there without patents, and even then they are only available to the better-off and not to the poorest population groups for whom we had intended them."
"What is more, they are sometimes re-exported or simply exported to Western countries."
"Commissioner, Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is painting a very negative picture of developing countries."
"Fortunately, things are progressing at this moment, although diseases are progressing even faster."
"It is precisely this race, against AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, that we must try to win."
"Attempts are actually being made to set up basic healthcare systems in many countries, in which, in fact no such things once existed, and the European Union must not be found wanting in this."
"It is the case that there was a time when treating people who became sick despite prevention - which, let us be honest, is not perfect even today - was an unachievable ideal."
"For the first time, however, there is hope that people - even those who are HIV positive - can in fact improve their lives and the quality of their lives if they have access to medicines."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance that you succeed in your assignment, Commissioner."
"All of us here in the European Parliament support you in your endeavour to ensure that disease can be overcome, even in countries which do not have the resources to do so themselves."
"The failure of Doha does, however, make us pessimistic."
"I hope that you will be able to tell us that we can revert to our own proposals, but I am also prepared to give your compromise a chance because I think that it is reasonable, although I find it too paternalistic. I think, though, that it is a minimum and I hope you are at least successful in that."
"Mr President, I will not bash America because the whole set of international trading regulations on medicines is in a mess."
"Unfortunately, once drug companies - even with the best intention to alleviate suffering - allowed their products and intellectual property rights to be semi-confiscated under the guise of becoming available on affordable terms in developing countries, it was inevitable that all sorts of complications would arise."
"These include definitions of what constitutes a measure to protect public health and is, therefore, subject to the compulsory licensing requirements allowed under TRIPS."
"Initially, the communicable diseases of HIV-AIDS, malaria and TB were included, but now there are plans to extend this list if the WHO thinks it appropriate."
"As these countries become more developed, more western diseases will become endemic, and a case will be made to extend the categories even further."
"Also, as more migrants come to Europe, diseases such as the three above will become more common."
"This will create markets for these drugs and lead to enormous market-driven pressures for parallel re-importation by unscrupulous middlemen from LDCs, which produce them cheaply as generics."
"This will undercut the profits of legitimate pharmaceutical industries."
"It also appears that the exemptions discriminate against smaller countries which lack the manufacturing base to produce the required life-saving drugs under compulsory licences."
"How much simpler it would have been if we had been more robust in defending the rights of drug companies to maintain their patent rights all over the world and then negotiated some differences in pricing, according to what the markets could actually bear and, at the same time, insisted that the burden of the drugs bill be picked up by and large by aid packages rather than by raiding the shareholder capital of the major pharmaceuticals."
"If there are to be reduced profits for the pharmaceuticals, my country, the UK, will suffer disproportionately, as it is a major employer and export-earner, and many of our pension funds are heavily invested in this sector."
"After all, many developing countries - even if the drugs were free - do not have the infrastructures to administer the treatments."
"Besides, profits are essential to fund further innovative research and development in the future, even into orphan drugs for rare tropical illnesses, which are of little interest in the West at present."
"At the very least, I call for a three-yearly review in future to see how this TRIPS agreement works out in practice."
"Mr President, the tragedy, as the Commissioner indicated, is that we still have a deadlock over changes that might deliver the real objectives we identified in Doha, which would allow countries - as others have said - to have the manufacturing capacity to export cheaper generic medicines to countries in need."
"The reality is that developing countries will not accept the United States' insistence on restricting exports to those who treat only a handful of infectious diseases."
"I fear also that, even if the United States concedes, the reforms will be wrapped up in red tape and have some TRIPS-plus features."
"We should now consider a fresh start that is likely to produce a workable solution, although I accept, regrettably, that this is unlikely."
"The danger is that this whole issue could drag on until Cancun."
"If this were to happen, then the TRIPS issues could then again be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations on agriculture, services and the new issues."
"Is that something you see as likely, Commissioner?"
"Surely it would be disastrous if developing countries were expected to do trade-offs in the only real area where they secured such a major victory at Doha."
"The spirit and reality of the development round is surely called into question if developing countries have the clear perception - and they do now, as Mrs McNally said - that commercial interest is being put before public health."
"That was not the intention at Doha."
"You understand, Commissioner, as others have said, that these are issues of justice and equity and that the concept of the development round would become a sham if the industrialised world is seen as, or perceived to be, reneging on the position that was so satisfactorily agreed at Doha."
"Mr President, when the United States recently faced the threat of an anthrax attack, the authorities needed adequate and cheap supplies of medicine to treat the illness."
"They therefore took it upon themselves to oblige the pharmaceutical laboratory concerned to provide the medicines more cheaply."
"Had the laboratory refused to do this, the United States authorities would have resorted to a compulsory licence."
"I would remind you that, at that time, no one required the United States to consult the World Health Organisation first to check if anthrax was on the list of diseases deemed to be admissible in this case."
"The United States was not required to negotiate the conditions for the potential production of such a generic medicine."
"Why then are certain developing countries now being required to do so?"
"I will now move on to my second point."
"I believe Mr Clegg was right to cite the Doha declaration."
"I think my fellow Members were right to remind us that an undertaking was implemented and that this undertaking should be respected."
"According to the undertaking nothing in the interpretation of the agreements on intellectual property should prevent developing countries and WTO member countries from tackling their public health needs, whether or not they have the capacity to produce medicines."
"These countries should therefore be allowed to make their own decisions on this."
"Those with the capacity to produce medicines should be able to decide the circumstances in which they might need to resort to compulsory licences."
"Those without the capacity to produce medicines should be able to decide the circumstances in which they might need to resort to parallel imports."
"These imports would be legal, as they would be sanctioned by the state."
"Mr Rod and Mr Wijkman are therefore right, as are others like Mr Van den Berg, when they say that we would be imposing on the poorest countries conditions which do not apply to industrialised countries or to developing countries with the capacity to produce medicines."
"I think we are now faced with the difficult task of finding a simple and effective solution to the problem."
"Any solution must not entail long and costly negotiations and procedures."
"The latter would eventually cost the lives of millions of sick people who would die without access to treatment."
"We heard that our fellow Member, Mr Tannock, is more concerned about the possible fall in the profits of certain industries than the fate of the sick."
"Mr Lamy, you are clearly under pressure from certain quarters, including the European industries. I urge you not to give way to these pressures!"
"Please speak for the people of Europe."
"The people want us to help the sick in developing countries."
"Mr President, I welcome the European Union initiative in January to break the current WTO deadlock on developing countries' access to affordable medicines, particularly those countries which do not have the manufacturing capacity to make generic medicines locally."
"Just last month, Commissioner Lamy proposed a pragmatic solution which, in his view, is workable, sustainable and legally secure, because it complies with both the Doha mandate and the compromise text of 16 December 2002 that was discussed within the WTO."
"The EU initiative covers the most comprehensive possible list of major infectious diseases but is not restrictive, which was the main problem with the negotiations in 2002."
"Commissioner Lamy's list includes: yellow fever, plague, cholera, meningitis, dengue, influenza, hepatitis, polio, typhoid fever, typhus and measles."
"These are all horrendous diseases that have been virtually eradicated in the West, yet millions die unnecessarily in the Third World every year."
"The Lamy strategy would save lives, and pharmaceutical companies will not be losing revenue because the people in these countries are too poor to buy the medication as it stands."
"The debilitating effect of these diseases affects families, communities and economies throughout the developing world."
"This EU initiative should help to improve the standard of living and public health in some, if not all, of the developing world."
"However, it is essential that a mechanism is constructed to deal with the other public health issues and potential outbreaks, and not just the diseases listed in the compromise deal."
"The list proposed by Commissioner Lamy is not restrictive - WTO members could ask for World Health Organisation guidance for any other serious public health problems which may arise in the future or are not covered by the list as it stands."
"This gives the EU proposal some flexibility to respond to unforeseen outbreaks."
"The response will be based on World Health Organisation expertise in the field."
"The compromise proposal, which is more humane that the US approach, should allay US concerns that patent laws could be breached and weakened."
"At the same time, it provides sufficient flexibility to deal with specific disease-related crises, should they occur."
"This debate will hopefully send a strong message of support for the Lamy proposal, as the WTO General Council simultaneously discusses the subject."
"It is important to help the developing world to eradicate these diseases without depriving the pharmaceutical industry of the funding it needs for further research in this area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say how pleased I am that we are holding this debate on the World Trade Organisation and on certain ongoing negotiations. This comes on the eve of another ministerial meeting at which specific political positions on the matter might be sealed."
"I am however concerned about the declaration of the Council for TRIPS. It means going back on the undertakings we gave at Doha."
"Access to generic medicines for developing countries is not just a commercial issue. It is at the heart of development the world over."
"If we do not make progress on this question, all our other efforts to promote development will be in vain. We would be wasting our time."
"Achieved in difficult circumstances, the Doha declaration on public health of November 2001 was an important first step towards helping the populations of developing countries and promoting their interests."
"We looked forward to at last sending a message of hope to those people."
"In December 2002 however, opposition to the agreement, for which the United States was entirely responsible, clearly demonstrated that the interests of the pharmaceutical industry took precedence over the health of millions of people."
"This stance is not merely unfortunate. It is unacceptable and inadmissible, given that as my fellow Member Mr Désir outlined, the United States was prepared to suspend the Bayer patent in October 2001, because they were experiencing an anthrax attack, which was obviously a matter of greater urgency for them."
"We should welcome the efforts of the Commission to reach an agreement on access to medicines."
"Nonetheless, the Commission is still failing to take enough account of the legitimate demands of poor countries."
"This comes as we are about to retain the division of countries into a first and a second class, as if the deaths in some regions were less important than deaths in others."
"Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement must recommence at the earliest opportunity. The lives of millions of people in developing countries are at stake."
"I am convinced agreement could be obtained on the basis of the Doha declaration and Article 30 of the ADPIC agreement, and on that basis alone."
"An agreement achieved on any other basis, that did not take account of Article 30, would extinguish the hopes of the people of developing countries. They want to lift themselves out of poverty and improve their worsening living conditions, conditions that are increasingly unacceptable."
"Such an agreement would also send a clear message to the people of Europe."
"It could be a fine example of the basis on which the European Union works and of the extent of our concern for others."
"Commissioner, we call on you to speak for our collective conscience."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have to start by clarifying whether patent laws are actually in place."
"The copyright must be valid in the country in which it is sold; that is to say, it must have been registered and granted there."
"Of course, things can always be manufactured in a country where there is no copyright on them, and there must be doubt as to whether, although they clearly bring benefits, the medicinal products have actually been patented in every country around the world;"
"I really cannot imagine that they have been, but should that indeed be the case, it follows that compulsory licensing is the ideal approach when it comes to giving help quickly and in a consistent way."
"We must ask ourselves, though, what happens if a compulsory licence is actually granted."
"Will it solve all our problems?"
"What about prevention and complete recovery?"
"I think it self-evident that medicinal products need to be developed further, and that we have to focus primarily on creating incentives for research, rather than simply allowing ourselves to reduce the issue to patent rights and licences."
"When, moreover, the copyright has expired and compulsory licences have been granted, we politicians, too, will bear responsibility for universities and industry having incentives to carry out research."
"Another important step in the right direction would be to put out public invitations to tender several times in a given year, to safeguard the fundamental principle that sufferers from disease really should get the most modern and the most effective medication available."
"For if, in future, research in this area of medicinal products, and the marketing of them, ceases to be a viable business proposition, we will be faced with the problem of being able to offer medicinal products that may well be cheap, but are not as effective as they might be."
"What do we do then?"
"Mr President, this is a difficult issue on which feelings can run high. I would first like to thank the representatives of all the groups who have expressed their support for the position I have adopted on behalf of the Commission."
"I have noted the statements made by Mr Wijkman, Mrs McNally, Mr Clegg, Mr Marset Campos and Mrs Maes in particular."
"The European Parliament is firmly united on this issue. This is very important for us at the Commission, it is important to me and it is important in the field of external relations."
"I would point out that the issue of the use of compulsory licences by countries with a pharmaceutical industry to obtain benefit from differentiated prices and lower prices was settled at Doha."
"On that occasion we did not however settle the issue of countries which have to resort to imports. This implies that the system of compulsory licensing could be applied across international boundaries, giving rise to complicated legal problems."
"This problem is currently dealt with on a provisional basis."
"All developing countries can at present use a compulsory licensing system to obtain benefit from differentiated prices. This applies to medicines to treat diseases like AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and certain other diseases."
"This is possible because of the provisional arrangement that the United States and the European Union implemented in December."
"This provisional arrangement is simply not enough however."
"We think it is unlikely to galvanise all the parties involved. These parties are the governments concerned, their health systems and the pharmaceutical industry."
"A long-term solution must therefore be found."
"None has so far emerged from the discussions taking place in Geneva, because of the American position."
"Further evidence of this was provided at the Council on TRIPS this morning."
"I would like to reassure Mrs Kinnock on one point."
"The issue of access to medicines is not on the Doha negotiating programme due to be concluded at the end of 2004."
"It does not feature amongst the fifteen subjects we decided to discuss."
"The issue falls beyond the scope of these negotiations and will therefore not be the subject of any kind of trade-off."
"It stands alone as a subject in its own right and on the table of the World Trade Organisation."
"This issue is not linked to the rest of the negotiations by virtue of the agenda but because it testifies to the capacity of the World Trade Organisation to instil confidence in its members. Consequently, when it comes to discussing the question of whether the compulsory licensing system should be used for Viagra or for medicines to treat toothache for example, members have the confidence to prevent the discussions degenerating into a legal battle."
"I am simply referring to this particular example because I have read about it in the press. This all amounts to a major problem for the World Trade Organisation."
"I wonder why the pharmaceutical industry has adopted the position it has. The latter resulted in the United States rejecting the compromise on the table in December."
"I have to say that I am completely baffled."
"I did not understand the position that the American pharmaceutical industry took in South Africa either, and I also failed to understand the position it adopted when it very nearly caused a stand-off between the United States and Brazil, until the United States Government saw the light. I just cannot understand its attitude."
"Its stance will only strengthen opposition to the principle of intellectual property across a large number of sectors. In truth, it is easy to present this conflict between health and profits in such a way that, little by little, if the American pharmaceutical industry continues as it has been doing, there will be sound political reasons for starting work on agreements on intellectual property."
"I would urge those of you who have some influence in this field to use this argument to try to convince these people that their attitude will not get them where they want to be, but will lead them in the opposite direction. The United States would do well to consider an example of how to reach a consensus when circumstances make this imperative."
"They could study the attitude adopted by the European Union recently towards the Kimberly process on the subject of blood diamonds. This may be a less high profile case, but it is nonetheless important, especially for certain developing countries."
"We Europeans were isolated in the World Trade Organisation. We were the only party reluctant to ask the WTO for a dispensation to implement the Kimberly agreements."
"We stood alone and eventually decided to go along with the consensus because we did not want to stand in the way of this solution."
"We shall do so by coming up with our own interpretation of the articles of the WTO."
"The United States could perfectly well adopt the same approach on this issue."
"On the question of parallel imports raised by several Members, I am sure you will be aware that the Commission has put forward a proposal for the European Union."
"The Council is currently studying the proposal. Those of you with an interest in the matter could join me in urging the Council to take less time than usual to rule on the proposal."
"I would now like to move on to my last point."
"I agree with those Members who explained that while the problem of price and the problem of taking account of patent law in connection with prices are important, these are not the only problems to be solved. There are many other issues to address if we are to ensure better access to medicines for people in developing countries."
"There needs to be a system of public research into diseases that no longer exist in developed countries and are therefore no longer of interest to the pharmaceutical industry. Problems of distribution and medical culture must be resolved."
"There will still be much to be done, even after the difficulties relating to patent law have been overcome, which I trust will be soon. This is not however a reason for giving up on our determined efforts to ensure that this first, important and highly symbolic step is taken with the help of the European Union."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2) I have received six motions for resolution to wind up the debate"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the WTO agricultural trade negotiations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Communication that the European Commission has just presented to Parliament on the modalities of the agricultural agreement to be negotiated at the forthcoming WTO Round was unanimously approved on 27 January by the General Affairs Council."
"I believe this proposal to be balanced and to be in line with the spirit of Article 20 of the Marrakech Agreement and of the Doha Declaration and makes a genuine and generous contribution to those who until now have gained little from almost 50 years of multilateralism in trade - in other words, the world's poorest countries."
"Evidence of this is the proposal for free access to the markets of the richest countries for the agricultural products of the poorer countries. Also, the compromise proposal intended to ensure that at least 50% of rich countries' agricultural and food imports come from the poorest countries."
"This proposal is coherent with current practice in the European Union which, as the Commission states in one of its recent documents, imports more food products than the United States, Japan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand put together."
"This is what gives us the moral authority to say that this WTO Round must be the development round."
"This is also why we have proposed a food security fund that will enable the poorest countries to implement measures to protect their markets from the subsidised exports of the rich countries, thereby enabling them to develop local production and to fight hunger and poverty."
"We must also be aware, however, of one important aspect, which is that an excessive reduction of customs tariffs could undermine preferential access to the EU market, which is already benefiting some countries with which we have trade agreements."
"Amongst these are the ACP countries, under the Cotonou agreements, and the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean."
"We will have to be careful about this because if we establish excessive tariff reductions and do not ensure that our market preferences in favour of these countries are consolidated, these same poor countries could lose market share to other, richer and more competitive countries."
"It is also because of this attitude of openness and support towards the poorest countries that gives us, the European Union, the moral authority, to say that we also have the right to protect our farmers and to preserve our social model."
"The European negotiators can therefore only accept a final agreement at the WTO that firstly preserves the European farming model based on farming's contribution to rural land-use planning, to the territory's balance and to the vitality of rural areas, which represent almost 80% of our territory."
"What this means, specifically, is that the EU will be able to continue to support its farmers and to guarantee a reasonable - and only a reasonable - level of Community preference for farm produce."
"Secondly, we must ensure the right balance between greater trade liberalisation and greater requirements in areas that are not strictly trade related, but are definitely related to the trade in food, such as, in particular, the quality and safety of food, compliance with basic environmental standards and adherence to the trademarks and denominations of origin and geographical indications of our products which, as we all know, are widely counterfeited by a huge variety of countries across the world, with the WTO rules unable to prevent this happening."
"Unless this is done, we shall be doing something that our society does not understand and we shall be attacking our own interests and, even worse, we shall not be supporting the interests of the poorest countries."
"I think that the European Union has provided a good example of good, reasonable proposals for these countries that have until now been the most marginal players, the most marginal beneficiaries of the WTO - the poor countries."
"We have come up with good and positive initiatives under 'everything but arms', and our proposal for negotiation consolidates these proposals. I therefore believe that we must call on other rich countries in the world, even more highly developed than we are, to follow the EU's example."
"Mr President, I am pleased indeed that Commissioners Lamy and Fischler will be going to Tokyo for the mini-ministerial with an approved position."
"I agree with you, Commissioner Lamy, that the agriculture negotiations will be very important in determining whether or not the meetings in Cancun are a success."
"I am pleased too that you have defined for us 'modalities', it is a word strange to the English language, but of course, once you come to rules and numbers you are then beginning to be so clear that certain vested interests begin to take fright, so these negotiations will be difficult."
"The European Union certainly has a world responsibility in terms of negotiations on agriculture."
"As Mr Cunha has just said, the volume of trade alone would make us significant."
"However, we do not have sole responsibility, and countries such as the United States should be reminded that they have a responsibility too."
"I am sure in your discussions with Bob Zurlik you will remind him of that."
"However, you said quite clearly that the European Union can and will negotiate, so let us look at what that means."
"Naturally we have the interest of European producers and consumers in higher food quality, rural development, environment protection and animal welfare."
"Some of those issues need clarification, and at the same time, the raison d'être of the development round are the needs of agriculture in developing countries where, proportionately, it is of far more importance than it is in the European Union."
"It is the principal source of income and employment in developing countries and a major tool in the fight against poverty and indeed in the improvement of food security."
"So our aim is multi-faceted, we need a better deal for agriculture in developing countries, but we also need to strengthen targeted support for certain aspects of European agriculture."
"We have a certain margin of manoeuvre within which to do it."
"There is some feeling within the Socialist Group that the proposal is somewhat lacking in ambition."
"We expect to be offering to the developing world a bigger and an earlier reduction in all agricultural tariffs and in getting rid of restrictions of imports from the developing world."
"We want more insistence on the importance of the greenbox and more attention to special and differential treatment."
"You will need to consider whether the current CAP reform goes far enough. The Socialist Group would probably think not."
"We will leave it to you to push the agenda forward as quickly as you can."
"My group is also of the opinion that the mandate that the Commission has been given is a good one, and that it is quite happy to be publicly associated with it."
"Negotiations have only just begun, and we are sure that if the Commission - Europe - takes a certain step, other trade blocs will have to follow."
"For us the most important thing is that we have found that the European people do not fully support European agricultural policy at this moment."
"Clearly this must change, so we must change European agricultural policy."
"We are in favour of the maximum possible reduction trade subsidies that distort trade, and this applies in particular to export subsidies and other similar subsidies imposed by other trade blocs."
"We are therefore generally in favour of greater liberalisation of trade in agricultural products."
"Something else enters into this, however."
"In Europe we have all sorts of rules which have little to do with the health of the product but much more to do with ethical principles, such as animal welfare, the bird and habitat directive, and so on."
"Elsewhere in the world, farmers have far fewer of these kinds of rules to contend with."
"I always find it very difficult to explain to European farmers why they have to adhere to these rules and at the same time compete with farmers elsewhere in the world who do not have to."
"This seems to me to be a recipe for unfair competition, and I think that the Commission should emphasise this, particularly in its negotiations with the World Trade Organisation."
"What is more, farmers in various parts of Europe do not always enjoy a very good income."
"We cannot change everything from one day to the next, and I therefore think that we need to pay great attention to the European agricultural model; this is something that we can certainly defend in an international context."
"We must be able to reward farmers for their performance on a basis other than their production of agricultural products."
"I can therefore only emphasise the need for the Commission to defend the worldwide recognition of regional products grown in Europe and the ban on their being grown elsewhere under the same name."
"The Commission must also emphatically underline our endorsement of a system of integrated agricultural production, with control from stable to table, so to speak."
"I would also like to emphasise that in addition to the policy of improving product prices, we need another policy to cover the use of agricultural products for industrial purposes."
"Finally, everything but arms: the overwhelming majority of my group supports this, and we must do something for the poorest developing countries."
"The great question for our group is that of how the Commission is dealing with the principle of origin, and how, as we intend, we can be sure that products imported by us really do come from the poorest countries."
"Mr President, I believe it would have been better to have held this debate before, and not after, the General Affairs Council had agreed to the Community's offer for negotiation of the agricultural aspects of the WTO."
"It is clear that this is necessary for institutional balance and the whole decision-making process."
"This is not a new practice, however, since there are precedents in the reform of the CAP of 1992 and in Agenda 2000."
"I say this because certain aspects, such as the reduction in internal support, involve the need to adopt very controversial aspects in the proposed regulations on intermediate reform."
"We are talking about aspects such as total decoupling which, as well as being rejected by many MEPs - including myself - is also opposed by professions and many Member States."
"With regard to the content, I would continue to say the same thing: we are accepting a policy which will lack substantial and sufficient funds and which could therefore have negative effects on Community agriculture and in particular on the least-favoured regions."
"With regard to the more specific proposals, I believe that there are some quite positive aspects in relation to the least-developed countries."
"However, the assumption is made that greater liberalisation of trade will lead to greater economic development. And this is not always the case."
"In this regard, I would like to point out that the two most liberalised markets - coffee and cocoa - are the agricultural markets with the highest level of poverty surrounding them and in which the producing countries call for less liberalisation and more regulation."
"Neither can the negotiations be based on world market prices which, although it is true they are linked to the volumes marketed, bear very little relation to production and consumer prices."
"In any event, I believe it is important to make progress in order to remove export refunds for agricultural products with damaging effects on local agricultural production in the least-developed countries."
"We must recognise the right of the less developed countries to protect themselves from these subsidised exports in order to safeguard their fundamental right to food security, to food sovereignty and to the survival of their small-scale and family-run farms."
"I believe the proposal to create a food security box is interesting, since it would be very useful also for the European Union for strategic and food security reasons."
"But in this regard the Commission is forgetting our dependency on vegetable proteins from outside and, specifically, from countries, in this case, which are not underdeveloped or developing, but which are very developed."
"And our dependency stands at 75%. This seems to me to be an extraordinary oversight."
"Finally, given its distorting use by the United States and other countries, I am very pleased with the proposals to eliminate the de minimis clause, to subject export credits and food aid to strict discipline and to protect geographical indications."
"Mr President, Commissioner, many developing world countries, along with many NGOs that are active around the globe, have demanded that responsibility for negotiations on agriculture should not be handed over to the WTO, a demand made also at the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre."
"There are good reasons for this. We have to see that, in the past, although agricultural trade affected the world's agricultural production only to a minimal degree, its mechanisms, and the resultant price destruction had a profound effect not only on European countries, but also on those in the developing world."
"Not only there, but also in Europe, its practice of dumping - in the form of export subsidies - destroyed or marginalised rural farming, bringing even greater hunger, forcing countries into a state of dependency, and causing debts to accumulate."
"It is abundantly clear that trade does not fill stomachs, and if anyone does get rich from it, it is seldom if ever both the parties concerned."
"It is therefore understandable that it is from these sources that highly sceptical questions are being asked about precisely what is to be negotiated at the WTO."
"If the WTO negotiations are to be successful, then these mechanisms have to be done away with."
"Care must be taken to give absolute priority to the right to produce basic foodstuffs, the right of countries to alleviate their own people's hunger, the right to cultivate the land and to treat the environment properly, along with the right to pass farms on to the next generation, thus maintaining rural farming, as well as the dismantling of destructive trade mechanisms, and of what we call world trade, which amounted to nothing more than export dumping. This will enable us to develop in solidarity with people in the developing world, as well as with rural farming in Europe."
"Mr President, the WTO negotiations on agriculture, combined with the Commission's proposals for CAP reform, represent fundamental change for European agriculture and the welfare of farm families."
"I have said on many occasions in this House that uncertainty about the future is having devastating consequences for farm families."
"I query the degree of compatibility between the Commission's commitment to the EU agricultural model, which is based on family farming, and the proposals in the world trade negotiations."
"Trade liberalisation, combined with a progressive reduction in EU farm support - particularly when this reduction is to apply to those already on the margins - raises serious doubts as to our real intentions."
"As for the detail of the WTO proposal, what we see once again is a desire by the Commission to exceed the mandate given to it by Member States."
"The cuts proposed in export subsidies, import tariffs and domestic farm support are both excessive and unnecessary."
"They certainly go beyond any area of commitment entered into in the Uruguay or Doha Rounds."
"When we see how our competitors behave - especially in the United States' Farm Bill - one has to ask why we in Europe have to lie down on every occasion and roll over."
"Now that the EU petition has been tabled with the WTO, I plead with the Commission to defend vigorously the vital interests of European and, indeed, Irish agriculture."
"Improved market access will intensify competition in the EU market."
"I call on the Commission to be particularly vigilant during the negotiations on the products more sensitive to this aggressive competition, in particular beef and butter."
"I want the Commission to ensure that only minimal tariff reductions will be applied to those sensitive sectors."
"It is impossible to debate the forthcoming agricultural negotiations at the WTO without putting the matter in the context of the Commission's mid-term review last month."
"All six impact studies, which the Commission carried out, assumed there would be no change in the multilateral trading framework."
"However, this is clearly not the case."
"While it is difficult to forecast the outcome of the current round, the one thing we can be certain about is that a reduction in tariff protection will be part of any agreement."
"Given the volume of beef and sheepmeat that is entering the EU at present levels of protection, it is equally certain that most, if not all, of the gap in the EU market created by the reduction in EU supplies will be filled by products from third countries."
"I ask where then are the price increases which have been forecast by all these studies to come from?"
"Decoupling, taken together with the WTO proposals, will cause a reduction in EU production of beef and sheepmeat."
"The Commission already knows my view that this will have a disproportionate impact on Ireland."
"Despite Commissioner Fischler being very dismissive of this when he presented his proposals to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development last month, I still hold firmly to my view."
"I am not afraid to be dismissed as a merchant of doom when I hold a view borne out by hard scientific data, compiled in an independent study on behalf of the Irish Government."
"For example, the Commission study indicates a 3% fall in EU beef production, but a 12% fall in Irish beef production."
"We will have to take the worst of both worlds: a serious reduction in production with the associated consequences for the economy, including unemployment in our vital agrifood sector, and the anticipated market vacuum filled by third-country imports."
"To conclude, I repeat what I said to the Commission last July when the mid-term review proposals were made and again when the legislative proposals were made last month: the combined effects of the prospect of greatly liberalised agricultural trade under the WTO and the Commission proposals for major reform of the common agricultural policy are potentially devastating for European agriculture."
"Less than 10% of the world's agricultural production ends up in international trade."
"The overwhelming bulk is traded locally or nationally."
"This means that proposals intended to regulate trade in 10% of production, as is the case with the World Trade Organisation, must not lose sight of the effects of these measures on trade in the other 90%."
"I do not have time to go into all the aspects of the European proposal to the WTO, so I will restrict myself to the position of developing countries and the European model for multifunctional agriculture."
"For some of the world's population, food is not something that can be taken for granted."
"We must keep a close eye on the interests of these population groups at the WTO discussions."
"These interests go further than simply breaking down tariff barriers and preferential access to the European market; preferential access does not necessarily result in an increase in the income of the developing countries and their people."
"A recent study has shown that complete liberalisation of trade only provides poor countries with a minimal increase in their income."
"Countries such as India and Nigeria are asking for the WTO agreements to be applied flexibly, and rightly so."
"They want to support and protect their agricultural sectors and the development of the countryside in order to offer their rural population some security of existence."
"These countries need subsidies in order to guarantee food security and to support small-scale agriculture."
"I am therefore pleasantly surprised by the Commission's proposal for a Food Security Box and by the scope that Europe wants to offer these countries to support their own agriculture by means of subsidies."
"Export subsidies are destroying the world market."
"The Commission is, quite rightly, proposing to reduce these further."
"If other countries agree to this, the result may be an increase in prices on the world market."
"I would, however, like to point out to the Commission that this does not help everybody."
"As many as 43 countries in Africa are net importers of food."
"They will therefore be worse off if food prices on the world market increase."
"This is why, in addition to the anti-dumping measures, technical assistance for these countries is of great importance."
"The incomes of farmers in the European Union are under pressure."
"Trade liberalisation is primarily of importance to trade and the processing industry."
"If Europe wants to retain its family-run farms, it will have to take measures that conflict with the principles of free trade."
"It will also have to act more effectively than it is doing at the moment."
"A study by the OECD shows that only a quarter of every euro of support that goes to agriculture ends up with the farmer."
"Further liberalisation without sufficient protection for the European agricultural model will result in a reduction in the number of farmers."
"Fortunately, the Commission's proposal to the WTO is putting the case for the multifunctional agricultural model."
"There should still be the possibility of subsidies for aspects that do not disrupt trade, such as the environment, animal welfare and countryside development, but I hope that the Commission also realises that a viable agricultural sector in Europe needs sufficient scope to regulate its market."
"Because agriculture still does not operate like a bicycle factory, we need appropriate protection at our borders."
"This protection must be transparent."
"Food aid as a capped form of dumping is reprehensible."
"The Commission rightly highlights this in its proposal, along with other forms of agricultural support such as export credits, export guarantees and state trading enterprises."
"Finally, the Commission's proposal is lacking a significant policy instrument that has a positive effect on the market and prices - I am referring to production control."
"This instrument is working properly for sugar and dairy products."
"The only discordant note sounded by this system is the dumping on the world market of surpluses caused by excessively high quotas."
"We should therefore not do away with the quota system, but quotas should be realistic."
"The quota for dairy products is 105% of consumption."
"If we brought this down to 100%, we would free the world market from dumped sugar and milk powder and we would at the same time offer our farmers a better price."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposals for the WTO negotiation modality, or rules on agriculture, were unanimously supported by Member States at the recent General Affairs Council, following earlier discussions with various trade policy groups and the agriculture fora."
"They have now been submitted to Geneva to be considered, along with the proposals of the other members of the World Trade talks, including the United States, the Cairns Group and the developing countries."
"Agreement on the rules under which the new agreement will be concluded is due by the end of March this year, and agreement on the new round itself by the beginning of 2005."
"But let us call it as it is. There are marked differences in the positions of the main negotiating parties, and there will be pressure on all, including the European Union, to compromise."
"The European Union negotiates at the World Trade talks on the basis of a mandate which was approved by the Council of Ministers back in September 1999."
"That was subsequently endorsed by the General Affairs Council."
"That mandate is based on the Agenda 2000 agreement, one of the main objectives of which was to prepare the EU for the WTO negotiations."
"Last December the Commission presented a draft paper which it said is consistent with the EU's negotiating mandate at WTO level, as approved by the Council in 1999."
"It is consistent therefore with Agenda 2000, and will not require changes to the common agricultural policy; the EU level of export subsidies and domestic support in the so-called 'yellowbox' are already below the levels of reduction commitments proposed; the market access proposals can also be accommodated without disrupting EU markets; and the EU is already committed to reducing tariffs and quota barriers on imports from the least-developed countries and from all developing countries, as proposed in the paper."
"Most Member States question the Commission's approach in making substantial reduction commitment offers at this stage, given that there will be pressure to make further concessions as negotiations proceed."
"Ireland and France had difficulty with a number of specific issues, and a small number of amendments were introduced at the Council to meet these concerns."
"The most important of these issues for Ireland related to improved market access, or the reduction of import tariffs."
"Following pressure from Ireland and France, the Commission provided a declaration in the Minutes of the General Affairs Council to the effect that it would submit the proposals on market access to the Council, would remain vigilant in the negotiations in relation to products which are exposed to international competition, and would take particular account of sensitive products."
"We also recorded in the Minutes a declaration that our acceptance of the Commission's proposal is on the basis that, at most, minimal tariff reductions will be applied to sensitive sectors, especially beef and butter."
"The Irish also had further concerns in relation to domestic support, the redemption of the 'bluebox' and the exemption from reduction commitments of direct payments which are of vital importance to our farmers."
"In 2002, 60% of Irish farm incomes were in the form of direct payments to producers which qualify for 'bluebox' exemption."
"The retention of export subsidies is also a major issue to us, as a major exporter of agricultural and food products to third countries."
"We are particularly dependent on the continuation of an EU system of export subsidies in order to remain competitive on export markets."
"Commissioner Fischler contends that his decoupling proposals will reduce production and therefore increase prices, but this ignores the reality of the Commission's World Trade proposals of a decrease of up to 36% in import tariffs amongst other multilateral issues."
"We still need answers from Commissioner Fischler as to how he is going to square that circle."
"The 36%, 45%, 55% proposals at World Trade talks, together with the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy - which includes proposals for decoupling and modulation - and the uncertain implications of enlargement, have created a climate of serious mistrust in a Commissioner who wants to tear up an existing decision of EU heads of government after only two and a half years of a seven-year agreement."
"Yes, we have a duty of care to the developing world, but that must go hand in hand with the duty of care to our own farmers."
"Notwithstanding the generosity of the common agricultural policy, and as a result of a combination of falling prices, lower production levels and higher costs, aggravated by exceptionally bad weather, they face ongoing and serious declines in income and uncertain futures."
"Mr President, on 27 January, the Commission stated that the EU's proposal on the WTO negotiations was compatible with our current advocacy of substantial and progressive liberalisation on a fair and even-handed basis."
"It is furthermore stated in clear terms that 'the actual measures involve the fair sharing of agricultural burdens and the developing countries, too, should be given greater opportunities.'"
"That is a logical development in view of the fact that, in the EU too since the 1992 CAP reform, liberalisation keeps making advances in the implementation of the GATT resolutions."
"The good ship WTO is steaming ahead, with undertakings in the agricultural and food industries swimming in its wake as best they can, as, every time the consumer spends a euro on groceries, the farmers get only an average of 25 cents."
"The liberalisation of agricultural trade has its advocates and its opponents."
"There is unanimous agreement that developing countries should be given easier access to the European Internal Market, yet, despite liberalisation - or, indeed, as a consequence of it - there has been no definite improvement in the situation as regards world hunger; indeed, as the motions for a resolution point out, this has got worse."
"It is not clear what sort of permanent and comprehensive body of Europe-wide legislation on non-commercial matters might be able to maintain the balancing act between, on the one hand, the maintenance and improvement of European agriculture's competitive position on world markets and, on the other hand, the protection of insufficiently competitive agriculture at a time when it is being made more multifunctional for the benefit of society."
"My mind is quite open as to whether the European agricultural model, combining multifunctionality with a policy of subsidies, can be implemented with any international legitimacy."
"The great danger is already present that this will prove no long-lasting protection and that the abandonment of European subsidy policy will then begin in earnest, because there will as yet be no political majorities, and where they do exist, they will be compromises."
"On the other hand, the WTO's fundamental categories do not include issues of rural development, environmental protection and animal welfare."
"What is true of enlargement must also be true of the WTO negotiations, the principle being that nobody should be any worse off."
"The situation before the negotiations and after them will be considered in that light, so we can look forward to the result with some excitement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two new worrying developments have emerged in connection with the latest round of WTO negotiations."
"These developments concern the atmosphere of negotiations on the one hand and the subject of negotiations on the other."
"The atmosphere has changed due to the strong pressure exerted by the United States representatives on their European counterparts."
"Mr Robert Zoellick has referred to European partners such as France and Ireland as colonialists who are two hundred years behind the times. You are an exception Commissioner, as you have all but been awarded an honorary doctorate by the Bush administration."
"All this has taken place against the background of references to 'Old Europe', or even cheese-eating monkeys. We know that your opposite number Mr Robert Zoellick, signed an open letter from Mr Wolfowitz in January 1998 calling for a war on Iraq."
"You seem to be negotiating with a hawk Commissioner!"
"You know him better than I do, however, so you must be best placed to judge if he really is one."
"The subject of negotiations has also changed."
"To date, we had been discussing subjects which lacked soul."
"Now, as we discuss agriculture, we are negotiating on quality, the environment, welfare, animals and consequently essentially cultural matters. The present round does not concern goods."
"It concerns knowledge. It concerns the very essence of people, and their very being."
"Hence the fear of nothingness, as the Louvain students made clear to you."
"Agriculture constitutes an exception to the rule."
"There is its unique structure, the AOCs and the countryside."
"Hence the deep-rooted fear that you might not stand up for this agricultural exception which goes right back to Mesopotamia."
"It is nothing new."
"Serious misgivings abound, and they are mainly of a political nature. We fear that Cancun will be a 'Munich in the sun'."
"There are moreover precedents for this. There is the mysterious agreement of 2001 on bananas."
"Chiquita collapsed just like Enron."
"There is the failure to challenge the issue of dependency on oil-producing crops, even after the opening-up of former Eastern bloc countries and the consequences of mad cow disease."
"Above all there is Mr Fischler's project, begun in July 2002 and confirmed in January 2003, which involved deep cuts in subsidies."
"At the same time, the United States established proposals to spend 190 billion over ten years from May 2002."
"Nonetheless, the de minimis rule would keep all this within the green box."
"Our fears are also based on an unfathomable contradiction."
"Surely it cannot be right to destroy our agricultural infrastructure and know-how when by 2020 there will be two billion more mouths to feed."
"This is the basis of my fundamental fear."
"Commissioner, we seem to be already condemned as we speed along on board the shuttle Earth which is as riddled with cracks as the shuttle Columbia."
"Yet here we are discussing commerce and global free-trade when we know drinking water supplies are dwindling and when two billion people lack electricity or medicine."
"I am beginning to wonder therefore whether the WTO, like the European Union, is a museum piece."
"Commissioner, the subject of this evening's debate is certainly the basis for a tapestry of some of the major themes of world and European politics."
"For example, the first theme is without a doubt that world agricultural trade and the talks which are outlining and will define the aspects and modalities thereof represent the point of confrontation between market liberalisation and governments' desires to pursue protectionist agricultural policies which go beyond production itself and affect what are known as non-commercial aspects too, such as environmental protection, food safety, the safeguarding and promotion of quality and the preservation of rural areas."
"We have listened to you carefully this evening, Commissioner, and it is clear from what you have said that the European Union has expressed a strong desire to negotiate an agreement for the further liberalisation of the trade in agricultural products."
"In our opinion, however, the agreement must be well balanced and must be an agreement which benefits everybody."
"It would appear that this is also the position which Commissioner Fischler has upheld on a number of occasions with regard to Community agricultural policies."
"Not more than a week ago, in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, he pointed out that the rules which emerge from the new rounds of talks next autumn must be fair and apply equally to all."
"Thus, the idea which emerges of cutting export subsidies is an idea which is certainly attractive and which I certainly support, but only on condition that other subsidies causing the distortion of the international trade market are also regulated."
"Then there is another major political theme which is connected with the subject of this evening's debate. We need an overall perspective on the matter."
"The current economic situation, whose development will interact with and be affected by the future development of the agricultural sector, cannot be viewed purely in terms of international trade, for international trade is directly dependent upon the proposal to reform the common agricultural policy."
"What was to be a mid-term assessment review has become a veritable transformation of European agriculture."
"The Community policy guidelines in this sector, in addition to seeing the market as a means of economic development, are intended in Europe to ensure consumer protection - consider the recent creation of the European Food Safety Authority."
"This principle of food safety has been expressed and accepted at WTO level too, but it has only been accepted as an ideal. Much progress will be needed before quality equal to that of our own produce is guaranteed."
"The production costs sustained by the European agricultural economy differ substantially from those sustained by the developing countries, for the standards of quality, safety and health and hygiene are different."
"It is as desirable that clear international rules for the protection of agrifoods should be established at the forthcoming negotiating rounds as it is for the Codex alimentarius to be duly valued and respected in the protection of recognised typical European products."
"European farms operating in a globalised context must invest in the quality of their produce to acquire specific market shares which are sensitive to new consumer demands."
"Production standards are now oriented towards ensuring the traceability of production from stable to table."
"In this sense, the possibility of marketing European agrifoods produce at world level must go hand in hand with the economic development of the less wealthy countries, with mutual respect for local agrifoods production in a global context of balanced growth regulated by both the economy and well-defined rules, but, above all, by the clear need for growth which benefits all to the detriment of none."
"Therefore, the basic issue before us now is that the proposal you have outlined to us this evening, Commissioner, contains a principle."
"We need a common agricultural policy which preserves the conventions we are used to."
"Your speech and the documents available to us uphold a principle which we find it very hard to accept, to the effect that the proposal for mid-term review, which provides, inter alia, for decoupling and the non-fulfilment of blue box commitments, should take precedence over the WTO negotiating modalities, which provide for an endeavour to preserve the blue box aid instigated with the McSharry reform."
"There is therefore a need to redefine the negotiating modalities, removing the Blue Box chapter altogether and thus irretrievably eliminating the possibility of safeguarding direct payments in a multilateral context."
"If this should happen, we believe that it would be the beginning of the liberalisation of the European agricultural sector, which is essential not just for the sector as such but for the whole of the European economy as well."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we support and we consider very positive the Commission's efforts to integrate the developing countries and the least developed countries into these negotiations, access without customs duties or quotas for those countries and the creation of a food security box, but we also believe that in some proposals we could have gone further, such as in the proposal relating to the reduction in export refunds, on which I trust we can make progress during the negotiations."
"I would also like to say that the commitment to greater openness must be accompanied by a fair distribution of responsibilities amongst the developed countries."
"In this regard, we must condemn the unilateral nature of the United States' agricultural policy."
"Commissioner, I am concerned, however, that the model of agricultural multifunctionality may be jeopardised."
"I must tell you that in the proposal for negotiation multifunctional considerations are mentioned just once when the Commission refers to access to the market for the poorest countries."
"With regard to Community agriculture, it is true that we are now referring to social objectives such as the protection of the environment, public health, obligatory labelling or the need to compensate for the additional costs of animal welfare."
"But European agricultural multifunctionality no longer plays an important role in this offer for negotiation and the main focus has passed to the decoupling of aid, the principle which the Commission is going to concentrate the negotiation on, in the internal support chapter."
"Commissioner, I believe that, if we allow our entire negotiating strategy to rest on the principle of decoupling, we may find ourselves without any room for manoeuvre in terms of guaranteeing elements which are essential to European agriculture, such as the stability of markets, with the maintenance of stable and economically viable prices which allow producers to earn an income."
"Mr President, it is abundantly clear that the European Union intends to sacrifice small and medium-sized farmers and support for agriculture at European Union level at the alter of the World Trade Organisation."
"The inviolable principle behind all European Union decisions is how best to serve the interests of big business and the multinationals."
"The forthcoming reform of the CAP - which is a catastrophic overhaul, not the mid-term review it claims to be - is being carried out in the run up to and under pressure from WTO negotiations."
"The proposed WTO agreement speeds up the liberalisation of the international trade in agricultural produce on the pretext that international trade will increase and benefit the developing countries."
"The same was said of GATT, and look what happened there."
"GATT was going to increase the international trade in agricultural produce and generate wealth."
"Not only did the developing countries and their people not benefit; they were worse off than before, with no margin for development even in countries with a high output like Argentina."
"All that happened was that the multinationals producing and selling agricultural produce sent their profit figures soaring."
"The same will happen with the WTO agreement, for three basic reasons."
"The first has to do with the approach, which favours monopolies, as did GATT."
"The second has to do with the international system of prices and subsidies for agricultural produce and the international system of prices for industrial goods."
"The rich countries buy cheap agricultural produce and sell expensive industrial goods, including medicines."
"The third reason has to do with who produces and owns the agricultural produce in numerous developing countries, where farming and agricultural produce are owned by huge multinationals paying starvation wages."
"That is why the Communist Party of Greece is against the proposed agreement and is doing everything it can to coordinate the grass-roots fight in every country for international trade based on mutual benefit of equal value to all."
"Mr President, the European Union has made clear its commitment to reforming the agricultural trading system - firstly to secure a future for Europe's farmers and, on the other hand, to recognise the need for special treatment for the developing countries."
"This is no mean feat."
"In fact it is very difficult, as we have people on one side who believe the Commission is going too far, and others who believe that it is acting far too cautiously."
"If the European Union is to have a credible voice in the Doha process, this procrastination must stop."
"With enlargement on our doorstep we must act immediately."
"The Commission's proposals will benefit European farmers in the long term and improve prospects for meaningful global trade liberalisation talks."
"I hope that we send the clear message that it is the farmers themselves who should receive a greater share of the market price, and not the increasing numbers of powerful monopolies that are controlling, in a devastating manner, our agricultural industry at the present moment in time."
"The balance we seek is to support small farmers - 90% of the farmers in my country, Wales, are small farmers who farm in less favoured areas - and rural development and Pillar II, on the one hand, while also taking account of farmers in the Third World."
"It is a very difficult balancing act."
"We can no longer continue with a situation where the average European dairy cow now has a bigger annual income, thanks to European subsidies, than half of the world's population."
"Mr President, Commissioner, what I actually would like to do is to address just a few points, as my colleagues have already had a lot to say."
"I believe that the difficulty we have, and that you in the Commission have in particular, is, in essence, the fact that you have to reconcile two different strategies."
"On the one hand, you have to implement reform in the European Union's agricultural production, and on the other, you have to improve developing countries' access to the market."
"That is of course extremely difficult, and is made more so by the very ambitious timetable, as you are required to be able to point to successes as soon as this year - successes in the Cancun negotiations."
"You must at least say in what direction you are taking us, and in doing so you also have to keep sight of your obligation to successfully conclude the negotiations in 2005."
"Add to that the complications with your trading partners, and the whole thing, taken together, amounts to a thoroughly tricky act."
"I have looked at many documents and position papers from Germany, but also from other countries, so that what is here on the desk in front of me is a pot-pourri."
"On the one hand, much that is said is complimentary; people approve of the fact that something is happening at last, and that we are going in the right direction."
"On the other hand, there are also many reservations and concerns, with fears that the European Union will end up with the model of what I might summarise in general terms as a sort of 'leisure agriculture', and that we are to some extent losing sight of the need to be flexible enough to be truly competitive and to be able to compete internationally."
"We may well be able to do a great deal for the environment and agriculture, but there is the risk of other instruments falling by the wayside."
"Commissioner, both you and Commissioner Fischler have, I believe, always said that we have enough room to manoeuvre."
"We have flexibility."
"We have to look at the details, perhaps at the milk prices for example, or in other areas, to see what else we might do."
"Let me conclude with a very brief question. At a seminar of the Group of the Party of European Socialists last week, representatives of the developing countries kept referring to the development box, and expressed the desire that more be done about it."
"Perhaps you could say something about this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the motto we need to adopt for negotiating our agricultural policy at the WTO is: 'More empty words?"
"No, thank you."
"Specific proposals?"
"Yes, please'."
"And the proposals and the timetable for applying them are nothing if not specific."
"The overall package being contributed to the forthcoming WTO negotiations by the European Union puts the ball very firmly in the European Union's court."
"Rather than just tabling proposals, it needs to make a studied demand for something in return."
"We need to know, for example, what the other developed countries are going to do and which parts of the system of protection for European Union farmers need to be safeguarded."
"While we are on the subject of protecting our farmers, and I mean the farmers of the 25 Member States of the European Union, not just the 15, we need first for the multifunctionality model of European agriculture to be recognised and protected."
"Secondly, the review of the common agricultural policy - and the Socialists' agree with the general philosophy here - must not pay the price for any misplaced commitments undertaken at the negotiations."
"Thirdly, as far as the environmental dimension of rural development, striking an ecological balance, food standards and so on are concerned, the European Union must lobby for a common clause for all countries based on its standards. It is both pointless and unacceptable to make it easier to import agricultural produce from developing countries which do not meet European standards."
"Finally, we are not doing poor countries and their farmers any favours if we manage to increase farmers' incomes in poor countries, merely so that the developed countries can sell them extortionately expensive AIDS drugs, for example."
"In other words, what we need at the negotiations are not just impressive proposals of good intent; we need to juxtapose them with social benefits, we need a certain type of negotiation which serves broader social interests."
"Mr President, I think one of the conclusions we can draw from the debate this evening is that this House always has much more to say about agriculture than about access to medicine, Davos or Porto Alegre."
"I am not sure this is news but it is nevertheless the case."
"We should ask ourselves what is really at stake in this whole affair of multinational commercial agricultural negotiations."
"The issue is whether the European Union can and should subscribe to controls, ceilings and rules. In the future these would limit the support and protection we currently afford to our farmers and would like to continue to afford them."
"Further, I would like to remind you of some of the principles on which my position and Mr Franz Fischler's position are based. I would then like to dwell on two or three points in a little more detail."
"Firstly, at Doha we made a number of commitments on negotiations. Our undertakings went considerably further than those we gave on the previous occasion."
"I am referring to Marrakech in 1995. We agreed to increase market access by reducing our support within the Union and reducing export subsidies."
"These matters form part of our negotiation mandate."
"We shall pursue this, as previously agreed."
"Our second principle concerns our work on these issues."
"In allocating concessions, we should give priority to developing countries and ensure that concessions and consequently control measures are applied in an equitable manner."
"There is no question of the European Union as part of the developed world accepting control measures other developed countries would reject."
"I would now like to outline my third and last general principle. This debate is not the same as our internal debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"The debate over our position in relation to the World Trade Organisation is quite separate from the internal debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"We are not debating the reform of the common agricultural policy in Geneva, Tokyo, Washington, Sydney or Cancun."
"It will be debated internally, along our own lines."
"It is true that we are debating our position in relation to the World Trade Organisation in Brussels and Strasbourg, but in the spirit I described."
"The Commission has indeed put forward a proposal."
"If adopted, it will usher in further reforms in the management of the common agricultural policy."
"It remains to be seen if and when these decisions are taken."
"It has yet to be established also which of these decisions will be used as negotiating tools and when."
"This is not the case at the moment however."
"I must make it clear to Mrs Doyle that the 36%, 45%, 55%, that Mr Franz Fischler and I have now put forward with the agreement of the Council, follow from reforms already adopted."
"They do not compromise the eventual outcome of other reforms in any way."
"Turning to whether what we have put forward is too ambitious or is not sufficient."
"You have already responded to this question I think."
"Some of you think our proposals lack ambition and others think they go too far."
"Mrs McNally made it clear that, in her opinion, we could have gone further."
"I would like to say that I do not believe we could have gone any further, at least not at this stage."
"If here and now all the contracting parties within the WTO made the type of commitment we have put on the table, we would all have taken a great step forward towards establishing better control measures to support agriculture throughout the world."
"Now for the question of whether we are going too far."
"I believe this is what Mr Hyland is concerned about."
"I do not believe that we are."
"I do think however that we have already gone too far in reforming the common agricultural policy in recent years."
"This was perhaps the essence of what Mr Hyland was saying."
"As you can well imagine, this is not the view of the Commission."
"I would now like to address the points made by Mr van Dam, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mrs Erika Mann."
"They rightly pointed to the issue of food security. They based their arguments on the fact that in agriculture, only 10% of production is traded on the international market."
"This contrasts with the situation in other sectors."
"They are right in what they say and this is why we have introduced a new measure that has been widely commented upon."
"We are building in the concept of food security, a safeguard clause, a separate section devoted to food security."
"As I said in my introductory intervention, we have taken inspiration from various quarters, in particular non-governmental organisations."
"Before I finish, I would like to respond to Mr Mulder."
"It is true Mr Mulder, that the rules of the so-called 'Everything but arms' initiative include very strict controls on the origin of products that mean that only products from the least advanced countries benefit from the 'zero duty, zero quota' measure agreed for their benefit."
"These rules are very restrictive and some of the countries believe they are excessively so."
"It is therefore right the rules should be so rigorous."
"I would say two lessons have been learnt from this debate."
"The first is that Mr Martinez appears to have certain existential concerns. This in itself is excellent news."
"The second is that, for once, there are excellent reasons for such concerns."
"On this occasion, I do actually share the view that agriculture concerns not just goods but our very being."
"I am sure my colleague Mr Fischler would agree on this too."
"Mr Martinez is right on this point."
"Agriculture is about goods that are produced, distributed and end up on our own or other people's plates."
"Agriculture is also about a service, however, and there is far less talk about that."
"The goods component of agriculture can be found on the market and in trade links."
"Goods are bought and sold."
"The service component of agriculture encompasses food security, the environment and welfare. This is not discussed."
"In general it is poorly served by market forces."
"Agriculture is therefore made up of two interdependent elements."
"One can be seen to circulate, and could be deemed to fit the same rules as applied to the production of socks, tyres and shoes The other element cannot be equated to the trade in socks, tyres and shoes in any way whatsoever."
"This is the service component, and because of it we have a special relationship with what we eat and what we produce."
"The coexistence of the goods and the service components of agriculture is at the root of the difficulties we are up against."
"This is how we in Europe perceive agriculture and this is why Europe has adopted a balanced position on a number of outcomes."
"We are not, however, prepared to sacrifice what we believe to be the collective cost of agriculture."
"We will pursue this concept of the two aspects of agriculture in our discussions."
"I have already made it clear to those of you who are interested in or indeed passionate about this issue that there is everything to gain from discussing this whole matter again, before the Cancun meeting."
"We should, if possible, debate the negotiation program as a whole, and not bit by bit disjointedly as we have this evening."
"Mr Franz Fischler and I are certainly willing to do so."
"As an exception to the rule, I will give the floor to Mr De Rossa."
"Mr President, I apologise for being late."
"I wanted to speak because my position in relation to agriculture is not the same as the position presented to this House by a number of other Irish Members."
"I say this because it is important for the variety of opinion that exists in relation to farming to be on the record."
"I welcome the proposals put forward by the Commission in relation to farming."
"One of the issues that is constantly ignored in Ireland and elsewhere is the contradiction between our spending a considerable amount of money on development aid in assisting developing countries, and yet maintaining a common agricultural system which, at the same time, undermines the very people we claim to be trying to help with our development aid."
"That is an issue we have not yet come to grips with in Ireland or, to some extent, in the rest of Europe."
"It is not a position that you will hear too often from an Irish Member in this House and, for that reason, I wanted to put it on the record."
"This intervention does not set a precedent since, as you know, if for any reason a Member cannot speak, they can present a written statement not exceeding 200 words once per part-session."
"To end this debate, I have received six motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure"
"Freedom of movement and residence for EU citizens"
". (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for this introduction, which paves the way for the presentation of my report."
"Indeed, the directive we are discussing represents a genuine leap forward in the debate on citizenship of the Union and the free movement of persons."
"For the first time, the citizen is recognised as having rights not just as an economic entity but as a person, as the holder of individual rights which, together with general rights, make up European citizenship."
"The rights of free movement and residence derive directly from the European Treaty, they have long been established, as the Commissioner said, and they confer on the citizens new, major fundamental rights."
"Indeed, one might say that this directive lays the foundations of dual citizenship - national and European citizenship - as formulated in the draft Treaty discussed in the Convention too."
"The introduction of the right to permanent residence is a concrete example of this."
"Before looking at the directive in more detail, we should specify its scope."
"It is directed at Community citizens and members of their families, of whatever nationality."
"The principle of equal treatment of third citizens who are members of a Community family has been established since the sixties and the directive makes it even more efficient and effective."
"This is a right derived from the right of the Community citizen of whose family they are members. It must be made clear from the outset that this directive does not apply to the citizens of third countries or, in any case, not to those who are not related to Community citizens, even if they are living in a Member State or enjoy free movement within the Union."
"The great merit of this directive is that it combines all the previous provisions on the subject in a single text."
"Another merit is its clarity and, in this regard, I feel that some of the rapporteur's amendments, not least, have helped to simplify the excessively bureaucratic sections as far as is possible."
"The most innovative elements include the proposal to replace the residence card, as the Commissioner mentioned, with a simple certificate of registration with the competent authorities."
"The registration procedures must be straightforward and direct and, in any case, the principle of self-certification must be applied, as it already is in some Member States."
"The principle of self-certification must also apply to the provision of proof of income and health insurance cover too."
"In the case of family members who are third-country nationals, an identity document must be supplied in order to prove the existence of a family relationship, purely in order to prevent abuses, which are always possible."
"A further innovative principle introduced by the directive concerns the expulsion of third country citizens who are entitled to residence on Community territory."
"The directive stipulates that they cannot be expelled under any circumstances whatsoever."
"This approach applies the 'Amsterdam objective', namely the creation of a border-free area of freedom, security and justice, but some of the Member States will probably want to establish their own rules on this matter."
"I have saved the most controversial issue until last, as always happens when debates are introduced in this Chamber: the family, its composition and the definitions of couple and spouse."
"To avoid such a vast wealth of innovative legislation being hijacked by the usual tug of war, as rapporteur, I have striven to be as open as possible, stretching my principles and the principles of the political group I represent to the limits in the interests of completing the process with the directive intact."
"Moreover, there is no ambiguity over the definition of spouse in terms of Community law, as the Court of Justice has confirmed on a number of occasions."
"In this connection and in relation to unmarried couples too, the rapporteur has appropriated a number of amendments tabled and then withdrawn by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which appeal to the laws of the different Member States with a view to putting an end to the discrepancies which still exist at Community level."
"In my opinion, this democratic appeal to subsidiarity, to national sovereignty, respects all interests and should avoid the usual crusades which could well diminish the content of the report and render its scope ineffective."
"In short, each Member State can regulate family issues on the basis of its own legislation and concerns."
"It would be a real shame if we were unable to succeed in delivering a worthy text enjoying broad support to the Council, considering the marvellous opportunity of codecision we have on this matter."
"Moreover, it is inconceivable that we should impose on 13 States a model supported by only two of them, or that priority should be given to symbols and dogmas rather than responsible rules awaited by millions of citizens who want to be able to organise their lives."
"To sum up, it has to be said that the rapporteur's approach is, for the most part, in line with that of the Commission, which has produced a coherent, objective text which, as we already know, also expresses the Council's position."
"We have the opportunity to give the citizens new, modern rules which provide greater guarantees of civil liberties."
"I am confident that they will be adopted at the vote in this Chamber and I would like to thank the committee draftsmen and all the Members who have contributed to the report with their amendments, which have, without a doubt, improved the content of the directive."
"Madam President, European citizenship was one of the great achievements of the Union Treaty adopted in Nice in 1992."
"In accordance with the judgments of the Court of Justice, the rights of European citizenship, including the right to free movement and residence within the Union, were fundamental rights of European citizens, whose recognition did not require any legislative implementation."
"In accordance with this legal basis, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market considered that there was no reason for the establishment of restrictions of an administrative nature, either for entry into a country or for free movement and residence."
"Much progress has been made in the field of legislative organisation by means of the Schengen Agreements, but it is the case that certain countries are still resisting this progress and are not participating in it."
"Therefore, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market hoped that this proposal for a directive would represent an effective step forward by removing all the restrictions in terms of administration and content to a citizen's ability to establish themselves in another Community country."
"This was the purpose of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"The amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market were not accepted by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the rapporteur would naturally like them to be maintained, but has not insisted, in order not to jeopardise the agreements reached in this field."
"I would like to draw attention to an amendment, however, which could to a certain extent respond to the concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"I am referring to Amendment No 23 - which introduces a new Article 4(b) - which says that 'This Directive shall not lead to the withdrawal of existing rights established by the legislation of the European Union or Court of Justice decision'."
"I believe this amendment is essential if we do not want to move backwards in terms of the rights of European citizens within the Union."
"Madam President, the Commission proposal for a directive on the right of citizens to move freely is, without doubt, an important step in removing the unjustified technical obstacles that persist even in united Europe."
"The proposed amendments submitted by the European Parliament have of course improved the Commission's proposal significantly."
"The amendments submitted by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities aim to bring about a number of improvements to reinforce the free movement of women, taking account of the specific problems faced by women and the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of gender."
"Unfortunately, Commissioner, your ambition to allow European citizens to exercise their right of residence freely and without impediment has not resulted in a text that is gender neutral and takes account of the specific problems faced by women."
"The main problem concerns women who are economically dependent on their husbands and who, in the event of death or separation, have no prospects of extending their right or continuing to reside in another European country."
"In other words, they are automatically deprived of any legal rights derived from their residing in another Member State of the Union."
"We feel this needs correcting."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities also emphasises the importance of protecting all interpersonal relations by giving live-in partners of either sex the same rights as a spouse."
"More and more Member States are finding ways of recognising couples who live together without officially getting married."
"Most countries now allow partners to be officially registered and this category therefore needs to be included in the definition of family members."
"Madam President, on behalf of my colleague, Carmen Cerdeira, who has been shadow rapporteur for this report, and who unfortunately cannot be here, I will try as far as possible to speak on behalf of my political group."
"Citizenship of the Union - institutionalised and created as such by the Treaty of Maastricht and later modified by the Treaty of Amsterdam - confers a series of rights and duties on the nationals of all the Member States."
"The intention is to associate the citizens with the process of European integration, giving them more involvement, strengthening the protection of their rights and promoting the idea of a European identity by means of the creation of a sense of belonging amongst the citizens of the Union."
"The citizenship rights and the Union as a whole will only have credibility amongst the citizens if they can be applied in practice in their everyday lives."
"Within the context of citizenship of the Union, one of the fundamental rights that citizenship confers is laid down in Article 18(1) of the Treaty, which gives every citizen of the Union the right to enter, move and reside freely in the territory of the Member States."
"The same right, with a similar wording, is conferred on the European citizen by Article 45(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and this seems to us very significant."
"Consequently, these rights are of a constituent and not a declarative nature. In other words they are acquired regardless of any permission granted by the Member States."
"We welcome the Commission's proposal, which we consider to be a genuine step forward."
"The movement of the Union's citizens amongst the Member States should be carried out mutatis mutandis in conditions similar to those of the citizens of a particular State."
"In reality, Madam President, the Union's citizens have taken this principle on board much more quickly and thoroughly than their governments."
"They have taken it on board and they exercise it."
"I can assure you that in my part of the Union, on the coast where I spend several days, there are many European citizens residing illegally who simply come and go between their two houses, one in their country of origin and one in my country, whenever they want and without filling out any papers."
"It cannot be demonstrated whether these people have spent the last six months in their house, because sometimes it is 60 km from the neighbouring country."
"The euro will make this even easier and more possible and I hope that progress can be made within the Commission."
"Therefore, my group has presented amendments that intend, once and for all, to end the consideration of the economic situation of people, giving priority to the condition of citizen, and to recognise that at this moment the citizens and their families are already exercising the right to free movement within the European Union."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I highlighted in my report on European citizenship, which we adopted in plenary last September, recognising European citizenship has been a slow process that even today faces too many obstacles, with initiatives having to be carried out to ensure that the concept of European citizenship is fully implemented in its political, administrative, judicial, social and economic aspects."
"I also recommended at that time that, in order to deal with the obstacles still hampering EU citizens' exercise of freedom of movement and residence, the proposal for a directive that we are discussing today should be adopted as rapidly as possible."
"By reworking existing texts, this proposal attempted to introduce the much -needed streamlining by combining in a single legal instrument the right to free movement and residence in the European area, and enshrine, specifically, the right of permanent residence at the end of four years of continuous residence."
"This is a welcome proposal."
"The work of our rapporteur, Mr Santini - and very good work it is - has helped to introduce into this proposal a set of contributions that I believe are extremely positive."
"There are, nevertheless, two areas that have already been mentioned in this debate, which still pose problems."
"They concern the definition of the family, an excessively broad definition, which appears to seek to force national legislation to recognise the definition of an unmarried partner as a family member."
"I believe that common sense would here dictate respect for national law and for the provisions laid down in each Member State."
"This also applies to the excessively broad concept of family member, on which I think it would be more reasonable to uphold the current acquis for direct descendants and direct relatives in the ascending line, contrary, therefore, to the widening put forward in the proposal."
"This could lead to an enormous increase in the number of people requesting family reunification."
"The widening of the definition proposed by Mr Santini is therefore acceptable on humanitarian grounds or on serious health grounds."
"Madam President, we have said a thousand times in this House that a global European immigration policy must be based, firstly, on the establishment of legal immigration rules and then on strong instruments to ensure that these rules are complied with."
"We are today discussing a proposed directive which would constitute the cornerstone of this policy, a directive on which the Council, of course, has not made much progress. Parliament should also have given its opinion some time ago, but we always lag behind on these issues."
"I have chosen this moment to present my report because, for the first time in a long time, the Greek Presidency has included the issue of legal immigration on the political agenda, something which I am glad about."
"The Commission's proposed directive is intended to harmonise the conditions for entry and residence for nationals of third countries who intend to enter a Member State for employment reasons."
"It allows the entry of workers from a third country in the event that the post cannot be filled by a national worker or a worker from another Member State of the Union or by a resident of a third country with the right to access the labour market."
"The proposal lays down a contract at origin for the immigrant worker, except for those who reside legally within the European Union for other reasons."
"The residence permit and the work permit would be combined as one single document."
"The adoption of this directive would involved the recognition of the need for legal channels for immigration and would create a more transparent framework with simpler procedures, which would provide economic actors with more facilities and also reinforce the rights of immigrants."
"For my part, I welcome the Commission's proposal."
"I only regret that the Commission, no doubt as a result of realism, has not been able to reflect in this proposed directive some of the ideas it put forward in previous communications, because I sincerely believe that we cannot continue to copy models of immigration control employed during the last century, when the industrial society was at its height, but that we must be able to imagine new procedures suited to our world, to a society and a labour market which operate according to principles which are very different to those of the decades following the war."
"Some of the measures studied by the Commission, such as mobility, moved in the right direction and reality will oblige us to return to them."
"Madam President, this is just an opinion report."
"I would have preferred to have produced a resolution rather than a package of amendments - which are unlikely to be read or taken into account by those people with real decision-making powers."
"But for procedural reasons we have had to present a package of amendments and these must reflect two fundamental issues."
"Firstly, a strong will and a strong signal in favour of a European immigration policy."
"We need clear rules which can be complied with."
"We have therefore rejected the amendments, above all those presented by the PPE-DE Group, which intended to convert the directive into a kind of recommendation which the States could comply with or not."
"Neither have we accepted the amendments which introduced requirements other than employment and which were difficult to verify."
"If we accept that the possibility of performing a job of work is what legitimises entry and residence in the Union, we must then ensure that this system works."
"By requiring that the immigrant has a contract or a firm offer while still in the country of origin, we are thereby regulating access in accordance with the labour market."
"Even in a situation of unemployment, this would simply become paralysed."
"Secondly, we must establish rules which can be complied with, thereby incentivising the arrival of immigrants through regular channels and preventing illegal contracts; preventing immigrant workers from ending up in an illegal situation, for bureaucratic reasons, once in the Union; and discourage, as far as possible, the entry of immigrants without permits."
"We proposed three things in this regard: that people legally residing in the Union, or who are here legally for any reason or have entered with a residency permit and have lost it, can recover their legal situation and not remain permanently in an irregular situation and that the States can, if they wish, establish a six-month visa for seeking work."
"Other elements we have introduced are the strengthening of equal conditions amongst workers, with a view to preventing all types of discrimination and the creation of a second-class labour market to which both immigrants and native workers would fall victim."
"We also intend for workers to be given equal rights and obligations, for workers to be allowed to move freely within the Member State - for obvious reasons I do not believe we have to go further - and, in general, to reduce the time periods and bureaucratic obstacles to establishing this immigration policy."
"Like our citizens and their representatives, like the employers and the unions, I hope that we can create clear rules based on the criteria of efficiency and not on ideological problems, which are of little help."
"Mr President, in order to achieve legislation in the field of immigration at Community level we should pay particular attention to the positive effects of immigration, something we are debating here today."
"I come from a country - Spain - from which, until a few years ago, many citizens emigrated in search of work and today we are a country into which, thanks to our growth and stability, we receive many immigrants in search of work, often honourable work, who undoubtedly make a positive contribution to our companies and who often carry out work which our citizens reject."
"The current reality, with migratory flows which are speeding up all the time, is reflected every day in the Spanish press."
"We see thousands of Moroccans and Sub-Saharan Africans arriving on our territory looking for work."
"In view of this reality, which is not confined to Spain, we must look for a way to control and regulate the situation, in order to prevent the growing networks trafficking in immigrants."
"The fight against illegal immigration requires the regulation of legal immigration."
"If there are employment opportunities but we do not allow the legal entry of immigrants, we will be promoting illegal immigration, and with it work which is often sub-human, dishonest and sometimes even verging on extortion."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal since it promotes a coordinated economic migration policy."
"However, as other rapporteurs from my group have said, we must maintain the Member States' competence to regulate how many immigrants they can receive to cover the work possibilities."
"We must be prudent."
"The admission of immigrants into our labour market may become a problem in the future when the situations of each of our countries change and our labour markets have higher unemployment rates than the current ones."
"We cannot provide direct access to the labour market for illegal immigrants, particularly those who entered legally, but who are now in our territory illegally, people desperate to find work."
"This would undoubtedly lead to exploitation by many employers and the extortion I mentioned earlier."
"We must improve all the possible mechanisms for the employment of immigrants from their countries of origin."
"We must give employers the opportunity to employ these immigrants so that the relationship between the immigrants in the State of origin and the employers is as fluid as possible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the context of an increasingly global labour market, the European Union has been the target of constant migratory pressure, which must be properly managed."
"I agree with the need to draw up a new common immigration policy, but this policy must always take account of the real needs of the labour market and of the economy itself in each Member State."
"For this reason we can only adopt the report that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has presented if the amendments retabled by the PPE-DE Group are accepted."
"I wish to highlight two points: firstly, this proposal for a directive seeks to establish a common legal framework for conditions of admission and residence of immigrants for the purpose of employment."
"Consequently, on the basis of this directive, immigration for the purpose of employment in the European Union will be permitted if certain conditions are met."
"In our opinion, however, the power of Member States' to regulate, through their governments, whether or not to open up their labour markets cannot and must not be taken away from them."
"In other words, this is a decision that can only be taken by Member States themselves and not at Community level."
"It is the responsibility of each Member State to assess and decide whether or not it needs to increase its labour force, by how much and in what sectors, taking account of their real needs as well as - and I think we all agree on this - their ability to receive and integrate third-country nationals."
"Secondly, the Terrón i Cusí report criticises the fact that the Commission's initial proposal only addresses the situation of individuals who are legally present on Union territory."
"It also claims that illegal workers should also have the right to request a residence permit, which should be granted to them."
"Regardless of the rapporteur's generous approach, this would clearly encourage an increase in illegal immigration, basically saying to these people that once they are on Union territory, even if they have entered illegally, they will have the right to be legalised."
"Mr President, as in other areas of human immigration, we must always be prudent."
"This is not simply a matter of protecting Member State nationals."
"In these areas, excessively generous solutions create more problems than they are intended to resolve."
"Mr President, firstly, on a point of order, I believe that immigration policy has many elements and I do not wish to discuss issues such as allocations in this report."
"I believe that we are going to do so by means of the open coordination method in a future report."
"Secondly, as a personal statement, I would like say to Mr Nassauer and Mr Coelho that no part of my report promotes illegal immigration or allows a work permit in the European Union to be granted to people who enter illegally."
"I am talking about people whose illegal status has come about for bureaucratic reasons and who have not been expelled and who once again fulfil the admission criteria."
"I believe that this is far from promoting illegal immigration."
"My report in no way provides for the possibility of entering illegally and seeking work."
"Finally, Mr Nassauer, I regret that it pleases you that what may be a majority opinion in this House should be thrown out."
"I hope that the participants in the Convention take a different view and that in the future the majority opinions of this House are taken into account."
"The next item is the report (A5-0005/2003) by Mr Hernández Mollar, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (COM(2002) 679 - C5-0609/2002 - 2002/0280(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, appropriate management of migratory flows through all Member States, including States of origin and transit, the fight against human traffickers and illegal immigration, as well as the need to reconcile immigration pressure with the capacity of the receiving society, are aspects which from many points of view - as we have just heard - we have been advocating as the necessary means to put an end to the human tragedies and dramas which uncontrolled immigration is producing within and beyond our borders."
"Furthermore, we must not forget that the gradual disappearance of the Union's internal borders as a means of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, as called for in Tampere, is a project which involves certain risks."
"The proliferation of mafias of every kind, of terrorist and criminal groups, as well as their free movement throughout the Union, must be combated through the fulfilment by all the Member States of our responsibilities, and it is therefore necessary to strengthen controls at the Union's external borders."
"The European Union therefore reached the conclusion that it was necessary to establish an objective list of countries whose nationals would require a visa to enter European territory, thereby making a start on the harmonisation of the Member States in the field of visas."
"Subsequently, the global plan to combat illegal immigration set as an objective, ratified by the Seville European Council, a review by the end of 2000 of this list of third countries, as the Commissioner has just pointed out."
"This is the subject of the report we are discussing today, for which I am rapporteur."
"It responds to the data provided by the Member States which demonstrate the increase in the number of Ecuadorian immigrants in an illegal situation and which lead to the need to include Ecuador on the list of countries whose nationals require visas."
"While it is true that the dramatic events taking place practically every day on the southern coasts of Europe are the most visible and newsworthy aspects of illegal immigration, we must not forget that this is a phenomenon with many other faces."
"From a quantitative point of view, the daily trickle of illegals arriving aboard small boats cannot be compared with the number of foreigners who enter the Community by means of other borders, such as airports."
"The majority enter as mere tourists, only obliged to carry a minimal quantity of money - which is often arranged by mafias - and once in Europe they become illegal immigrants seeking work on the black market, with the resulting employment exploitation."
"It is therefore essential, ladies and gentlemen, that together with repressive measures which only deal with a part of the phenomenon of illegal immigration, we opt for the adoption of rules aimed at promoting the arrival of people on European territory by means of legal channels."
"The proposal we are discussing today falls within this context."
"On the basis of the reality demonstrated by the data currently available to us, we must facilitate the legal arrival of Ecuadorians, preventing them from falling into the hands of heartless gangs as well as the creation of false expectations about what awaits them on European territory."
"Finally, Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this measure will require, on the one hand, that the Republic of Ecuador fulfil its responsibility to properly manage its own emigration and, on the other, that the European Union prioritise the policy of cooperation in the field of emigration with the countries of Latin America."
"We will therefore vote in favour of the amendments which, to this end, have been presented by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to clarify that, during the debate on the previous report, I wished to read a phrase in Spanish, which is the correct linguistic version."
"I had the right to do so, but I am going to do so tomorrow during the vote, although that is less convenient, since it is different from the phrase read by Mr Nassauer."
"With regard to the report we are discussing now by Mr Hernández Mollar, I would like to say that this is not a happy occasion."
"We cannot take pleasure in the restriction of the right to free movement, which - as we pointed out this morning - is an essential factor in the Europeans' world view."
"The Group of the Party of European Socialists, however, despite the irresponsible inclinations in favour of illegal immigration I am accused of by certain Members from the PPE-DE Group, will vote in favour of the inclusion of Ecuador in the list of countries whose nationals require a Schengen visa."
"It will do so having analysed the information which has been provided by the countries requesting it and because it believes that it will provide better guarantees of the rights of those people who today are being denied entry in the terminals of the European Union's airports, which often also affects people who wish to enter for the purposes of tourism."
"In any event, I would like to call on the European Commission to see this as a serious alarm call with regard to a country which is reaching very serious levels of poverty and, in accordance with its own statements on the Union's immigration policy, to treat this country as a priority objective, in terms of development cooperation and co-development measures."
"I believe we could thereby compensate for the sad message which unfortunately we have to send today from the Union to the citizens of that country."
"I thank the rapporteur for his work and for accepting this amendment, because I am convinced that we share this concern."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0024/2003) by Mr Marset Campos, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on relations between the European Union and Belarus: towards a future partnership (2002/2164(INI))."
"Mr President, after the completion of the process of enlargement and of European construction following the Convention and the new Union Treaty of 2003, the European Union will have new borders which will not only require a new form of economic, social and cultural partnership and cooperation with these new neighbours but also, above all, a firm, very broad and effective common foreign and defence policy."
"The reasons depend on the importance of these new neighbours, from the Ukraine and Georgia to Belarus, in which the presence of the giant Russia plays a pivotal role."
"It is therefore a great challenge for the European Union to do the right thing in terms of how relations with these countries develop."
"One of these countries, Belarus, borders Latvia, Lithuania and Poland and, until 1996, had developed in a fairly similar way to the other former members of the USSR but, since that year, it has taken an authoritarian course which has restricted human rights and democracy and imposed abusive social controls which prevent the European Union from establishing mechanisms for relations, association and cooperation such as the ones it has put in place with the rest of these countries."
"So much so that the three European institutions which have monitored the development of events in Belarus, the OSCE, the Council of Europe and the European Union - the parliamentary troika - has had no hesitation in describing these events as incompatible with minimum democratic requirements and has suspended its relations with that Republic until those requirements are met."
"The presentation of this resolution has been delayed considerably as a result of having to convert an initial draft report on the European Union's relations with Belarus into an own-initiative resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy due to the deterioration of the situation in terms of the exercise of democracy and respect for human rights in that country."
"In 1995, the European Union had prepared an agreement on trade and commercial cooperation based on the agreement which had existed since 1989 between the USSR and the European Economic Community and furthermore the victory of Lukashenko had given rise to a degree of hope."
"But all of this became deadlocked when in 1996 President Lukashenko put the brakes on the democratisation process."
"The authoritarian approach of Lukashenko has been characterised by the adoption of mechanisms to harass the opposition, to eliminate critical voices and to create a network of patronage by means of abuses of power and at the same time has tried to come closer to and more dependent on Russia, which Putin has recently pulled back from."
"The various elections held since 1996 have been described by the parliamentary troika as lacking in effective democratic guarantees."
"This has lead to the consolidation of a democratic opposition platform which has been maturing and which involves a broad spectrum, ranging from parties on the right to parties on the left - the communist party for example - which agree on fundamental aspects such as the establishment of democracy, partnership and, when appropriate, integration into the European Union."
"Awareness of the need for democracy is increasing within Belarusian society and there are increasing numbers of members of the current Parliament of Belarus in favour of democratic reforms which bring the legal framework for freedoms closer to the requirements of the European Union."
"Therefore the recommendation which we in the European Union must make, and which we are proposing in this resolution, combines two considerations: on the one hand, a firm rejection of reaching an association agreement at this time since that would imply a legitimisation of the current authoritarian regime and would hinder the establishment of democracy, and, on the other, an increase in initiatives which send a clear signal of cooperation and solidarity - with the victims of Chernobyl, for example - or coming closer in social, cultural and trade union terms which will allow democracy to be restored."
"This is what our proposal is aimed at."
"We must not forget the important role Russia can play in this process."
"I would like to end by thanking all the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their significant cooperation and I must finally acknowledge that I do not accept some of the amendments proposed by my own group for the reasons I have just given."
". Mr President, I very much welcome this opportunity to debate Belarus and the relations between Belarus and the European Union."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Marset Campos, for his excellent preparatory work."
"I will indicate, in my remarks, where we find ourselves in profound agreement with what the rapporteur has said."
"It is a very sad reality that, as on the many previous occasions when we have discussed Belarus, the focus is on a number of very difficult subjects: on the whole question of the cases of disappeared persons; on the harassment of the media; on the limitations on the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion; on the recent open confrontation by the authorities in Belarus with the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group in Minsk."
"Alas, we have never been in a position to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement with Belarus."
"That country is the only European successor of the former Soviet Union without a privileged contractual relationship with the European Union, including a clear mutual commitment to the common values of democracy and human rights."
"It is obvious that the current state of relations between the European Union and Belarus is profoundly unsatisfactory for both sides."
"While we are developing new forms of cooperation, for example, with the Russian Federation, while we are about to address the specific challenges and opportunities of enlargement in defining new forms of cooperation with those countries that will be our new eastern neighbours after enlargement, Belarus has sadly chosen the role of spectator."
"The Commission has been invited by the Copenhagen European Council to submit proposals on the EU's future relations with its neighbours, including Belarus."
"I am sure a number of honourable Members, during this debate, will want to make reference to this 'New Neighbours' or 'Wider Europe' debate."
"Obviously, we will have to be prepared for the moment when Belarus sends a signal that it is ready to co-operate with us."
"Given the present situation on democracy, freedom of speech and the media, and on human rights in general, it is difficult to imagine when the EU will be able to have normal relations with Belarus."
"I am very grateful for the clear message that this debate and Parliament's resolution will send in this respect."
"However, I fully agree with the elements in the resolution - and I am sure this will be followed up in a number of speeches today - which recalled the importance Belarus has, not only for the European Union, but also for the stability and prosperity of the whole region."
"I can assure you that this is the common ground we are all working on."
"There are many issues where the Commission would like to broaden its activities and its co-operation with Belarus, be it in addressing common threats of cross-border organised crime and illegal migration, or in regional development, economic and structural reform, environmental protection and so on. Every day lost in dealing with these issues adds to the hardship of the people of Belarus, and to the potential risks building up on this part of our future eastern border."
"On different occasions, in particular since early 2000, the European Union has co-operated with the OSCE and the Council of Europe to build a bridge that would help Belarus move towards normalisation of its relations with the international community."
"Belarus has, on several occasions, missed these opportunities, including prior to the elections in 2000 and 2001."
"The European Parliament and its Delegation for relations with Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, has been very active in the framework of the Parliamentary Troika with the Parliamentary Assemblies of the OSCE and the Council of Europe."
"While the European Union has limited its official contacts with Belarus to a strict minimum, this alternative form of political dialogue is very useful and demonstrates that in terms of minimum standards of democracy and human rights, the elected representatives of all three organisations speak with one voice to Belarus."
"The Commission strongly agrees with the emphasis in the resolution on strengthening dialogue with civil society, NGOs, democratic forces, the media and with the universities in Belarus."
"However, as to the call to the Commission in Article 9 of the draft resolution, to: '?develop a strategy for Belarus within the proposal 'Wider Europe' for the democratisation and the development of a social market economy' in Belarus, it seems obvious to me that any assistance or help from the Commission could only be in support of a comprehensive government strategy."
"It could never replace a strategy by Belarus itself."
"The driving force for this sort of change would need to come from Belarus."
"Unfortunately, it does not seem to be there yet."
"What we can and will do in the Commission, is to use the instruments at our disposal to continue support and assistance to grass roots civil society organisations, to journalists and independent media, to universities and also - where it is appropriate - to local authorities."
"Within the limits of the restrictions set by the September 1997 General Affairs Council, the Commission is also proceeding with technical assistance on border and regional projects, as well as projects linked to the aftermath of the Chernobyl catastrophe."
"When calling for broader engagement in terms of assistance, we should also not forget the difficult ground we are working on in Belarus."
"It is the authorities, with instruments like the notorious 'Decree No 8', that make the work of foreign donors and their partners in Belarus extremely difficult."
"We had some joint projects with the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Belarus."
"The de facto closure of the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group in Minsk last October has obviously threatened the further implementation of such projects."
"Only after the 19 November 2002 decision of 14 EU Member States to impose a visa ban on President Lukashenko and seven other leading personalities in Belarus was a compromise finally reached to establish a new OSCE Minsk office as of 1 January 2003."
"The coming weeks and months will demonstrate whether the authorities in Belarus are finally committed to take the path towards freedom, democracy and an improvement in human rights."
"Normalised relations with the OSCE could be a first step."
"Compliance with minimum standards during the coming local elections in early March would be a second step, followed by a convincing commitment to fulfil all the conditions outlined in Parliament's draft resolution."
"These are the sort of benchmarks that could prepare the way for the eventual accession of Belarus to the Council of Europe and, beyond that, open the perspective for a gradual normalisation of relations with the European Union."
"I am very grateful to the rapporteur for the work he has done to make these things possible - we all hope - in the future."
"Mr President, the European Union is trying in any way it can to put pressure on Belarus to respect human rights and bring about democratic reform."
"Until now we have used more stick than carrot."
"In the future it will be wise of us to try and find more positive ways of achieving our aims."
"After the enlargement of the EU Belarus will be our neighbour, sharing a common border with no fewer than three new Member States: Latvia, Lithuania and Poland."
"We must encourage Belarus to maintain its independence as a state and orientate itself towards European cooperation."
"Multilateral cooperation will provide us with a good forum for cooperation with Belarus."
"Positions in the Council of Baltic Sea States will alter when the Baltic countries and Poland go from being neighbours to members of the EU."
"In this situation the EU must be more firmly committed than it has hitherto to the work of the Council and channel more funds to projects to be undertaken."
"With Union enlargement the importance of cross-border cooperation will increase."
"We have to encourage Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in particular to develop cross-border cooperation with Belarus."
"In the future the Union must be prepared to finance projects in connection with this."
"There must be a new scheme to provide funds created in the European Union for cross-border cooperation, either in association with TACIS or as a separate arrangement."
"There must be more conspicuous channelling of funds on the part of the Union than there has been until now towards development in our neighbouring countries, especially those neighbouring regions across our borders."
"Differences in standards of living must also be narrowed down effectively on the Union's external borders."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few minutes until voting time)"
"Mr President, as the House knows, my report concerns the Spanish initiative to simplify the Schengen rules and cut out as much red tape as possible, by allowing group visas to be issued at external borders to seamen in transit, thereby making things easier for Member States with a navy."
"My report is a considerable improvement on the original proposal, because it protects citizens' individual rights and personal data, using the Schengen provisions on which the regulation is based."
"My report also edits the text so that it is gender neutral, in recognition of the fact that many women have entered the seafaring profession over recent years."
"Most importantly, we reject the criterion of common nationality because there are insufficient grounds for requiring seamen to be of the same nationality in order to obtain a group visa."
"The report therefore proposes that short group visas should be issued to groups of between five and fifty seamen, even if they are not all of the same nationality."
"This will help European shipping considerably."
"Mr President, my voting machine is making a very strange noise and it has a lot of lights on it."
"Mr President, I have no objection to a separate vote, but I agree with the order established since that was what was approved in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"Mr President, my proposal is firstly Amendment No 3 and then later Amendment No 6."
"And if there is an Amendment No 6, a separate vote."
". (PT) Although visas should only be granted at borders in exceptional circumstances, common procedures must be established in the Member States for the transit of seamen, a professional category that is subject to enormous labour mobility."
"This initiative is intended to update, clarify and streamline rules for granting visas to seamen in transit."
"The major legislative innovation consists of the possibility, provided that certain conditions are met, of issuing collective transit visas to seamen from the same vessel who are travelling in a group of between five and fifty people, provided that the period of transit is limited."
"They must not be required to have the same nationality, however, because in practical terms, this would basically nullify the effects of this proposal."
"It is also important to make the shipping agent and the shipping line responsible for visa requests."
"The need for the exchange of information must also be emphasised to ascertain, for example, whether an individual has been arrested, whether he has a criminal record, whether he is suspected of being involved in trafficking or in illegal immigration."
"This initiative, with the amendments tabled by the European Parliament can contribute to making the complex Schengen acquis a little more comprehensible and bring solutions which, although perhaps not the ones we would wish to see - such as the introduction of more thoroughgoing reforms of the Schengen acquis - are solutions that are possible."
". (PT) I voted in favour of this report for two main reasons."
"On the one hand, I acknowledge the clear need to promote the harmonisation of the divergent legislation in this field, an essential requirement for making the Schengen acquis intelligible and accessible."
"I would emphasise, however, that even were this not the case, I do not see the slightest problem in there existing differences between national legislations on migratory phenomena."
"On the contrary, I feel that any artificial attempt to standardise, exceeding the provisions of Article 63(3)(a) of the EC Treaty, would be counterproductive."
"Furthermore, I also share the rapporteur's conviction about the importance of controlling external borders as a means of combating illegal immigration and crime."
"To conclude, I welcome the integration into the Common Manual of practices applicable to seamen in transit and would highlight the importance of the collective visa which, as the rapporteur quite rightly observed, could become unenforceable if it were only issued to nationals of the same State."
"I deplore, however, the 'politically correct' approach adopted by the rapporteur in insisting on adding gender-related words, when the fact is that basic interpretive rules would suffice and there was clearly never any discrimination in the Commission's text."
". (EL) The motion to allow European citizens freedom of movement and residence on Community territory is on the right track, which is why I support it."
"It gives citizens greater opportunity to exercise their right to move freely throughout the Community by calling for procedures to be simplified and pared down."
"Of course, making over six months' residence dependent on financial resources could give rise to social discrimination."
"Now that the definition of the family has been extended to same sex or unmarried partners, the directive reflects the diversity of family relationships in today's society more closely."
"Finally, greater flexibility is needed for students studying abroad; with the length of time studying takes nowadays, this could be considered as a reason for obtaining a residence permit."
". (PT) I welcome the improvements being made to the situation of EU citizens who wish to settle in another Member State of the Union, in particular reducing the bureaucracy that currently proliferates."
"On the basis of the proposal for a directive put forward by the European Commission, it will now be possible for an EU citizen to remain on the territory of another Member State without having to comply with any formalities, for a period of six months and not only three months, which is the current requirement."
"For stays of more than six months, if a Union citizen is engaged in a gainful activity, he is simply required to make a declaration to that effect."
"If he is not engaged in a gainful activity, he is obliged to declare that he has sufficient resources and Member States may not fix any threshold for this."
"He must also take out sickness insurance cover for his first four years of residence."
"The right to permanent residence at the end of these four years is the major innovation introduced by the directive and consists of the fact that this right is granted to the European citizen and to the members of his/her family."
"The report makes some positive improvements, widening the concept of the family, eliminating or simplifying some bureaucracy, and guaranteeing more rights than those planned initially."
"Hence our vote in favour."
". (PT) We are aware that studying this report appeared at the outset to be a difficult exercise, basically due not only to the issue of the categories of person that should be included in the definition of 'family member' - or of 'beneficiary', in addition to the EU citizen, the definition of the right to move to and particularly to reside in the European Union - but also to the problems inherent in defining the conditions that EU citizens must fulfil in order to benefit from this right."
"The fact is that the solutions adopted in these nuclear definitions both in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and in plenary, have all had the majority support of the parliamentary left."
"In fact, with regard to the definition of the term 'family', most of the solutions were adopted in a sense that does not match the values that I hold dear, especially Amendment No 53: the 'spouse', regardless of their sex, the 'unmarried partner' and/or 'person with whom they live', regardless of their sex, 'in a de facto union', 'with whom the applicant has a durable relationship' and 'registered' under the terms of the relevant national legislation, the 'partner' and/or 'person with whom they live' from third countries or without a residence permit and lastly, direct descendents and direct relatives in the ascendant line and those of the spouse or registered partner with whom they live."
"My position is not rooted in any type of ideological or religious fundamentalism."
"I am not judging, and nor is it my place to judge anyone's rights on the grounds of their sexual or any other kind of orientation."
"I see no reason why the EU should promote legal definitions of the family that are far removed not only from national legislation, making it difficult to transpose them, but also from traditional values that have always been commonly accepted."
"Apart from anything, such definitions will encourage all sorts of abuses by those who attempt illegally to move to the EU and settle."
"Hence my vote against."
". (PT) Although I believe that creating a genuine European area of free movement and genuinely defining the Union's citizens' right to residence justify promoting a coherent and articulate policy, I have had to vote against the report."
"I regret that the excessive approach of the proposals, voted for mainly by the left in the parliamentary committee, remove any merit the report had, and take it far from the considerably more balanced approach of the rapporteur."
"The final text suffers from the vices of failing to add to the rights and freedoms that are enshrined the duties that go with them, thereby denying the need to take account of their real value and of their real existence."
"They also seek to impose a European identity, ignoring true national identities; establishing an artificial equation between the family and other human relationships in a way that is no longer surprising and takes opportunistic advantage of one issue in order to impose another; and it ignores the third largest concern of Europe's citizens - the fight against organised crime."
"In addition to breaking down the internal doors of the Union, this text would not allow Member States to learn about and monitor migratory phenomena, a factor that will affect their domestic social balance and the implementation of their budgets, especially for social assistance."
"The European Parliament has therefore opted for what is a clearly excessive approach, which goes far beyond what is needed."
"This will, in a counterproductive way, only create further difficulties and new unnecessary obstacles to the adoption of these rules."
"As I have already said, those who wish to achieve too much will prevent us from achieving the basic goals."
". (PT) The European Parliament has today had to face the fact that five Member States have declared themselves to be in favour of transferring Ecuador to the list of third countries whose nationals require visas, basically because of illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, regional coherence and considerations of public order."
"According to information that has been provided, many Ecuadoreans enter Europe legally under the cover of tourism but then stay on illegally for longer than three months."
"The expulsion of Ecuadorean nationals is becoming increasingly frequent, due mainly to a lack of evidence that they have sufficient means of subsistence and their inability to submit valid proof of the purpose of their journey."
"There is also the consideration of geographical coherence, because visas are currently required of nationals of other Andean countries, which makes Ecuadorean passports more 'interesting' and encourages their falsification and counterfeiting."
"Since the Commission proposal was drawn up in response to the priority established at the Seville European Council, to combat illegal immigration, we have voted in favour of it."
". (PT) I am voting in favour of this report, primarily because it is a further demonstration that East Timor is recognised as a fully-fledged State."
"I understand the need to re-examine the list of third countries subject to visa requirements, due to the necessary and urgent fight against crime and illegal immigration, I welcome the possibility of reassessing the impact of making visas mandatory, particularly with regard to journeys undertaken for business, leisure and research purposes."
"Going now into the most widely debated point, it is clear, given the Member States' answers to the questionnaire published by the Commission, that transferring Ecuador to the permanent list of countries on Annex I of Regulation (EC) Noº539/2001 is justified by the concerns expressed about illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings, regional coherence and public order."
"The Ecuadorian Government's concern at the legislative change we are discussing is understandable, but we cannot minimise the dissuasive effect that experience has proved necessary to step up."
"In fact, the human tragedy of being uprooted, of being in an illegal situation and of lacking the means to survive has, with the implementation of this amendment, better possibilities of being avoided upstream, thereby ending the particular attraction that an Ecuadorean passport holds for forgers and counterfeiters."
"Belarus has cut itself off from the international community because of the autocratic policy followed by its regime."
"This policy involves persecuting the opposition, restricting the freedom of the press, restricting trade union freedoms, imprisoning, mistreating and doing away with political opponents and applying the death penalty."
"Belarus needs to start democratising if it is going to be in a position to ratify the partnership and cooperation agreement between the ?U and Belarus in the not too distant future."
"It goes without saying that the European Parliament's call for democratisation must not conceal any attempt by the EU to challenge the right of Belarus to decide its own foreign policy."
"The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report on Belarus because it represents monumental intervention by the ?U in the internal affairs of an independent country."
"The problem for the EU is not one of democracy; it is the fact that Belarus insists on respect for international law, territorial integrity and national sovereignty and is against selling out to the multinationals."
"The report - and this is pure blackmail - makes future relations with Belarus dependent on its immediate transition to a market economy and even calls for cooperation with the USA in a bid to make its intervention - which nowadays can mean anything and everything, including military intervention - more effective."
"There is a problem in Belarus with respect for human rights and democratic freedoms."
"However, this is a matter for its own people and does not warrant foreign intervention."
"The supposed democratic freedoms which international imperialist organisations and this report are endeavouring to blackmail Belarus into accepting are freedom of action for big business and the freedom to wipe out any achievements left over from the socialist regime."
"All this is illustrated by the fact that the amendment proposed by the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece, calling on the ?U to cooperate directly with Belarus in combating trafficking in human beings, was rejected in favour of an amendment requiring Belarus to toe the EU line."
"The next item is the recommendation by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (A5-0017/2003) on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the conclusion of an Association Agreement between the European Community and its Member States of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part [13767/2002 - COM(2002) 536 - C5-0589/2002 - 2002/0239(AVC)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in the production of this report, which has been unanimously approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and I would like to stress this cooperation since it does not happen very often."
"Secondly, I would congratulate the Commission on its impeccable negotiation of this association agreement with Chile - as Commissioner Patten has pointed out - taking up the suggestions of the European Parliament in relation to the timetable and overcoming the difficulties caused by the negotiation guidelines."
"Commissioner Patten asked us to trust in his judgment in order to overcome the problems relating to the timetable and he has been proved right."
"The result, Mr President, is that we have the most innovative, ambitious and global agreement the European Union has ever concluded with a third country which is not a candidate for accession."
"An agreement which has been described by the Commission - correctly I believe - as an agreement for the twenty-first century, a fourth generation plus agreement."
"I believe we must be pleased that this agreement has been concluded with a country such as Chile, since in a way this agreement is a recognition of the great civil maturity of the citizens of that country and their decisive desire for openness and trade."
"As Commissioner Patten said to us a moment ago, this agreement also represents a message of hope to a region which is currently experiencing a difficult situation: instability in Venezuela, crisis in Argentina, the hopes and challenges arising from the election of President Lula da Silva in Brazil, poverty on the subcontinent and the phenomenon of violence in Colombia."
"I would particularly express my gratitude for the words of Mr Patten, who, on behalf of the European Parliament, is also going to communicate a message of solidarity to the Colombian authorities in relation to the attack which killed many people in Bogotá last weekend."
"This agreement - as the Commissioner quite rightly pointed out - takes a similar approach to the Association Agreement with Mexico which has lead to an increase in commercial transactions since its entry into force and which is an agreement which goes much further than these requirements, since it provides for the liberalisation of 100% of transactions, many going much further than the forecasts established in the negotiations of the World Trade Organisation."
"I would like to highlight an aspect which I believe to be particularly important, and that is that Chile has concluded this association agreement with the European Union before concluding its agreement with the United States."
"I would also stress that the Commission has stated that this agreement goes beyond mere commercial thinking, since association agreements try to establish a strategic partnership based on the principles and rights contained in the democratic clause for both parties."
"This agreement is very rich in terms of commercial liberalisation."
"It involves almost 100% of products, not just agricultural products, but products of every type, it establishes stipulations relating to agreements and technical clauses, it lays down the greatest degree of liberalisation ever to have been created in an agreement on the services sector and also establishes, Mr President, the most generous treatment Chile has ever given to a third country, and, for the first time in negotiations with the European Union, it lays down accessibility for foreign investors in an agreement of this nature."
"I believe that this agreement completes the network of agreements being negotiated at the moment."
"The only one remaining is that with Mercosur, and we are awaiting negotiation guidelines for agreements on political dialogue and cooperation with the Andean and Central American Community, which we hope - as Parliament has requested on many occasions - can become association agreements."
"In this way, Mr President, I believe we will be able to respond to the difficult situations being experienced by certain Latin American countries and create an extensive range of relations between our two regions which should culminate - and this is what Parliament wants - in the coming summit of Heads of State in Mexico, and we hope that these agreements can lead the way to a strategic and bi-regional partnership which will result in this global partnership we want to see."
"Therefore this agreement, Mr President, represents a geographical consolidation of the existing links between both regions, which are destined to be political, commercial and strategic partners, and increases the tools at our disposal for responding to the challenges and uncertainties we are faced with in this globalised world."
"I would like to thank all the political groups for their positive and constructive cooperation in the issuing of this favourable opinion on the association agreement."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first of all like to express the satisfaction of the Group of the European Peoples' Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - and mine in particular - at the conclusion of this association agreement between the Community and its Member States and Chile, the most ambitious, innovative and global agreement the European Union has ever negotiated with a country which is not a candidate for accession, to use the words of the European Commission, in line with what, as has been said already, should be the bi-regional strategic partnership between Latin America and the European Union that this Parliament proposed."
"Furthermore, I would like to, and must, congratulate Mr Salafranca on the work he has done in order to realise this work and the Commission on the efforts and guidance it has contributed to the conclusion of this Agreement, which began as soon as Chile had recovered its rights and freedoms, which would not have been possible without the political vision and tenacity of the Chilean leaders, from President Elwin to the current President, President Lagos, and which reflects the will of Chile and of the European Union and its Member States to establish privileged relations in the political, commercial and cooperation fields which the agreement encompasses and to strengthen links, as a result of the shared values which unite them."
"Within the framework of the liberalisation of the markets, the benefits in terms of economic growth and sustainable development which may result from reciprocal economic and trade relations is unquestionable, as are the benefits of a political dialogue aimed at promoting democracy and the formulation of common responses to the great challenges of this millennium."
"That is why I am convinced that this agreement - which my group will support resoundingly - is a very positive step not only for relations between the European Union and Chile, but also for the economic and social well-being of the Chilean people in their democratic journey, which has so far been recovered in such an exemplary fashion, and which must serve, and in reality does serve, as an example to Latin America during these difficult times for some of its countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we must be glad about the establishment of this agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Chile and I also believe it is fair to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Salafranca, on his efforts and the results achieved."
"It is a very broad agreement which will undoubtedly increase commercial transactions between the European Union and Chile and this is positive at a time when many countries in Latin America are in a particularly difficult situation."
"It should be stressed that the total of tariffs on imports from Chile, relating to industrial products, will be restricted in 2006 and that in the agricultural field this will take place in 2012."
"The agreement also offers great possibilities in the fields of services and financial services, as well as on all aspects relating to investments."
"It is also positive that it includes a protocol on fishing enterprises."
"I have read the report of the International Human Rights Federation on the indigenous populations in Chile."
"These represent 4.4 % of the total population, or 13%, depending on the source of statistics."
"Of these populations, the Mapuche people, in percentage terms, are the most significant."
"The problems of the indigenous population relate to forest exploitation and the construction of large hydro-electric projects."
"We must remember that these problems were exacerbated enormously during the dictatorship of Pinochet."
"We are glad that the report contains explicit references to the protection of human rights and specifically mentions the rights of indigenous minorities."
"We hope that this Agreement will create greater transparency and mutual understanding, and that it will also recognise the rights of the indigenous peoples."
"Finally, while on the subject of Chile, as a citizen of Catalonia, I must acknowledge Chile's reception in former times of Catalan exiles fleeing the Franco dictatorship."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU/Chile Association Agreement enacts particularly ambitious, strengthened cooperation."
"Such intense dialogue should, of course, be encouraged with the greatest possible number of third countries in order to support economic development and emphasise the ecological values and democratic clauses of the European Union."
"Furthermore, we feel this far-reaching agreement has taken place too quickly, in particular given the impact assessment unveiled at the same time."
"It is a shame that the impact assessment did not really act as a basis for this association agreement."
"The European Union negotiations, which are very strong with regard to trade and, in our opinion, excessive with regard to liberalisation, should now also be based, in a balanced manner, around human rights and the environment."
"Following Chile's dark history, all our vigilance should be focused on political rights, in particular the fate of the Mapuche Indians."
"With regard to fisheries, the Union's interests for Chile should be balanced and only have meaning and a future within the perspective of development and sustainable management of fisheries resources."
"Let us spare the Chilean fishermen the overexploitation of their resources that has destroyed our own European marine resources."
"In particular, let us spare Chile from being relegated to the role of ersatz fishmonger for our Community ports."
"Lastly, we think the scope of this agreement should have given rise to a prior discussion of the same magnitude."
"This agreement, which aspires to be a model for the twenty-first century, is being dealt with too cursorily."
"Although the agreement is interesting because it integrates the human rights dimension and consultation of civil society, it nevertheless deserved a more extensive debate on its possible impact, both positive and negative."
"We submitted an oral question in this regard to allow a debate worthy of the agreement, but the proposal was dismissed."
"Far from constituting barriers to the implementation of the agreement under consideration, these observations - and we would emphasise this - are an attempt to increase its relevance and durability."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance would like this twenty-first century agreement to become a beacon for a new kind of trade based on fair trade, respect for the environment and human rights."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0019/2003) by Mr Caveri, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the establishment of an ecopoint system applicable to heavy goods vehicles travelling through Austria for the year 2004 [COM(2001) 807 - C5-0699/2001 - 2001/0310(COD)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal was presented on 20 December 2001 in order to respond to the request of the European Council in Laeken."
"However, the Commission does not believe that the system of ecopoints is a valid long-term system for resolving the problems of traffic associated with sensitive regions."
"The text we will present contains certain significant elements, such as the removal of the 108% clause, which imposes an annual limit on the number of transit journeys by Community lorries through Austria."
"On the other hand, the proposal maintains the system in force throughout Austrian territory and also the number of ecopoints available for 2003."
"In fact, in 2003 the objective of the system will be achieved, which is to reduce pollution by 60% over the last twelve years."
"This proposal therefore responds to the desire of the Heads of State and Government and implies an extension for a limited period - one year renewable for two further consecutive years, that is up to a maximum of three years - but under no circumstances can it be the definitive proposal, but simply a transitional solution until we can implement other solutions."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Caveri for the work he has done on an issue which - as we have seen here today - is very difficult and delicate."
"There are a range of interests, all of them legitimate but entirely contradictory, which are in opposition to each other."
"I would simply like to point out to certain Members that we need a quick resolution, because the current transitional situation ends on 31 December 2003."
"Secondly, the current situation is transitional."
"In other words, what appears in the accession Treaty, the protocol on which the whole system of ecopoints is based, lays down a limited time period."
"Thirdly, we must be aware that the other fourteen countries of the European Union are accepting the idea of making an effort and an exception in order to satisfy Austria with regard to what is one of the essential freedoms of European integration - initially of the Common Market and now of the European Union - which is freedom of transit for people."
"On this basis, the Commission presented a proposal which suggested an extension for a maximum of three years - year by year - of the current system, in order to allow time to seek general rules which of course will not mean for Austria or anybody the maintenance of the ecopoints system or any similar system."
"I say this because it is obvious that it is not now a question of seeking a system which is radically different to the ecopoints system, since it is going to have a restricted minimal period in force."
"I would insist that we are seeking a transitional system so that Austria, which participates in the ecopoints system, may arrive, together with the other 14 countries - 24 within a few months - at a common system and a better assumption of the external costs of the different infrastructures throughout the European Union, without exceptions for anybody."
"It is therefore a transitional exception which must be based, in principle, on the current system because for two or three years it would not make much sense."
"In Mr Caveri's proposal there are points which take the same approach as the principle for agreement proposed by the Danish Presidency on 31 December."
"This represents a compromise and I am happy that there is agreement, for example, on the idea of banning the most polluting lorries; on the idea of freeing the least polluting lorries from the ecopoints system; on establishing an annual duration of a transitional system up to a maximum of three years."
"However, there are provisions which we believe will make it difficult for the Commission to reach an agreement with the Council - I would make this very clear - and which would provide more problems than solutions."
"This is the case with the reduction of the scope of the system to just the Austrian Alps, which are genuinely of the greatest sensitivity, because in the other areas of Austria the sensitivity - and many of the speakers were right - is identical to that of other areas of Europe."
"However, while I understand this in principle, it would create enormous difficulties in terms of managing the project."
"I would therefore ask that the general area of Austria be maintained."
"Furthermore, in the Council we have debated whether or not to exclude the Hörbranz Pass, the Lindau-St."
"Margarethen, which involves a stretch of road of less than 15 kilometres, a very short distance."
"That would also raise problems."
"I would therefore ask you not to retain this part, please."
"The provisions of the system of contingents, which vary according to categories, would also raise difficulties."
"Furthermore, the number of ecopoints set relates to the current Member States, and to apply the system now to the future countries would complicate matters even further."
"Let us hope that before they join as full Members this problem has been resolved definitively."
"Furthermore, we ask that you do not insist on the reintroduction of the 108% clause, because we cannot maintain and represent something which - I can tell you - the Council would never accept and which the Commission also rejected."
"Furthermore, that clause did not appear in the proposal."
"Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we can accept six amendments, one of them a fundamental issue and, if necessary, with some modifications to the wording of the text, Amendments Nos 1, 5, 11, 12 and the first sentence of No 15 and of No 18."
"I would like to say to you that the real solution is to build the Brenner, to build the Lyon-Turin, that intermodality truly be established."
"Those are the solutions."
"You must understand that we have to seek a compromise and that a solution is urgently required."
"We do not have many months."
"And the perfect is always the enemy of the good."
"I say this to everyone."
"I would ask you to cooperate so that, amongst all of us, we can resolve this problem, which is very sensitive in one of the countries of the Union."
"We must seek a response and achieve a result which allows progress to be made, while we present proposals which serve to provide a more rational system of charging for infrastructures throughout the European Union."
"I would once again like to congratulate Mr Caveri on the difficult work he has done in trying to seek a formula acceptable to everyone and, in any event, the Commission will, of course, take very good note of what Parliament says as always and will try to include these elements in the basis of an agreement acceptable to Parliament and to the Council."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the White Paper on Transport is dated 12 September 2001 and it may appear that we have spent too much time analysing this important report sent to us by the Commission."
"However, I must say that we have made good use of this time, thorough use I believe, to debate and bring together positions between the different groups in the House."
"At the moment these approximations are still taking place, and I would urge that we reach a thorough consensus for the vote tomorrow."
"We have used this time to inform the sectors and allow them to participate."
"I am sure that the Commission has held many contacts with all the sectors before producing the White Paper, but I must say that Parliament has not been left behind and that practically all the European associations representing the different modes of transport have been heard by Parliament and that many of their proposals have been incorporated into the approach we have been working on."
"This approach is characterised by a fundamental fact: Commissioner, in this case Parliament is not opposing the Commission."
"On the contrary, it is demonstrating willingness and carrying out a positive analysis of the Commission's proposal, of the proposals in the White Paper, and we believe that the enormous majority of its offers and analysis can be perfectly endorsed by this Parliament."
"W are continuing this reflection, however, and providing certain constructive criticisms and specific proposals which should be analysed by the Commission as appropriate."
"This is a crucial and decisive time for transport."
"It is true that in 1992, in the last White Paper on Transport, certain objectives were set which have been fulfilled practically in their entirety."
"We could say that the liberalisation of transport was the strategic and fundamental objective of that White Paper: the incorporation of technologies, the reduction in transport costs, the increase in competitiveness, objective achieved, but in this war, we have lost the battle of sustainability, and I am glad that the Commission is the first to clearly acknowledge the seriousness of this problem, and the fact that we cannot afford to delay decision making if we want to be operative."
"The problem of sustainability in the broad sense, environmental, naturally, with the grave consequences of the pollution created by transport, which cancel out the savings made in the rest of industry with a view to fulfilling the Kyoto commitments, and with the impact, not only on nature generally, but on the health of the citizens who, according to certain reports, reaches levels practically as serious as transport accident levels."
"As well as the actual environmental aspect, congestion is worrying."
"We used to have a functional operative transport system which was competitive, but now the main routes are seizing up, cities are becoming grid-locked, kilometres of rail and road, approaches to airports, are showing themselves to be structurally weak in terms of competitiveness."
"And therefore competitiveness is being seriously harmed."
"This is not the time to give figures, I refuse to do that, we do not have time, but I must say that we are also moving in that direction."
"Charging is a rough diamond in the White Paper which we must be able to cut from now on and which is essential."
"We must promote modes of transport which are respectful of the environment, create synergy between the different modes of transport by means of intermodality and the logistical platforms necessary for creating transport as efficiently as possible."
"The essential role of roads must be respected and valued, the railways must be liberalised, short- and medium-distance cabotage must be strengthened, etc."
"Safety cannot be conditional."
"There is a proposal from Parliament on the creation of the European safety agency for roads - the only one missing from the White Paper on Transport - and I hope that it is received well, as well as other problems relating to safety at sea, on the railways, etc."
"Commissioner, the time has come for us to say very clearly that the European Union's transport policy cannot work without a consistent budgetary policy, and hence Parliament's proposal on the European transport fund that we need and on the financial instrument for transport."
"It is true that European asymmetry is not properly considered in the White Paper, that urban issues have not been dealt with since they are considered subsidiary and not to be subject to the Commission's proposal, that public transport is not yet properly dealt with - and we are asking the Commission for complementary documents - that enlargement is not really taken into account in the White Paper, but if Europe wants to participate in the process of globalisation and not wait for others to implement it and, if it wants to be as viable as possible, it must have better transport."
"You have cooperated in the White Paper in this respect and Parliament wishes to follow."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank Mr Izquierdo Collado for the work he has done over a long period."
"I believe his work has allowed us to hold the sometimes passionate debates which have resulted from the White Paper."
"We are talking about promoting a transport policy, taking account of new elements, as has been said, in a clear and precise way, such as the aspect of combining sustainable development and growth, in other words, the incorporation of quality of life and the protection of the environment as factors which are also essential when it comes to drawing up our policies."
"In this regard, the almost sixty measures proposed between now and 2010 are geared towards rebalancing modes of transport, which does not mean running down road transport - let us make this very clear - or sea transport, which are the two most competitive modes of transport, but simply preventing the future deterioration of rail transport or inland waterways transport in the north of Europe, which are absolutely essential forms of transport which must play a fundamental role in absorbing the new transport demands, and this is also true of the development of sea transport."
"It is therefore a question of rebalancing modes of transport, removing bottlenecks, having a policy of safe transport - safety is an essential point when it comes to serving the users - and also tackling the globalisation which is today being experienced by many modes of transport, in particular air and sea transport."
"The analysis we have presented in the White Paper has been debated in depth, also by the industry and the sectors mostly affected."
"Also by the Council."
"In this regard, most of the measures proposed in the White Paper have been presented by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council."
"Some have made significant progress, such as Galileo, accession to Eurocontrol, the creation of air and sea safety agencies - I will talk later about road safety, which Mr Sr. Izquierdo Collado has mentioned - including initiatives on working time in the road transport sector or the recent agreement in the Council on the single European sky and the Marco Polo programme."
"With regard to the second rail package, the negotiations are at a very advanced stage and this Parliament expressed its opinion very clearly just a couple of months ago."
"However, other important proposals are still at a preparatory stage, such as the trans-European networks."
"As you know, despite the fact that this Parliament had expressed its support for the partial reform proposed by the Commission, the Council preferred to delay it and simply to go ahead with a more general revision."
"Alright. In this regard, I hope that the Van Miert Group, which is considering a global revision of the trans-European networks in view of enlargement, that is, a Europe of twenty-seven - because it includes the countries with which negotiations are either completed or at an advanced stage - will achieve a good result before the end of the Greek Presidency and that the document can therefore be presented during the Italian Presidency."
"It should therefore also be discussed by this Parliament."
"I would like to say that we are also at the final stage of the launch of the infrastructures package, which will contain three essential elements for the development of infrastructures: a methodology for charging - which Mr Izquierdo Collado mentioned a moment ago and which we discussed before the debate on the issue of ecopoints in Austria - as a preliminary stage before a directive on charging which will indicate how far the Council and this Parliament are willing to go on this issue and which lays down the forms, modes and limits."
"Secondly, a system for incentivising public-private partnerships in the creation of infrastructures."
"We need to incorporate private capital into the development of new infrastructures in order to speed up the implementation of these new infrastructures in a Europe of twenty-five - and soon of twenty-seven."
"Thirdly, a European system of electronic pricing which furthermore will be accompanied by compatibility, in other words interoperability of practical, technical systems in the different countries of the European Union, with the medium-term aim of creating uniformity, establishing a single system based on the satellite control systems, that is, the Galileo system."
"With regard to road safety, I am pleased to note that the honourable Members share the objective we have set of reducing the number of fatal road accidents by 50% by 2010."
"The Commission has just adopted a proposal for a directive on the safety of tunnels and we will shortly present a global action plan in the field of road safety."
"In this field, we will also present important proposals on the control of road transport in relation to the identification of motorway black spots."
"I hope that these new measures will contribute to achieving this objective and they must be supplemented by measures established at national and local level, because here there is a very significant margin for subsidiarity."
"In the field of maritime safety, ladies and gentlemen, we have held discussions for several years, following the tragic Erika accident, and again recently following the Prestige disaster."
"However, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission can say that we have presented a coherent package of measures which enormously increase maritime safety in the European Union, which only need to be implemented, and that the remaining measures will be presented shortly."
"Some of them have already been presented, such as the timetable for the departure of single-hull oil tankers and their replacement by double-hull oil tankers, the requirement for safer and more modern oil tankers for the transport of the more polluting hydrocarbons and we will soon present issues such as criminal responsibility in the event of serious negligence."
"We must insist on the maximum level of compensation funds in the event of pollution or in the proposals to promote with the countries of the Union modifications in the field of international maritime law, which is based on completely obsolete principles from the nineteenth century rather than the twenty-first century."
"With regard to air transport, in 2003 we will concentrate our action on external relations, including the mandates for renegotiation of open skies agreements, which is an extremely urgent matter, beginning with the agreements with the United States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have seen the proposals made by the rapporteur, in general terms, though I will discuss the different points in more detail later."
"I believe we are working in the same spirit."
"I hope that the approval of this Parliament, with the amendments it considers appropriate in a report on the White Paper, will help to speed up the measures being discussed, both in Parliament and in the Council, and that those yet to come will clarify the possibilities, the margins and the limits and will above all allow the discussion with this Parliament within this same mandate to be speeded up."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the subject for debate here is not simply a report on the transport of the future."
"This is, in fact, one of the last ways out following a generation of production and mobility that has burnt itself out."
"Who would still dare to speak of disaster-mongering or ill omens of charlatan ecologists on the environmental state of our planet, in the face of WHO studies which estimate the number of deaths caused by automobile exhaust emissions at 800 000 each year."
"There is nothing we can do now other than try to curb the existing phenomena of environmental crisis."
"What was urgent in a Union of Fifteen now becomes an imperative before a Union of Twenty-five, and any transport policy that failed to include the sustainable development aspect would be entirely ineffective."
"The threats to our lifestyle are forcing us to instigate a genuine revolution in transport culture."
"We have certainly realised this rather late, but now we are, at last, able to separate increases in transport volume from economic growth."
"Far from previous traditions, this new transport deal should include environmental requirements first and foremost in its studies, place the transport-using citizen at the heart of its definitions and liase with NGOs in all of its deliberations."
"Increasing urbanisation must go hand in hand with improving public transport."
"For each new project, opportunities for intermodal connections between networks that already exist or are planned should be prioritised."
"Furthermore, we must not oppose this new deal on transport in 2010 with financial quibbling."
"An ambitious Community research and development programme must be carried out to counter noise pollution and harmful emissions in the transport sector and achieve the objectives of the Kyoto protocol."
"In its report, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy raised the issue of the impact of these kinds of pollution on human health."
"Alarm bells are ringing everywhere, but that is no reason to simply announce that disaster is looming and cannot be averted."
"We have progressed from realisation to warnings."
"Now we must act."
"Far from giving up, Commissioner, in the face of the ecological disaster that is forecast, the Union must change direction with regard to transport and require all agreements and programmes, and heaven knows there are many of them, to comply with environmental criteria."
"Otherwise we are heading for a fall, with full knowledge of the facts."
"Mr President, this is really a debate for the initiated and we are using the twelfth language of the Community, the budget."
"Commissioner, the Copenhagen figures, as I understand it, are budget figures, while what we are discussing now, in relation to your presentation, are financial perspective figures."
"In other words, the financial perspectives - the headings - may be greater than the budgetary sums approved in Copenhagen."
"Is this correct?"
"Is that what the Commission is going to say, that we should take the Copenhagen figures as a minimum and go further, in case the needs are greater than the Council's estimates?"
"Mr President, in Copenhagen categories 1 and 2 have been negotiated and in reality the internal and external policies have more or less been calculated."
"Does this mean, following the explanations you have given, that the sums in categories 3 and 4 can be considered as indicative while the sums in categories 1 and 2 are established?"
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0010/2003)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Commission."
"Part I"
"Question No 36 by Didier Rod (H-0050/03):"
"Subject: Implications of tobacco advertising for Community competition policy"
"Following the statements to the press by representatives of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), it seems that the FIA is threatening not to allow any further Formula 1 races to take place at any track in the EU Member States because of the new European directive on tobacco advertising which the Member States are required to transpose in 2005 at the latest."
"What conclusions does the Commission draw from this as regards competition law, particularly in the light of the agreements between the Commission and the FIA?"
"From the point of view of competition law, what is the Commission's view regarding the FIA's decision to leave it to the teams to decide whether to race or refuse to take part in races at tracks in Member States because of a law banning tobacco advertising during sporting events, in the light of the case law of the Court of Justice and the positions of the European Council, Commission and Parliament on sport?"
"Question No 37 by Anna Karamanou (H-0031/03):"
"Subject: Victim of sex abuse banned from leaving the United Arab Emirates"
"According to French press reports, on 15 October 2002 the authorities of the United Arab Emirates banned Touria Tiouli, a French citizen, from leaving the country."
"The authorities of the Emirates have charged her with engaging in sexual intercourse outside marriage, which is punishable by a term of imprisonment of at least six months; this occurred after Touria Tiouli had herself lodged a complaint with the police that she had been sexually abused by three UAE nationals."
"Does the Commission intend to apply pressure on the Government of the United Arab Emirates, in parallel with the efforts made by the French Government, to have the detained woman released and the men who raped her punished, bearing in mind that the protection of women's rights and the fight against sexual violence in particular are fundamental principles of the European Union?"
"Commissioner, I am partly satisfied with your reply; however, I was hoping that the Commission would use its authority to put pressure on the United Arab Emirates."
"The good news is that the Emirates court has acquitted Mrs Tiouli of the accusations made against her by her rapists, but her troubles are not over yet because she still has to wait a fortnight from the date of the ruling."
"The ruling was returned on 26 January; unless I am mistaken, that was a fortnight ago today and we are waiting to see if her passport will be returned so that she can leave the country."
"I should like to ask you, Commissioner, if you intend to collaborate with the French Government and the French embassy in the United Arab Emirates and exercise the authority and powers you have as Commissioner of the European Union to put an end to the nightmare this French woman has been put through."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the next questioner and the next Commissioner are not now in the Chamber and I am therefore going to stop the clock for 3 or 4 minutes so that Question Time can then continue."
"Question No 38 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0054/03):"
"Subject: The MEDA Programme and women"
"In the context of Community funding for MEDA regional programmes and in the light of the conclusions of the Brussels Regional Forum held under the Belgian Presidency on 14 July 2001 on the role of women in economic development, the Commission was called upon to prepare the First Regional Programme for the participation of women in economic and social life and development."
"Since then the Commission has not presented any specific proposals within the framework of this programme."
"Can it give the reasons for such an unjustified delay?"
"Does it have any specific timetable which it intends to implement in 2003 to initiate this programme?"
"What are the principal orientations it wishes to give to this regional programme for women and what are the main needs it intends to meet?"
"We will begin the second part of this Question Time, during which Commissioner Solbes will be replying."
"Part II"
"Questions to Commissioner Solbes"
"Question No 39 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0024/03):"
"Subject: Updated stability programme for Greece (2002)"
"In its conclusions on Greece's updated stability programme for 2002 (9 January 2003), one of the points the Commission makes is that, in a period of strong growth for the Greek economy, the pace of reduction in the public debt indicator is slow."
"How does the Commission view the slow pace of reduction in public debt in Greece, despite the high rate of growth in GNP, which is mainly due to the third CSF and the Olympic games?"
"In the Commission's opinion, what will be the trend in Greek public debt after 2004, when it is probable that rates of growth in GNP will be lower?"
"The ratio of debt in Greece is one of the highest in the Community."
"It increased up until the middle of the 1990s, reaching a peak of over 110% of GDP in 1996."
"This was the result of increasing budgetary imbalances and low growth in GDP."
"The stabilisation efforts with a view to participation in Monetary Union and the improvement in the main macroeconomic indicators have contributed to reducing the ratio of debt, although at a very slow rate."
"The debt still represents 107% of GDP in 2001."
"Three factors have influenced this development: the level of primary balance, that is, excluding financial payments, the nominal rate of growth of GDP and other autonomous or residual factors."
"Notable amongst those are the financial operations which do not affect the budgetary balance but the volume of debt."
"In fact, the high rate of adjustment of the volume of debt, which reached 7.1% of GDP in 2001 - and is estimated as 4% of GDP in 2002 - meant that the evolution of the debt ratio does not entirely reflect the evolution of the budgetary situation of the public administrations, the achievement of increasingly high primary surpluses or the growth in GDP."
"Furthermore, the evolution of public debt, as laid out in the Greek stability programme in 2002, has been partially affected by the review of the statistical methods used in different financial operations."
"That review was carried out in accordance with the system established by Eurostat in order to comply with the conditions set in the ESA 95, in our European system of national accounts."
"The statistical review which was carried out in 2002 led to an increase in Greece's debt ratio in 2001, which rose to 7% of GDP higher than the figure previously estimated."
"Bearing in mind the new budgetary perspective arising from this review, the updated stability programme foresees a reduction in the debt ratio equivalent to 1.7% in 2002, forecasting an acceleration of this reduction after 2003, with a reduction of approximately 0.4% until the end of 2006."
"In fact, from 2003, the modification of the debt ratio will correspond better to the level of primary surplus."
"In accordance with the Commission's economic forecasts of last autumn, Greece's ratio of debt should decrease until the end of 2004, although at a slower rate than that forecast in the 2002 stability programme."
"For the period following 2004, when the updated stabilisation programme allows a certain decrease in real production growth, it will be necessary to apply a credible strategy of budgetary adjustment in order to be able to guarantee this reduction in the debt ratio laid down in the programme."
"In this regard, the greater transparency of the public accounts achieved as a result of their recent review has increased their credibility and also that of the strategy of budgetary adjustment, laid out in general terms in Greece's stability programme."
"My reply will be very quick."
"The strategy in the programme has clearly been drawn up without the assumption of a war in Iraq."
"The strategy naturally anticipates an increase in the primary surplus and, to put it another way, using growth potential essentially in order to reduce taxes."
"The problem of war is viewed in completely different terms."
"It is not a scenario which I believe should be tackled at this point, but it is clear that the Stability and Growth Pact itself allows for the existence of exceptional circumstances and there is no question that war is one of these."
"However, I believe it would be premature to consider at this point doing anything more in relation to this issue."
"Question No 40 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0045/03):"
"Subject: Transfer of profits from Central Bank to State Treasury"
"On 17 May 2001, the Swedish Parliament decided that the Central Bank should pay an extra SEK 20 billion to the Swedish Treasury this year in addition to its normal payment of SEK 8.2 billion from its profits, which naturally broadened the scope for reorganising the national budget."
"A similar transfer was made the previous year."
"Would this type of transfer from the Central Bank to the Treasury have been possible if Sweden had been taking part fully in the third stage of EMU at that time?"
"Questions to Commissioner Lamy"
"The issue mentioned by the honourable Member was raised in the convergence report adopted by the Commission on 22 May 2002 and also in section 6.2 of the convergence report by the European Central Bank of 2002."
"It should be observed that the comments of the Commission contained in its report stress the absence of detailed legislation on the financial transfers of the Central Bank to the Swedish Treasury, particularly in relation to the allocation of extraordinary benefits and payments."
"That legislation should establish the rules and conditions for the carrying out of such transfers and should guarantee that the Riksbank conserves the financial resources necessary to comply with its obligations within the framework of the European central banks system."
"In the absence of such rules, there is no adequate guarantee of the independence of the Central Bank and particularly its financial independence."
"It should also be observed that the relevant requirements within the framework of the Treaty appear in Article 108 - the independence of the Central Bank - and in Article 109 - the compatibility of national legislation with the Treaty. These articles apply both to the participating Member States and to the Member States with exceptions."
"I believe that I have tried to be relatively clear in my reply."
"The lack of precise rules on the way in which such transfers are carried out does not guarantee the independence of the Central Bank, a key element for participation in the Monetary Union."
"That is my comment and that is the comment included in our report."
"There is clearly time for implementation until participation in the Monetary Union, but this updating is essential for participation in it."
"The essential point is to achieve financial independence, the key element for the independence of the institution."
"Very briefly, as you know, the decisions relating to the use of resources fall to each of the national authorities."
"The Commission is obliged to verify compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact and that means monitoring decisions affecting stability programmes, or, in this case, the convergence programme."
"The problem you raise goes a step further."
"It is the problem of public finances, where revenue should be used and what type of expenditure we should carry out."
"We have obviously produced certain reports on this type of decision, but nevertheless they are not of a binding nature, but they are simply an approximation of how we believe certain decisions should be managed."
"Mr President, I wish to thank Commissioner Lamy for his answer."
"I shall convey this to the NGO Intermon-Oxfam in the terms in which the Commissioner has expressed it to Parliament."
"Question No 42 by Glenys Kinnock (H-0039/03):"
"Subject: Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)"
"Is the Commission aware that there is an ACP perception that, thus far, the EPA negotiations have an inadequate development focus?"
"What practical measures can be implemented which would be likely to convince the ACP that the objective of the negotiations is about more than just trade liberalisation?"
"Question No 44 by Richard Howitt (H-0058/03):"
"Subject: Request from Thailand and the Philippines for preferential access to the EU for their canned tuna"
"In response to requests from Thailand and the Philippines to be granted preferential access to the EU for their canned tuna, the WTO Deputy Director-General submitted recommendations in December 2002."
"If agreed and implemented by the EU, the recommendations will cause serious prejudice to the export of canned tuna of the ACP States and the Andean Pact countries."
"Does the Commission agree that the provision of any preferential access to Thailand and the Philippines will displace ACP and Andean Pact countries' imports into the EU, thereby threatening the livelihoods of poor fishermen and EU investments in the ACP States with whom the EU has concluded 16 bilateral fishing agreements to access fishing resources in their waters?"
"Can the Commission confirm that it will not accede to the recommendations of the WTO mediator, but will instead examine the whole issue in the context of the ongoing WTO Doha round where a more balanced result can be achieved to the satisfaction of all the parties?"
"Questions to Commissioner Diamantopoulou"
"First, may I say - and I imagine you will agree - that the real world exists in every country, not just Great Britain."
"It is not true that Great Britain has more temporary workers than any other country."
"It has 3.2%, compared with 4.6% in Holland, 2.5% in France and far fewer in Germany."
"This particular market, the agency work sector, is a law unto itself, but we can see from our analysis of each country that, in countries such as Holland which use exactly the same system as in the directive, not only are there no problems; the sector is becoming more and more dynamic."
"In the United States of America, it is highly profitable and attracts a great deal of investment."
"So we have a model that does not increase payment costs."
"There is no interference whatsoever on our part in workers' take-home pay; all we are doing is securing their minimum rights and we can see that, so far, this model has been a success in the two countries in Europe which have applied it."
"This legislative intervention affects a very small number of workers at present - 1.5% throughout Europe."
"However, what is important is that it introduces a framework which secures minimum workers' rights for the future development of this sector."
"Our research shows that this sector has a very poor reputation in the labour market because often the workers used do not enjoy even basic rights; they have no protection, they have no pension rights and they have no insurance rights."
"If minimum rights - no more and no less - were protected, it would become a dynamic sector."
"That is the view taken by Confederation itself."
"As I said at the beginning, the CIETT has surveyed these agencies, which believe that a broad legislative framework will give better results and enlarge the market."
"I can even quote figures to support this:"
"The most recent CIET? study concluded that, with the right legislative framework and with basic insurance for workers, these agencies could be employing 6.5 million people by 2010."
"That represents an increase of 4 million people."
"I repeat, I shall be using the assessment by the agencies themselves, not just the Commission's assessment."
"As you know Mr Bushill-Matthews, before the Commission made this particular proposal, this directive was the subject of discussion between the trades union and employers."
"Neither the trades union nor employers are happy with the present directive, because it tries to strike a balance between creating a real incentive to employ temporary workers while abiding by the basic European principles and minimum protection for workers enshrined in the Treaty."
"We have not added so much as a comma over and above the minimum protection for workers."
"You said my evidence is based on what the CIETT has said to me."
"I have not had any discussions with or received any verbal information from the CIETT; we used their study and written documents but I would be more than happy to discuss anything at all with them."
"I am open to any information they may have to give me."
"In Holland, the fact is that I have spoken to these agencies, which are developing rapidly and which, apart from a brief recession two years ago, are doing good business."
"You referred to a cost in Great Britain which, of course, I can neither corroborate nor assess at this point in time;"
"I imagine you are referring to the cost of insuring these people."
"And, of course, I cannot argue, I cannot talk about no insurance, about no pension rights or any such contributions that have to be paid."
"But apart from that, as far as payment is concerned, the directive does not interfere at all, it does not call for any sort of equivalence, except where the worker replacing the person off work has exactly the same qualifications, exactly the same seniority and exactly the same number of years' experience."
"Only then does it call for identical working conditions and this, of course, is highly complicated."
"However, I am more than willing to discuss the individual elements with any agency at all."
"Question No 46 by Lennart Sacrédeus (H-0902/02):"
"Subject: The demographic challenge, families and work"
"In Sweden, the number of people written off sick has soared in recent years and there are also signs of a disturbing trend in other Member States."
"At the same time, the birth rate in Europe is at a record low."
"Over the next 50 years, therefore, the population in Germany, Italy and France, for example, will decrease dramatically."
"An ageing population creates a strain on the economy to provide pensions and a social safety net."
"The EU summit held in Stockholm in March 2001 identified the demographic challenge as one of the Union's priorities for the future."
"What lessons can be drawn from this serious trend and what initiatives has the Commission taken to foster a more integrated view of family formation, childbirth, the demographic challenge, rising numbers of sick notes and sustainable pension schemes?"
"Meeting the demographic challenge is one of the main problems facing the countries of Europe."
"Naturally, any demographic policy has to be a combination of individual policies and economic and social incentives, most of which come under the Member States and their jurisdiction."
"I should like to comment on European added value in this sector, given that the demographic problem is a problem which besets each individual country and Europe as a whole, where the population is both ageing and falling in numbers."
"There are two parts to this problem."
"First, the population is ageing and has a longer life expectancy; that people are living longer is a good thing and is due to better living conditions and medical care, but it calls for special policies to manage this ageing population."
"In this sector, the sector of the ageing population, the European Union has important policies on public spending and on how to improve public spending and link it to health care, pensions and, of course, employment policies."
"I would remind you here that the open method of coordination on employment, on poverty and exclusion programmes and on pensions is geared towards older workers; this is one of its basic lines of approach."
"The second set of policies is designed to reinforce the family so that people can have more children, given that numerous countries have a very low birth rate."
"It includes legislation, especially legislation to support parents with young children and basically help them reconcile working and family life, policies on gender equality and women's access to the job market - remember families often have serious financial problems - and of course social policies, especially social infrastructures."
"Social infrastructures are the responsibility of the Member States, but I would remind you that, first, they receive a great deal of funding under the Community Support Framework in connection with employment and, secondly, the first specific targets were set in Barcelona a year ago, when all the Member States undertook to provide 95% of children between the age of 3 and 6 with a place in a state or private nursery by 2010."
"This will do a great deal to help families."
"It was an oversight on my part in my first speech that I omitted to mention the fact that one of the Commission's basic jobs is monitoring demographic developments and this is presented in the annual social report supported by the European Observatory on the Social Situation, Demography and Family, which funds important studies."
"This report, which maps the situation in Europe in the form of highly detailed statistics, refers to the indicators you mentioned on the number of births in each country, the number of births in each region and the ratio between immigrants and the population in each country."
"These are detailed, accurate statistics which map the situation in Europe from one year to the next."
"I am afraid, Mr Fatuzzo, that if we link the number of new jobs to the number of births, we shall be in for some very unpleasant surprises."
"All I need say is that, even if the birth rate increases significantly in Europe and even if the number of immigrants doubles, Europe's population will still not stabilise and its numbers will continue to fall."
"Consequently, the demographic problem really is a burning issue for governments; as far as the labour market is concerned, a larger population obviously also makes for a more dynamic economy."
"The example of the United States, where the population is expanding fast as immigrants integrate, is an important example."
"So it is vital for us to realise that the situation as it is today will create serious problems on the existing job market, where we look set to have a shortage of workers under 30 from 2030 onwards."
"Consequently, irrespective of how intensively we need to act on the problem of employment, and you are quite right that we need to create more and more jobs, we also need to act directly to increase the population of Europe."
"I agree that, at the moment, we urgently need to integrate workers over 55 years old into the European labour market."
"The figures are indeed worrying."
"Only 37% of people over 55 are still in work in Europe."
"Early retirement has been used as a restructuring mechanism in most countries for years now."
"It has put a large number of people out of work and of course, as the information society restructures, older workers are the first to go."
"When we analyse pension systems and their problems, we generally talk of the need to increase the retirement age."
"This is an economic approach which numerous countries need to take; at the same time, however, we cannot increase the retirement age unless there are specific policies and incentives, as you said, for these people to enter the labour market, which is why, at European level at least, one of the main priorities in our Employment Strategy and in our recent review of this strategy has been the over-55s."
"Under the Barcelona target, every country undertook to have 50% of the over-55s in work by 2010."
"Every country also undertook to include a percentage of over-55s in training and in training and lifelong learning policy; in other words, there will be incentives in the form of tax relief or subsidies to encourage these people to go back to work."
"Of course, there is the major social sector you referred to, where you do not have full employment but you offer social services with certain specific incentives."
"This is the active ageing policy we constantly support and which is included in our guidelines."
"Question No 47 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0014/03):"
"Subject: Women's access to the armed forces and sexual harassment"
"With reference to Directive 2002/73/EC"
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for this reply, which is genuinely useful, and in view of it I do not know what action we can take to urge the Minster for Defence in Spain to deal with certain serious cases of rape and sexual assault, such as that of soldier Quiñoa in the army."
"Because a year ago now the Minister promised in the Spanish Parliament to fulfil certain commitments to speed up these cases, but has not done so."
"There is a serious legal vacuum, however, because these sexual assaults are dealt with within military jurisdiction as abuses of authority and not as violations of human rights, which is what they are."
"Commissioner, what measures could we take to encourage the application of this directive?"
"I would very much like some measure to be taken in this regard."
"Perhaps a letter addressed to you which could be communicated to the Spanish Minister for Defence so that he may deal with this case of soldier Quiñoa could have an effect, because for more than two years the victim has had no posting, relegated within the armed forces, while her rapist, lieutenant Iván Moriano, is in the army, he is a persistent offender, and no measures have been taken."
"This is a serious case of sexual assault within the army which is yet to be dealt with."
"It is also a European issue, Commissioner, because I have investigated and there are other cases throughout Europe."
"Therefore, if you will allow me, I would address a letter to the Commissioner which explains this issue, Mr President, and which you could communicate to the Minister for Defence, Mr Trillo, who should deal with this serious problem."
"We cannot ask any more questions, Mr Moraes, unless you ask a supplementary question to the question by Mrs Izquierdo."
"A supplementary question."
"As the time allocated to Question Time to the Commission is at an end, Questions Nos 48 to 81 will be answered in writing"
"Mr President, I should first like to thank the rapporteur for his work and also for his efforts to reconcile diverse positions, about which we have heard today."
"I think that the White Paper gives European transport policy a great opportunity to draw the right conclusions from the ruthless analysis that it contains."
"This must not be to do nothing; we cannot hide our heads in the sand, as this might well make a transport policy meltdown inevitable."
"The analysis is harsh and cruel and, Mrs Peijs, we have to take it on board: every day there are 7 500 km of traffic jams on Europe's roads; between 1990 and 1998, CO2 emissions increased by 15%; the amount of freight transported by rail has declined in recent years from 21% to 8.5% and between 1990 and 1996 alone, ten football fields' worth of new motorways were constructed every day."
"We simply cannot go on like this and a sea change in transport policy is the only answer."
"That is why I say that the analysis in the White Paper no longer has anything to do with genuine mobility, which we want, or with a more environmentally friendly transport policy."
"That is why we need a radical rethink, above all on freight transport, where we need a move to rail and waterways."
"This is therefore about a shift to environmentally friendly modes of transport and about making sustainability our basis and our yardstick."
"Economic growth and transport growth must not be taken as givens either, because as transport politicians we actually also need to consider whether it is also possible to cut some traffic out altogether."
"In my view the White Paper tends to neglect this aspect."
"I believe that the Commission has drawn the right conclusions from this analysis and that it has initiated many good measures."
"We have made substantial progress in rail policy and we have also made progress on maritime safety, not least - unfortunately - thanks to the Erika and the Prestige."
"One further very complicated area is still missing and that is internalising external costs."
"Put into plain language, this means that not all of those who travel on the roads, by rail or on water pay the same price for what they actually use."
"That is why I hope that a serious proposal will be forthcoming from the Commission very soon - that we will then discuss in detail - so that we can guarantee that all modes of transport bear a fair cost burden, based on true and transparent costs."
"My final point, Commissioner, is one that you addressed in your speech earlier."
"Enlargement is nearly upon us and I think that we need to do all we can to avoid repeating the same mistakes or again adopting the same unfortunate transport policies that we have seen implemented in the Member States over the last 30 or 40 years."
"We must not repeat these mistakes with the new Member States."
"That is why I believe that you have a very considerable responsibility to avoid these mistakes with the new Member States and also to work with them to put in place, at an early date, a good and fair European transport policy."
"Mr President, my congratulations to Mrs de Palacio on the White Paper on transport before us in this debate."
"This is a well-produced piece of work on the part of the Commission which allows us to look as far forward as 2010."
"May I also thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, on his report."
"I think all the political groups will more or less vote the same way tomorrow on a number of points which are vital to the future of transport in the European Union."
"For me personally, our guiding principles for the immediate development of European transport are to complete the single market, promote competition, especially by liberalising transport wherever it has not yet been liberalised, ensure all forms of transport are safe and prioritise environmental protection."
"I should like to qualify these principles by making a few comments on some of the individual issues."
"First of all, the debate on trans-European networks must at some point stop being a debate and must be fleshed out, by which I mean that the trans-European networks will need to be promoted in practice and this will require political will on the part of the Member States on the one hand and both national and Community funding on the other."
"We therefore need to increase funding under the Community budget specifically for trans-European networks."
"Secondly, we need to open up the railway market."
"The Council needs to push the second railways package through as quickly as possible on the basis of Parliament's proposals, so that the European Union has something to show for itself in the railway sector."
"Thirdly, we need to strengthen short sea shipping."
"This is vital, especially in certain areas of the European Union, and of course helps to protect the environment."
"Fourthly, our debate must include the special role which outlying regions of the European Union and island regions need to play if there is to be a balanced development of transport networks within the Union."
"Fifthly, road safety."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is not united on this issue."
"I personally am in favour of a road safety agency, given that 40 000 people are killed on the roads of Europe every year and I think that, while respecting subsidiarity, we need to do something at European level."
"Finally, two brief comments on measures to promote safety at sea and charging for infrastructures."
"We need to look at this issue but we need to be very careful because it is a rather delicate issue and, although the Commission needs to act, it needs to take careful stock before it makes any proposals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, for a report prepared so well and thoroughly."
"The rapporteur has introduced notable improvements to the Commission proposal."
"The major objectives are the relief of congestion, the creation of hubs, improved safety and the promotion of sustainable transport."
"These are targeted primarily at the Union's central regions."
"I would like to remind everyone of the transport needs in outlying and remote districts and regions, and geographically problematic areas."
"Good and viable transport links are vital for these areas, which have thin traffic flows."
"These needs are virtually ignored in the Commission White Paper."
"Account has to be taken of the special needs of sparsely populated island and mountain areas in any development of a common transport policy."
"Good transport links will ensure that the whole of the area of the Union remains within the scope of a functional single market and that all Union resources are spent."
"I would like to mention one final detail."
"A harsh winter has exposed a new type of safety risk in sea transportation."
"Consignments of oil in the Baltic Sea from Russia's new oil port have increased in number."
"At the same time the risk of oil disasters in exceptionally icy conditions in winter has grown."
"The EU, like the International Maritime Organisation, has no agreement regarding how fit a ship carrying oil is to travel through ice."
"This breach in safety arrangements should be swiftly put right."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo, on his excellent work."
"Secondly, I would like to apologise to the Commissioner, because this is the first time in this legislature that this Member will refer expressly to his region, Andalusia."
"Andalusia - as you know - is one of the most extensive territories of the European Union, with almost 8 million inhabitants and in 2002 it received 21 million visitors who generated EUR 13 200 million."
"As you know, it is one of the Union's Objective 1 regions, with one of the lowest levels of income, but it survives thanks to agriculture and tourism."
"The report itself talks of the substantial impact of transport on European tourism and the need to create north-south corridors in order to facilitate the free trade area between Europe and the Mediterranean, as well as the development of the outermost regions."
"Well, what do you make, ladies and gentlemen, of the fact that Algeciras, which is the European Union's largest Mediterranean container port, has just one connection, by rail, with the interior, which follows a route which is more than a century old and which allows an average of no greater than 17 km/h?"
"Did you know that the only Mediterranean coastal area in the whole of the European Union which does not have a motorway is between the provinces of Malaga and Almeria?"
"Well, between them is located the province of Granada, which has the lowest income in Spain and in Europe."
"If infrastructures do not get there, how are we going to develop?"
"These are examples of the infrastructure deficit of the peripheral regions of the Union."
"While the different Community policies allow these bottlenecks, there is little or nothing we can do to create cohesive transport and intermodality from social and environmental points of view."
"I am glad that this report has not forgotten users of two-wheeled vehicles, who are extremely important in terms of individual transport and its sustainability in cities, which, thanks to them, are more human places to be."
"We must continue to work to increase safety standards in transport and its infrastructures, pinpointing black spots and protecting them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if only for money, let us work, let us invest more in safety."
"One death costs us EUR 1 million and we have 40 000 deaths a year on the roads."
"The report does not mention non-transport."
"We must work on an innovative aspect, which is the pedestrianisation of the cities."
"Mr President, Mr Izquierdo Collado is quite right to recall the obligation of transport policy to contribute to balanced development and to economic and social cohesion."
"In fact, when thinking about and outlining a transport policy it must be realised that this is a sector of strategic importance and a service of public interest that must serve basic objectives."
"No less importantly, account must be taken of people's right to mobility that is safe, affordable and of high quality."
"Giving priority to modes of transport that are compatible with the environment also warrants our agreement although we must immediately highlight the contradiction between this statement of principle and the way in which the report favours roads."
"Nevertheless, I also wish to state that on some fundamental aspects, we are moving far away from the Commission White Paper and also from the report by Mr Izquierdo Collado because the report does not distance itself sufficiently from the White Paper on these aspects."
"In particular, we do not agree with and even reject the leap forwards represented by the constant support for liberalisation, for opening up the markets in the transport sector, as if this were a panacea that could resolve all the difficult situations that have been building up over the years and which have led to the subordination of public transport to private transport and to the degradation of that service."
"To date no study has been produced and no one has been able to prove that opening up transport to competition can resolve the sector's problems."
"On the contrary, where liberalisation has taken place, the results prove that exactly the opposite is true."
"This is why we have these railway and aviation accidents, which are basically caused by the lack of investment in equipment and in safety, or because of redundancies and the deterioration of employees' social conditions."
"Furthermore, the idea that guaranteeing the existence of various operators of these lines or routes leads to an initial situation of apparent openness systematically ends up creating real monopolies."
"The current discussion with regard to the air transport sector is enlightening on this matter."
"Finally, I do not think it is acceptable, in the aim of ensuring high-quality and safe transport, for States only to have infra-structures in which they have to invest heavily and that the same States still subsidise - using money from the public purse - companies that will provide services and that these ultimately collect the profits from operating these services."
"This is certainly a profitable business for these companies."
"The same is not true, however, for public operators."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, please allow me firstly to pay tribute to a person connected to the world of transport, the head of local police recently murdered by the terrorist group ETA."
"Secondly, and turning more specifically to the report, I would like to make a series of comments."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and Karla Peijs, our shadow rapporteur, since she has made enormous contributions to this document."
"I will move on to the issues in the report."
"Firstly, there is concern amongst a series of delegations, a series of groups, because we believe the report does not reflect, or reflects very little, the situation of certain countries whose infrastructures have not yet been established, as opposed to other countries in which infrastructures, investments in infrastructures, essentially roads, are completely finished and which only need to be improved."
"That is one of our group's concerns."
"Secondly, I would like to express our support for the creation of a road safety agency."
"The number of fatal accidents currently occurring on European Roads requires not just a message but an effective and active European policy, and we believe that the road safety agency can be a good instrument."
"Finally, we also support the creation of the transport fund, with objectives and considerations other than the trans-European networks and the Structural Funds in the field of transport."
"We will support these two ideas which we consider to be positive."
"Mr President, Mrs de Palacio, it is gratifying that the Commission is addressing Europe's transport problems seriously."
"Reducing deaths on the road by 50% is in particular an aim that deserves all our support."
"There is no good reason why anyone at all should die on the roads."
"Congestion in Central Europe is also a big problem, while in the peripheral regions the worry is safeguarding links with the European markets."
"As well as the many good proposals, the White Paper unfortunately contains seriously mistaken evaluations."
"The Commission wants to break the link between economic growth and transport growth."
"That will not be possible, although we can certainly bring economic growth to a halt."
"By easing transport problems we can, without anxiety, allow traffic to increase."
"New vehicles will produce up to 90% fewer emissions than those manufactured before 1970."
"This is not realised if you only take a blinkered view of the matter."
"By abolishing all car registration taxes in Europe and lowering car tax for clean cars we will be able to improve the state of the environment radically."
"Another odd proposal is that of freezing the share of the market enjoyed by the different transport modes at 1998 levels."
"This is something we might expect from the old Soviet Union's Politburo, but it weakens the Commission's authority very much indeed."
"It would be nonsensical to set out to forcibly steer the market share balance in the direction of targets that have been decided in an ivory tower."
"We should instead create an equitable situation for competition for all modes of transport."
"Let the market itself then decide the natural balance for transport modes."
"The third error relates to the harmonisation of labour and social legislation."
"Only when it is a question of transport safety is the harmonisation of maximum transportation times appropriate, and then it will be on the condition that the costs and benefits have been closely looked at."
"If we make these three mistakes we will be further than ever away from a dynamic Europe."
"The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the result of its own impossible situation, but our splendid European project deserves better."
"Our rigid economy is in need of care, and our self-inflicted sickness is actually not just an imaginary one."
"Unfortunately, the Commissioner's medicine seems as if, dare I say so, it had been bought in a bazaar."
"Would it not be about time we stopped talking about the European model and sought recipes for success among those who are getting along best?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for attending this debate."
"Behind each of the speeches there is what I believe to be a fundamental concept."
"This fundamental concept is the single European transport area, a European area of transport which is not only compatible with European asymmetry but which must actually incorporate it."
"Europe is not equal - as Mr Sudre has just said - Europe has certain areas of infrastructure, certain peripheral regions, certain areas of cohesion, certain nuclei - more now, with enlargement - which require extremely considerable promotion, but this is not incompatible with the single European transport area."
"A few months ago, Commissioner, this House and the Council approved the sixth framework research programme."
"This programme established the single European area of research."
"The Commissioner said to European researchers: we have passed the stage of you meeting to tell each other what you are doing and even to cooperate on friendly terms."
"It is necessary to create a single European area of research so that all research capacity and effort is focussed on the same projects, has the same objectives and the same territory so that we are not therefore inventing the wheel fifteen times."
"Therefore, the European research area is the key to understanding all the speeches which this afternoon may have sounded like a rainbow of views which would be difficult to unite."
"But I can assure you that the vote tomorrow will not produce a blurred picture, as may be assumed on the basis of tonight's debate, but a clearly defined one."
"You are fortunate, Commissioner, since this Parliament is saying: go ahead, you have the support of Parliament to formulate into directives the issues you have presented to us in the report on the White Paper, and you have certain additional contributions from the European Parliament which may be useful."
"Many doors are therefore being opened, and the Council cannot turn a deaf ear to the fundamental demands and the appeal represented by the Transport White Paper that the time has come to take decisions, to create a genuinely European policy, because, in view of this European policy, the effect will be a synergy which will respond to the reticence of those who say that the European Safety Agency will cost money, that the European Transport Fund will not be well used, of those who do not believe that intermodality in one port will benefit the whole of Europe, that investments and corridors, in any area, will benefit around 400 million Europeans once the Union has been enlarged."
"Therefore, Commissioner, although there is apparently a rainbow of diversity in this House, I can guarantee that we are very close together."
"I will end by thanking all the Members who have participated in this report, because they have offered me many ideas and entirely constructive cooperation."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo, for the work he has done, all the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the quality of the report as a whole, and the various speakers who have spoken on behalf of the different committees during this debate."
"I would also like to thank all the Members who have spoken, including those who were highly critical, because I believe they provide colour and variety and above all they communicate feelings and opinions which must be taken into account when we talk about offering solutions in an area which, as Mr Izquierdo said, is so large and diverse and at times so asymmetric as the European area."
"I would like to point out that I agree with the honourable Members, and this is clearly spelt out in Mr Izquierdo's report - which I consider to be very balanced - that we are talking about sustainable transport and this requires, to begin with, a competitive transport system."
"If we do not create a competitive transport system in Europe, the whole of our industrial fabric, the whole of our productive sector, will suffer."
"We must therefore create competitive transport, but at the same time we must take account of society's demands, which are linked to quality of life and respect for the environment."
"And this is the not always an easy task we must respond to through our proposals."
"I have taken good note of the clear support offered by Mr Izquierdo and Parliament's proposed report."
"You have taken your time, but, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is not moving any more quickly - let me make this very clear - in expressing its support for modal change, for the opening up of the railways, for the creation of the single sky, for the launch of the Galileo programme, on which it is really urgent that decisions and actions are taken."
"Like us, your priorities include safety and the need to respond to the investment needs of the trans-European networks, in particular through charging, where necessary, for the use of infrastructures."
"I am also glad that the report insists on the aspects relating to connection with outermost regions, on the economic importance of roads, on the need to reduce traffic - when I talk about the outermost regions I am talking about islands situated several thousand kilometres from continental Europe."
"I believe that all these points are very interesting and worthy of our attention and they deserve to be highlighted in this report."
"However, I would like to make a few comments with regard to the important points which have been raised here and in the report."
"Firstly, the road safety agency."
"I fully understand this idea, because it stems from the need to create means of promoting responsibility at all levels to react against the lack of safety on the roads while respecting the principle of subsidiarity and the Commission's right of initiative."
"I believe we should consider the steps to be taken in order to achieve this objective."
"I hope to be able to provide more detail in the communication on road safety which I will present to you in the near future, but there is little difference between an observatory and an agency."
"At the end of the day, they are the same idea."
"I would like - in relation the text we are discussing - to make a few comments on competitiveness, respect for the environment and the incorporation of quality of services, safety and quality of life."
"Paragraph 9 states that the transfer of goods transport by road to other modes of transport should be promoted by improving the quality of service of these other modes of transport which are more respectful and under no circumstances having a negative impact on the competitiveness of road transport."
"I believe that this sentence is fundamental."
"Europe cannot afford to make road transport less competitive, since it forms the basis of its economic development, its growth and its international competitiveness."
"It is a question of making, for example, the railways as competitive as road transport."
"To those who entirely reject the liberalisation of the railways - who are a minority in this Parliament - or the introduction of competition - we are talking more of introducing competition than liberalisation, since this is a highly regulated form of liberalisation - I would say that we know what maintaining the current situation would lead to: to our having railways in museums but not in reality."
"I believe we should try to take other routes which have provided good results in other sectors of transport, but I would like to stress this phrase: it is not a question of penalising but of improving the quality of other systems."
"The honourable Members also propose the creation of great axes (east-west, north-south) of roads and railways, as laid out in paragraph 36 and others."
"I would like to point out that it is a question of incorporating enlargement in terms of the trans-European networks and of exchanges and of this European area in which it is transport that guarantees the reality of a market and the capacity for goods and people to move around throughout this European area."
"We must insist on strengthening the railways."
"This is a fundamental point and we cannot ignore it."
"Paragraph 36 and others refer to this aspect."
"I am aware that it also involves promoting inland waterways, the maritime sector, but in some cases we cannot avoid building new roads because there are areas which still lack road infrastructures."
"We must therefore not be dogmatic, but we must have a practical appreciation of the reality of European transport needs."
"With regard to the great Fund for financing transport, of course I fully agree with Mr Izquierdo Collado that we need greater European funds in order to provide the support and promotion for the creation of infrastructures, in particular rail infrastructures, and for curing bottle necks in order to improve the use of European infrastructures."
"Can it be approached in the way Mr Izquierdo Collado proposes?"
"I believe, rather, that what we have to do is, within the context of the new financial perspectives whose principle elements will be discussed shortly, raise the need to channel more funds to the trans-European networks."
"I believe it is there that we must seek these greater funds, these greater resources, because what is clear is that we need to speed up the process of creating infrastructures."
"The funds currently allocated to the trans-European networks are insufficient and we must make progress in this field, because these networks are of benefit and interest to Europe as a whole, regardless of the specific countries they link or cross."
"They are of interest at European level because they promote - I would insist - the creation of the internal markets and the integration of the European area itself."
"This issue of the EIB: other formulae to bring us closer, of course, and we must also promote public-private participation in funding."
"I will shortly present all these issues in that infrastructures package, including charging."
"Mr Costa has mentioned this, but I would like to say that charging is discussed in paragraphs 75 and 76 which speak of the simultaneous introduction of a system for setting prices in all modes of transport, both for infrastructures and for the related external costs, and which say that under no circumstances must anybody be penalised but that we must promote a balance and allow cross funding."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree with this approach, with one exception, and that is that cross funding must be restricted to exceptional cases in alternative routes and under no circumstances must cross funding or tolls or charging become a form of generating income from the geographical situation of a country within the European area."
"Otherwise we would be returning to medieval times, when, for example, controlling a bridge over a river provided sufficient income to live in luxury and become a member of the gentry."
"That is what we must do, establish charging which covers costs, which is destined for infrastructures, the improvement of infrastructures, improvements in road safety, the improvement of the locations where they are collected, and that in certain cases cross funding may be allowed, since it is clearly a good instrument and has led to good results, as for example in the case of the Swiss system."
"Before 2004, the Commission will draw up a communication on the transport situation in the candidate countries."
"We do not believe that a specific communication is necessary in 2003 because we are going to produce two reports."
"Firstly, a complete follow-up report, six months prior to the date of accession, that is, more or less in November 2003, which will examine the degree of preparedness of the candidate countries in all sectors, including transport, and a communication in 2003 on cooperation with the candidate countries and neighbouring countries in the field of trans-European transport networks."
"All of this in addition to the report by the van Miert group, which draws up the networks within the context of twenty-seven countries: the pan-European network."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the mid-term assessment report in 2005, laid down in the White Paper, will be the perfect opportunity to deal with these concerns and integrate all this information."
"Mr President, I will end this long and extremely important debate by once again thanking Mr Izquierdo Collado for this work, which has been serious, balanced and difficult, since it is not easy to unite positions."
"In the end, I hope that tomorrow, following what I have heard throughout today's debates, it is clearly established that the key guidelines for transport policy in the European Union for the next ten years is fully reflected in the vote in Parliament."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would in fact like to thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent levels of cooperation."
"We are now giving the Council a clear message, and, hopefully, an impetus no longer to dally in this area."
"I would like to speak more about the report drawn up by my colleague, Mr Van Velzen."
"It is a very important start and represents a crucial change in the development of the information society."
"It is perhaps a good idea to have confidence in the words he spoke, which were truly appropriate."
"The information society sector is a major employer and a factor which unites us all in Europe as a whole in a completely new way."
"Its development will bring with it significant economic, political and cultural opportunities."
"Confidence in the sector, however, has plummeted and we know the reason why, as we have spoken about it so many times."
"It is the result of auctions and general uncertainty."
"Although digitalisation and networking offer a wide variety of opportunities for development, they have also led to a worldwide gulf between the people of prosperous countries and developing countries."
"Furthermore, the gender divide, for example with regard to students, is huge and is particularly pronounced in the rural areas of the Union and in the developing countries."
"In addition the introduction of information technology has led to the restructuring of job descriptions: many jobs have gone and some middle-aged people have had to give up work."
"Furthermore, those groups which are in a weaker position are at risk of becoming doubly discriminated against."
"They are being left outside the information society."
"I do not see any easy alternatives here: it is our biggest challenge."
"The network has also become a political implement."
"It increases opportunities for civil action and hopefully also opportunities for influence."
"I am pleased with the Commission's eEurope 2005 Action Plan, as with it we will increase investment, aim to create jobs, and give everyone the opportunity to participate in the information society."
"I also urge the Commission to speed up the introduction of third generation mobile communications and eliminate the technical and administrative barriers there are in the sector."
"The Member States themselves should adhere to a flexible approach to the purchase of frequencies and the costs incurred in creating the necessary infrastructure, and do so speedily in a new way."
"The Member States should offer their citizens sufficient Internet time, which is to say participation in the information society."
"The Commission should research the possibilities of developing voice-controlled services."
"These will shortly be available and will make it easier for all of us to use the Internet."
"I would also ask the Commission to investigate the possibilities of adult education in the sector and whether a general diploma might also be required to move on to the next stages of the technology."
"Likewise, Member States should support SMEs and help them get online, as they represent major potential for increased employment."
"Perhaps there would be a need too for funds to be established in the Member States to help socially excluded groups to become integrated into the networked society."
"In my opinion it is good that the Commission has now established a cybersecurity task force."
"It is now three years since the Lisbon strategy was created and it has met with political and economic uncertainty."
"We are seeing developments, but they are not fast enough or adequately coordinated."
"In the last six years we have seen around a million new jobs created a year, although last year the figure was only around half a million."
"What sort of economic know-how can be achieved when training, education and research are neglected as much as they are today and many Member States do not observe agreed rules or implement agreed projects?"
"Commissioner, what could you do so that certain Member States do not slow down development in this sector?"
"It might turn out that a number of Member States will establish their own sort of 'Information Society Europe' among themselves unless we involve all Member States in this development."
"Finally I would say that the transference of social information and knowledge to the network in digitised form, which Mr Van Velzen's report highlighted, will create a completely new stage in the development of the information society."
"It will create work and opportunities, but problems too."
"The protection of privacy is not the least of these, but when society's functions are online we will be in a situation where we can say that the information society has come about insofar as we are all in it together."
". Mr President, I am happy to see everyone with an interest in this field here tonight."
"I dream of a day when we can discuss this issue in the daytime - it may come."
"Information and communication technologies are a powerful source of growth and productivity gains, which contribute to improving our living standards."
"That is why the recovery of the sector is so important at this point in time."
"The five reports which the House will deal with today and tomorrow give us the opportunity to keep the political momentum towards the achievement of the Lisbon agenda, as many honourable Members have said today."
"These reports also contribute to the process of building confidence in the ICT sector."
"Allow me first of all to thank all the rapporteurs, Mr Van Velzen, Mrs Auroi, Mr Paasilinna, Mr Khanbhai and Mrs Read, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and political groups for their thorough work on these Commission communications and proposals."
"I am also pleased to have the opportunity to inform you that the Commission adopted four important documents today."
"These are: a communication on the situation in the telecoms sector; a draft regulation establishing a European Network and Information Security Agency, as has been mentioned here; the final report on eEurope 2002 and the Recommendation on Relevant Markets."
"I hope you find them in your computers when you return to your offices."
"Let me reiterate our common commitment to an efficient and timely implementation of the new regulatory framework."
"The framework will stimulate investment and thus promote facility-based competition, which is, in the medium to long-term, the best guarantee for sustained consumer benefits, innovation, and investment."
"With the recommendation on relevant markets we aim to give legal certainty and to help restore confidence to the sector."
"Let me come back to the themes of tonight and say a few words first on the report on 3G."
"Mrs Auroi's report, as adopted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, sends an important signal at a time when the first 3G services are about to be launched."
"At this juncture, 3G deployment is clearly a priority."
"We need to encourage solutions which favour a quick deployment of networks while also accommodating environmental needs."
"In today's communication on the situation in the telecoms sector, the Commission calls for a series of actions to overcome barriers to 3G deployment."
"Amongst these is the clarification of network infrastructure sharing, the importance of which was also emphasised in the report."
"Information to the citizens on the health aspects related to mobile communications and continued research are important."
"Scientific findings need to be made broadly available."
"The Commission will promote the diffusion of information, for example through a specific web site."
"The World Health Organisation is the leading authority in this area, and we are working closely with it."
"Finally, I would like to stress the importance of 3G in the context of access to open and interoperable platforms."
"This is to increase consumers' choice and thus to contribute to the establishment of an information society for all."
"Inclusiveness is an overriding principle in eEurope 2005."
"The Commission is committed to pursuing action toward openness and interoperability of platforms, as so clearly requested by Parliament."
"Let me briefly reiterate the main objectives of the eEurope 2005 action plan. eEurope sets out to stimulate the demand-supply cycle by, on the demand side, promoting content, services and applications, where there is a crucial role for online public services - eGovernment, eHealth and eLearning - as well as for eBusiness."
"This will stimulate and is stimulated by the supply side, by enabling the widespread availability and use of multi-platform and secure broadband."
"It is vital to ensure an inclusive information society."
"Therefore we are promoting multi-platform access which includes digital television, 3G mobile, PCs, kiosks and whatever terminals are available."
"I am pleased to see that Mr Paasilinna's report gives such strong support to the main ideas of the eEurope Action Plan."
"We fully share the view that guaranteeing broadband connections at an affordable price, which is essential for a competitive and dynamic economy, requires decisive actions from Member State governments."
"Mr Paasilinna asked how we could accelerate access for the Member States."
"We continue to carry out rigorous reporting and benchmarking of the activities."
"At the same time, we have launched two presentations of European best practice in eGovernment and eHealth."
"We will nominate these best practices and ensure they are widely diffused among the public authorities in all Member States."
"In our recently adopted communication on the situation in the telecoms sector we call upon Member States to commit to putting their national broadband strategy in place by the end of this year."
"As Mr Khanbhai's report on the impact of eEconomy notes, SMEs are key drivers of economic growth and should be encouraged actively to engage in the eEconomy."
"I broadly share the views presented in Mr Khanbhai's report, for example, the need for SMEs to have easy access to legal advice on applicable law and on ICT and eBusiness skills."
"We agree that European businesses, and especially SMEs, need support in 'going digital'."
"The Commission is currently working together with the Member States to set a new policy framework for eBusiness policies for SMEs, including potential quantitative targets."
"Network security has become a major policy concern and therefore a central issue in the eEurope 2005 action plan."
"Parliament's position on this matter of October last year was very much appreciated."
"As I mentioned earlier, the Commission today adopted a draft regulation on the Agency."
"The Commission is also committed, through eEurope 2005, to promote a wider access to and greater participation in the benefits of the information society, particularly for disadvantaged groups."
"In addition to the specific measures foreseen by the MODINIS programme itself, the Commission intends to promote and sustain several initiatives which will be organised in the context of the European Year for Disabled and which will follow from its earlier communication on website accessibility."
"eEurope 2005 will be implemented in part through MODINIS and, though it is not part of our debate today, I would like also to thank Parliament for the support given to the Commission proposal, in particular as far as the budget is concerned."
"Let me now turn to the piece of legislation which we now have on the table: the directive on the re-use of public sector information."
"As Mr Van Velzen said today and as he underlines in his report, the content is essential for further development of the information society."
"The message here is clear and it comes at a time when the financial constraints in the sector bring attention to the fact that public sector information is a key content resource throughout information society services."
"The key elements are transparency of procedures and of conditions for re-use, non-discrimination and fair competition."
"The directive will stimulate the creation of information services based upon, or incorporating, public sector information."
"It is important for the content industries and also for the telecoms sector, which needs to find ways to generate content for 3G services."
"I fully share the opinion of Mr Van Velzen that the operators should work together to create a marketplace."
"We need cooperation and interoperability to create a market which can convince the consumers."
"Mr President, I wish to thank all the Members for this important debate and for their contribution to the whole process since we started work on the telecoms framework."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight that the amendments presented by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms have been accepted by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and, in particular, the demand in Articles 41 and 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights for good administration and access to the texts of the institutions (this corresponds to Amendment No 1 of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms)."
"The promotion of free computer programs is an option increasingly used by public administrations and which democratises access to and the use of public documents and data."
"In fact, if we make the documents available in a format not linked to the use of specific computer programs involving payment, we reduce the discrimination relating to the wealth of the users."
"It is important to promote the use of the information by people with diminished sensory capacity, for example through a textual description of the graphs and pictures contained in the documents."
"Furthermore, the advertising of all generally accessible documents, including those relating to judicial and administrative procedures, must reach the public sector."
"This is a fundamental instrument for the development of the right of citizens to knowledge and a fundamental principle of democracy."
"This objective is applicable to institutions at all levels, local, national and international, and furthermore it is necessary for the public administrations, whatever their institutional level, to promote and support the reuse of the information provided."
"I would end by stressing that we naturally believe that all these principles should also apply to the European institutions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, first I shall look for and I intend to find those responsible for the third generation mobile communications recession."
"The guilty parties are the governments of those countries that organised radio spectrum auctions and transferred the money companies in the sector had invested to themselves."
"The action taken by the public authorities to alleviate this slump in investment has not been sufficiently effective."
"Authorisation has been granted for installations of equipment to coexist side by side for common use, but that is all."
"Consequently, the slump in investment in third generation mobile communications continues, and the pious hopes for the ambitious targets set in Feira, Lisbon, Barcelona and Seville are not realised."
"More realistic targets should be set."
"Now I have made my protests I would like to say thank you."
"Mr Paasilinna's report has focused attention on an information society for all, and on the important reason for the Action Plan: the information society must be brought within the reach of everyone, and I mean everyone."
"That is democracy."
"This democracy must be promoted through public investment."
"In addition to the technical tools and fast connections we have to give attention to user instructions and guidance, because equipment is no use if the information society actors cannot use it."
"I would like to remind Mr Van Velzen of something in the explanatory statement of his report, which mentions that for the work of public institutions to continue it is essential that they can also calculate a charge for information provided, to offset the investment needed to produce certain databases."
"Basic information services must be free of charge or at least inexpensive, but historical investment must also be taken into account in the production costs involved in the re-use of, for example, land register, museum, university and research institute databases."
"Our group supports the amendment tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which takes this matter into consideration, and we hope than Mr Van Velzen can show his support for preserving general use services with user charges without them having to be financed out of taxes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as I have already observed on other occasions, issues involving the information society must be at the forefront of the concerns and the actions of the European Union and the Community bodies."
"This is one of the great issues of the future and one that offers the greatest opportunities, multiplied by our common efforts."
"It is not by chance that following the action plan eEurope 2002, we are already looking towards eEurope 2005, specifically in order to fulfil the Lisbon and Feira European Councils, held under the presidency of my country and later on, those of Barcelona and Seville."
"What we want, it should be remembered, is to make the European Union the most competitive society in the world and it is also for this reason that the action plan eEurope 2005 was drawn up, with the purpose of providing an environment that favours private investment and job creation, of boosting productivity, modernising public services and giving everyone the opportunity to participate in the global information society."
"In this joint debate, I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Paasilinna on his magnificent work, which is clearly reflected in the consensus with which this report has been received here in plenary."
"In particular I appreciated his approach to providing the technical means necessary to implement these aims, for example extending bandwidth and multichannel distribution, and on the delicate problem of security of information."
"Moving onto the issue of the re-use and commercial exploitation of public sector documents, I understand and share the vision proposed by Mr Van Velzen, who recommends a broadly streamlining approach."
"I also think that everything concerned with basic information, related to the democratic rule of law, must be available free of charge and the remaining information should be available at a marginal cost that would not exceed the aggregate costs of their reproduction and dissemination, without prejudice to the specific system to be defined by the public cultural sector for obvious reasons of intellectual and artistic copyright."
"To conclude, I should like to refer briefly to the report by Mr Khanbhai, in order to congratulate him too on his work and to express the wish that the Commission enjoys full success in the actions it is recommending to ensure that EU businesses can harness the potential benefits of the eEconomy."
"Speeding up the construction of a clear and predictable framework for ecommerce, promoting the full participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the economy, improving the availability of venture capital and market finance, etc., are several actions intended to make the aim of an information society for all a reality and to ensure that in this crucial field too, the ambitious aims of the Lisbon strategy are pursued and achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when speaking of the information society we should remember that a large-scale reform of communications market law has just been undertaken with new legislative norms being created for the telecommunications and other network business."
"The Member States are just now putting the package into effect."
"This debate cannot be allowed to distort the picture of telecommunications legislation, which would only cause uncertainty for investment in third generation mobile communications."
"We must help the troubled third generation mobile communications business, not restrain it."
"The GSM communications business, which has grown considerably in five years, is the cornerstone of our competitiveness and virtually the only thing driving the Lisbon strategy along."
"Following the disaster over the financial exploitation of third generation mobile communications we have to show we are jointly responsible."
"The mobile phone industry is a major employer representing the cutting edge of innovation."
"There has to be a new upswing in the sector; otherwise, the Japanese will leave us behind once and for all."
"I made a point of investigating the claim regarding an increase in brain cancers in Finland since the 1990s."
"Whilst the base station network has grown phenomenally, the figures for cancer in Finland have fallen radically."
"It is hard to sell dull facts to the public."
"In the EU we have prescribed exact limits for radiation which are lower than WHO standards."
"There is more radiation from microwave ovens than there is from base stations."
"The values for Spanish operators are as little as one two-hundredth of the safe limit values."
"However, it is easier to claim that mobile phones melt our brains."
"Public documents must be made available in electronic form."
"Basic information must be free of charge."
"An authority may make a charge to cover its costs, but it is unnecessary to ask for additional payment."
"The Member States must be responsible for seeing to it that the public institutions have sufficient resources available to them."
"Finally, I would like to express my sincerest thanks to the rapporteurs."
"Mr President, there is no need to insist on the importance today of the information society for everybody, both for the public sector and for companies and citizens."
"I will focus on just two of the reports under discussion today."
"With regard to the Commission's initiative on the reuse of public sector documents, there are more and more companies in Europe who make use of information from the public sector and who reuse it."
"We must guarantee that the conditions for access to this information are the same throughout Europe."
"The price for this information must be proportional - without question - to the cost of production, but on the other hand we cannot oblige the administration - as the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has said - to produce all that information if it is not relevant or necessary."
"With regard to the Council's proposed decision on the monitoring of eEurope and the dissemination of good practices and security on the networks, I would like to highlight two aspects."
"The Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which produced the opinion for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, which produced the main report, has also stated that it is necessary not just to promote all exchanges of good practices between public and private professionals, but that the Commission should also fund information and awareness campaigns on the issue of the security of networks."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative today to present a single system for security of the networks."
"It is clear that our work and our economies are increasingly based on the information society and it is therefore important to reduce the risk of insecurity on networks."
"We must guarantee both safe access and the protection of the privacy of the data of those who access the public sector and the networks in general."
"In order to promote an electronic economy in the field of enterprises, it is also essential to promote a culture based on the entrepreneurial spirit and to stimulate greater participation by companies in the information society."
"While in Lisbon, as other Members have said, the strategic objective was set on turning the knowledge-based economy into the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world, the objective of the information society is undoubtedly an important and essential driving force."
"Mr President, it has been a broad and very interesting debate."
"I would like to thank Mr Van Velzen for his work on public sector information."
"We all very much agree that quality is one of the essential factors for the development of the new information society services and particularly 3G services."
"I would prefer to submit the Commission position on the amendments in writing because the safety at work directive starts with the limits on our working hours!"
"That is a very wise decision."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, Wednesday, at 12 noon."
"I congratulate Mrs Terrón i Cusí on her work."
"The Commission's proposal for a directive on the entry and residence of third-country nationals again places the emphasis on legal or illegal immigration and raises the issue of employment as a prior sine qua non condition for granting stable status."
"I welcome the improvements contributed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to the proposal for a directive, but I would also like to stress that the rapporteur has shown great lucidity and has dealt with the issue without demagoguery."
"There are some interesting proposals and advances, in particular increased transparency, a simplification of the procedures and taking more account of the interests of third countries."
"In general the rapporteur moves in the direction of improving the rights of holders of residence and work permits and stresses the need for all foreigners to be given equal access to education, training and housing assistance."
"I regret that these proposals have not been backed up with real figures and that the report has not placed more emphasis on access to citizenship."
"We must all work to guarantee the principle of free movement, to increase the opportunities for workers to find work and enrich their professional experience and to promote mobility with a view to creating a closer union between peoples."
"(Written statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Preparation for the 2003 Spring summit (Brussels, 21-22 March 2003)"
"I should like to take the opportunity to welcome to the diplomatic tribune this morning the chairman and his deputies of the delegation of the Russian National Assembly to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee who are here for a Bureau meeting."
"I welcome Mr Vladimir Lukin and his colleagues."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, we have of course listened with enormous interest to the speech by the President-in-Office of the Council, and, if I may summarise, it was concerned with two issues. Firstly, how to restore confidence in the Lisbon strategy and how to improve the efficiency of its implementation."
"Mr President, that is at the very heart of the matter."
"I also think that now is a good time to make this analysis, because the realisation of the Lisbon objectives is under very great strain."
"In addition, the circumstances have become much more difficult, the economic climate is unfavourable, uncertainties have increased and, as the President of the Commission rightly says, entrepreneurship is extraordinarily difficult at this time."
"My group therefore welcomes the evaluation report from the Commission."
"The report offers insight into the achievements of the Member States over the last couple of years with regard to implementing the Lisbon objectives."
"I must say, however, that the picture is disconcerting."
"We see extraordinarily sluggish implementation by the Member States and vast disparities in implementation."
"That also means that the credibility of the Council with regard to the implementation of Lisbon has taken a tremendous blow."
"You were not wrong when you said that it is necessary to restore confidence."
"Confidence can only be restored, however, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if we put an end to the fine words and magnificent plans and actually concentrate on implementation."
"Therein lies the main problem."
"And so we say in our resolution: it is time for the Council and the Commission to come up with a roadmap: a roadmap setting out precisely what tangible aims have to be achieved over which period of time; stating that the Council imposes an obligation to make an effort to actually do that, that EU legislation will be implemented and that this is then very carefully maintained, and that there is a coherent, consistent division of tasks between the European Council and the relevant national ministers, because that is generally lacking."
"The Lisbon document raises a large number of issues, some of which do, but most of which do not, fall within the jurisdiction of the European Union, and for these we have the fine term 'open coordination'."
"It would be good, however, if we could have much more clear-cut agreement on how to proceed with this open coordination."
"As my group sees it, the emphasis would have to be placed on cooperation, on the exchange of best practices, on benchmarking, and also on respecting the role of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament."
"Lisbon is not a one-man show involving only the European Council, particularly if one were to now lay its achievements on the table."
"Mr President, the economic and budgetary reform process indicated by the Ecofin Council must be continued."
"We must then have the courage to take daring decisions."
"Then we must also get the debate on the revision of the pension system under way."
"We would call for the three-pillar system to be looked at, under which, of course, the solidarity of the state is maintained, along with the solidarity on the part of trade and industry, and of course individual responsibility."
"A three-pillar system may, in future, put us in a better position to tackle the problem of an ageing population."
"It is true that a large number of obstacles would then have to be removed."
"If we argue in favour of more entrepreneurship, we make it possible to achieve that aim of a 25% reduction."
"Let us then get down to enacting the European Charter for SMEs, too."
"Let us also ensure that something is done about the obstacles to the recognition of educational qualifications."
"If we say 3% R&D, where is the timetable enabling us to ensure that that 3% can be achieved by 2010?"
"It is lacking, so it must be put in place."
"We have been discussing patents for such a long time now."
"The intellectual elite, says the President of the Commission, must not leave."
"Indeed so, but how long will it be before a European patent finally appears?"
"The credibility of the Council rests on this, and at some stage we must take up a position on it."
"It should not be the case that it is constantly being blocked by a number of the national ministers."
"Mr President, the knowledge-based economy is key."
"However, we no longer have any inkling that a significant part of software development, and all the research in the field of the knowledge-based economy, is currently on its way over to Japan because we in Europe have been consistently unable to establish the 3G sector."
"We are already three years behind Japan and, by the time we do bring it in, we will be five years behind."
"That is disastrous in a sector like this."
"I am therefore making an urgent plea to the Council: do not go on discussing the French proposal to give another six or nine billion back to one operator, but instead give some thought to devising a programme that will enable you to actually make 3G a reality in Europe."
"We need it."
"To sum up, what is important is not fine words, but deeds, and sending out a strong signal that the Council must actually get down to the business of implementation."
"What is important is getting a roadmap, so that we can see, in practical terms, who is going to do what and when."
"What is important is having a good working relationship between the different parts of the Council, and between the European Council and the relevant national ministers, because otherwise we will keep muddling along, and then the intellectual elite really will go to the United States and Europe will remain on the sidelines."
"Our Europe does not deserve that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has always been successful when it has been ambitious."
"The euro was one of those ambitions, which is providing increasing benefits for citizens."
"After thirteen months in actual physical existence, the euro has become the equal of the dollar, and is already the second reserve currency in the world."
"Since the European Central Bank has been managing monetary policy, the rate of inflation in the euro zone has remained lower than the American and British rates of inflation."
"Long term interest rates are at an historic low in Europe and lower than in the United States."
"By pointing out these facts, I am standing against the prevailing euro-scepticism and against the tendency for self-punishment among many of our colleagues."
"It is true that Europe has problems: growth has slowed down, some large Member States have mounting deficits and unemployment is rising again."
"However, which region in the world does not have problems?"
"We are told that Europe is suffering as a result of its lack of flexibility and structural deficiencies due to social overprotection."
"We are given the example of an American economy which is reportedly more productive and which, thanks to a more flexible labour market, is said to create more jobs."
"So what do we see?"
"American unemployment is higher than in the vast majority of European Member States."
"What is more, the American unemployment rate does not count the two million Americans of working age who are in prison."
"However there is something more important: productivity per hour is greater in Europe than in the United States, which is evidence of greater efficiency of production and services in Europe."
"This efficiency is reflected in international trade, in which the Union is selling nearly twice the volume of American exports."
"The United States are accumulating other deficits."
"Currently, if the federal budget deficit were evaluated according to the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, it would be between 5% and 6% of the United States GDP."
"The reason that I am pointing out these figures is not in order to gloat about them, as the United States are an essential driving force in the world economy."
"Europe could take over, as long as it equips itself with the resources to support its ambitions."
"The Lisbon Strategy is an ambition that will incite action, but the Member States will have to finally get behind implementing this joint strategy defined in Lisbon and Gothenburg."
"The Commission should ensure that all the Member States keep to this strategy as a whole, and not only to a few structural reforms, which are necessary but not sufficient to create the most competitive knowledge and 'well-being' based society in the world."
"In this context, Europe needs to rethink its investment strategy."
"In 1970, Europe used 4.2% of its GDP for public investments."
"Now we have dropped that figure to 2.3%."
"I am of the opinion that stability is essential for fighting inflation and public deficits."
"It also helps towards defending the purchasing power of the poorest in our societies."
"However, in order to have greater growth, we need to invest in infrastructures, research and the knowledge-based society."
"We also need to distinguish between investment expenditure and operation expenditure."
"Mr President, I will conclude by saying that I have tried to give an optimistic message."
"However, if war were necessary, we would all have to take another look."
"One of the first victims of this war will certainly be the Stability and Growth Pact, unless Europe refuses to sacrifice growth and employment on the altar of the gods of war."
"We therefore need to work to prevent this war in order to preserve growth and employment."
"Mr President, I congratulate the President-in-Office on his speech and wish him well with his agenda."
"Mr Prodi has outlined the scale of the challenges we face and the measures that are needed; yet it seems to me that if the Union's backbone were as strong as its wishbone this debate might not be necessary."
"The list of unresolved economic reform issues on the agenda for the Spring Council makes depressingly familiar reading."
"A year ago, ahead of the Barcelona European Council, which one government dubbed the 'make or break summit' for economic reform, the Union was deadlocked over fundamental issues such as the Community Patent, the Take-over Bids Directive and the Pensions Directive."
"Ministers were at sixes and sevens over the Stability Pact, having failed to issue early warnings to Germany and Portugal."
"Resolving these issues was proclaimed to be the foremost objective of the heads of state and government."
"So how much progress have we made, one year on?"
"On the Community Patent, which Mr Prodi mentioned - no progress."
"The best gloss that you can put on the new Take-over Bids Directive is that it is 'a work in progress'."
"Far from improving the situation, the Pensions Directive could actually represent a step backwards if adopted in the form currently advocated by Parliament's rapporteur."
"And Germany and Portugal have since been joined by France in the rogues' gallery of countries which are falling foul of the Stability Pact."
"In the midst of this litany of failure, in step Messrs Blair, Chirac and Schröder with another depressing example of letterbox diplomacy."
"After highlighting Europe's divisions on Iraq with the 'gang of 8' letter, the UK's Prime Minister has now formed a terrible trio of leaders with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder, who presume to tell other leaders how to reform their economies while blocking economic progress themselves."
"To hear a clarion call for economic reform from a British Prime Minister whose continued indecision over joining the euro is hitting jobs, growth and investment, is more than a little galling."
"For the President of France to put his name to a letter calling for the rapid completion of the internal market, when France tops the charts for failure to implement single market legislation, is little short of breathtaking."
"And to be lectured on the need for Europe to reform labour markets and increase employment by a Chancellor who has presided over record levels of unemployment in Germany, really takes the biscuit."
"Perhaps a little humility from those three leaders is called for when it comes to economic reform."
"We are in the third year of the ten-year Lisbon plan to improve competitiveness."
"The truth is that progress has been disappointing."
"The keys to higher employment levels and sustainable growth lie in sound public finances, a dynamic private sector, the completion of the single market, a real European research area and incentives for work, skill and innovation."
"My group would emphasise in particular the importance of completing the financial services action plan, fostering entrepreneurship and promoting flexibility and adaptability in the labour market."
"We must also increase the participation of women, immigrants, older workers and disabled people in the labour market, and adapt tax and benefit systems to make work pay."
"These are the challenges we face and we have only seven years left it we are to achieve our goal of making Europe the most competitive, dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world."
"Instead of setting new bold targets, the heads of state and government should get on with the job of closing the existing 'delivery gap' between their words and their actions."
"Mr President, we are a long way off from fulfilling the euphoric proclamations of the Lisbon Summit of March 2000 on full employment and on making the Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010."
"The slowdown in economic growth, the relocation and closure of companies accompanied by further redundancies, higher employment and increased social difficulties demonstrate the danger of the approach that has been pursued. This approach involves speeding up liberalisation and privatisation, the insistence on the primacy of monetary policies and of competition, the deregulation of the labour market and of labour legislation and making these more flexible."
"These factors clearly demonstrate the need for a sea-change in the neo-liberal guidelines and policies currently practised, which will not happen as a result of the proposals that have been presented to us."
"The Commission acknowledges, however, that the lack of up-to-date data still hampers the detailed study of what is happening in the field of poverty and social exclusion. Furthermore, little progress has been made in preventing early school leaving and in reducing gender inequality and the guidelines that have been presented, specifically in the field of social security, structural reforms of the labour market of work based on making work more flexible and more precarious and on wage moderation, and for pursuing the process of liberalisation in an increasing number of sectors, tend to aggravate the current situation."
"By accentuating the unilateral approach to the liberalisation and greater flexibility of the goods, services, capital and labour force markets, ignoring economic and social cohesion, the Commission and the Council are contributing to increasingly significant social problems and to hampering economic recovery."
"Consequently, as we highlighted in the resolution tabled by my group, it is crucial that the objectives of full employment, the harmonisation of social conditions in order to achieve progress, economic and social cohesion and development are defined as priorities for the Spring Summit."
"Social and employment policies cannot remain subordinated to strict compliance with the criteria of nominal convergence and make it urgent to redefine the mandate and powers of the European Central Bank."
"Sustainable development with a view to achieving social and ecological conversion must be founded on a thorough overhaul of the irrational criteria of the stability pact, given the diversity of the economic and social situation of the various countries. It also requires a more equitable distribution of wealth, an overhaul of social protection systems in a way that demonstrates solidarity, and requires public and social investment, particularly in education, research and in the knowledge-based economy."
"Consequently, as demanded by workers and citizens almost everywhere, including in Portugal last weekend, for example, at the impressive demonstration in Lisbon, it is time to heed the calls of the citizens and the workers."
"Mr President, and I should add, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about the Spring Summit, and Lisbon, about strategies for economic, social and environmental renewal."
"In fact, I have barely heard mention of those last two words."
"The question, therefore, is whether Lisbon is on the right track that is the question in the Commission notice and whether we, the EU, are still on the right track, and are travelling at the right speed."
"As far as the right track is concerned, I think that the report is based on a number of presuppositions - in regard to which I should like to delve a little deeper than Mr van Velzen and a number of analyses that are incorrect."
"I think that what we are dealing with is not a new economy but a cyclical one, and we have to take account of this."
"I think that we are also over-emphasising the knowledge-based economy, as we also need jobs at the bottom of the labour market - but I do not hear anyone talking about this."
"We are overestimating the potential of liberalisation and underestimating the Member States' capacity to implement directives and legislation."
"We are not seeking the causes of the failure to implement them."
"Is the EU still on the right track, and travelling at the right speed?"
"I think that Mr van Velzen puts it well, and several people have mentioned it."
"The answer is no."
"Let us look at employment: there are too few new jobs."
"With our twelve million, we can consider ourselves well off, but these jobs are not the result of our policies alone."
"The number of women, older people and people with disabilities in employment is too low."
"The path to better jobs is still long, and we have done far too little in the way of the modernisation of the organisation of work."
"I hope, therefore, that the review of the employment strategy that we are now going to work on and the improvement of the social agenda will bring about an adjustment in that field."
"If we look at the environment, we see that nothing has come of the horizontal integration in this policy."
"I am saying it simply but in the strongest terms."
"I have also just said that little progress has been made in the transport sector, and likewise in energy policy, in agricultural policy and in the field of public health."
"Who is discussing energy tax reforms?"
"And so on, and so on."
"If we look at the general approach, too, talking of Kyoto or Johannesburg, we see very little progress."
"However, we need better indicators, et cetera. I have already said it: the policy is too one-sided with regard to knowledge and innovation."
"As an engineer, I am all for the intellectual elite, but we should also look at other developments."
"We need other jobs, too, and that means that we also have to think of the bottom end of the labour market, that we have to tackle the informal economy, and so on."
"The streamlining of economic and social policy is very important, but that means that we have to draw conclusions both for the Stability and Growth Pact and for the orientation of the broad economic guidelines towards social and environmental policy."
"We must continue with Lisbon, but incorporating great adjustments, not only in the Member States, who have all kinds of things to implement, but also strategic adjustments and adjustments to its content."
"In my opinion, we need a thorough evaluation of what we are doing."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the EU Summit is to meet 'His Imperial Highness' Giscard d'Estaing, who is in the process of preparing a draft democratic constitution behind closed doors in a Praesidium in which four of Parliament's seven political groups are not represented."
"We have sent a complaint to President Giscard d'Estaing and asked to be given the right of access to the documents being used in the course of the Praesidium's work."
"We have still not received a reply."
"President Giscard d'Estaing has refused another request to scrutinise documentation on the grounds that EU rules on transparency do not apply to him."
"I should like to call upon the Presidency to inform him politely but firmly that the Praesidium too is funded by EU taxpayers and must of course act in accordance with the judgments of the Court of Justice and the principle of transparency, which now appears in Article 255 of the Treaty."
"There is no exemption for President Giscard d'Estaing and no legal base for representatives of the Commission, Parliament and the Council being able to depart from the principle of transparency unless they are provided with a special legal base by the regulation on transparency or decline to make a document available after making a practical assessment of it."
"In the case of every single document in the Praesidium's possession, President Giscard d'Estaing must weigh up its significance in the negotiations against the public's interest in knowing about it and, like everyone else in the EU, he must ensure that the principle of equality is practised."
"The situation must not arise in which three political groups have documents from the Praesidium available to them that are not available to the other four groups, or in which Convention documents circulate among foreign ministry interns that have not also been made available to members of the Convention."
"We demand equality - neither more, nor less."
"The word 'constitution' appears 32 times in the first 16 articles."
"It must now be clear even to those least quick on the uptake that a constitution, and not merely a constitutional treaty, is being worked on."
"I should like to call for the Praesidium to be reconstituted and made more representative of EU citizens."
"All the political groups should be represented. Women, who constitute half the electorate, cannot be satisfied with two places; the 13 candidate countries cannot be satisfied with one observer; and there cannot continue to be no representatives of that half of the electorate who voted no in the referendums on the EU held in the few countries that allow people to vote."
"Thank you, Mr President, even though there is not very much to say thank you for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to return to the Spring Summit."
"The final Lisbon Objective - to make the European economy the most competitive knowledge-based economy in ten years - appeared to many, right from the start, to be an optimistic, consolatory slogan."
"In actual fact, it seems increasingly less consolatory seeing as, three years later, very little headway has been made towards attaining that objective."
"The European economy is still at the starting-post, the necessary reforms are postponed or watered-down at each summit and the hopes of unemployed Europeans of finding work thanks to growth are still closely associated with the revival of the economy of that driving force: the United States."
"During the Spring Summit, the Heads of State and Government will probably confirm their commitment to the Lisbon Objectives, even though as things stand, we cannot be sure of this."
"A letter addressed to the Greek Presidency is already doing the rounds, reaffirming the need and desire to revitalise the European economy through ambitious structural reforms."
"Good - very good, we will say - but we Radicals nevertheless believe that instead of setting or reintroducing impressive objectives, we should do useful and fair things right now: welfare systems are in urgent need of immediate reform, and for many States constitute, in addition to a serious injustice for future generations, a real time bomb for the sustainability of public finances; we need to liberalise the markets in key sectors such as energy, transport, postal services and the professions; we need to create a truly integrated European financial market; there must be drastic cuts in the burdens weighing down, in particular, small and medium-sized businesses in Europe - tax burdens and bureaucratic burdens in terms of employment regulations - and which are one of the reasons for which a substantial number of European entrepreneurs and microentrepreneurs - I am referring mainly, but not exclusively, to Italy - are driven into the underground economy, a type of economy which evades regulation, which evades legality precisely because of the excessive burdens which are imposed."
"This is what should be done, if we want to avoid fooling ourselves with slogans, with magic formulae - formulae put to much use in this Chamber - such as 'European social model' or 'social market economy'."
"We would do well to ask ourselves whether these models are, today, really capable of protecting society's most vulnerable, society's 'outsiders'."
"We now move to the 'Catch the Eye' procedure."
"Colleagues, I remind you that you have two minutes' speaking time."
"If you stick to your time we can maximise the number of participants."
"Mr President, I welcome the remarks of President Prodi with regard to the current political tensions in the world and his emphasis on the role of the United Nations in resolving those tensions."
"I also wish the current Presidency-in-Office well at the extraordinary summit next Monday."
"I hope that it can establish a common position for the European Union in the present very fraught situation."
"I want to put it to the Commission and the Council that one of the most important things we can do at the summit is insist that Member States comply with the agreements they make in the Council."
"By this I mean both the targets they agree to under the Lisbon Process and the implementation of those targets because there is a clear gap in the implementation process."
"I should like to re-emphasise a point made by a number of Members."
"The Lisbon Process is not simply a liberalisation process - important as that is."
"The whole idea of the Lisbon Process was to have a coordinated and well-balanced social and economic approach to modernising the European social model."
"If we are to retain the uniqueness of the European Union, then we must ensure that social equity is not sacrificed in pursuit of the goal of liberalisation and competitiveness."
"That is also essential - not just from the point of view of social justice but also for creating a more productive Union."
"We have to ensure that those who are engaged in production feel it is worthwhile for them and for their children."
"Therefore, the crucial role of public services has to be defended."
"At the summit, the Commission and the Council have to seek to guarantee that services of general interest are enabled to grow and develop and are protected - and I use that word cautiously - from the ravages of the free market."
"My final point is that we must set targets for youth employment, in particular for disadvantaged youth."
"They are the long-term unemployed of tomorrow."
"Mr President, implementation of Internal Market legislation at national level is an absolute prerequisite for achieving the Lisbon objectives."
"The increase in the implementation deficit is causing EU markets to splinter and is eroding the benefits of the Internal Market."
"Unless the directives on telecommunications, for example, are implemented in the Member States, that sector's development will be become more disharmonious than ever."
"In order to maintain our competitiveness it is vital that we increase resources for research and training."
"We will not succeed in the future with just bulk products and a poorly trained workforce."
"Tax on earnings and employers' indirect costs must be cut to boost employment in Europe and to make it easier for SMEs and growth companies in particular to employ staff."
"Lower taxation would, for its own part, stimulate European entrepreneurship, one of the pillars of competitiveness."
"Let taxation in future fall within the competence of the Member States."
"I would also encourage Member States to lighten the tax burden in parallel with the Lisbon objectives so that they take account of fair and positive tax competition."
"The EU's task in this area will be to compile comparable data and propagate best practices."
"Mr President, the commitments entered into in 2000 for what is known as the Lisbon process were very ambitions, but they did of course constitute a heavy responsibility for the Heads of Government, and three years on we can see that this was all talk and that, up to now, it has not been transformed into any action to speak of."
"It is very ironic, however, to state that the European Union is going to be the most dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 and then do absolutely nothing dynamic about living up to this."
"In so doing, the European Union makes itself look ridiculous and the Council is not meeting its responsibilities."
"The most important reason is that we, as a Union, tolerate the failure of the Member States to honour the commitments they have entered into."
"Over recent years, it has emerged that France, for example, does not, in general, want to have anything to do with the commitments it entered into in 2000."
"For example, the monopoly of the largest energy supplier remains in place, and, what is more, that subsidised energy is being exported to those Member States who have indeed opened up their borders."
"In so doing, we have achieved the opposite of what we intended."
"The countries that have carried out liberalisation are being punished for their good behaviour."
"We have to see to it that countries honour the commitments they have entered into."
"This means commitments that are honoured instead of more targets."
"If we do not want to let the Lisbon process become a gigantic flop, definite action will have to be taken, and the Commission will have to draw up a clear timetable stating how the aims are to be achieved, setting end dates so that the Member States can be called to account on their responsibilities."
"The emphasis will have to be placed on financial soundness, on full liberalisation of the services sector, the creation of a knowledge-based economy by investment in research and development, and radical simplification of the regulatory environment."
"This means less detailed legislation and more framework legislation, so that people are not hampered in their activities by unnecessary red tape."
"It is not just the Lisbon process but the credibility of the whole Union that is at stake."
"Finally, I was struck by the speech by Mr Bouwman on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, but I should like to add one thing to it."
"He says that jobs should be created at the bottom of the market, and not only for the intellectual elite, and I agree with that, but we have to realise that one is a precondition for the other, and for this we need a competitive Europe."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, what makes the forthcoming Spring Summit so crucial in terms of political psychology is the fact that the times in which we live are not at all rosy."
"The message from this summit must be one of confidence, because Europe's economy and hence growth and employment, will not be got moving if such confidence in the EU Member States' political leadership is not created or, where it exists, improved."
"I do think, however, that it is not just confidence in governments that matters, but that it is also significant that European business is at last affirming its responsibility for contributing towards growth, investment, and employment."
"The state alone cannot create the jobs that Europe needs in order to really develop its productivity and also in order to become the region of the world best able to face the future."
"So it is to the Greek Presidency of the Council that I am appealing for a continued campaign against unfair fiscal competition and for us to be enabled at last to blockade all the tax havens and not let matters rest with the first breakthrough we achieve on the fiscal package, so that everyone can help put the Member States in a better position as regards the receipts on which their ability to make investments depends."
"It is at this point that I would like, again, to appeal to the private business sector to step up private investment."
"Not only is there too little public investment, but the private sector also invests too little, and it is only partnership between the two that will enable Europe to evade the self-fulfilling prophecy that our weak growth - or, in certain states, stagflation - will be followed by recession, which is something Europe can do without."
"It is because our periods of growth are far too weak that this appeal is addressed to the Greek Presidency of the Council, along with the appeal to the Commission and the Council for improved cooperation between the institutions."
"The European Parliament, as co-legislator, is prompt in doing its work, and it would be a good thing if the Council could keep up with us."
"Mr President, the Greek President-in-Office gave us a seductive list of all the things he was working on. It would make a great change - and I say this to him with due humility - if Presidents of the Economic Council would come here with a shortlist of things they were actually going to deliver."
"One hundred priorities on a list means there are no priorities at all!"
"I want to echo what Mrs Randzio-Plath just said."
"It would be refreshing - in fact essential - for the Economic Summit, when it meets on 21 March, to set down what its real priorities are."
"I would suggest - and I think all colleagues would agree with this - your priorities are to inject confidence and dynamism and a sense that the Prime Ministers of the European Union are determined to create a dynamic single market in which we will create jobs and accelerate economic growth."
"If we do not get investors behind that, President-in-Office, how are we to deliver all the other promises on your long list?"
"That is what we must do."
"It would also be refreshing - and, as you said, innovative - to find ways to activate the European Charter for small enterprises."
"It would not take much innovation to talk about it for once and actually implement it."
"It has taken three years of inaction to demonstrate that making business start-ups easier and cheaper across the Union - something the Prime Minister is committed to doing - simply has not happened."
"Again, I echo what Members have said: it is about time the Member State governments started to deliver on their promises on the patent, completing the internal market, clearing their transposition deficit and moving forward on the internal market for services."
"President-in-Office, we are witnessing an absurd situation where a simple mutual recognition measure of sales promotion is blocked in your Council."
"Show us the message, take away the clutter, get down to business and priorities, come back here and then we will feel you have delivered something."
"Let us have an end to the laundry list economic summit!"
"Mr President, the executive difficulties, together with the potential of the Lisbon Strategy, lie principally in its comprehensive, integrated nature."
"Despite some timid progress, the basic idea of integrating economic, social and environmental policies has not seen any significant, coherent progress at either Member State or Community level."
"If we totally accept the view that social and environmental quality is not incidental, but an element of growth and an essential factor of competitiveness, then I believe that the open cooperation method must be strengthened."
"I therefore applaud the fact that, in the Convention, the possibility of granting it constitutional status seems to be gaining support."
"Experience teaches us that objectives as ambitious as those involved in the concept of sustainable development cannot be attained without a strong, common lead from all social and institutional quarters."
"Regarding environmental policies in particular, without the adoption of plans and incentives at all levels, it is hard to imagine that more eco-compatible production and consumption models will really take off, models to which we are also committed under the Johannesburg Summit conclusions."
"We therefore need to ensure that all interested parties are persuaded to adopt innovative and responsible practices, by including them in medium and long-term outlooks."
"In this connection, I consider it a grave limitation that Parliament has not yet managed to formulate organisational and procedural methods in order to monitor, appraise and guide sustainable development policies in a truly effective - that is, multidisciplinary - way."
"It is right to call for Parliament's effective participation in the formulation of the broad guidelines to be guaranteed in the Interinstitutional Agreement, but we too must make better preparations to achieve our goal."
"Mr President, I am sure that it is clear to everyone that the Lisbon process is not yet finished."
"I think that there are two reasons for this."
"The first is to do with Lisbon itself."
"Back then, we took - as we, particularly, do now - as our starting point scenarios based on excessively high growth rates."
"I think that too many people think that growth is something that you can simply write in a book and it just happens."
"It does not."
"Instead, as Mr van Velzen pointed out, you then have to take hundreds of measures to promote this growth, and that cannot be done by means of rhetoric alone."
"Secondly, of course, all kinds of promises were made, and they have not been kept."
"This has also been pointed out enough times."
"What, however, can we do about it now?"
"One of the things you spoke about, Mr Prodi, was the takeover bids directive."
"That is one example that I would like to give."
"There is a great deal of talk about employment effects."
"In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have been looking into the probable employment effects of this takeover bids directive."
"They are negative. The Commission itself did not look into that."
"I would also like to see some more employment impact assessment, therefore, not only in the field of social measures - which is logical - but also with regard to other measures, in particular financial measures."
"Things often do not turn out as one would think."
"Another point I would draw attention to is the figures."
"In the Commission's answer to a question I asked, it admitted that the European growth figures cannot be compared favourably with those for the United States, presumably because the US growth figures should always be taken with a pinch of salt."
"It makes sense to me that we not only look at the US or China, but that we at all events use good figures and not go by incorrect data."
"Finally, a good deal has been said about cooperation in the field of universities."
"I think that that is very important."
"I think that a lot more can be done without us encroaching on the sovereignty of the Member States in this respect."
"I should like to put one question to the Presidency, however."
"How is it possible, if we are busy working on the universities, that, in Greece, the state universities still enjoy a monopoly, so that thousands of Greek students are studying in the USA and not in other European countries?"
"Can an end not be put to this?"
"I know that this is a Greek responsibility, but perhaps some thought could be given to it during your Presidency."
"Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, Mr Prodi, spurred on by today's debate in Parliament and the vote on the Commission's position on the WTO, I would ask the Greek Presidency: how should we deal with the Mediterranean products disaster given the desire for the gradual dismantling of aid and support for agricultural produce?"
"The desire to end support and to promote the free market is certainly positive, but how can we pursue this objective gradually, taking into account on the one hand, the needs of developing countries, and on the other, the needs of Mediterranean countries which would surely suffer severe, inestimable damage, owing to sudden and excessive liberalisation and the withdrawal of support?"
"This is a subject which I think the Presidency of a Mediterranean country should address, and should be of particular importance to it, not least because 2010 is not far off and the free market area is an appointment we cannot miss, but one for which we are making inadequate preparations."
"We should initiate a major debate and large awareness campaign throughout the Union on this subject."
"A final remark on the European research area, which greatly concerns me: our economy is indissolubly linked to our ability to intensify research, but many small-sized, very small businesses remain outside the Sixth Framework Programme, not because the Programme itself requires it, but because they cannot manage to take advantage of this opportunity by themselves."
"I would call for an incentive to be considered for small-sized business combinations, especially in circumstances where there is little inclination to plan and make arrangements together."
"I should like to thank President Prodi for again emphasising research and education, as is his wont, and their importance within the Lisbon process."
"I should also like to congratulate him for raising the problem of war with Iraq, which is clouding the atmosphere and will have a direct impact on the political and economic future of Europe."
"We started out with great expectations of the Lisbon process."
"However, in education, research, lifelong learning and training, it does not appear to be delivering the goods."
"3% in research was an important target and the Commission deserves our praise for managing to push it through, but we come at it as if our hands were tied behind our back and we fail to make the necessary progress every year."
"We talk a great deal about training, but the private sector only invests 2.3% in training and progress with investments in lifelong learning, school-leavers and immigrant groups does not, unfortunately, give us cause for optimism."
"All this is taking place in a climate which discourages university researchers and teachers because decisions are not followed up with the practical policies needed."
"Education and training are not, unfortunately, at the top of the agenda, not even the Lisbon agenda."
"But we still believe they must remain at the heart of the policies, as they were formulated when the Lisbon process was first designed."
"Sustainable development and the environment are just as important as the economy and social performance."
"The Spring Summit must therefore pay just as much attention to these, and not spend hours on the economy, minutes on social aspects and only seconds on environmental policy."
"The European Commission should prepare a sustainability report each year, and the joint resolution requests that the European Commission do just that."
"One example is fuel cell cars: the car of the future."
"Citizens of the United States and Japan are already driving them: they are already available; but not in Europe."
"We are lagging behind in this field."
"The widespread use of fuel cell cars, powered by biomass, will also mean that wars over oil will be a thing of the past."
"Environment, social aspects and economy are each of equal importance."
"It is a great shame that by no means all Heads of Government have taken this to heart."
"Mr President, we are living not only in a knowledge-based economy but also in a post-Kyoto carbon economy."
"Those who are able to produce goods whilst producing the least emissions will be the winners in this new economy."
"They will therefore be able to gain advantages in terms of employment and in economic and environmental terms."
"I therefore think it is extremely important that the European Union should have developed an emissions-trading system that will enable us to lower emissions in industry and in the energy sector, which accounts for fifty thousand companies and for 46% of carbon dioxide emissions."
"This is particularly important because it will lower the financial cost to Europe of complying with Kyoto by 35%."
"We cannot, however, resolve Kyoto merely through industry and energy."
"The Commission needs to come up with initiatives for the transport, farming and energy sectors."
"Despite the fact, however, that we in Europe are living in a carbon economy, we are still dependent on Russia's agreement for the Kyoto protocol to enter into force."
"We also know that the United States are currently waging a campaign in Russia against the Kyoto protocol."
"I would ask the Council and the Commission, what measures are being worked on at European level to ensure that we can convince our Russian friends to ratify the Kyoto protocol?"
"It is crucial that the protocol enters into force so that European businesses can accept the forthcoming measures, some of which are more difficult, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Europe."
"Mr President, I would like to concentrate on research and the creation of the European research area, both through the framework programme and through coordination of national policies."
"A 3% target for investment in research was set in Barcelona, but it is beginning to look like my New Year's resolution - to eat less and take more exercise - in that it has not been kept and really needs a bit more effort!"
"I attended an interesting benchmarking conference in Greece on research and technology."
"Let me tell you about some of the areas where people looked in detail at the performance of different Member States."
"Regarding women in science for example, countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy are turning out excellent women scientists and engineers, but other countries are doing very badly."
"When it comes to persuading young people to enter science and engineering, Nordic countries are doing well, as they do in a lot of categories."
"Others are doing poorly."
"This is a crisis across Europe."
"In terms of linking research with regional policy, again Finland is doing well, and Ireland exceptionally well but other countries are not."
"Representing Cambridge, I am pleased that some prestigious Cambridge institutions are now looking to South Yorkshire as a suitable location for research infrastructure."
"Some countries do well in clustering."
"The more we do of this comparison and the more we learn the lessons of the comparison, the more likely we are to keep our New Year's resolution."
"I will try harder on mine if Member States try harder on theirs!"
"Mr President, clearly the crisis currently plaguing the European Union and the capitalist system as a whole will not be remedied with the measures proposed for the spring Council."
"If anything, they will make it worse."
"The USA appears to be determined, with the direct or indirect connivance of the European Union, to go through with its threat of war; against Iraq today, tomorrow against who knows?"
"The objective is to redistribute the markets and control energy resources as part of the USA's master plan to rule the world."
"However hard the communications policy of the European Union and the governments of the Member States tries to nourish vain hopes for the future, the working classes feel the brunt of the system and its anti-worker, anti-grass roots measures on a daily basis."
"Even the European Union and other international economic organisations admit that their liberal policies have been a total failure."
"Underlying stagnation and falling production and development can no longer be turned around by stability pacts."
"It is fast becoming apparent that the much trumpeted social policy of the European Union, as it reduces labour costs and curtails or abolishes the workers' rights, is not fostering development and is not resolving the crisis inherent in the capitalist system, even on its own terms."
"The failure to achieve the Lisbon and Stockholm targets on employment proves how right we were when we said that they were designed, not to deal with unemployment, but to step up the attack on workers' rights and grant big business new privileges."
"The reason for insisting on privatisation and liberalisation, even in sectors such as health and education, and for handing over insurance funds to big business is so that it can increase its profits even during a recession."
"The only way forward is to galvanise the workers at both national and international level into a bigger, more massive and more dynamic anti-monopoly, anti-imperialist movement and so create a new force field that will get the economy out of the doldrums and pave the way for another, diametrically opposed policy for our people."
"Mr President, the fact that my seat is directly opposite yours has not helped me to attract your attention from the start, but never mind."
"The European Union is in need of structural reform, as we have heard, and reform of the labour market is a structural reform that will be included in the Spring Summit, preceded by Thessaloniki."
"However, Mr President, the labour market and welfare systems are two sides of the same coin: if one goes well - the labour market - then so does the other - welfare systems - given that the labour market finances welfare systems and vice versa: if the labour market does not go well, then neither do welfare systems, and Commissioner Solbes starts to have problems."
"If, on the other hand, the labour market changes - owing to either regulatory reasons or market reasons, or both - then the welfare systems must also change, because they must reflect the changes occurring in the labour market."
"This is why, Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, we also need to launch a strategy for welfare systems, similar to the one we applied, some years back, to the labour market under the Luxembourg Process: national plans, consensus on common objectives, transparency, the so-called three pillars, what was not yet called open coordination but which is now referred to in this way, and so on."
"We have to synchronise the two systems, we have to synchronise the two reforms, we have to synchronise the labour market and welfare systems."
"Therefore, open coordination, obligations and evaluation of the Stability Pact are all aspects that must be clearly defined and quantified at the Spring Summit, if we want to meet the Lisbon Objectives."
"Mr President, it was agreed when the Lisbon strategy was being decided that the EU could not become the world's most competitive knowledge-based economy unless there was sufficient investment in human resources."
"That is why the decision to place skills and innovation in the frontline of the strategy at the Spring Summit is a welcome one indeed."
"The Commission communication is urging Member States to increase investment in skills and innovation over the next twelve months."
"This is a good start, but there has to be long-term investment in training."
"A solid skills base will not be built in a year."
"Public expenditure for training and education has remained virtually unchanged in all Member States in recent years."
"With an ageing population and as the need for labour grows we must view training and education, not just as a necessary evil, but as an investment in the future."
"Societies which try to make use of the whole nation's resources, based on a policy of equality, achieve great things."
"Public services alone are not enough in making use of resources: the public sector must also do its share, especially by offering its employees the opportunity to receive training alongside their work."
"Training is the most important factor when it comes to employing people."
"The share of the population that works has increased in the last ten years."
"Since 1996, for example, 12 million jobs have been created."
"Most of these have been in sectors that require further or higher education."
"Education and training policy is the responsibility of the Member States, but we can enhance it though cooperation at EU level."
"The ministers for education have agreed on some common targets for education and training systems."
"By 2010 the number of those who leave school early should be halved and the proportion of those receiving vocational education and training among 25-64 year olds should be increased to 80%."
"The imbalance between men and women in the areas of mathematics, technology and science must be corrected."
"Mr President, Mr Yiannitsis, Mr Prodi, I have been unable to sleep for several nights; by not sleeping I cannot dream and this makes it difficult for me to give the explanations of vote which I normally give in this Chamber."
"Therefore, I turn to you for reassurance, in particular President Prodi, not just because he has a persuasive, calm, reassuring, almost paternal voice, but also and above all, because of the statements made so far."
"Why am I worried?"
"Because many pensioners are worried and cannot sleep either."
"They know, as I do, that the Presidents-in-Office of the Council try to balance the accounts, for economic reasons, in any way they can, even by cutting expenditure intended for pensioners."
"Pensioners agree with having accounts that balance - and what well-balanced accounts they are - but some of them only have their pension to live off."
"The approximate number of people living exclusively off a pension does not exceed one hundred million in Europe, without taking into account the candidate countries, and they say: 'We are all for balancing the accounts, but why not cut expenditure other than that intended for pensions?'"
"In some States, for example in Italy, there are laws, adopted by previous governments but still in force under the current government, according to which a 99% disabled person who has worked for a few years is given a pension of EUR 30 a month and widows of young men who have died are given pensions of EUR 18."
"Can we be reassured - and therefore sleep peacefully - that cuts will be made, as is only right, but that this will be done wisely?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too get the feeling that sustainability, in the context of preparations for this year's Spring Summit, is seen only as an appendix to general policy development."
"This is indeed regrettable, as - or so I believe -the future development of our society is to a very large degree dependent on how we manage to fashion the elements of our lives in an ecological way that will also be able to enable future generations to live decently."
"In so far as that is the case, we need to step up our efforts in the area of sustainable development; it is here that I address my remarks particularly to the Council, as we in this House, as well as the Commission, have specified in precise terms what shape sustainable development should take."
"President Prodi, when the Gothenburg Summit was in preparation, laid out before this Parliament very clear indicators and objectives for sustainable development, and these I can wholeheartedly endorse."
"What I believe hampers our discussion is the Council's failure to take these objectives on board, so that, whilst we are drawing up projected goals for many policy areas, sustainable development is not one of them."
"This means that it is not possible for us to impose any binding obligations, nor can we monitor what is done."
"I do not at this point want to draw up a long wish list, as one does at Christmas, but we have to focus our considerations on one or two core elements, and in that respect, strategy for dealing with climate change is certainly one important area, and transport another."
"What matters is that there should be binding targets, which the Member States have to achieve."
"I might add that this encourages renewed investment and creates jobs."
"Let me remind you only of the way in which the promotion of forms of energy such as wind energy has created tens of thousands of jobs in the European Union."
"What we need, then, is definite goals, goals that we must achieve, rather than only - as Winston Churchill put it - planning great things but taking small steps!"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the letter sent to you by the prime ministers of Europe's big three economies, Mr Chirac, Mr Blair and Mr Schröder, makes the spring Council far more important than a merely routine Council following the standard procedure."
"It makes it a symbol of the unity of Europe, at a time when this unity is being severely tested; perhaps even a symbol of hope."
"This letter is commendably realistic because it puts the emphasis where it is needed: on industry which, apart from the fact that it generates 25% of total European domestic product, also employs 45 million people; at a time when there is a great deal of talk about services, knowledge and so on, it is worth remembering that the economy has a far more material and palpable basis."
"It also puts the question of public utility services on the right footing."
"These services are a necessary basis and a necessary infrastructure for the economy and they must be maintained in the European way, not in ways which could lead to their being broken up, as is the case in certain sectors in the United States."
"Then there is the whole issue of modernising the markets and not tying companies down in more red tape."
"That is quite right."
"And of course, one issue which is extremely important when it comes to unifying the markets is the unification of the financial markets."
"From this point of view, 2003 is a milestone in the Lisbon programme."
"We also need to complete the legislation unifying the transport markets; perhaps the Commission could tell us if it is optimistic about at least keeping to this deadline."
"The prime ministers also emphasise the need for high levels of employment."
"It is worth remembering that Lisbon talks of full employment, not high levels of employment, and we should stick to our original ambition."
"Then, of course, there is the question of investments."
"Where the money is going to come from now that the stock exchanges are falling is a question which needs to be addressed and I hope, Mr President, that the skills of the Greek Government, which has a very distinguished economic staff, will create the optimistic climate without which confidence will crumble and the economy - and hence the Lisbon process - will not progress."
"This optimism is sorely needed."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have all stressed how especially important the Spring Summit is in view of flagging growth, the internal market not yet being complete and the Lisbon objectives becoming ever more nebulous and people having less and less confidence in them."
"I see the Lisbon strategy as being Europe's response to globalisation."
"The Lisbon strategy is our regulatory framework, because it links the market to social responsibility and the sustainability of the environment, which is how this regulatory model distinguishes us from the United States and from other continents."
"What is known as the eco-social market economy is the European regulatory model."
"We must stop apportioning blame."
"We must make it clear where responsibilities lie - who is responsible for meeting what target and by when."
"We need definite targets rather than woolly statements."
"In which areas do we want to be Number One and by what date?"
"Who has to achieve what subsidiary goal and by when so that the jointly determined European objectives might be fulfilled?"
"What the Spring Summit should do is specify how the Lisbon objectives are to be broken down country by country, and have these objectives incorporated in every statement made by governments and every labour convention entered into by them."
"There is no contradiction between the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon strategy; on the contrary, without the Pact, the Lisbon strategy could not be fulfilled."
"This means that we have to keep on ensuring that the internal market becomes a true internal market and that sufficient account is taken of small and medium-sized businesses' potential as the foundation of Europe's economic structure and a source of new employment."
"I would like to speak about the letter that three Heads of Government - Tony Blair, Gerhard Schröder and Jacques Chirac - have drawn up ahead of this Spring Summit."
"It represents an attempt to demonstrate their unity once more and to set the tone for the debate at the summit."
"There is nothing wrong with this in principle, because I think that it is good that some broad lines are set out amid the multitude of documents that crop up around this kind of summit, but I think that the epistle that these three have drawn up really plunges to new depths."
"It is an insult to the equilibrium and depth that characterise the Lisbon process, which we have now been working on for three years."
"In addition, I think that it clumsily upsets the careful balance in the Lisbon objectives, because - and a number of points have already been mentioned in the debate - it leaves out a number of objectives completely, and it only places the emphasis on the interests of trade and industry."
"It does indeed seem as though the letter has been copied from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the Federation of German Industries (BDI) and the French Enterprises Association (MEDEF), the employers' lobby organisations in the respective countries."
"I took particular exception to a passage concerning the Hartz Commission."
"A kind of commission is proposed at European level based on the German model, but evidently the governments in London, Berlin and Paris do not realise that a European directive on temporary employment, the cornerstone of the Hartz Commission, is already under discussion in Brussels."
"An extraordinary deal has been struck between London and Berlin concerning that very directive, to block any decisions being taken on it; a deal which has to do with another dossier, the takeover bids directive, which is also being discussed at the moment."
"It is absolutely absurd that, in the self same letter that has now been drawn up ahead of the Spring Summit, it is proposed to set up a kind of Hartz Commission that reinvents the wheel, instead of now working constructively on that directive and a decision being taken on it in March, within the Economic and Social Council."
"That brings to a close the 'Catch the Eye' part of this debate."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the European Commission, the Lisbon strategy, the vital tool needed to make the European Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, is perhaps more topical today than ever before."
"The social repercussions of possible military intervention in Iraq and its impact on the European economy are giving great cause for concern."
"Just what is it within the Union that ties it to outside developments?"
"According to the snapshot presented by the Commission, things are not so rosy when it comes to the open method of coordination between the Member States at all levels within the Union."
"For example, there has been too little progress towards the objective of sustainable economic development, more and better jobs and greater social cohesion which we set in 2000."
"Some Member States have completely failed to meet targets for employment and competitiveness, with the result that the word now is that we shall not achieve the target set by the Union in the Lisbon strategy."
"We therefore need to review what has been done and examine everything left on the to-do list, especially in the Member States which have fallen short."
"Again on the subject of sustainable development, we need to plug the gap between the announcements we make and the legislative tools we provide for protecting the environment and public health and we need to mainstream the environmental dimension in all Union policies."
"With pressure from both the Lisbon process and the process of reviewing the Union Treaties and, of course, globalisation, we urgently need to apply sustainable development within the context of European integration."
"However, what I want to focus on and highlight once again is this: I think, no I believe that the European Union is lagging behind in science and technology, especially biotechnology."
"Without scientific and technological progress and innovation we shall be unable to meet the challenges - the nutritional, medical, environmental and socio-economic challenges."
"Science and technology are the key to dealing with the major problems that beset human society."
"This has always been a basic element in the history of man and it still is today."
"Scientific, technological and related research, education and training are therefore non-negotiable."
"And in my opinion, Mr President-in-Office, you should take decisive action to promote research in science and technology, as the President of the Commission said, because it will, I think, turn out to be the most important tool in achieving the Lisbon policy, strategy and programme."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am indeed very well aware of the backdrop against which the Greek Presidency of the Council is obliged to make preparations for the Spring Summit."
"What makes it certainly the most difficult Spring Summit since Lisbon, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is the global economic situation and the prospect of an imminent war, which we hope yet to be able to prevent."
"In a situation such as this, a great deal of responsibility rests upon your shoulders, but there is only one mistake you can make, a very serious one, and that would be if you were to allow your courage to fail you - the courage to, for once, push to one side the declarations prepared by the many bureaucracies; the courage to distance yourself to some degree from the anaemic statements, all couched in the same language; the courage to engage in real discussion among yourselves of the real conditions under which the people of the European Union live."
"We know from former Presidents of the Council that finding the courage to break with ritual is perhaps the hardest thing of all."
"It is not simple."
"Let me give two reasons why I think it essential that you summon up the courage to do this."
"What we learn from an unvarnished depiction of the situation is that investment, both private and public, in Europe is at a low point."
"We have to take especial note of the fact that public-sector investment is collapsing in those economies on which a major part of our economic development depends."
"This is where ritual invocation of the Stability and Growth Pact is not enough."
"When will we at last affirm our belief in the golden rule and put fresh wind and impetus behind increased investment in Europe?"
"I, for one, want to hear no more from Members of this House who ritually affirm the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises without at the same time stressing the link with public investment."
"This question demands an answer, and soon."
"You are in a position to do this, and you can get it done."
"There is a second aspect that seems to me to be of great importance."
"Wonderful papers are produced on active ageing."
"I know about the demographic situation, and about how important it is to keep people active as they get older, but if you ask the European public, what you come up against is the great difficulty you have in persuading someone who has worked in a factory for forty years, perhaps working shifts, to carry on doing that job."
"You will find it even more difficult to convince a businessman that this worker has to keep on working longer, and, in particular, even more difficult than that when people out there know that these papers are written by people who reckon on going in their fifties or early fifties with a golden handshake."
"If you really want to do something, do some work on health programmes in the workplace, do something about enabling people to have an early-retirement part-time pension, and then, above all, ask yourself how it is that nearly 20% of our young people still end up on the labour market without proper training?"
"These people are the future of Europe, and we force them into unemployment."
"This is an urgent problem, and I do not find anything like enough about it in our papers."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, much has been said during this debate and it is obviously difficult at this point to add anything new. I will therefore insist on the aspects which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party considers to be most important in this preparation for the Spring Summit."
"Firstly, on assessing the results so far since Lisbon, we observe that, rather than making progress - at least in relative terms - we have moved backwards."
"If we compare the levels of productivity in the European Union and in the United States we see that the European Union comes out worse."
"We believe that this is because we have not been able to make sufficient progress on a framework favourable to business initiative for investment."
"This is because, despite the declarations made at the successive Councils in Lisbon, Gothenburg and Barcelona, there has not been adequate action on the part of the Member States, which have committed themselves to making a series of reforms, of which the really important ones are reforms to make the labour market more flexible, to promote an environment more favourable for the creation of companies, at a time when growth forecasts within the European Union are low."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are key, but it has been demonstrated that the bureaucratic obstacles to creating a new business are infinitely greater in the European Union than in the United States."
"This is not a favourable environment either for the creation of companies or for small and medium-sized businesses or, above all, for those companies which are taking a new direction by applying new technologies."
"Therefore, the twin objective of creating companies and applying and developing new technologies has also been significantly delayed and clearly, despite the successive commitments and solemn declarations, which were repeated in Barcelona, on the process of liberalisation of sectors which are still protected, in energy and telecommunications we see once again that they have not been fulfilled."
"I therefore hope that rather than making great declarations, the Brussels Summit will fulfil its commitments."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is, I think, obvious - and here I disagree with many of my honourable friends - that, if nothing else, the Lisbon process, the Lisbon strategy, is not a total failure."
"At worst, it has not made any headway."
"Clearly, it is developing and progressing too slowly."
"The recession which has hit the economy, especially the sectors of the new economy on which we have - to put it one way - somewhat over-optimistically pinned our hopes for the Lisbon strategy, cannot be left out of the equation."
"As far as sustainable development is concerned, there has been a huge delay."
"We should already be fully monitoring and developing the outcomes of Johannesburg."
"I think that both the word and the town have been forgotten."
"Then there is the letter from the three leaders, which a previous speaker quite rightly referred to and which really does upset the balance which the Lisbon strategy tries to strike."
"This letter calls for reform, but reform in the wrong direction."
"The letter ditches the term full employment and talks of high levels of employment."
"It says - and this is outrageous, Mr President-in-Office and I should like you to respond to this - that we need to prevent new restrictions on companies and that, whenever the Commission proposes new policies, we need to listen to the opinion of companies and the business world first."
"I have nothing against consultation, but what will you do about the legislation on chemicals?"
"What will you do about the new legislation on environmental responsibility?"
"In one sense, these laws are restrictions which come within the context of sustainable development and so on. Will they too be left out of the equation?"
"I think an answer is required."
"If not now, then during the discussions at summit level."
"In all events, a clear answer is required."
"Obviously the war, or rather, let us not deceive ourselves, the invasion of Iraq may exacerbate all this and does, of course, make it hard to get down to brass tacks and discuss the follow-on strategy for Lisbon."
"However, a number of questions need answering, Mr President."
"Have you thought about re-tabling a general reduction in working times in order to create more jobs?"
"About funding the development of the so-called third sector?"
"About updating the ideas in the White Paper, which was when we last thought about this in a specific, integrated manner in the European Union, for example on trans-European networks and tax changes, in order to shift taxes off employment and on to the use of natural resources."
"Have you thought about re-tabling all this in the light of the failures so far?"
"Or has all this now been forgotten?"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the tone of this discussion is too pessimistic."
"I think that now, of all times, we need to testify in strong support of the value of the European model, not only as a market, but especially as a model for well-being, sustainability, development, and the prosperity which is tied up with well-being."
"That is why we have made a conscious decision to support integration in place of confrontation, unity in diversity, and world development in place of dominance."
"And so we have brought about the upcoming enlargement of the Union, but, at the same time, we are confronted with the growth of unemployment."
"At this time, therefore, we need leadership from the Commission, the Council, Parliament, the EU institutions and the Member States."
"Member States, regions, local authorities and heads of businesses alike fail to deliver the goods, however."
"They all sit on top of their heaps of gold, exercising caution and not doing what needs to be done in order to combat this unemployment."
"Believe me, if we carry out enlargement of Europe with unemployment still hanging over our heads, we will be heading for an utter fiasco."
"You talk of research - we have failed to bring about a real European policy for this."
"Our doctores honoris causa still come to our universities to collect their honorary doctorates, before returning to the USA to work in very high-performance laboratories."
"Why are we doing so little; why are so many countries lagging behind in terms of research?"
"If sustainable development is to be possible, each country must do more than it is currently doing, and together we must do more than we are currently doing."
"For we must admit that when times were good - times are not so good now, but we must turn the tide - we did actually see, to our regret, that regions with high unemployment also remained regions of high unemployment when they were part of the Union."
"On top of that there is also cyclical unemployment."
"At the same time, we can see that, across the board, there are still semi- and unskilled workers who are out of work, still too few women in the labour force, too few people in work, and businesses that systematically show their staff the door when they reach 52; and there are still too many countries that endorse this behaviour and even give government money for it."
"Have we not been fobbed off in that regard with nice summits and fine words for long enough now?"
"I hope that now, some action will be the result."
"That was very difficult."
"Ladies and gentlemen in the galleries, I warmly welcome you to Parliament, but I must firmly ask you not to attempt to join in the debates or to applaud."
"Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you can see what great expectations are placed in you at a time when Europe is in a really difficult economic situation, and I am therefore glad to be able to invite the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Yiannitsis, to address us."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their comments, views and thoughts, which will be passed on to the Member States and will help both them and the Council to make a success of the Spring Summit."
"It seems to me that the entire debate can be summarised in three key words, three key messages."
"The first is confidence, the second is action and the third is balance, the European model."
"Let me explain myself."
"Public opinion, what the citizens of the European Union want to come out of a Council such as the Spring Summit, which has an agenda of important and extensive issues, is confidence, not just in the abstract sense, but based on a realisation that the European Union is in a position to take decisions on growth, on employment in these difficult times and on a series of other issues of real concern to our citizens in their everyday life, such as social issues, pensions, health, education and quality of life."
"This is an aspect that, I think, mainly has to do with economic and social affairs."
"However, I think that, especially in today's circumstances, questions of confidence do not arise solely from decisions relating specifically to Lisbon matters."
"We are in a period, to paraphrase Tolstoy, of 'War or Peace' and Europe's confidence in the European Union will also depend on the decisions it takes on political issues."
"Everyone is waiting to see what decisions we, as the European Union, are in a position to take."
"The Greek Presidency, in agreement with its partners, has convened a special summit on political issues next Monday, in order to consider how we can make sure Europe is in the thick of things and how we can gain the confidence of the citizens of Europe on this front and prove that Europe can progress, that it can progress in an organised fashion and that it can take decisions."
"President Prodi mentioned the importance of this sort of image under present circumstances and I shall have an opportunity to say more on this during this afternoon's debate on Iraq."
"This confidence, to come back to Lisbon, touches on a series of issues for which, as a number of speakers quite rightly mentioned, there is no institutional basis for progressing as one might perhaps wish."
"However, they are issues on which progress must be made and the open method of coordination, which has proven its worth over recent years post Lisbon, has injected flexibility into the Community system and allowed us to make some headway."
"I think the debate under way in the Convention may give us a more efficient institutional system, which could allow us to make decisions which are important to the citizens of Europe rather than getting entrenched in specific remits which prevent Europe from moving forward on a series of day-to-day issues."
"Greece, not as the presidency but as a Member State, is one of the countries that wants us to move in this direction."
"The second point I noted from the debate and want to highlight is the real need for action."
"We do not need new objectives, we need to implement much that has already been decided."
"Everyone realises this, the presidency realises this, the Council also realises this and we are working in this direction."
"However, I should like to point out that, whatever you may say about Lisbon's progress to date, it is also worth remembering and highlighting the positive developments."
"I should just like to mention employment, because that was one of the main points of Lisbon, and remind you that, during these difficult years, with a recession in 2002, Europe managed to create 600 000 new jobs and that between 1999, the year before Lisbon, and 2003, an estimated 7 000 000 new jobs have been created in Europe."
"I know we also have the problem of unemployment, but mentioning this does not play down existing problems;"
"I just want to point out that we have to see not just where we have failed to hit target; we also have to look at what has been achieved in relation to the targets set."
"I should like to comment on another basic Lisbon issue, to do with balanced policies."
"I really do believe that Lisbon is one of Europe's many responses, and a very serious response, to the issue of globalisation."
"And that is very, very important."
"The whole core idea of Lisbon revolves around the key word of balance, balanced policies."
"What we have to decide, of course, is how we can strike a balance between policies to strengthen competitiveness and policies to strengthen the social dimension."
"It seems to me that you have to decide how to answer this."
"How to answer the need to strengthen and remove all limits on the market system and, at the same time, strengthen issues to do with employment, the social model or the concept of growth and the concept of sustainable development."
"The success of post-war Europe has been built on its ability to find a satisfactory answer to the question of balanced policies."
"We cannot compare Europe with other models without thinking about it very carefully and setting certain limits."
"We can use benchmarking in each country to see where we were before and where we are now."
"We can even use it between Member States of the European Union; but benchmarking between the European Union and other countries is another matter, because no country anywhere in the world has developed the elements that typify and constitute the post-war European development and social model."
"No country has fast rates of growth and social protection and sustainable development and environmental protection all at once, meaning that any benchmarking is flawed."
"Useful yes, as long as you are aware of its very narrow limitations."
"We know what the price will be if we ignore the demands of competitiveness."
"So we are forced to proceed in the direction of key factors that currently strengthen the competitive potential of our economy."
"Otherwise we shall achieve nothing."
"However, we also know what the repercussions may be if competitiveness is our only criterion or if employment, or social protection or environmental protection are our only criteria."
"I think that all our concerns centre around how we can safeguard the Europe we know, by which I do not mean safeguarding old inflexible structures, I mean safeguarding old values and achievements, taking account of the fact that times have changed and that we need to move with the times if we are to have the sort of success we had in the past."
"Numerous speakers rightly raised issues to do with employment and employment arrangements."
"One of the hardest problems is how to tread the fine line between the need for flexibility and the need to strengthen competitiveness and job standards and protect workers."
"These are the values we have always known in Europe and these are the values we want to safeguard."
"No one objective takes precedence."
"There is a very fine balance between all of them and therein lies the rub, therein lies the concern;"
"Europe has acted on this concern for years and has managed to find its own answer."
"We believe that it will be able to find a new answer to these issues in this new, difficult phase."
"One speaker pointed out or, if you like, criticised the fact there is no specific emphasis on sustainable development or the environment."
"I should like to start by reminding you that it is Europe as a whole that has put the emphasis on environmental issues."
"We in Europe have done this, which is why we are critical of other countries which have not signed the Kyoto agreement and so on. Of course, we still have a great deal to do in this direction."
"We, the presidency, want to focus over the next few months on removing obstacles to environmental technologies, strengthening procedures to promote renewable sources of energy, promoting approaches which allow transport infrastructures to be properly costed and polluting sources of energy to be taxed and examining the report on the environment which will be submitted at the spring Council."
"We also agree that the question of investments and trans-European networks are important issues in the current phase of low manufacturing output in Europe, and it is vital that we find new, innovative ways of funding and boosting investments in both the private and public sectors."
"Issues arising from enlargement are important in relation to the Lisbon strategy. The Lisbon strategy basically summarises the European development and social model and, if we want to make enlargement a real success rather than just a decision to enlarge the European Union, we need to see how we can extend the main elements of this model to the new countries, how we can set up social, economic and political structures in most of the new Member States, which still have quite a long way to go to meet current European standards, and how we can transplant these standards and promote unification."
"This is a new challenge for everyone and, of course, for several presidencies, not just the Greek Presidency or this spring Council."
"I shall close with the letter received by the presidency from the three leaders already referred to."
"This is one contribution and we want to examine it."
"We have had contributions from other Member States which have not perhaps received as much publicity."
"They raise a series of issues which the spring Council will be examining and I agree with the Member who said that the European Union will need to demonstrate in March - the presidency does not of course have magic powers and cannot decide on behalf of the Fifteen - the Fifteen will need to demonstrate that, despite the climate in which we are operating, we have managed to take decisions which will open up prospects, build confidence and work for the future good of the European Union."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"I am looking in the direction of Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission."
"I had been told that you would not be speaking today."
"Is that still the case, or do you want to say something after all, Mr President?"
"Just a brief thank you because Mr Yiannitsis has already replied in such a thorough manner and we are in complete agreement. I would just like to emphasise the tone of this debate which has been, I would say, characterised by considerable pessimism."
"It is clear that this is not the best of times, in both political and economic terms."
"Nevertheless, we have a doctrine and rules which all of us here have endorsed."
"I can assure you that if we persevere in forging ahead with this doctrine, with these rules, we will not fail to see results."
"We have created the largest, and I would say, potentially the most efficient market structure in the world."
"We have established rules, and know where we want to go; progress, obviously, is slow because this entails transfers of power and transfers of competence which are always difficult to carry out."
"Some States are pushing ahead, others are dragging their heels, but remember that it is our duty - the duty of Parliament and the Commission - to lead everyone back to the course that must be followed and the journey that must be completed."
"And you will see that results will not fail to arrive soon."
"Thank you, President Prodi, for your encouraging and optimistic message."
"We all hope that what you expect will indeed come to pass."
"I notify the House that I have received six motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"Yesterday, in the course of the debate, the arguments put forward by Mr Mayol i Raynal and Mrs McKenna persuaded me not to endorse the report by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra in the end."
"It is not only about a neutral agreement with Chile, a country where the same language is spoken as in Spain and which deserves support after shaking off dictatorship."
"It seems to be yet another fisheries agreement in disguise."
"In addition, the present Chilean government is taking little account of the minority which is descended from the indigenous American Indian population, and, as a result of opposition from its Senate, Chile will not for the time being be ratifying the Statute of the International Criminal Court in the Hague."
"Under those circumstances, I think that an agreement of this kind is premature, to say the very least."
". (PT) I agree with this report because I feel that it makes a valuable contribution to improving the effectiveness of the decisions adopted in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), to whose Convention the European Union is a contracting party."
"The rapporteur's suggestions make the process of documenting catches of this type of fish more rigorous, thereby further enabling us in situ to meet the objectives proposed by the Conservation Commission, by detailing the responsibilities of fishing-vessel captains as regards their declarations concerning fishing areas, quantities caught, the nature of the products in question and information regarding their vessel."
"This measure will in fact provide a response to the considerable increase in declared amounts of catches landed outside the Convention zone, but which are thought to be the result of illegal fishing practised in the zone covered by the agreement."
"This measure, combined with others already adopted by the Commission such as setting catch limits for Dissostichus spp. in waters covered by the Convention, the mandatory use of an on-board satellite-linked vessel monitoring system (VMS), inspections in ports in which catches are landed and transhipped, and the issue by the flag state of licences or authorisations in respect of Dissostichus spp. fishing, encourages closer monitoring of the fight against the scourge that is the unregulated and undeclared illegal fishing of these species, which have considerable commercial value."
". (PT) I support this report - basically a technical document - which, in conjunction with the proposal for a Council regulation introducing a Community system of statistical documentation for bluefin tuna, swordfish and bigeye tuna, is the next logical step following the adoption of various programmes, by Regional Fisheries Organisations (RFOs) in which the European Union participates, to combat illegal, unregulated and undeclared fishing operations for these species of fish."
"I am referring to the decisions taken within the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)."
"Apart from this somewhat involved reason, I agree with the report because I believe that it represents a step closer to achieving greater transparency in this market, contributing to the greatest possible rigour and helping to ensure more effective monitoring of illegal, undeclared and unregulated fishing."
"Achieving this objective is all the more important because, according to FAO estimates, 30% of fish landed come from such sources, which has disastrous results for the Union and specifically leads to horrendous falls in fish prices."
". (PT) The eEurope programme forms part of the key aim of the Lisbon Strategy and of promoting the opportunities created by the new information and communication technologies (ICT), or what is known as the 'new' economy."
"This joint debate on the information society, of which this report is one component, seeks to give a new boost to this 'new' economy, pursuing the idea of a new model and that the ICTs are a type of panacea for economic growth, for job creation and for increasing productivity."
"Furthermore, the concept of innovation and the new technologies create new problems, specifically the commercialisation of knowledge and the creation of a two-fold exclusion/marginalisation, in particular for society's most disadvantaged groups and for the regions that are geographically most remote or which have specific problems."
"The digital divide will therefore be between those who have and those who do not have access to the benefits provided by the new technologies, including small and medium-sized enterprises, which find it difficult to take full advantage of the new opportunities, because of shortcomings in investment and qualifications, despite greater pressure of competition."
"This attempt to provide a new boost, to be decided on at the Spring Council and which has come about in response to the failure of this model, proves that there is no such thing as a new or old economy; there is only economic rationality."
". (PT) I have supported this report, which is closely linked to the Paasilinna and Van Velzen reports, and I welcome the results of the soundings carried out by the European Commission amongst European economic actors and the follow-up given to these soundings."
"In fact, material and political investment in the new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is becoming an increasing priority."
"This investment should encompass society as a whole and I am therefore pleased to see that the European Commission is now adopting a method for assessing and consulting all stakeholders and is launching practical actions to encourage the widespread use of the new technologies, in particular by small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I also believe that the Council's request to the Member States to formulate and develop EU standards and codes of conduct for practical application in encouraging the establishment of open e-marketplaces, secure e-business solutions, e-signatures and electronic payment systems is extremely important."
"It is becoming increasingly clear to everyone how the widespread use of the new ICTs depends entirely on the degree of confidence stakeholders have towards the security of their transactions and their interoperability. It is therefore crucial to look more closely at this sensitive field and to invest in it more appropriately."
"Mr President, on behalf of our group, I wish to make a declaration of vote on the Caveri report."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regrets the fact that, eight years after Austria's accession to the European Union, no solution satisfactory to all parties - on economic as much as on ecological grounds - has yet been found to the problem of goods transport through the Austrian Alps."
"In the hope of a speedy solution and of greater planning security, acknowledging the positive efforts of the Danish and Greek Council presidencies, we call upon the Council to act upon the mandate of the Laeken and Copenhagen European Councils by promptly presenting a Common Position that will speed up the decision-making process involved in the joint enactment by the Council and Parliament of a solution accepted by all the parties involved."
"I wish to thank the interpreters for their excellent translation of what was far from being a straightforward text."
"Mr President, whilst I otherwise hold Mr Caveri in high esteem, I wish to make it known that I have voted against his report."
"I believe that it would, in this case, have been better for Parliament to have taken the Danish compromise into account and not gone beyond it."
"It is not, in my view, very helpful to tie oneself down to a new line."
"I trust that the Council will again do as Mr Poettering, the leader of our group, has just suggested, and get to work on finding a common solution."
"The fact of the matter is that even the rule on category 4 HGVs is not entirely without its problematic aspects, as it means that the environment in the affected areas will be subjected to new nuisances."
"We have to provide help here as a matter of urgency, and there needs to be greater understanding of this area, which is such a sensitive one."
"Mr President, while I was on the aeroplane taking me from Bergamo to Strasbourg, I was reading this report in order to decide how to vote, and I read that the ecopoint system is being extended."
"I fell asleep again and in my dream, I saw Austria winning the football world cup in 2006."
"Why?"
"Because it had the most points."
"So points are helpful to Austria!"
"Points which mean it will win the football world championship in 2006, if my dream comes true - and I think it is also the Austrians' dream - but also points in the Caveri report which will enable Austria's citizens to have less pollution, even if the problem has, however, not yet been resolved."
"This is why I voted for the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to inform the House that my group and I have rejected the report, and explain why we have done so."
"As I said yesterday, Austria does not want to keep its ecopoint system for ever; what we want is a fair and sustainable solution to Europe's transport problems."
"For as long as such a thing is not in sight - and, above all else, for as long as the new transport infrastructure directive is not adopted - the transit issue needs to be dealt with by acceptable transitional rules."
"It is for this reason that we have not approved today's Caveri report."
"We have supported Amendments Nos 19, 20 and 21, as they call for the retention of the ecopoint system and an upper limit for the number of journeys by HGVs until such time as a sustainable solution to the problems of the whole of the Alpine region enters into force."
"I see the failure to even vote on Amendment No 18, which is based on the Danish compromise, as sending a very poor message to the people of Austria."
". In the plenary debate on this issue, which took place yesterday, I gave as my opinion that any kind of redistributing road-transport capacity throughout Austria has to be distrusted."
"The reason is the heavy pressure of road transport companies in Germany and Italy on Austria to accept heavy trucks which are not allowed to enter neighbouring Switzerland to cross the Alp mountains."
"Nevertheless, I announced on behalf of my GUE/NGL Group that a majority of us should accept the proposal for the year 2004 only, because it continues to limit transport."
"After I had given my contribution to the debate, the Austrian representatives of all different parties and the Group of the Greens/EFA introduced one very strong argument not only to amend the Caveri-proposals but to reject them as a whole."
"This argument is that they become a part of a system to phase out the actual restrictions within a few years."
"They have convinced me finally."
"As a defender of environment and national self-determination I cannot accept what is happening now, although I respect the contribution of Mr Caveri to find a solution which will be more or less equal to the situation in other parts of the Alps."
"So I cannot vote in favour of the Caveri report."
"Mr President, Mr Van Velzen has presented us with the Commission's proposal for a directive on the commercial exploitation of public sector documents , chiefly those of the European Parliament."
"In that case, I thought, explanations of vote can also be used for commercial exploitation, and I still think so."
"Therefore firstly, I cannot fail to vote for this report, in the hope, secondly, that I too will manage to commercially exploit the explanations of vote over these five years at the European Parliament."
"Naturally, the profits, if there are any, will go to pensioners who will certainly not snub extremely modest support from the European Parliament, even in this form."
". (PT) The current situation of publicly accessible re-use of public-sector information varies enormously from Member State to Member State, both in terms of conditions and also of the costs of this re-use."
"This field needs to be simplified: everything related to basic information - concerning the democratic rule of law - should be made available free of charge, and other information should be made available at a marginal cost, except in what is known as the 'cultural' sector, for obvious reasons of intellectual and artistic copyright."
"This is not a simple issue and divides the supporters of a certain degree of freedom of decision-making in this field by the Member States and their public services from those who advocate a single harmonised market being imposed on these States for the dissemination and re-use of their information."
"I have abstained because I am sensitive to these problems, to which I would add the current state of discussions on this matter in my own country."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of the report on the eEurope 2002 action plan."
"These reports formalise the principles laid down at successive European Councils for 'an information society for all'."
"The current potential for telematic transfer and access provided by the Internet, forces us to march in step with progress."
"The same applies to consolidating democracy and the principles of the rule of law."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he suggests that public authorities should act as a driving force in developing new content services, encouraging the re-use of the information they have and making marginal charges for this."
"The profusion of information held by States should be accessible to everyone, with the proper safeguards for information that is of strategic importance or in the national interest and in line with the rules of the prevailing culture."
"This directive does not seek to harmonise the Member States' systems, or access criteria that vary from country to country with regard to information that is universally accessible and information that is not."
"This matter should remain within the sphere of each Member State because it is dependent on the specific context of that country."
"What seems obvious to even the simplest mind, however, is that we must promote the sharing of information at European level and the establishment of conditions of access to this information as well as rules on charging."
"Mr President, this report expresses an opinion on the entry and residence of third country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities."
"At the airport, I met some beautiful retired ladies and some retired men who were still youthful, who said to me: 'Why is it that you at the European Parliament only concern yourselves with the movement and residence of workers and citizens in general?"
"Are you not going to do something for pensioners as well?"
"We too would like to travel throughout Europe, even if we are from third countries and are not workers, just pensioners."
"Will there be a directive in the future which will facilitate the entry into the European Union and movement and residence therein of pensioners too?'"
"'I am sure there will', I replied."
"Therefore, in the meantime, I voted for this report too."
"- (DA) The June Movement has, as far as possible, voted in favour of the highest minimum requirements, but voted against whenever there has been a risk of undermining the Danish tax-funded welfare model with its social and civil liberties for all."
"We have abstained from voting in this vote because of the above-mentioned conflict."
"- (DA) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Terrón i Cusí's report (A5-0010/2003) on the entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities."
"The proposal contains quite a few constructive elements for improving and simplifying application procedures, as well as for ensuring uniform rights for the persons concerned."
"We are, however, aware of the fact that this area has to do with circumstances covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and does not therefore apply to Denmark, cf. the Protocol on Denmark's Position."
"Europe is becoming less and less open to refugees who have had to leave their countries because their lives and freedom were threatened."
"Even those who have become well-established are being deported after years of residence because they are not recognised as refugees, and run the risk of being in serious trouble again when they return to their country of origin."
"On the other hand, there is an ever-increasing need for people pursuing occupations in which there are shortages in Europe. Examples are nursing staff from South Africa, the Philippines and South America, and highly trained chemists, physicists and mathematicians from India."
"Those people are not naturalised in Europe and are badly needed in their country of origin, which, despite the low standard of living, has often made a considerable contribution to funding their training."
"This proposal extends the permits of those people we, in Europe, consider necessary."
"Instead, we should be looking a bit more at those who have already become established here, and who hope to be able to stay."
"Apart from that, it should not be the case that only the most highly trained people have the right to stay, because that only increases the negative brain-drain effect in their countries of origin."
". (PT) The philosophy of Community immigration policy is quite clear in the proposal for a directive we are currently examining: we will continue to receive immigrants from third countries only if and when these serve the economic interests of the European Union."
"Consequently, the proposed conditions of entry and residence for third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment are so restrictive and tough that very few candidates for immigration will be able to meet them."
"Such an approach is all the more unacceptable because it is backed by a Community budget that is cutting funds intended for developing countries, because in Monterrey, the EU produced nothing more than a grotesque commitment to allocate only 0.39% of its GDP to public development aid until 2006 - instead of the 0.7% set internationally a considerable time ago; because the policies established at the WTO are not benefiting the poorest countries. This has led to the gap between the richest and poorest countries growing, to encompass a further 100 million poor people."
"It is true that the European Union cannot receive all of the world's poor onto its territory. On the other hand, this cannot be its response to the problems of poverty in the world and to the racist and xenophobic discourse that has recently been flourishing in some Member States, in total contrast to the humanist values that should be guiding it."
". (PT) I fully subscribe to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's interpretation of Article 63(3)(a) of the EC Treaty presented in the opinion appended to this report."
"I believe that by seeking to harmonise all regulatory material concerning immigration for the purpose of employment, the Commission's proposal far exceeds any possible grammatical, logical, systematic or teleological interpretation of these rules, in flagrant breach of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Similarly, both the Commission proposal and this report claim that the need for legislation to be harmonised - which would justify this interpretation that goes beyond the Treaties but which contravenes these same Treaties - is based on certain factors, which are invoked, despite the fact that no real evidence for them is presented."
"In fact, it is impractical 'to take account of the European Union's labour needs'."
"I believe that the differences between national legislation are quite acceptable and not damaging; any attempt to artificially standardise this field will be counterproductive and I think that the way in which it is blithely claimed that access will be opened both to external borders and to intra-Community movement is dangerous, because this overlooks the fact that the lack of security is one of the issues of greatest concern to the Union's citizens."
"I therefore voted against the report."
"It is clear both from the debate and from most of the motions for resolutions that the idea is to draw parallels between Porto Alegre and the economic forum in Davos, on the grounds that both are looking for a better method of global governance."
"The facts of the matter are very different."
"Although some people tried to play it down and others tried to gear it towards system management or turn it into a meaningless debating club, the movement against capitalist globalisation raised its voice loud and clear against the imperialist war and global social injustice in Porto Alegre."
"This movement did not come out of nowhere; it is linked to the struggle by the workers and the working classes and it draws on their experience and messages."
"It does not by any stretch of the imagination qualify as cross-class collaboration, as the Social Democrats would have us believe, on the grounds that the basic socialist/capitalist divide no longer exists."
"Nor can it confine itself to defending the rights of the developing world, now that the plutocracy has its sights set more firmly than ever on people in the developed world."
"The galloping escalation in the divisions within capitalist society will inevitably result in further radicalisation of the grass-roots masses, who are and always will be the force behind social change."
". (EL) The spread of illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and epidemics in the developing world has taken on genocidal proportions."
"Unfortunately, the international community is still addressing this issue with one eye on the interests of the big pharmaceutical multinationals."
"The European Union has recently taken a number of positive initiatives within the World Trade Organisation to allow underdeveloped countries to use so-called generic drugs to treat these all-out attacks on the health of their people."
"The European Parliament's resolution is an acceptable contribution in this direction."
"(PT) The Commission's proposals on the WTO negotiations on agriculture, which were given unanimous approval by the Council, are a further step towards a substantial liberalisation of farm trade, which maintains the current model, based on promoting exports and insists on the idea that liberalising trade will help developing countries. This overlooks the fact that this approach accentuates food dependency and specialisation based on monoculture for export dominated by the developed countries' food multinationals."
"Instead of further liberalisations, these proposals should take account of the injustices of the international trade system and call for the right to food sovereignty and security to be recognised, in other words, the right of all peoples to define their own agricultural and food policies. They should also advocate the right of all countries to ban the trade in GMOs."
"The proposal exceeds the framework of Agenda 2000, which had already made excessive concessions to the detriment of small and medium-sized family holdings."
"Hence our opposition to any agricultural negotiations within the WTO, which has been giving a further boost to the concentration, intensification and verticalisation of production and in this way, to the elimination of thousands of small and medium-sized holdings, in particular in Portugal."
"It should be noted that from the outset this proposal makes the interim review of the CAP a precondition, which demonstrates the hypocrisy of some delegations within the Council."
"Mr President, item 66 of the document on European transport policy seeks to improve road safety."
"That is all well and good, very good, but when will we manage to beat the fog?"
"In other words, when will we succeed in seeing through the fog and having fewer road accidents?"
"Today, thanks to the progress of technology, we can even see in the dark, with special infrared glasses."
"Why do we not spend Europe's money on better research so that, at last, all motorists have fog glasses?"
"Let us spend our money on this research too, which I am sure will yield positive results, making our roads safer and giving us a European transport policy which is truly the envy of the whole world."
"Mr President, I have voted in favour of this report."
"In my own country, the issue of the White Paper on Transport is a matter for vigorous debate."
"The White Paper on European transport policy points in the right direction, towards the opening-up of the railway market, the revision of the guidelines and of the TENs, and towards taking enlargement - which is almost upon us - into account in the area of transport."
"One of the White Paper's proposals is of enormous importance in view of something currently under discussion - the extension of the Austrian ecopoint system."
"A proposal for a framework directive to lay down the principles on which charges for the use of the infrastructure were to be imposed on all cross-border carriers was to have been presented as recently as 2002, yet, even today, we wait in vain for this directive on transport infrastructure costs, which is intended to at last facilitate a cross-subsidy, along Swiss lines, for the benefit of environmentally friendly means of transport and to pave the way for the transfer of traffic from road to rail."
"Such a transport infrastructure costs directive will be a criterion against which our credibility and the much-invoked European transport policy can be judged."
"We need it urgently!"
"- (FR) I heard a Member talking about a 'revolution in transport culture', and I say yes to that."
"Yes, we should encourage the development of clean transport systems, yes we should limit road traffic, and yes we should have a European transport policy which contributes to economic and social cohesion."
"However, there is one thing that we must not forget: there are real geographical and cultural differences between States, which explain the history of the transport systems of each one of them, and Europe should not seek to erase these differences."
"For example, in France there is great diversity between the various landscapes, especially in mountain regions and rural areas."
"If we want to treat our citizens fairly, wherever they happen to be in France, or in Europe for that matter, we cannot think dogmatically, as the Commission has done in its proposal."
"This proposal is lacking in pragmatism and does not take sufficient account of disparities in treatment at local level."
"When I see the flagrant lack of infrastructures in certain geographical areas, when they are already isolated, depopulated and abandoned, I cannot accept the guidelines set out in this White Paper, which continues to address only liberal concerns."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"- (FR) I voted in favour of the report."
"Transport policy is essential, both for economic development and for the preservation of the environment and of our living conditions, and this means that we have to take the long-term view."
"Improving the quality of transport means increasing the alternatives to road transport, in particular by giving support to rail transport and effectively implementing north-south links (Rhine-Rhone-Mediterranean via the Frankfurt/Lyons/Perpignan/Barcelona axis) and European interconnections (Lyons-Turin,?)."
"In this field, political willingness on the part of governments is sometimes lacking."
"Improving the efficiency of transport also means paying special attention to trans-European navigable waterway networks."
"All too often these projects are prevented from being implemented."
"Improving transport safety also means preventing foreseeable bad weather conditions from blocking roads and airports, leaving people to fall back on their own resources owing to the lack of sufficient capacity to react to such situations, and the lack of equipment or of efficient warning systems, even when the appropriate technology exists."
"Finally, I am not in favour of the creation of a European road safety agency."
"I do not think that we can solve the problems we are currently encountering by multiplying structures of this type."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated pursuant to Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"- (DA) The members of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party in the European Parliament voted neither in favour of, nor against, the first part of Amendment No 19."
"The ELDR Group is in favour of an environmentally friendly plan for traffic through the Alps, but such a plan must support the development of environmentally sound transport."
"That is not emphasised in the proposal."
". (EL) The Commission proposal and the report follow up and flesh out the policy set out in the White Paper on competitiveness, advocating the full liberalisation of the transport market."
"The ultimate aim is to increase the return on capital."
"Proclamations about safe transport and environmental protection are cancelled out by the philosophy of all-out, unaccountable competitiveness."
"The report welcomes the fact that a good deal of progress has been made with regard to liberalisation and competitiveness in transport."
"Using demand as its criterion, it highlights the advantages of road transport and focuses on the creation of high capacity north-south and east-west corridors."
"At the same time, it insists on the need to privatise the railways as a precondition for making them profitable."
"It also supports market access to port services and stresses the need for a uniform taxation and costing policy for transport."
"The Commission and the report are indifferent to the impact this policy has and will have on the standard, safety and cost of transport to the general public."
"It supports the single European sky, the abolition of national FIRs and flexible civil and military use of airspace; in conjunction with the general border changes taking place in the area as a whole, this spells danger for the security and national independence of countries such as Greece."
". (PT) I congratulate Mr Izquierdo Collado on the excellent report he has drawn up on the Commission White Paper entitled 'European transport policy for 2010: time to decide', which I fully support, in particular his call for the issue of the growing liberalisation of the transport sector to be accompanied by guarantees, investment, mobility, subsidies, price support and maintenance of services for remote and island regions."
"In this context I should like to emphasise that, due to the importance of transport for the development of the outermost regions, the European Parliament must, within this process, defend the commitments given to the outermost regions in the Treaty of Amsterdam, thereby contributing to economic and social cohesion in Europe."
"I should also like to point out that the safety of transport cannot be made conditional on its profitability and that, where the safety of road transport is concerned, I fully share the aim laid down by the Commission to achieve a 50% reduction in the number of road deaths by 2010, (totalling 20 000) and I support the proposal for the Community-level implementation of evidence-based measures that will enable this target to be achieved."
". (PT) The increasing attention paid to road safety represents added value for Portuguese interests."
"In fact, the adoption of this report will enable many problems experienced on Portuguese roads, and in particular on some roads in the Algarve, to be solved."
"Creating a European Road Safety Agency, as proposed in this report, seems, in my opinion, to be of enormous importance, particularly to 'speeding up developments in road safety and providing access to road safety data and best practice information across the EU.'"
"Furthermore, I think that the European Transport Fund, another of the measures proposed, is an important pillar for the proper development of infrastructures for roads, railways, maritime routes, river and sea ports and airports, in the aim of creating a European network of balanced and sustainable infrastructures."
"For all of these reasons I am persuaded to vote in favour on this matter."
"This report is based on a premise that is good for my country, since it seeks to launch new initiatives to improve access in the outermost regions."
". (PT) It is absolutely crucial that we adopt a realistic approach to this matter."
"Firstly because of the distant horizon of 2010, the deadline set by the Commission White Paper is directed and secondly, in light of the practical difficulties of implementing a very broad range of measures with meagre resources."
"This will be a good way of giving the Transport Policy the solvency and credibility that it needs."
"With regard specifically to freight transport, I have for a long time maintained that priority must be given to restoring rail transport and to developing short-sea and inland waterway shipping, rather than to the excessively overcrowded roads."
"Many of the problems of concern to the rapporteur, such as road safety, the prevention of bottlenecks, mobility and environmental protection, will be significantly alleviated by action designed to achieve this new balance, favouring the modes of transport that are most heavily penalised today."
"Internalising external costs, such as environmental costs, can also play a major role in this correction, obviously most heavily penalising the most polluting and most redundant forms of transport, which are also those most likely to cause bottlenecks."
"These are my reasons for voting in favour of the report."
". (PT) Transport is an essential sector of undeniable strategic importance for sustainable development and for economic and social cohesion throughout the Union because it transcends the economic and union interests of the sector and its quality affects the entire Community."
"We fully support the railways within the Union's transport system and call for top priority to be given to urgent changes to the terms governing its expansion, nature and adjustment to market conditions."
"We advocate the responsible liberalisation of European railway management."
"We support the institutionalisation of a European Transport Fund."
"Mr President, I am starting to feel the pangs of hunger so I will not deliver an explanation of vote this time."
". (PT) The potential delay in implementing third-generation mobile communications networks and services is today a major risk factor for a sector that has been considerably weakened by the bursting of the speculative bubble in the USA, which could have a knock-on effect on the communications and information technology sector and hence on the economy in general, given this sector's influence on telecommunications, and particularly on mobile communications, in some Member States."
"This situation is largely due to the great expectations raised for the sector's development and to the enormous financial sums obtained by some Member States by auctioning UMTS licences. Consequently, these States are now considering adopting unilateral aid to 'rescue' this sector from a situation of considerable debt."
"In addition to this risk factor, we must consider the issues of equal access for citizens to third-generation mobile communications, content-related issues, specifically in terms of public service provision, the consequences of the further liberalisation of the sector and the effects of radiation from the electromagnetic fields created by mobile phones, making it crucial to extend scientific research in this field."
"Mr President, I cannot refrain from delivering this explanation of vote."
"The document is entitled: 'eEurope 2005: An information society for all'."
"For absolutely everybody?"
"Mr Silvio Berlusconi has issued a letter giving money to students to buy computers."
"What about pensioners?"
"I would like pensioners not to be overlooked in this information society."
"I propose that, when pensioners draw their first pension payment, together with this first pension payment they should be given - and I stress, given - a computer, so that they too can enjoy the benefits, the marvels and the joys of information technology."
". We are all aware that for the European Union to remain competitive we must take full advantage of the new information technologies that are coming on stream."
"That is the core of the Action Plan for eEurope 2005 guaranteeing widespread availability of broadband networks throughout the EU. It also seeks to ensure the widespread use of the Internet through eGovernment, eLearning, eHealth and eBusiness initiatives."
"I represent a peripheral part of the European Union - both the western and border county regions in Ireland."
"It must remain a central European policy that the benefits of new technologies extend equally to all urban and rural parts of Europe."
"If access to these new technologies is not available, investors will locate their companies where the best available technology is."
"On issues such as information technology, there is the principle known as universal access."
"The cost of access to the internet must be the same whether the user is living in a rural part of Ireland or in a capital city in the European Union."
"We must do more to promote a dynamic e-business environment, and ensure that small and medium sized companies take full advantage of the new evolving technologies to meet that objective."
". (PT) I welcome the fact that the European Parliament has dedicated itself to a plan as important as eEurope 2005, in the aim of enabling the Member States to develop their online skills in the sectors of public administration, by modernising public services in order to guarantee universal accessibility; education, specifically the aim of guaranteeing broadband access for all educational establishments; health, by providing online health services to the population, and broadband data networks between the various points of healthcare provision, such as hospitals, laboratories and homes; and 'business', obviously not forgetting issues involving the technical means necessary to achieving these aims - extending bandwidth and multiplying channels - and the sensitive issue of the security of information."
"Despite the fact that there is generally consensus amongst Members on this issue, I think it important to register my vote in favour of this report."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of this report, and I agree, therefore, with the conclusions reached by the competent parliamentary committee on its content."
"I felt I should give my unequivocal support to promoting the skills - especially the technical and logistical skills - of the Member States, in order to achieve the aim proclaimed at the Lisbon and Santa Maria da Feira European Councils and later at the Barcelona and Seville Councils, to make the European Union the most competitive society in the world and in this respect at the forefront of the 'world information society'."
"This report must also be seen as forming a link with the Van Velzen and Khanbhai reports, because, as it states, a new era of high-quality content must be promoted, in which the Member States must have a special say and their own contribution to make."
"I therefore consider establishing priority action frameworks to promote online skills, as the report suggests, to be of the utmost strategic importance, especially in public administration, by modernising public services in order to guarantee universal accessibility; education, specifically the aim of guaranteeing broadband access for all educational establishments and health, by providing online health services to the population, and broadband data networks between the various points of healthcare provision, such as hospitals, laboratories and homes."
". (EL) The prospects and expectations of Lisbon are, unfortunately, a far cry from the situation on the ground in Europe."
"Europe has not only failed to take the lead in the most important technologies; it is still as far behind the USA as it was before, growth has slowed, unemployment has risen, new sciences are finding it hard to break into the market and regional disparities persist."
"Unfortunately, the summit Council does not appear to have a cohesive programme or proposals and the proposals by the leaders of France, Germany and Great Britain are confined to the industrial sector."
"The Spring Summit will need to set out new priorities, tailored to the current climate of economic recession and international tension, which include relaxing the Stability Pact criteria, tax incentives to boost labour intensive activities, special incentives to help regions lagging behind in the new technologies, joined-up interventions to upgrade the education system and monitoring the implementation of eEurope objectives in each Member State."
". (FR) When I spoke this morning I asked that this summit should not turn out to be a mere catalogue of good intentions and that the objective of full employment, with all the consequences that that implies, should become more or less the sole objective from which all the rest are derived."
"The resolution which was voted for and signed by Members on the Right and belonging to the PSE, was not acceptable, particularly since the votes had 'liberalised' it even more."
"I therefore voted against it."
". (IT) We would like to express our satisfaction at the proposals and at the commitment of the Presidency to the events ahead of us, and point out that a rapidly developing society brings cases of social exclusion as well as general prosperity."
"A policy which caters for the weakest is the hallmark of a civilised human community which has to meet the needs of the weakest too."
"We must preserve the family and the right to a dignified life as basic values, activating instruments to ensure equal access to education and work and preventing the spread of child pornography and all physical and moral violence."
"We must be more mindful of the environment, food security and animal rights, for these are issues related to quality of life."
"We need to prevent practices such as female genital mutilation which damage physical integrity and personal dignity."
"We need framework rules requiring each country to establish basic salaries and pension, health and welfare systems which reflect the true cost of living, and we need to bring about the effective participation of employees in enterprise profits and gain."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the votes."
"The sitting is suspended"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance face the prospect of their unity being shattered."
"Even though Europe is a sad sight to behold, there is an opportunity in every crisis, and so we should not be saying that a common European foreign and security policy makes no sense, or that it has failed; rather, we have to redouble our efforts in order that our foreign and security policy may indeed be shared by all of us."
"Any such policy must be founded on clear analysis, that analysis being that it is Saddam Hussein who is the problem, at the head of a regime of terror founded upon crime, terror and murder."
"Commissioner, Iraq is in fact a rich country, but its dictator has plundered it."
"So anyone who sees the USA as the problem is confusing cause and effect."
"It is the Iraqi dictator who is the problem."
"Our group is of the very decided opinion that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein are a menace to the region and imperil the peace of the world."
"It is under the UN's aegis that disarmament must take place; it must be peaceful if at all possible, and, if that proves impossible, military means must be employed."
"Responsibility for whether it happens peacefully or by military force lies solely with the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein."
"(Applause)"
"Let us just remind ourselves of the chronology of events."
"At the heart of disunity within Europe and across the Atlantic is the self-isolation of the Federal Republic of Germany, for which its present Chancellor must bear responsibility."
"(Applause from the right, heckling)"
"The German Federal Chancellor, by isolating Germany - whatever reasons he may have had for doing so - during a federal election campaign, in which he said, 'No matter what the UN does, we will never take part in it!', took the pressure off Saddam Hussein; he acted in an anti-European way, for one needs to speak first to the Europeans before coming out with utterances with such implications at public election rallies."
"He gave a complete repeat performance in the elections to provincial assemblies, but it brought him no success in terms of votes."
"We then come to the second chronological element, the Franco-German declaration at the celebrations of the Elysée Treaty."
"Speaking in terms of political psychology - and I do so for the benefit of our French friends in particular - this gave the false impression of the French position now being identical to the German one."
"The French were always much more sophisticated, but that was the political impression that was given."
"Then came the statement by the eight states."
"I am speaking for our group when I tell you that we regret this way of going about things, which bypasses the Community process, and that we cannot endorse it."
"In essence, the statement does meet with our approval, however."
"It was also necessary in order that we might send out a signal of friendship to our American partners."
"(Applause from the centre and from the right)"
"We are now faced with the question of what is to happen next."
"I recommend that we give thought to how we understand our relationship with America."
"If we understand European unity in terms of opposition to the United States of America, then we are building Europe upon sand."
"Rather than that, we want a partnership between the European Union and the United States of America, a partnership founded on cooperation between equals and on multilateral partnership."
"There are also, of course, things that we demand of our American partners."
"We do not think it right that the American administration under President Bush tends to see the USA's relationship with Europe in bilateral terms, in other words, Washington and Paris, Washington and London, Washington and Rome, Washington and Madrid, Washington and Berlin and so on. We have to define the relationship between the USA and Europe in such a way that Europeans can take common action and also in such a way that the European institutions are the American administration's partner in negotiations."
"(Applause)"
"For if we do not build this partnership of equals with America, that also goes against America's interests, as we now see, as European disunity has consequences for the North Atlantic Alliance."
"The American administration and President Bush should also recognise the value of European unity, which is also in the interests of the United States of America."
"If we in Europe were to revert to forming axes as we once did, then both our group and I would consider this a perilous road to go down."
"Just imagine - and I will not use the word 'axis' - that there were to be, as seems at present to be taking shape, something like two common positions, with Paris, Berlin and Moscow on the one side and London, Rome, Madrid and Washington on the other."
"If Europe were to present itself thus to the world, it would be a nightmarish sight."
"That is why we have to act within the framework of the Community."
"All the things we are doing now have to be done on a Community basis."
"That, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, is why our group supports your decision to call a summit meeting of the Heads of State and of Government."
"Let me say just a word or two on the subject of Turkey."
"If our Turkish partners ask us to involve them in planning and to supply them with weapons for their defence, I do not believe that we can refuse such a request, such an entreaty."
"I hope that we will also achieve a result on this issue."
"(Applause)"
"My wish for the Presidency of the Council next Monday is for three things to be achieved: a European common position, the bridging of the deep gulf between us and the United States, and the sending of a signal to the Iraqi dictator that he must disarm."
"It is to be hoped he will be brought to do this by peaceful means and under the guidance of the United Nations!"
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest achievement of European construction is the fact that for half a century we have broken the pattern of war, replacing it with peace and a shared destiny."
"The European peoples do not just co-exist in the Union, but we share a destiny in brotherhood and mutual tolerance."
"And we are still constructing Europe, with difficulties, but the united Europe is not the old Europe of endemic civil wars between us nor the new Europe which was preached by fascism and Nazism."
"At this time much more unites us than divides us."
"We all want peace, we are all against bloodthirsty dictators and we all want to see the disappearance of weapons of mass destruction."
"In families - and in the Union - there can be moments of tension, but we must be able to overcome them through solidarity and mutual compromise."
"The approach which can unite Europe is the mandate of the United Nations, respect for international law and the continuation of the inspectors' work."
"We are not condemned to war; we must work to give peace a chance."
"In this context, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Group of the European Socialist Party support and welcome the correct and timely initiative of President Simitis: we must do everything possible to find a common position and overcome the disagreements within the Council and also with the candidate countries, who are already members of our Union."
"I would like to correct Mr Poettering on a point relating to the isolation of the current German government."
"I would like to remind him that the first government of the German Federal Republic since the war to fully assume its responsibilities in the international field was the Socialist/Green coalition of Chancellor Schröder."
"Before that there was nothing more than passivity."
"Therefore the Schröder government is not isolated, it is in good company."
"From the point of view of our responsibilities as the European Parliament, we were significantly united in the resolution approved in January by a large majority - from which, curiously, the Group of the European Peoples' Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats withdrew at the last moment, after having negotiated it."
"My Group would ask the President to use the resolution as a guide for his speech on Monday, in which we urge him to make a solemn appeal and to insist on the need for the United Nations Security Council resolutions to be fully applied and complied with, to express opposition to any unilateral action and to consider that a preventive attack does not conform to the United Nations Charter, and that he also urge the Council and the Member States to take the initiative of proposing to the International Criminal Court that the Iraqi leader is responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity."
"In this regard, it is important to point out that at this time we must not anticipate events."
"The military machine must not be allowed to take on its own dynamic, leading us into war, the war is still avoidable and the United Nations Organisation is still necessary."
"The geopolitical effects of action adopted unilaterally outside the framework of the Security Council would be catastrophic not only for Iraq but for the whole of the Middle East, with unpredictable consequences."
"We must not forget that Iraq, despite everything, is still a secular and religiously pluralist regime, which is important in view of the situation of increasing fundamentalism."
"We have heard the Commission's report on the humanitarian issue - and I thank Commissioner Nielson - which also points out the risks involved in this."
"We must therefore carry on supporting the inspectors, insisting that Iraq comply with the resolutions of the Security Council without allowing it to make any excuse or evasive response."
"In this context, the inspection chiefs have noted that it is a positive step that Iraq has agreed to allow surveillance flights and is cooperating."
"At the moment, the international community has put is faith in the inspectors."
"They must continue their work and we must support them."
"Finally, Mr President, since 11 September we have insisted on the need to coordinate efforts with the United States and we have expressed our solidarity with this great country in the fight against the threat of international terrorism."
"This is not only a result of our historic gratitude and friendship, arising from the role of the United States in favour of European democracy in the two world wars."
"The issue today is not the extent to which we are friends on paper with the United States."
"We are in disagreement - and this must be said - over the doctrine of preventive war."
"We are even more in disagreement and we totally reject the unfortunate comments of the Secretary of State, Mr Rumsfeld, in Munich last week, insulting a European country and not explaining the thing he should explain: why, as Secretary of the Reagan administration, he went to Baghdad to give weapons of mass destruction to his then ally, Saddam Hussein."
"This must be explained."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I will end by saying that we are friends and allies who behave like genuine friends: we say what we think."
"We are allies of the United States as a result of shared historical responsibilities and principles."
"We must fight to give peace and hope a chance. We are not condemned to the disaster of war and mass destruction, and we call on President-in-Office Simitis to speak on behalf of a Europe with one harmonious voice next Monday."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, it seems hard to believe that the disunity of the world community as a whole, and the European Union in particular, could reach a lower point than when the 'gang of 8' prime ministers signed their ill-judged letter backing the USA on Iraq."
"But we are now plumbing new depths of public bickering, with the splits spreading from the UN and the EU to include Nato."
"Anarchy reigns in our international institutions, and that only provides comfort to Saddam Hussein."
"If we are to prevent these fissures becoming a chasm, our governments must draw back from their quarrels, return to first principles and move forward on the basis of what unites them."
"The United Nations, Nato, the European Communities - these institutions have served us well, and they are too valuable to be abandoned in the face of current differences of approach."
"And if that requires America to show a little patience, that is no bad thing."
"Public opinion in the US is less united than President Bush pretends - over a third still want a new UN vote to authorise any conflict, and almost a quarter do not want US troops to be sent to Iraq at all."
"When a former president pleads for patience, and leading Democrat Senator John Kerry hopes for an America: 'where military might is not clouded by our need for oil', is there really bipartisan backing for President Bush, to give him the credibility he needs?"
"Democracy can be difficult, and building support for a position often takes time and good arguments."
"But it is better to take the time to do it and get it right than to launch into a course of action, half cock."
"Liberals therefore congratulate the Greek Presidency on convening next Monday's meeting."
"We trust that all governments will attend."
"They should come prepared to listen and to seek common ground, not simply to repeat their well-known positions."
"Europe's leaders too should take care not to overplay their hand."
"The United Nations High Commission for Refugees is rightly following the maxim that they should prepare for the worst while continuing to hope for the best, by making contingency plans for a possible refugee crisis."
"As a collective defence organisation, Nato should be guided by the same principle, and it is the responsibility of every Nato country to support Turkey's request for assistance under Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty."
"Given the reservations he expressed last time, Dr Hans Blix's report on Friday will carry particular significance."
"Those who call for more inspectors should heed his remark that: 'the principal problem is not the number of inspectors but rather the active cooperation of the Iraqi side'."
"At the same time, if he reports progress towards active cooperation, the US and Britain should give the UN process the space to work."
"Amid all this gloom, perhaps we can take comfort from one ray of hope."
"When the inspectors report again on Friday, the eyes of the world will again be focused on the UN Security Council."
"It will be the body which represents the ultimate authority of the international community and considers Iraq's fate."
"We should welcome the fact that the UN, established to preserve world peace, is at the heart of the process."
"Let us keep it there."
"Mr President, the European Union is facing a test of truth."
"The attitude which it will shortly be taking towards the prospect of a new Gulf War will be crucial in defining our vision of Europe and our conception of the world."
"It will have to shoulder its responsibilities in circumstances which will leave no room for one of those woolly consensuses to which, all too often, we have become accustomed thanks to the common foreign and security policy."
"Hemmed in by the pressure from the Bush administration's call to arms on one side and the demands of European public opinion, which is massively opposed to it, on the other, there can be no middle way: we shall have to choose."
"In these circumstances, what message should Parliament be sending to the European Council?"
"Its resolution of 30 January was clear on the essential points, and is still entirely in line with our current view."
"Allow me to add a few points drawn from the moving experiences of the delegation of over thirty Members of the European Parliament, drawn from eleven countries and four political groups, which has just returned from Iraq."
"First of all I should like to brush aside the insidious remarks of those who have tried to portray us as being under an obligation to Saddam Hussein."
"On the contrary, even in the opinion of the journalists who were present, ours was the most independent delegation of any in recent times."
"After all, our links with the democratic opposition to the Baghdad regime and our absolute rejection of Saddam Hussein are sufficiently well known to enable me not to waste any more time on this unfounded, petty accusation."
"I hope, in this respect, that the European Parliament's ad hoc delegation to Iraq will not stop in New York but will continue to its final destination, Baghdad."
"Our delegation, by contrast, will proceed rapidly to New York and Washington, where the anti-war movement is growing day by day, reaching right to the heart of Congress."
"Well then, what did we see and hear in Iraq, and what collective conclusions have we drawn?"
"First of all there are the accumulated impressions and observations of the life of the population, from Baghdad and its most deprived suburbs to Basra, in the south, and Mosul, in the north, with its enormous camp for Turkish Kurd refugees."
"Everywhere, poverty is on a massive scale, and there has been spectacular social regression according to those who knew Iraq before the Gulf War, and even more so compared with what the country was like before the war with Iran."
"There is no longer an economy, apart from oil, exports of which have fallen by half due to lack of investment."
"In rural areas, all activities have collapsed, desertification is progressing and the population exodus is speeding up."
"UN agents are sounding the alarm: one third of the population is suffering from chronic malnutrition, and one third of children are seriously underweight."
"Infant mortality has exploded in the last ten years."
"More than eight thousand schools are in ruins and need repairs that would now be too costly."
"Students have no books, and teachers earn the equivalent of a few euros per month."
"In Iraq today, people do not live, they try to survive thanks to the meagre assistance provided by the 'oil for food' programme, which is financed using revenue from hydrocarbons and is managed directly by the government."
"This is the result of twelve years of embargo, and it is absolutely essential to put an end to this unbearable collective punishment."
"It is possible to get an idea of the memories left in people's minds by the war, by going, as we did, to the so-called demilitarised zone in the south of the country."
"There, the heaps of countless wrecked tanks, cars, jeeps and buses remind us that, in the final hours of the conflict, even as the Iraqi troops were falling back, a final bombardment claimed more than thirty thousand needless victims."
"Against this background, now, the predominant feelings are of fatalism, resignation, and silent traumatisation."
"A new war would undoubtedly lead to the catastrophic disruption of supplies of food and water."
"It would be a humanitarian disaster."
"In our view this reason alone is enough to rule out absolutely any new recourse to war, whatever the circumstances."
"There is also another reason, however, namely the risk of destabilising the whole region, starting with the Middle East, where the Palestinians are currently facing one of the worst situations in their history."
"The other striking experience in our view was our meeting with the spokesman of the inspectors and the director of the UN inspection centre in Baghdad."
"What they told us makes good sense. First of all, as long as the inspectors are present, it will be difficult for Saddam Hussein to manufacture prohibited weapons."
"Then again, it is completely impossible to complete such a mission in the space of two months, but given time, resources and the cooperation of the authorities, it will be possible to achieve the international community's objective, namely to ensure that Iraq no longer constitutes a threat to the world."
"This is why we stated publicly, on the spot, that in our view, at the present time, the only chance for Iraq lies in complete cooperation with the United Nations inspectors."
"This is also why the Franco-German proposals seeking to strengthen the resources of the inspectors now constitute, in our view, the only acceptable outcome of this crisis, ruling out any military action."
"This is the position that our group expects Member States to adopt, especially those among them who sit on the UN Security Council, particularly if they have the power of veto, which if necessary they should use if that is the only way of refusing to sanction the shameful actions of a team which is drunk with power and is currently placing world peace and equilibrium at risk."
"What credibility would the United Nations be left with if a policy of giving in to the strongest party were to lead a handful of states to violate so cynically the spirit of the UN Charter?"
"Next Saturday, throughout the world, a tidal wave without precedent in many countries will rise up and say no to war."
"We hope that as many Members of the European Parliament as possible will be seen at these demonstrations, because Europe has a duty to say no to an imperial machine, whose new strategic doctrine, as published by the Bush administration on 20 September last, illustrates its nature and its scope, namely the cult of military power, the thirst for domination, the claim to be able to act alone, if necessary, on a preventive basis, in order to achieve objectives which have nothing to do with world security."
"Following the events of 11 September, we said that we were allied but not aligned."
"This handful of Member State leaders who are ready to divide Europe at a signal from the White House needs to be reminded of this principle."
"As for the candidate countries, I believe that this is the time to let them know, in all frankness, before the ratification of the accession treaties, that we must be clear about our common ambition: let us not confuse the new Europe with the reform of NATO."
"We must keep abreast of European public opinion as it emerges throughout the continent."
"In the eyes of an increasing number of our fellow citizens, what the United States has gained in power it is losing in confidence, owing to the Messianic and megalomaniac behaviour of its leaders."
"This situation gives the European Union a historic responsibility, not against America, but against the dangerous desire for hegemony on the part of those who claim, on its behalf, to dictate to the world, only to lead that world into chaos."
"We are, as I said, facing a test of truth."
"History has not yet been written."
"Let us hope that those who are holding the cards are able to measure the weight of their responsibility."
"President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in every country in the European Union, the great majority of public opinion is still opposed to the idea of a war in Iraq."
"If the objective really being pursued is that of disarming Iraq, we must strengthen the inspection programme."
"The inspectors are the alternative to war."
"If, on the other hand, the objective is first and foremost to topple the Iraqi regime by force, then we must conclude, here and now, as the American Government has done, that the inspection programme has now become pointless."
"We must therefore confirm, at the Security Council on Friday, that the sole objective of Resolution 1441 is to disarm Iraq."
"I would remind you that the resolution adopted by the plenary session of the European Parliament on 30 January is clearly in line with this reasoning."
"This attitude in no way signifies that we accept the dictatorial nature of the Iraqi Government."
"It signifies that we do not want a change of regime to be brought about by war."
"That, Mr Poettering, is the attitude of the German Government, and it is not an isolated one: it is also the attitude of the French Government and the Belgian Government, and I hope that next Monday, at the European Council meeting, it will be the unified attitude of the fifteen governments of the Union."
"Whatever happens, I am proud of the position adopted by these various governments."
"I mentioned public opinion in Europe, but I should also like to talk, though not at such length as Mr Wurtz, about the fate of the people of Iraq."
"I too was a member of that delegation of 31 Members."
"The contact that we had there, both with the authorities of the UN agency and with the NGO officials, have led us unanimously to conclude that after two wars and the current embargo the Iraqi population is at the end of its tether."
"A new war in Iraq would obviously have catastrophic humanitarian consequences, and this was confirmed to us by all the UN workers whom we met in Baghdad."
"Is this really how we imagine we are preparing a future for the people of Iraq?"
"Finally, in order to give some hope back to the people of Iraq, I should like to emphasise, as I already have done and as we already did at the previous plenary session, the need to change the embargo arrangements."
"Before 11 September 2001, the whole of the international community recognised the negative effects of this embargo, which is helping the dictatorship and keeping the population in a state of dependency while at the same time stifling the Iraqi economy."
"I propose that, at the same time as we intensify the inspection programme, there should also be a revision of the mandate of the 'oil for food' programme, which would make it possible to buy local products, thereby encouraging the Iraqi economy to make a fresh start, and which would also give responsibility for distributing food rations to the UN World Food Programme."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, this is an exceptionally important debate."
"Tensions are certainly rising in an international context."
"If we are not careful, and if this crisis is badly handled, this will only result in serious and long-term consequences for us all on many fronts."
"It would be tragic if the authority of the United Nations is weakened to a point where it loses international credibility."
"That is why it is so necessary to guarantee that the United Nations is involved at each and every stage of the developments to disarm the Iraqi Government of its weapons of mass destruction."
"International security is best served in a collective sense, via global institutions such as the United Nations."
"In many ways, it is even more important for smaller Member States to have their security protected by an international organisation such as the United Nations."
"This is the crux of the issue."
"There is genuine good will, support and confidence on the part of the people of Europe in the work of the United Nations."
"In fact, no one would dispute for one moment the professionalism and integrity of the United Nations officials who are officially involved in the inspection missions in Iraq."
"The United Nations has been involved in the whole process to disarm the Iraqi Government of its weapons of mass destruction."
"The United Nations must remain a central player in this ongoing process of disarmament."
"Any unilateral action in the coming weeks would gravely and seriously damage the authority and credibility of the United Nations as an organisation involved in maintaining international governance in the world."
"Weapons inspections must continue as long as the inspectors themselves and the United Nations Security Council believe that they will serve a useful purpose."
"We all want to see a peaceful solution to this issue by guaranteeing the compliance of the Iraqi Government with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441."
"Saddam Hussein must recognise that the international community wants to resolve this issue by peaceful means."
"Disarming Saddam Hussein in a peaceful manner is by far the most acceptable and preferable course of action for all of us."
"EU governments are meeting next Monday to review the political situation."
"This meeting is taking place at a time of rising tension between the different European Union states."
"I certainly hope that this meeting can and will be used to defuse this tension which simply serves no one's interests whatsoever."
"This meeting will take place only a few days after the next United Nations weapons inspectors' report is published."
"We must continue to try to secure a common European position on Iraq, notwithstanding the very clear differences in approach to this issue that now exist between the different EU governments."
"We must all try to approach the next few weeks collectively in a calm and reasoned manner."
"However, Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to defy the authority of the United Nations as he has sought to in the past."
"We must not forget that this is a man who brutally abuses the human rights of his people."
"He has used chemical weapons on his own people; he has invaded Iran and Kuwait and bombed Saudi Arabia and Israel in the past."
"This is certainly a track record of brutal belligerence."
"Saddam Hussein needs to be disarmed, and he must recognise that the international community will continue to demand that he does disarm."
"However, the United Nations must continue to be the organisation that oversees the implementation of United Nations Resolution 1441 or any future resolutions that may be agreed at the UN on this very important and sensitive matter."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that there is only one person at this time, shut up in his 13 palaces, who is happy and feels in a stronger position because of what is happening."
"That person is Saddam Hussein."
"That person - I do not know whether it is his evil genius or our or your stupidity - has succeeded in very little time in exposing the European crisis, the Nato crisis and what we hope, at least, will not be a United Nations crisis."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the alternative to war is not, for democrats, the status quo, that bloodthirsty, cruel dictatorial regime described by many of you as 'peace'."
"The alternative is politics, and it is the role of politics to define what kind of peace, what kind of conditions, what kind of rules."
"Yet, here, there have been no political proposals, apart from a few banalities, and, whether this self-important House likes it or not, the only political proposal currently on the table is for a free, democratic Iraq governed by a transition government under the auspices of the United Nations, which would mastermind the democratic transition for Iraq and the Iraqi people."
"You see, you are incapable of doing anything except mumbling 'peace'."
"And what does that mean, pray?"
"Peace for whom?"
"For the oppressed Iraqis?"
"You will go out in your millions to demonstrate for peace and Arab public opinion will see you as supporting Saddam Hussein, whether you like it or not."
"If you had taken 'A free Iraq' as your slogan, that would have weakened the conflicting arguments and created such a strong position that even Saddam Hussein would have seen the advantages of going into exile."
"That did not happen, and just look at the chaos."
"I hope that, at the European Council, this single proposal, which has now been signed by thousands of people, will be the only point of convergence."
"I believe it can enable us to regain some of our lost dignity."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have just been listening carefully to the President-in-Office of the Council setting out what the extraordinary summit on the 17th is intended to do."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I think it would be a very good thing if we really could find a common position on the points you have set out."
"They are also the essential points of the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 30 January, with which you are no doubt well acquainted."
"I would like to take a close look at these four points."
"The removal of all weapons of mass destruction from Iraq is not at issue."
"That, I believe, is something we can all agree on, as, no doubt, we do on support for UNMOVAC and IAEA, that is to say, for the inspectors' attempts to bring all this about in Iraq."
"Where we will have difficulties, and where it is important that we be clear in our own minds, is with the maintenance of the UN's primacy."
"That international organisation is in charge of the process and must remain so; it alone is capable of endowing with legitimacy whatever measures will turn out to be necessary in this case."
"We also have to make clear our opposition to unilateral courses of action and, most certainly, our opposition to a preventive war."
"The final point that needs to be made is that we must try everything that occurs to us as individuals and groups as a means of averting this war and finding a peaceful solution."
"There are many possibilities for this."
"The latest proposals put forward in Europe point in this direction."
"There is one point I would like to address and one prefatory remark I would like to make in order to make Mr Poettering's speech comprehensible."
"This House is perhaps not aware that we had elections in Germany on 22 September last year."
"They were won by Gerhard Schröder and not by Mr Stoiber."
"That is something with which Mr Poettering cannot yet come to terms, and he believes that his speeches in this Parliament will bring about Mr Schröder's downfall in Germany."
"He can carry on believing that, but I do not believe that this House is particularly interested."
"We have quite different problems with which we should be getting to grips."
"One of those problems is that with the candidate countries."
"I think we have to make abundantly clear to the future members of the European Union the importance of the principle of solidarity, which is in every respect equal to the Copenhagen criteria and all the other technocratic criteria by which - so to speak - their readiness for accession was measured."
"I do not find it acceptable for these states, at this point in time, to make affirmations of solidarity, although I too welcome solidarity with the United States of America and have nothing against it."
"What is of primary importance, though, is solidarity with the European Union, which is to accept them as Member States and has made massive efforts in order to do so."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, a great deal is being said at them moment about Europe being divided."
"I believe that never has Europe been so united at the level of its peoples as it is today in rejecting this war in Iraq."
"Opinion in all the Member States and in the candidate countries is between 80% and 90% opposed to war."
"And I wonder how Mr Poettering, whom I have known for twenty years now, can make himself so remote from the opinions of his own people."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I was also part of a delegation from the Verts/ALE Group which went to Iraq last week, and we would like to say to those eminent Members of Parliament who criticised the visit that it was an important and timely initiative for peace, during which we also had occasion to criticise the Iraqi Government in no uncertain terms and call for the resignation of Saddam Hussein."
"There is genuine desire for peace in Iraq."
"It is a country devastated by sanctions, with teachers and university professors earning as little as USD 10 per month and 3 000 children a month dying of malnutrition and the lack of essential medicine."
"If war finally breaks out there, the only means through which the country presently survives - the Oil for Food programme - will come to an end and throw the country into massive chaos."
"It will create 900 000 refugees - those are not my figures, they are figures produced by the United Nations - who will flee, not to America, but to countries in the Middle East and Europe, creating an unprecedented humanitarian aid disaster."
"If the human tragedy unfolding before us can be resolved peacefully - and I am heartened by the initiative of several countries now, calling for more staff resources and more time for the weapons inspectors and for the possible intervention of a UN peace keeping force - then surely that is the only alternative before us."
"If weapons inspectors can avoid the deaths of half a million civilians, then that is surely the only logical course of action we can consider."
"This imminent war is also about human rights and democracy in Iraq."
"I visited a Kurdish refugee camp in Makhtur in northern Iraq, where 10 000 refugees from Turkey are captives in their own camp."
"They are allowed to leave the camp only under strict surveillance."
"The latest understanding between America and Turkey, ceding control over the whole of the devolved Kurdish territory in the north of Iraq, is a nightmare scenario in which the Kurds will again face persecution and attack."
"How long can the international community allow the continued suffering of the Kurdish people?"
"Democracy must apply to all in any new Iraqi administration: to the Kurds, the Shias and the Turkmens and, of course, to the Iraqis themselves."
"But it must be achieved through peaceful means, not through the bombing and killing of half a million defenceless men, women and children."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Le Pen is applying the yardstick in not quite the right way."
"If anyone is a mass murderer, it is Saddam Hussein; of that there is no doubt."
"The question is by what means he may be disarmed. We have to make clear the necessity of using every possibility of a peaceful solution, no matter how difficult that may be in the days that remain to us."
"I am very grateful to the Greek Presidency of the Council for having, despite the behaviour of many Member States of the European Union over recent weeks and months, summoned a special summit, in order that, in what one almost has to call a free-for-all in the European Union, we may seize the opportunity to pause for a moment and consider where there might be common ground, where we can still join in playing our part, in order to make a positive contribution."
"I hope that they will be supported by many Members of this House and that Monday's summit will meet with the success it deserves, so that Europe does not end up looking foolish on the sidelines of this dispute."
"I think it is important to see that there must be no emotional reflex actions."
"Although historical parallels are never a good idea, I sometimes get the feeling that we are in something like the summer of 1914, and so I believe that we all have to engage in renewed dialogue with each other, so that we Europeans, being united on the essentials, can take our place in the negotiations on the final United Nations resolution, which must aim to make good use of every opportunity for peace, whilst at the same time making it clear that Saddam Hussein has to be disarmed."
"If the relevant United Nations resolution makes it possible for this to be done by force if need be - but only if we avoid unilateralism - then we have a chance of doing this."
"But the use of force can be avoided only if Europeans present a united front."
"All those who have violated this unity have also thrown away Europe's chance of playing a part in this dispute."
"Mr President, on the issue of Iraq, Europe is not divided."
"Its governments are, but its public opinion is not."
"As we all know, the majority of European public opinion is united against war."
"So the discussion on the division of Europe, in relation to the CFSP, must take this aspect into account."
"And, incidentally, the European citizens should take this into account when casting their votes in the forthcoming elections."
"However, there is an aspect which worries me particularly and that is the high number of governments of European candidate countries who have joined an operation which, rather than reinforcing European values and principles, supports the warlike approach of a non-European superpower whose values, such as the death penalty and the rejection of the International Criminal Court, are not our values."
"Having said that, I also have faith in the public opinion of those candidate countries."
"I am less optimistic when it comes to the gulf separating us from the United States, or rather the gulf which the Bush Administration is widening every day."
"I believe it is a bad sign that some sections of the so-called 'liberal' press in the United States are tending to jump on the war bandwagon and that in doing so it is furthermore using insults which are not supposedly worthy of it."
"Thus, regrettably, we have recently read this sentence in the New York Times: 'Only an imbecile or perhaps a Frenchman could be insensitive to Colin Powell's arguments'."
"Well, I would declare myself French and insensitive."
"This francophobia is being cultivated alongside germanophobia."
"It has just been said insultingly of the other unfortunate partner from the old Europe: 'The Germans do not play any important role in international decision-making', said by Richard Perle, one of Minister for War Rumsfeld's tough advisers."
"Well, in view of this I would declare myself to be German and a Social Democrat."
"(Applause)"
"In my opinion, though, the greatest and most significant blunder is from Richard Boucher, spokesman for the State Department."
"As you know, Bin Laden has just said in a very timely manner that, in the face of the aggression being prepared, all Muslims should support the Iraqis, despite the fact that the latter are socialists and apostates."
"Rather than coming to the opposite conclusion, Mr Boucher not only states that this proves the links between Al Qaeda and Iraq, but he also adds: 'We have already said that this is a fight by civilisation to protect the civilised countries'."
"So it now turns out, Mr President, dear friends, that the Bush Administration sponsors war between civilisations."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, the risk of terrorism is omnipresent now."
"The dull and brooding presence of sudden, unanticipated and violent death hangs over military and civilians alike in all our nations."
"Links have been found recently between the Al Qaeda network and pro-Saddam forces fighting the free Kurdish people in northern Iraq."
"However, a much better established and older terrorist organisation has been working inside Iraq since 1986: the MKO, or MEK as they are known inside the USA."
"The MKO have thousands of members inside Iraq and thousands outside, financed, equipped, armed and trained by the Iraqi army and fully engaged, militarily at least, since 1986 in all of Saddam's many wars."
"The USA froze MEK assets in 1994, declaring the group under its many aliases to be an international terrorist organisation."
"The EU followed the US example as late as 2001, yet last week the New York Times published a full-page advertisement for the MEK, using the names and photographs of members of the US Congress and claiming their support."
"Our recent debates on Iraq have been attended by known members of MKO."
"These people are a threat to world security."
"Their organisation strikes silently but with lethal impact."
"This is Saddam's private international terrorist army, working against us all."
"Whatever our differences on the future treatment of Iraq, for the sake of our citizens and global safety, I urge that far greater security attention be paid to the MKO."
"For war or no war, with or without a war, the criminals who make up the MKO continually kill and destroy the innocent among us."
"Mr President, last week I went to New York with a delegation from this Parliament, and there we had, I must say, impressive discussions with Dr Hans Blix and Kofi Annan, but we, as a delegation, were also witness to a shameful performance in which four ambassadors from EU countries that are members of the Security Council made not the slightest effort to hide their differences."
"That was humiliating, but was it inevitable?"
"It is not clear."
"I know that it will be extremely difficult to reach agreement at next Monday's summit of European leaders, but I refuse to accept that this is inevitable."
"There are the French proposals to increase the number and power of the inspectors."
"Next Friday, there will probably be a cautiously positive report from Dr Hans Blix and Mohamed El Baradei in favour of doing just that."
"I would therefore make an urgent plea to the governments of Great Britain, Spain and Italy to stop playing the role of yes men to the United States and to at last seize the very real chances we still have to disarm Iraq by peaceful means."
"I urge those same governments not to turn their backs on Europe."
"Many Members have said this already this afternoon: all the opinion polls in all the European countries point to one thing: it is not the French government, not the German government and not the Belgian government that have become isolated; instead it is Tony Blair, José María Aznar and Silvio Berlusconi that have lost touch with European reality."
"To the Eurosceptics in this Parliament, and also to the United States, who are quite happy about this discord among the EU Member States and see it as proof that it is unlikely that anything will ever come of one joint European policy, I would say this: this Parliament is a European institution that, in its pronouncement in its last resolution, gave a voice to the vast majority of the European population and that voice says 'no war'."
"I sincerely hope, therefore, that, next Monday, that voice of the vast majority of the European population resounds in the heads and hearts of the European Heads of Government, too."
"Mr President, UN Resolution 1441 must be complied with."
"Some say that this is exclusively Saddam Hussein's responsibility."
"They are placing the fate of the world in the hands of a psychopathic dictator."
"We too have a responsibility, namely to work out how much cooperation is required here and now in order to prevent a war."
"When we were in Baghdad last week, the weapons inspectors made it quite clear that, if they were to continue to be present, Saddam Hussein could neither develop new weapons nor use those he already has."
"We must give the weapons inspectors more time."
"We must support the Franco-German proposal, and we must do so partly on humanitarian grounds."
"UNHCR has drawn attention to the fact that 100 000 Iraqis would die in the first 48 hours of a war."
"Seven million people would be without food, and 22 million debilitated Iraqis would be without clean drinking water."
"There would be a danger of civil war."
"Dare we take responsibility for all this by demanding that UN resolutions be complied with to the letter here and now?"
"I also think that this debate is too serious to be subordinated to domestic policy."
"Mr President, we are glad that the European Council has been called, as my Group has demanded."
"I imagine that the Greek Presidency will be holding very intense contacts in order to propose a common position, because intentions are not sufficient."
"But it did not take this crisis to demonstrate that one of the gaps that reform of the Treaties must confront is the lack of instruments to promote the common foreign and security policy."
"In fact, it is now exactly two years and seven months, Mr Nielson, since the Commission committed itself to adopting an initiative to respond to Parliament's proposals on common European diplomacy."
"We are still waiting."
"Meanwhile, the Member States have taken positions."
"I believe that the Franco-German axis is very positive in terms of promoting European integration, but with 15 Members, and particularly with 25, nobody, by definition, can assume they speak for the European Union, and neither do I believe - as some do - that the European identity must by definition be in opposition to the United States."
"At this point the European institutions should take concrete initiatives - and I have not seen any - within the framework of Euro-Mediterranean relations, because the danger does not come from Islam but from the Iraqi regime, and also, despite all the difficulties, initiatives to re-launch the battered Middle East peace process."
"And since there has been reference to European history, that history shows that complacency, the failure to meet responsibilities in relation to despotic dictators, for whom expansionist ambitions are intrinsic, may be more comfortable in the short term and also more popular - there were no opinion polls in 1938 but now there are - but sooner or later they cost us dearly in terms of freedom and human lives."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what happens next week will surely not be about playing Europe off against America, but about countering the Bush Doctrine with an unambiguous European position."
"The Bush Doctrine is founded on the assumption of the unilateral use of military might, underpinned by a commitment to preventive warfare."
"We in Europe must affirm our commitment to a multilateral approach, in other words, to the United Nations."
"We in Europe must start by using every means other than military force."
"We in Europe reject the theory of preventive strikes against potential dangers."
"We affirm our commitment to containing them, above all when this approach has a chance of success."
"What does that mean in terms of Iraq?"
"I believe it to mean that we all, out of profound conviction, abhor this regime in Iraq and its inhumanity."
"Everyone living in Iraq has the right to democratic government."
"Anyone who campaigns - as I do - for the rights of the Kurds in Turkey cannot fail to campaign for the rights of Kurds in Iraq."
"Yet no one country and no alliance - be it an alliance of the willing or of the unwilling and dependent - may claim for itself the right to simply get rid of disagreeable governments, and, moreover, to use massive force in doing so - not, above all, when a policy of containment has a chance of succeeding."
"Everyone living in the region and beyond it has a justified interest in weapons of mass destruction not ending up in the hands of Saddam Hussein."
"Is it not possible, though, to use inspections, surveillance flights, and other non-violent means to prevent him from getting his hands on dangerous weapons?"
"Europe must surely not allow itself to be characterised by the pursuit of a policy of non-resistance and appeasement in the face of the present dangers."
"Is that, though, a reason for denying Europe the right to refuse to let fly with a war waged in the way that President Bush and Mr Rumsfeld want?"
"We Europeans contend particularly for democracy and the rule of law in the Arab world, but we do not do it with weapons in our hands."
"Even 'old Europe' seeks a secure source of oil and gas, but do we therefore have the right to wage war for the sake of oil?"
"We do not!"
"If, moreover, doubt is cast on our clear and unequivocal commitment to the UN and to its resolutions, are we in this House not aware of how many UN resolutions have not been complied with?"
"Are we not aware that there is a UN resolution, relating to this region, that dates back to 1947 and has still not yet been complied with?"
"Even so, we are not willing to go to war, and rightly!"
"So I do believe that, yes, we are to help the United Nations get what it is entitled to."
"Yes, we are to strive for all the resolutions to be complied with, but that must mean all the resolutions - those on Palestine as much as those on Iraq."
"Then our position would be a truly European one."
"(Loud applause)"
"Mr President, after both the First and Second World Wars, people demanded 'No More War!', and the international legislation drawn up in order to give this demand tangible form expressly incorporated a clearly defined ban on the use of force, making the use of it subordinate to the United Nations."
"They expressly rejected any preventive war of aggression without United Nations approval."
"Any preventive strike against Iraq on the part of America and Great Britain would, without a doubt, be in breach of international law, and its consequences for the Middle East, for the Arab world, but also for the world community as a whole, would be incalculable."
"If one or more states arrogate to themselves the pre-eminent right to use force and take the law into their own hands, that amounts to unmitigated private warfare, the so-called law of the strong, one of the characteristics of which is that it breeds more private warfare."
"Looking at things from this angle, the European Union must do everything possible to avert a unilateral war of aggression."
"Europe's peoples have long known this, and now it is time for European politics to grasp it."
"Mr President, I welcome this debate on the eve of Monday's Summit, for Europe must speak out for peace, in support of all initiatives which can prevent war in Iraq."
"The Council, the Commission and Parliament, acting together, can help to bring about a change in the situation in Baghdad."
"However, war can be avoided if Saddam Hussein leaves his country or if he can provide concrete evidence that he has destroyed all the prohibited weapons."
"Thus far, the dictator has failed to comply with the United Nations' requests formulated in the 1991 resolution."
"If Iraq had behaved like South Africa, Belarus or Kazakhstan, we would not be in this tragic situation now."
"The Baghdad regime is guilty of a major violation of the will of the UN."
"Iraq has, in practice, failed to comply."
"I wonder, and I put it to you, whether it is still possible to prevent conflict."
"It may be, but Europe must stand united, the international community must stand united."
"Indeed, the Iraqi regime will use each division, each sign of weakening, to attempt to strengthen its own positions."
"That is why the Union must speak with a single voice in order to bring about peace, but also in order to ensure the safety of the citizens, who are still at the mercy of terrorist organisations which are threatening to use bacteriological and chemical weapons which may still be in Iraq."
"That is why I support the position calling upon the institutions and governments of Europe to follow three guidelines."
"Firstly, to strengthen relations between the countries of the Union in order to achieve a common position."
"Secondly, to prevent divisions between the United States and the European Union, and, in this regard, I agree with the Italian politician who said that Europe cannot exist if it stands apart from or in opposition to the United States of America."
"Thirdly, to make every endeavour to preserve the credibility of the multilateral organisations, NATO and the UN."
"In conclusion, Mr President, not forcing Saddam Hussein to respect the United Nations resolution is tantamount to divesting the Security Council of its authority."
"This is the line being taken by the Italian Government, which will be at the helm of the Union during the second half of the year."
"I feel this is another reason why we must pay careful attention to and support the peace-keeping initiatives emanating from Rome."
"Mr President, I have to say that I was more than a little surprised to hear Commissioner Nielson's opening remarks."
"He said that the poverty in Iraq at the moment is a result of the Iran-Iraq war, the Gulf war and ten years of international sanctions."
"I heard no mention whatsoever that Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction to kill hundreds of thousands of his own people."
"Nor was there any reference to the fact that Iraq has a corrupt dictatorship which represses freedom, stifles initiative and siphons off money that was intended for food and medicines for its own people under the oil-for-food programme, but is instead used by Saddam to build more of his own palaces."
"We must be clear that the villain of this piece is Saddam Hussein - full stop!"
"Any weakening of that position will make war more, not less, likely."
"Commissioner Nielson also said that this is not an institutional problem, but then he gave us an institutional solution."
"He said that we could solve all these problems by more QMV."
"QMV will not create the political will to have common policies."
"We should have a common foreign and security policy - not a single policy but a common policy."
"We all have our views on how it is that the common policy set in Copenhagen has suddenly somewhat disintegrated."
"The French President is very good at the rhetoric of European cooperation, but not so good at the practical aspects and seems to think common policies apply to everyone but him."
"Nonetheless, we must have a common policy."
"That much is very clear."
"Let us remind ourselves that Resolution 1441 states that Iraq is already in breach of UN resolutions and has been for over ten years and that any obstruction will lead to serious consequences."
"We have to be united in accepting that those serious consequences will follow."
"Any weakening of that position runs the risk of undermining world global security."
"If we are to resolve this situation we need less name-calling and a more coherent approach."
"Mr President, 12 years ago this month, we saw the cease-fire after the liberation of Kuwait."
"In March 1991, UN Resolution 686 set out the conditions of the cease-fire."
"In April 1991 UN Resolution 687 required Iraq to accept the internationally supervised destruction, removal or rendering harmless of all chemical and biological weapons, agents and components."
"In August 1991, UN Resolution 707 condemned Iraq's non-compliance."
"Now, after 12 years of flouted UN resolutions, 12 years of internal oppression and torture, 12 years of violence against the Kurds and Shi'ites of his own country, Saddam Hussein has been given a last chance."
"And yet, unlike when we took action to rescue the Falklands, Kuwait and Bosnia, this time our constituents are uneasy and uncertain."
"They see no unity of purpose among the governments of Europe."
"They see Member States declining to comply with their Nato obligation to protect Turkey against the possibility of attack."
"Their fears are confirmed that a European defence policy could be dangerous for Nato."
"They do not know why action is being proposed, what is supposed to happen at the end of it and which countries might be next."
"The guilt of Saddam Hussein is in effect being compounded by the failure of our leaders to explain."
"My own Prime Minister, Mr Blair, has abysmally failed to persuade the British people."
"He could not even persuade a single one of his own Labour MEPs to vote for his policy."
"Unlike Iraq, we are democracies."
"Unlike Saddam, Mr Blair, you cannot go to war without heeding the concerns of your own people."
"It is time we set out the facts and destroyed the myths."
"UN inspectors are not like a team of archaeologists excavating for ancient Mesopotamia in the sand."
"It is not their task to play 'seek' to Saddam's 'hide'."
"They are there to assess Saddam's evidence of how, when and where he has destroyed or handed over his weapons of mass destruction."
"We do not need more inspectors."
"Mr Blix has confirmed that."
"We need compliance by Saddam Hussein."
"Where are those precursor chemicals, the munitions?"
"Where are the tonnes of bulk chemical warfare agents: 1.5 tonnes of VX nerve agent, 10 milligrams of which on the skin results in rapid death?"
"I do not believe that any of us want war."
"We want peace, but we want a peace that is free from the threat of terrorism."
"Saddam Hussein needs to understand that either he complies in full with the UN resolutions or he risks plunging his own people, once again, into the suffering of war."
"Mr President, as everyone knows, the Portuguese Prime Minister signed the letter from the European heads of state and government because he believes it is crucial to ensure that Iraq disarms and complies with Resolution 1441."
"The Portuguese Members of the European People's Party unreservedly support this view because this is a clear position underpinned by the political tradition of the European democracies, based on the transatlantic alliance with the democracy represented by the US and also, it should be remembered, by Canada, Australia and many other democratic countries in the world."
"It comes as no surprise that today this approach has the support of the overwhelming majority of European countries, within the European Union, amongst those who will be joining it in the forthcoming round of enlargement, and also amongst other countries on the continent."
"Nevertheless, recent events that have led to a crisis in NATO and to the danger of a veto in the Security Council by Member States of the Union pose a serious risk to the unity of Europe."
"What we are seeing is that there can be no common foreign policy based on anti-American prejudice and on complacency towards the threat from dictators who present a danger to world peace, such as Saddam Hussein."
"We should, therefore, bear in mind some aspects that should not be forgotten:"
"firstly, Europe does not have strategic defence capacity against the new forms of international terrorism that are bound up with the States that support them;"
"secondly, the only strategic defence body of which Europeans countries are members is NATO."
"If this body goes into crisis, it is Europe that will suffer most at the hands of its enemies, more than the United States, for example, because Europe cannot defend itself."
"The crisis in NATO will make any common defence policy for the European Union impossible;"
"thirdly, for the enlargement countries, with their recent experience of totalitarian regimes, security concerns are vital."
"Provoking a crisis in NATO will be profoundly damaging to these countries and will cause them to have confidence only in bilateral strategic alliances with the United States, outside the framework of the European Union and of NATO."
"It would be extremely bad if these countries' freedom to take political decisions suffered because they do not agree with some, and I repeat some, countries of the European Union."
"Lastly, the effect of a crisis in NATO will isolate the Europeans, and will reinforce the United States' tendency to act unilaterally."
"If the United States and its allies, including the majority of European countries, were to embark on military action in order to ensure compliance with Resolution 1441 without the explicit support of the European Union and with NATO in deadlock, the damage caused to European alliances will be very difficult to resolve."
"This is my request to the Council and the Commission; please use the little time available to you to prevent action being taken to force Iraq to comply with the Resolution without there being unity amongst the countries of Europe."
"The majority of the members of the Security Council seem to want to give peace another chance."
"They prefer to disarm Iraq by peaceful means, using the weapons inspectors."
"More pressure must be put on Iraq to cooperate."
"Parliament has contributed to this through its resolution and by a number of MEPs travelling to Baghdad to explain our position."
"A majority in Parliament is on the same wavelength, therefore, as the majority of the public."
"It is remarkable that the governments of some Member States would rather take the side of the United States than that of their own citizens."
"Even Turkey, traditionally a staunch supporter of the United States, considers war to be very risky."
"And then people say that France, Germany and Belgium are isolated!"
"Would it not be the US, rather, that was isolated if they could not bring to bear a whole arsenal of means of coercion?"
"It is not enough to make every effort to stave off a military invasion of Iraq."
"Peaceful means must indeed be used to bring Iraq not only to disarm, but also to change, to respect human rights, to respect the right to life and respect for the diverse peoples and cultures within the Iraqi borders and to respect for all the peoples in the region."
"(Text abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"It now seems to be an established fact that the Government of the United States is determined to go to war against Iraq, whatever the Security Council decides."
"With or without the authorisation of the Security Council, this war is unjustifiable."
"Of course we must hope that reason will prevail within the Security Council and that, if there is a war, it will be formally contrary to international legality."
"Those thirty or so of us who have just been to Iraq were able to see for ourselves the state of material and moral dilapidation of the country, trapped as it is between a ludicrous and bloody dictatorship and the sanctions imposed by the international community."
"The Iraqi army is merely a shadow of its former self, and is formidable only in the hallucinations of the American President."
"What concerns the oil-obsessed Government of the United States is of course control of the black gold, and not the weapons of mass destruction which, as the experts know full well, Iraq does not possess."
"This war will be another crushing blow for people who are already suffering greatly, particularly the Kurdish population."
"Among those people it will give rise to lasting and justified hatred of the West, and will cause innumerable tragedies."
"This crisis shows how far Europe still has to go before it becomes anything other than an integrated economic area."
"(Written statement abbreviated in accordance with Rule 120(7) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The next item is the debate on oral questions to the Council and the Commission (B5-2/2003 and ?5-3/2003), on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the 2002 Annual debate on an area of freedom, security and justice."
"Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the annual debate on an area of freedom, security and justice must be seen against the broader backdrop of the progress that has actually been made in the course of the last year, as a result of the commitment of the successive Spanish and Danish Presidencies. This debate must also be seen in the context of the forthcoming enlargement and of the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe."
"First of all, I wish to congratulate Baroness Ludford on the quality of the questions she has put to the Commission and to answer the first of these by saying that the Commission still takes the view that the future Treaty on the area of freedom, security and justice should enshrine the principle of the Commission's exclusive right of legislative initiative."
"Indeed, we feel that the transfer of the majority of legislative aspects to the codecision process will only be coherent if we retain the framework of the Commission's right of legislative initiative."
"Giving the right of legislative initiative to a Member State or to some Member States will always cause problems and confusion in implementing common codecision rules."
"I would add that the Commission's right of initiative is today the most appropriate, precisely because it is exercised in the framework of a set of interinstitutional programmes agreed with the European Parliament and with the European Council itself."
"With regard to the second question, dealing with the priority given to combating terrorism and illegal immigration, the Commission believes that these were not only priorities in 2002, but will also be priorities in 2003."
"The European Union has demonstrated its ability to respond to the terrorist threat by adopting two important instruments: the European arrest warrant and the framework decision on combating terrorism."
"From the Commission's point of view, the final text of these two legislative initiatives will ensure a healthy balance between the objectives intended to facilitate investigations and prosecutions against terrorists, on the one hand, and, on the other, the protection of defendants' rights, but I shall return to this issue a little later."
"The Seville European Council gave new impetus to speeding up all aspects of implementing the programme adopted in Tampere with a view to creating an area of freedom, security and justice."
"New priority has been given to measures intended to combat illegal immigration and to establish the common management of our external borders."
"At the same time, however, the Seville Council also laid down objectives and timetables for adopting the other decisions in the field of asylum and immigration policy laid down in the Tampere Council conclusions."
"The Commission responded quickly to this new priority by presenting its proposals for an integrated management system for external borders, that was generally well received by the Council and included in the action plan that was not only approved by the Council last June, but was also recently endorsed by the European Parliament in a resolution voted on last month."
"This progress must of course be assessed in light of the timetable and programmes for measures established at Tampere. Progress must also be in line with an approach that is balanced between the three components: freedom, security and justice."
"The Commission emphasised once again in the last scoreboard, of 16 December 2002, that there are still delays in adopting asylum and immigration issues."
"We hope that the Greek Presidency will, as the Minister has just stated, give a commitment to speeding up work on adopting this legislation within the framework laid down by the Seville European Council."
"In relation to the fourth issue raised by Baroness Ludford, I wish to say that the Greek Presidency has given pride of place on its agenda to the debate on family reunification and on the status of long-term residents in the European Union, together with the directive that Parliament debated yesterday, on the entry of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and with the directive on the conditions of entry and residence for citizens from third countries for the purpose of study."
"We will consequently have the basic legislative framework in the field of immigration policy that is being discussed in Council."
"I would also add the initiative that the Commission will be adopting next month to present a communication focusing on the issue of integrating third-country nationals into European reception societies."
"With regard to the future of decision-making processes, the Commission welcomes the conclusions reached by the Convention's working group on Justice and Home Affairs, because it acknowledges that in issues of asylum, immigration and other policies involving freedom of movement, the general rule for decision-making must be to adopt legislative acts under the codecision process, in which the Council reaches agreement by qualified majority."
"I also welcome the fact that this conclusion has been reached by the Convention's working group with a broad majority."
"In terms of changes to the Treaty, the Commission is encouraging the Convention to adopt the rule of a more explicit legal basis for developing a common European asylum system that goes beyond the mere minimum common rules that the Council is currently discussing."
"As to the issue the honourable Member raised concerning the usefulness and effectiveness of the networks, the Commission wishes to state clearly to Parliament that its assessment of the work undertaken by the networks that have real operational duties, such as Europol, Eurojust, or bodies such as the Chiefs of Police task-force and the judicial networks in civil and criminal matters, is positive."
"Nevertheless, we must emphasise that not all networks present the same added value and that the Council should be more particular in selecting its priorities for establishing these networks."
"With regard to the relationship between the Commission and the European Parliament, the Commission is attempting scrupulously to comply with the framework agreement signed by the two institutions on 5 July 2000."
"In this context, I intend, as early as next week in Brussels, to inform the European Parliament's Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs of developments in the negotiations underway on readmission agreements with third countries."
"With regard to the issue of evaluating the way in which framework decisions are transposed into the national legal system of each State, The Commission wishes to draw Parliament's attention to the fact that evaluation methods vary from framework decision to framework decision."
"Our view is that priority should now be given to the framework decision on combating terrorism, which should be transposed by all Member States by the end of 2002."
"We are gathering information from the Member States on this transposal and we hope to be able to present the corresponding report by the end of 2003."
"As always, the Commission is paying particular attention to achieving the necessary balance between respect for the law and for the protection of people's fundamental rights and the fight against organised crime and terrorism."
"To this end, following a recommendation of the European Parliament, the Commission has created a network of experts in fundamental rights."
"This year's report on this network of experts focuses in particular on the compatibility of the measures adopted by the Member States and by the European Union on the fight against terrorism and respect for fundamental rights."
"Finally, with regard to the rapporteur's last question on the framework decision on procedural guarantees for persons standing trial, the Commission welcomes the Greek Presidency's intention to include this matter in the discussion at the Véria informal Council at the end of March."
"For our part, before this Council we will be adopting a Green Paper on common rules for procedural guarantees for persons standing trial anywhere in the Union."
"This Green Paper will give civil society and legal professionals, in both current and future Member States, the opportunity to contribute to the debate, with a view to our presenting a proposal for a framework decision that we believe must be scheduled by the end of this year."
"The Commission is consequently committed to establishing minimum common rules in this field, as stated in its presentation of the annual work programme for 2003."
"I wish to conclude by announcing that work is also underway on guarantees for equal treatment in gathering and processing evidence and the on the right to remain silent during trial. We believe these matters to be particularly important for creating a common base, a common platform in criminal cases, in order to make mutual trust and cooperation between judicial authorities more effective in the fight against organised crime."
"In short, the progress that has been made is unequivocal and undeniable."
"They are not balanced in all aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice, but in light of this experience we can help the Convention on the Future of Europe to overcome the main institutional and procedural difficulties to ensure that the Union becomes an area of peace, prosperity, freedom, cohesion, security and solidarity."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing my appreciation for Baroness Ludford's question, which, being comprehensive in its scope, was a very good one."
"I cannot do other than endorse the rapporteur's constitutional thinking on the subject of asylum and immigration policy."
"We need majority voting in the Council, Parliament needs to have the power of codecision, and the right of the Member States to propose legislation needs to be limited, as it is mainly used for reasons of domestic policy and rarely advances the cause of European Union."
"She is also right in her conclusion that the EU is a long way from implementing what was decided at Tampere."
"Whilst Baroness Ludford regards the Council as being to blame for this, I take the contrary view that the Commission must shoulder a large share of the responsibility for it."
"Commissioner Vitorino, although the Treaties require minimum standards of you, you wanted to go ahead and generously broaden the scope of both the Convention on Refugees and the provisions of national law, and your attempts to do so failed at Council level on many occasions."
"It might be a good idea if you were to slowly learn the error of your ways; your new proposal on the reunification of families certainly gives us hope that you are willing to do so."
"It so happens, Baroness Ludford, that minimum standards are often the lowest common denominator."
"The Group of the European People's Party welcomes the Commission's commitment to combating illegal immigration, which demonstrates, Commissioner Vitorino, that you can see that there are two sides to the coin and that you are getting down to work."
"Let us turn to counter-terrorism, an area in which 2002 has seen great progress made."
"The common definition of terrorism, the European arrest warrant, and the reinforcement of Europol were important milestones on the road towards terrorism being effectively combated in Europe."
"I would like to take this opportunity to specifically call upon the Council to make use of the funds we have allocated to Europol, which amount to over EUR 3 million, for if they do not do so, nobody will be in a position, in the event of one or more attacks in Europe, to coordinate or to lead police operations."
"Your disputes about competence will not, at any rate, meet with much public sympathy."
"Baroness Ludford has diagnosed an imbalance between the methods of counter-terrorism on the one hand and guaranteed fundamental rights on the other."
"I do not see that such is the case."
"Laws at national and European level have made very good provision for data protection, we have extensive systems for defence and legal protection, and direct intervention can, of course, still only be carried out at national level."
"She is right, however, to demand that Europol and Eurojust - which latter has had a successful start - should be brought within the Community sphere, for that, in the long term, is the only way to guarantee effective democratic and juridical control and to prevent duplication of structures."
"It is clear to see that, if Eurojust were to be brought within the Community sphere, it could take over OLAF's tasks as well as ensuring that the Community's financial interest was protected."
"As well as that, though, the Schengen Agreement and its associated information system have to be brought within the Community sphere."
"I might add, by the way, that the plethora of information systems will function effectively only when they are interconnected and equipped with standard rules on data protection, which could also be monitored by the new data protection commissioner."
"At the same time, we also need a new coordination body for the external borders, by which I mean a sort of 'Eurobord' or 'Euroguard'."
"Open internal borders mean that it is in the interest of all Member States that Poland's eastern border, the waters of the Italian Adriatic, and the Straits of Gibraltar should be secured, and this calls for solidarity on their part."
"I might add that the EU has wasted years of valuable time when it comes to these matters, which are closely connected with its own enlargement."
"For far too long, Commissioner Verheugen has been lulling the EU to sleep and reassuring it that no reforms are needed."
"The second generation SIS has now been delayed, and frameworks for common border control are also only in their early stages - all this with enlargement one year away."
"These are issues where we have to work, even now, much more closely with the candidate countries than we have done before."
"We all have a long road ahead of us before we can present the Europe of freedom, security and justice to its citizens, but we have to take the first steps, and, Commissioner, let me add that the Convention has to become even more courageous."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on the questions she has addressed to the Council and the Commission, which anticipate a resolution from this House and which I hope will receive strong support."
"And I would also like to thank the Council and the European Commission for their comprehensive replies."
"Firstly, I agree with both the Council and the Commission that it is fair to say that we have made a lot of progress in the field of cooperation on criminal matters."
"So much so that it now seems reasonable - and I hope that everyone agrees - that we should expect and ask for the proposals which the Commissioner has put forward here, more than once, in relation to improving judicial standards in the European Union and creating common minimum standards which guarantee to the European citizens that this framework of criminal cooperation reinforces not only their freedom and security but also the efficiency of justice."
"I believe that this is really positive."
"In relation to the fight against this type of cross-border crime, I would simply like to draw attention to the Conference which took place in Brussels with regard to trafficking in women and children."
"I believe that the citizens expect us to deal with this issue from a Community point of view."
"We adopted a declaration, the Brussels Declaration, which had our full support, and I believe we should take the lead in the implementation of the measures it called for."
"With regard to asylum and immigration, the truth is that I have been perplexed all day."
"I do not understand what is going on here."
"We have often said in this House that we endorsed the Tampere agreements, that we wanted a common, balanced and global immigration policy, in the way that all the Ministers, including those from the PPE group, had stated in Tampere."
"We all agree that the framework referred to by Mr Vitorino is the one we need in order to create this common area for immigration and asylum, in the terms indicated by the Commission and undoubtedly in the terms which inspired the debates in the Parliament and the Council."
"Now it seems that, on the contrary, we are only calling for certain minimal things in the field of immigration."
"I do not understand."
"I hope, Mr von Boetticher, that you are not in the government at some time in the future and that we do not hear you saying, 'This is a European problem which must be dealt with from a European perspective', as so many Prime Ministers affiliated to the PPE do, quite rightly."
"I hope that this can carry on and to this end I hope that the Convention will grant Parliament and the Council co-decision powers, as the Commissioner requested, in the field of justice, freedom and security, because the citizens must be secure in this area, and that the Commission will have its right to initiative returned so that progress can be made logically and coherently."
"Mr President, in the course of 2002 we saw a broad debate and a profusion of legislation on matters relating to what is known as the area of freedom, security and justice."
"For obvious reasons it was felt necessary to establish more ambitious targets in areas such as illegal immigration, border control, the European arrest warrant, asylum and police and judicial cooperation, amongst others."
"Something that has also made a positive contribution to these developments, and I cannot deny this, is the dynamism of Commissioner Vitorino, who is responsible for these matters within the Commission and whom I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate."
"We cannot forget, however, that these matters are of enormous political sensitivity."
"We are invading the traditional sovereign borders of the Member States, a fact that cannot be ignored or played down."
"Recent international events are a clear reminder that the European Union is still made up of sovereign States."
"It is also the rights and the obligations of their citizens, however, that are at stake here and which must be acknowledged and defined with a sense of responsibility, in an attempt to respond to the needs imposed on us all by the complex current situation."
"Mr President, in the short time I have left, I shall concentrate on the new terrorist threats, which require action at European level and solidarity at international level."
"In fact, the way in which we approach terrorism these days is completely different to the approach pursued in the 1970s and 1980s."
"We know that the terrorist threat today is hard to see and is underpinned by motives other than political ones."
"As a rule, it acts illegitimately, I repeat, illegitimately, in the name of a given civilisation in the aim of setting this on a collision course with our own."
"Today's form of terrorism is well known: it selects its targets according to the visibility of the results of its action, which incidentally makes all of us and our institutions possible targets."
"We also know that it is extremely mobile and that it uses, as we all do, modern means of communication."
"We know that its sources of funding are diverse and that this funding is often obtained under the guise of promoting respectable aims."
"No less importantly, we know that it certainly has access to arms of mass destruction, especially chemical and biological weapons."
"Against this backdrop, we must of course provide responses that go beyond the national sphere and even the spheres of action for justice and domestic security, which naturally highlights the importance of this debate of ours."
"The presence of these new terrorist threats undeniably requires action at European level."
"Unilateral national action is no longer sufficient to ensure that our populations are protected."
"These new concerns do not mean, however, that we should indefinitely extend the rules of Community initiative and of qualified majority in this entire area."
"We believe that these developments do not necessarily mean that the Union's procedures must all be produced or implemented in the same way."
"I am sure that it will be possible to take decisions on issues of Justice and Home Affairs by simplifying the structure of the pillars, without this changing the balance of the necessary cooperation between governments and national authorities in conjunction with the system of joint management developed by the European Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make use of today's debate, in the presence both of the Commissioner and the ambitious Council Presidency, to direct our attention to the potential influx of a massive number of refugees, triggered by a war in Iraq that we hope will not happen, but is nonetheless possible, and the related subject of the Refugee Fund, which was set up two years ago."
"It makes it possible for us, in accordance with Article 6 of the Council Decision establishing the European Refugee Fund, to take special steps in the event of a mass influx of refugees."
"What I now propose is that you, as representatives of the Commission and of the Council, make every conceivable preparation for such an eventuality, so that the Member States may not be left to their own devices, but may be supported in the manner provided for in Article 6."
"You should be allocating up to 80% of the funds required, but this requires that you take the necessary precautions right now."
"The Member States are to be urged to take the necessary precautions by appointing authorities to which the Commission may have recourse."
"I am addressing both the Council and the Commission when I propose that consideration should be given to setting aside funds for eventual allocation to international aid organisations providing the relevant help on the spot, which should be the primary and most efficient form of aid."
"I propose, thirdly, that you should not leave the Member States to deal with this potentially tragic situation on their own, but should, in advance of events, give consideration to spreading the load of dealing with the people involved, as we know that a few countries were obliged to shoulder most of the burdens resulting from the crisis in the Balkans."
"We should be learning from our mistakes and preventing such a thing from recurring in future, so we should be preparing to apportion the people involved to individual Member States."
"I would very much like to know how, and to what extent, you envisage acting upon these proposals."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the reason I am taking the floor in this debate is that I would like to make two basic observations on how this House cooperates."
"Mr von Boetticher, in the few parts of his speech that were any good, pointed out that we will, in future, have to do more legislative work if we are to achieve what we want, that being the bringing within the Community sphere of more aspects of the European Union currently covered by policy on the area of freedom, security and justice."
"In this sector, too, majority decision-making and the codecision procedure would have to be normative, with the Commission, rather than the Member States, having the right to initiate legislation."
"Very good!"
"That is something I can only endorse."
"If, however, that is how he thinks, then what is needed today is a sober inventory of the present situation, so that, if we want to overcome the challenges of the future, we are equipped to do so and able to fashion a policy that makes sense and will work."
"So what is the situation today?"
"Commissioner Vitorino is thinking up something good."
"By making proposals, he is discharging the obligations laid on him by the scoreboard that he announced after Tampere."
"What he proposes goes too far for the Council, on the assumption that they actually read the stuff."
"The proposals then end up in Parliament, and Parliament adds to them and forwards them to the Council."
"What does the Council do?"
"It throws them in the waste-paper basket."
"Such is the reality of the situation today."
"Now, I do not want to tread on the Council's toes."
"I am quite convinced that the Greek Presidency of the Council will read everything."
"Do not take what I say too personally."
"What we need in future, though, is a different way of making laws, one in which the balance between the three institutions involved is safeguarded."
"This will involve all three bodies being willing to compromise."
"The Commission must be willing to compromise, as indeed it is, as all of us who know Commissioner Vitorino can tell you, even if he has to put up with being given an unjustified battering in the German press by young and rather immature MEPs."
"The Council's willingness to compromise is a matter of doubt, as the Council's policy is not - primarily, at any rate - guided by European standards, but by the demands of every single Member State's domestic policies."
"That is wrong."
"And thirdly, it is one of our institution's failings."
"It is at this point that Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats should prick up their ears and listen."
"I am now making them an offer, and this is the first time - but not, I hope, the last - that they will receive such an offer in this form."
"Let us talk together, so that we are not always coming up with the minimum of consensus, but can get the legislative work done."
"What are your demands, and what are ours?"
"Where are you prepared to give some ground on your position, and where are we prepared to give some ground on our own?"
"Where, then, can we achieve real compromises that make real law-making possible?"
"Business in this place has hitherto been conducted on the basis that anyone who is not on my side is against me, and that I will not vote with anyone who does not back up my position 100%, so this House ends up passing fortuitous texts by fortuitous majorities."
"If we want to do real legislative work, then I invite you to discuss compromise, but you will then have to demonstrate your capacity for it."
"This will involve you putting some of the hardliners in your ranks on the lead."
"But, Mr von Boetticher and Mr Pirker, being made of the stuff you are, I am sure you will manage that."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the area of freedom, security and justice is something that many Members of this House still imagine to be a highly advanced position adopted by a European Union that offers its citizens the greatest possible degree of freedom and protection from the State."
"It is not only in the last year that events have proved the opposite to be the case: repressive measures are enjoying a boom, with the European Union and its Member States forcing through controls on the EU's external borders no less than in its interior."
"On top of that, there is increased monitoring of personal data and of free communication."
"Biometric means are being used to evacuate privacy of any meaning."
"Finally, the EU's racist character is enhanced still further by the many laws aimed at so-called 'foreigners', with the introduction of the Eurodac system and the development of the Schengen Information System representing only the tip of the iceberg."
"This security means, then, the greatest possible security for the State, whereas freedom would require a quite different policy - some would call it a more mature one - backing effective data protection, the demolition of Fortress Europe and the repeal of all racist special laws, including those on the right to citizenship."
"Such, though, is not the case."
"What we are building here is a Union of state security, control and monitoring."
"Baroness Ludford's Liberalism, does not, unfortunately, extend to addressing any of these points in her question."
"Mr President, the President-in-Office has just reminded us that the Tampere Conclusions in the area of Freedom, Security, Justice and Home Affairs proclaimed in 1999 the principles of transparency and democratic control for the protection of citizens' human rights."
"In the Kingdom of Spain on 13 February 1983, that is to say 20 years ago, Joseba Arregi, a Basque political prisoner, died under torture while he was in police custody."
"That was 20 years ago tomorrow."
"In 2002, 634 politically motivated people were arrested."
"127 of them subsequently claimed in court that they had suffered ill treatment or torture."
"Have the Council and the Commission received clear information about this issue from the Spanish Government?"
"Do the Council and the Commission consider that the transparency principle has been respected by the Spanish Government?"
"Last year the Spanish Government proposed the banning of several social organisations - media and cultural associations - that had denounced the political repression suffered by Basque dissidents."
"Through a Spanish initiative, the European Union has drawn up a black list of associations and individuals accused of specific or tacit support for terrorism."
"The accused have neither the legal means of defence nor effective access to the courts."
"Do the Council and the Commission consider there to have been real enforcement of the democratic control principle with regard to Spain?"
"Will the Council and the Commission put forward a judicial instrument in the new texts being prepared for those included on the European Union's black list?"
"I would like to thank Baroness Ludford and express my recognition of the effort she has made in this important area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I shall, of course, begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Baroness Ludford, on the excellent report she has contributed to this debate."
"This annual debate on the area of freedom, security and justice provides Parliament with a new opportunity to express its dissatisfaction and frustration with regard to the paralysis affecting the third pillar as a result of the lack of political will on the part of the Member States, and despite the ongoing efforts of the Commission."
"Important Commission initiatives, both before and after 11 September 2001, remain deadlocked in Council or are still waiting to be transposed or ratified by the Member States."
"The States appear to wish to compensate for their inability to establish policies that will provide a structure for the area of freedom, security and justice by putting forward a torrent of proposals based on their right of initiative. As a rule, these proposals make a minuscule, if not counterproductive, contribution to the objectives that these States themselves have imposed on successive European summits."
"We are seeing a procession of outlandish proposals, by which I mean proposals that are not part of any plan or form part of the Commission scoreboard."
"These are arbitrary proposals of limited or no scope, incoherent, sometimes dictated by national political agendas, proposals that tend to turn the third pillar into a universe in chaos, continuously expanding in all directions - a legal and bureaucratic novel without full stops."
"The European Parliament has the duty to condemn this impasse, which is the result of the political inability to date of the Council and the Member States to have brought into force a single measure on the package on combating terrorism that has been drawn up by the Commission or come originally from it and planned in its scoreboard."
"The gulf between the discourse of political leaders, in particular, of government representatives, and this resulting in practical actions is reaching scandalous proportions in the field of fighting transnational crime."
"Furthermore, in the areas covered by Title IV, we are still seeing a persistent imbalance, rightly condemned by the rapporteur, between the relative ease with which agreements are concluded on the repressive elements of controlling immigration and the ongoing inability to establish common policies in the field of asylum and regulating legal immigration, specifically in the field of civil rights and social integration."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must congratulate Commissioner António Vitorino on his efficiency and hard work that have led to the progress made, which has been particularly noticeable in the last six months."
"2002 was more positive than previous years and we saw a considerable number of initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs."
"The proposals for a European arrest warrant and for a framework decision on terrorism that have already been referred to, for example, are proof of the Union's ability to implement the objectives set by the Treaty of Amsterdam when the need to act is combined with the will to do so."
"Nevertheless, and despite the progress that has been made, as Baroness Ludford has already observed and as was also stated at Laeken, I quote, 'new boosts and new guidelines are needed to make good the delay seen in certain areas'."
"On the one hand considerable progress has been made in stepping up cooperation between the agencies responsible for implementing the law on the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters, on the European arrest warrant and on harmonising criminal and anti-terrorist legislation. On the other, much still remains to be done in order to achieve a practical and effective system for safeguarding citizens' rights."
"It cannot be emphasised too much, as indeed Commissioner Vitorino emphasised, that it is crucial to maintain a balance between the three components of the same concept, which together constitute the area of freedom, security and justice."
"In other words, there can be no security without freedom and justice."
"Another source of regret, as various speakers have said today, is the excessively frequent use of the right of initiative by the Member States, who have increased the number of proposals that this Parliament has felt obliged to reject because they lack coherence, clarity and even usefulness and which were only guided by the requirements of national politics or to placate the media."
"Furthermore, the imposition of matters pertaining to the first pillar and of means that fall under the third pillar has been an ongoing source of difficulties."
"Decisions need to be taken, especially in areas such as data protection."
"With regard to Europol and Eurojust, it is regrettable that there is still only an indirect democratic division of responsibility, which is fragmented and insufficiently limited."
"To conclude, Mr President, the reduced level of democratic legitimacy that we are still seeing is also a matter of regret."
"Parliament is rarely consulted and often on political agreements that have already been concluded in Council, which means that our contribution is an irrelevant and useless document."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to this debate and, above all, Baroness Ludford for her excellent contribution."
"I shall just address a few of the questions raised during the debate, starting with a remark by Mr Schulz."
"We should all resist the temptation to reduce the debate on asylum and migration to a purely ideological debate."
"It is indeed tempting and very easy to do this by using slogans to manipulate emotions."
"However, if we reduce the debate to such positions, I wonder whether we are really addressing the dramatic problems that asylum and migration raise for thousands of people all over the world and especially in the European Union."
"It might even be tempting to make the Commission the bad guy."
"I am used to performing several roles, but this would be a new one for me."
"However, the Commission has always tried to put forward the right balance between an efficient policy combating illegal migration and, at the same time, defining the grass roots of a proactive, positive policy on migration."
"This is not for ideological reasons."
"We believe that if we do not succeed in having a clear, transparent and coordinated policy on legal migration, we will not succeed in the fight against trafficking in human beings and illegal migration."
"If I appear too generous, I would like to recall that the Commission put forward a proposal for a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings."
"The Commission presented the action plan on illegal migration that was taken on board by the Council."
"The Commission presented the action plan on external border controls that was taken on board by the Council."
"The Commission presented the proposal on the return action plan."
"The Commission made the proposal on a new Schengen information system."
"The Commission proposed the creation of a visa database."
"If this is being too generous, I admit that I have some differences with some Members regarding the notion of generosity."
"When it comes to the new terrorist threat, as Mr Queiró has emphasised, we recognise that we are confronted with a phenomenon we know little about."
"We are not yet at the stage of being prepared to face the new profile of the terrorist threat, not only as far as the possibility of terrorist attacks is concerned - and one must be prepared for whatever might happen in the near future, in the light of the evolution of international events - but also in terms of a key question you have raised: the financing of the terrorist networks."
"Therefore I hope that during 2003, Member States will be able to make effective progress in achieving concrete results and adopt legislation to combat the financing of terrorism."
"This should include not only the illegal financing of terrorism, but also the 'legal' financing of terrorism in the European Union, including offshore centres on its territory."
"I would like to confirm to Mrs Terrón i Cusí that the Commission intends to set up a network of experts during spring 2003, thus following up the Brussels Declaration."
"I now turn to the issue raised by Mr Coehlo. Difficulties abound in dealing with certain specific and very sensitive issues because we have a split between the first and third pillars; data protection is a very good example of this."
"We should emphasise that there is a clear sign from the European Convention that the values of freedom, security and justice cannot be held hostage by a schizophrenic division between pillars that is blocking us every day."
"Finally, on the very important issue raised by Mr Pirker, I can guarantee that we are preparing for the possibility of a mass influx."
"I do not want to anticipate the evolution of international events, but we have learned much from the experience in Kosovo."
"We have the directive on temporary protection."
"It has been transposed into national legislation by Sweden, Finland and Belgium, and other Member States already have provisions in their national legislation concerning sudden influxes of migrants and refugees."
"Therefore, to deal with the most urgent situations we can mobilise, in the very short term, the reserve of the fund for European refugees."
"My colleague, Commissioner Nielson, together with ECHO, and in close coordination with UNHCR, is looking at the possibility of supporting refugees in the region."
"I hope that this time things will work much better, thanks to the progress that has been achieved as far as temporary protection is concerned."
"I would like to pay my sincere respects to Parliament."
"If we have problems in terms of progress during this year Parliament cannot be blamed for any kind of delay."
"It has always given its opinions on time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be held on 11 March."
"Mr President, I just wish to make a point of order."
"There was no simultaneous interpretation into Portuguese during the last speech."
"I would therefore ask you to have someone look into this matter."
"Mr President, it is, in my view, clearer than ever nowadays that there is a need for an international legal system, and it is also becoming ever clearer that, if an international legal system is to be developed that is viable and that applies to large as well as small countries, it is the EU that must play the decisive role and be the guarantor of large, as well as small, countries' complying with a set of international ground rules."
"I therefore think it important also to get the Council and the Commission to follow up this very important matter of how best to emphasise to one's partners, and in any future situation, that to use anti-personnel mines, cluster bombs and depleted uranium is to use weapons that strike indiscriminately, that hit civilian as well as non-civilian targets, that hit the innocent as well as the guilty and that can be dormant for a long time and only make themselves felt perhaps years after a possible war is over."
"These are weapons that are contrary to the provisions of the Geneva Convention on how we are to treat one another in the course of war."
"I therefore think the Council and the Commission should understand that, firstly, we must prevent these types of war crime from being committed."
"We must prevent these weapons being used in possible future conflicts and, clearly, we are all nowadays thinking of Iraq in this connection."
"There are, however, other places too in which this could be relevant."
"That was the first aspect."
"The second is to follow up those crimes that have already been committed."
"In that connection, I should also very much like to hear the Council's and the Commission's answers regarding how these crimes are to be followed up and how it is to be ensured that those who are responsible for using weapons in ways that constitute war crimes are dragged before the International War Crimes Tribunal and prosecuted, for it is not enough for us to have a set of ground rules."
"We must also be prepared to apply them, and we must be prepared to apply the sanctions available to us at present."
"It is the EU that must take this task upon itself."
"Otherwise, we shall end up in a world in which only the strong make the decisions, in which only the strong can do as they see fit and in which weak countries are entirely subject to the diktat of a stronger power."
"I eagerly await the Council's and the Commission's answers."
"Mr President, as we are all aware, dormant explosive devices, landmines and cluster bombs are among the weapons that can cause especially cruel injuries and mutilations."
"Those of us who have been to countries in conflict will know the mutilations and wounds with which one is confronted there. I myself became familiar with these sights in Central America."
"Parliament has, in various resolutions, insisted on the implementation of the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which banned the use of landmines."
"It is with reference to this that I want to praise the Commission for the excellent work it has done, not only in the field of mine clearance, but also in educating people as to why landmines have to be banned."
"Work is progressing at present on preparations for the next conference on the revision of the Ottawa Convention, which is to be held this September in Bangkok, by which time I very much hope that those European states that have not yet ratified the Ottawa Convention will have made good their omission."
"I look forward to hearing what the President-in-Office of the Council will have to say in response to this question."
"I think he might well be about to bring Parliament good news from Greece."
"The worldwide campaign against landmines has already made great progress."
"Considerable efforts are currently being made to get belligerent parties other than states to sign up to the Ottawa Convention."
"This work is being undertaken by a non-governmental organisation - 'Appell de Genève' - and I believe that we can rejoice that such work is being done by non-governmental organisations when state bodies cannot carry it out."
"In Somalia, for example, 15 organisations and belligerent parties, none of them part of any state apparatus, have signed the Convention."
"Another problem of a particularly shattering nature comes in the form of cluster bombs, whose victims include innocent civilians; the injuries these bombs inflict are so horrific and their effects so indiscriminate, that they should be prohibited outright."
"Previous speakers have described this, and I wish to touch on it only very briefly."
"You are all familiar with the descriptions of the horrendous injuries resulting from the deployment of cluster bombs."
"The particularly dreadful thing about it is that the splinters from the cluster bombs that remain in the human body are almost never capable of being removed."
"Not only are the effects of these bombs indiscriminate in that they can strike civilians as much as soldiers, but they are also imprecise in the area they affect, which amounts to something like 350 football fields every time a cluster bomb is dropped."
"This makes the precision bombing of military targets impossible, so that there is an increased risk of innocent people being injured."
"Finally, these bombs also vary in their effect over time, since, if they do not explode, they can remain live for years to come."
"It was in December 2001 that Parliament last recalled the 1980 UN agreement on certain conventional weapons and demanded an immediate moratorium on the use of cluster bombs."
"A moratorium can clearly only be the second best solution until such time as a ban on these inhuman weapons becomes enforceable, but I believe that imposing a moratorium in the first instance is the pragmatic way to go about things."
"It is here that the European Union could, by its actions, give a very good example."
"Mr President, I wish to state that the current international situation is not preventing us from adopting the necessary objectivity in this debate on unexploded ordnance and depleted uranium ammunition."
"It will therefore be easier to assess all the consequences underlying this debate."
"Mr President, war is always war and its effects are always appalling."
"The fact is, however, that sometimes we cannot escape the need for military intervention or its inevitability."
"This is why we must concern ourselves with the long-term effects of this ordnance, out of consideration in particular for the innocent victims and most frequently, those harmed by their effects after operations have ended."
"There is growing concern amongst interested communities and also amongst the general public in this field."
"With regard to the specific case of ammunition that contains depleted uranium, the lack of rigorous clinical proof that clearly confirms the cause-and-effect relationship between its use and the occurrence of diseases must lead us to invest even more heavily in research into this possible connection."
"This is where the Council's action could be extremely useful, particularly in supporting the work of groups of government experts on the leftovers of war, such as explosives and anti-tank mines, and in giving priority to this issue."
"Next it is crucial that the Council and also the Commission heed the results obtained and present, within the scope of their respective competences, practical recommendations or measures to help to improve and increase the reliability of ordnance with a view to eliminating the lethal damage it causes following conflicts."
"Incidentally, and to conclude, Mr President, I wish to say a few words about the people that this debate is seeking to protect."
"Even without conclusive proof, it is a requisite of conscience to provide effective forms of support for victims and their families, whether or not they are military personnel, who have been affected after the end of a conflict and whose suffering could be related to unexploded ordnance or depleted uranium ammunition."
"This would not be the first such action."
"Portugal, for example, has been doing just this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is particularly concerned about the deaths and injury caused every year by explosive remnants of war."
"Apart from directly killing and injuring civilians, explosive remnants of war often hamper humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping forces, reconstruction following conflict and development in general, which is why the Union has taken an active part in the debate on explosive remnants of war within the framework of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons."
"Allow me to quote a few examples of Union activities in this sector."
"In June 2001, the Union circulated a discussion paper on explosive remnants of war at the meeting held on the subject in the run-up to the second review congress on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons."
"The General Affairs Council issued conclusions on 19 November 2001 promoting the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, in which it called on the second review congress to set up a working party on explosive remnants of war."
"Thirdly, the European Union submitted a working paper to the second review congress on the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva in December 2001, calling for legal instruments to be introduced in order to deal with explosive remnants of war, as a result of which efforts will be made to prevent explosive remnants of war, including through provisions requiring them to be more reliably designed and to have self-destruct mechanisms, and to prevent physical injury from detonators in explosive remnants of war."
"The Union also submitted a paper on explosive remnants of war to the team of government experts set up by the second review congress."
"During the congress of the States Parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the Presidency stressed on behalf of the European Union that the introduction of a legally binding instrument on explosive remnants of war within the framework of the Convention was a priority issue for the Union."
"The congress agreed with the recommendation of the team of government experts that negotiations should start on an instrument for these explosives."
"The Council's competent working party will be discussing future Union action in this sector."
"I should like to point out on behalf of the Council that the Member States of the Union are not unanimously in favour of declaring an immediate moratorium on the use of all types of cluster bombs."
"The Council has not received reports of any NATO members using cluster bombs."
"The common action by the Union in November 1997 dealt in its first three articles with the question of the universality of the agreement banning mines, in which the Member States of the Union set a target of totally eliminating anti-personnel mines worldwide."
"The common action authorised the Presidency to take suitable measures."
"These measures have consisted to date of demarches to countries which have not yet signed up to the Convention, including associated countries, and it has also recommended that churches sign the Convention."
"These demarches are carried out by the Presidency at the time."
"The Union has also been promoting the universality of the Convention at all the appropriate fora, especially the United Nations."
"The resolutions of the General Assembly on the application of the Convention have been unanimously supported by the Member States of the European Union."
"In addition, the European Parliament and Council resolutions of 23 July 2001 concerning action against anti-personnel landmines in developing countries and in third countries other than developing countries both state in article 3 that operations against landmines financed by the Union must in principle benefit those countries which are party to the convention banning landmines."
"Exceptions may only be made for humanitarian reasons."
"This stand by the Union has created an important incentive for countries to sign up to the convention banning landmines."
"The European Union and its Member States are the main international source of funding for action against landmines, which in itself is an important way of promoting compliance with the convention."
"I should also like to point out that no reports have been submitted to the Council on the use of depleted uranium ammunition by the American or British forces during the intervention in Afghanistan."
"The Council has not addressed the question of the application of the protocol to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons on non-detectable fragments to which all the Member States are party."
"Nor has the Council discussed ongoing work on this question at the United Nations."
"Finally, the Council does not have a catalogue of depleted uranium ammunition in current use."
"Decisions on the use of various types of ammunition are taken by Member States exercising their national sovereignty."
"All the Member States are party to the Geneva Conventions."
"Similarly, the Council has received no information about the use of depleted uranium ammunition in Chechnya, nor has it discussed the possibility of making the use of cluster bombs or depleted uranium a war crime under the statute of the International Criminal Court."
"Mr President, I can well imagine that the Commissioner is right about depleted uranium."
"As far as I am aware, and if my memory serves me right, it even has its civilian uses, but that is something that would have to be checked."
"However, as we know nothing about what long-term effects the dispersed material may have, there may be some surprises in store for us."
"I would like to say something about landmines."
"What we have to know about landmines that some 230 million of them are currently stored in a number of countries."
"Between 70 and 100 million of them have been laid around the world."
"It is unfortunate, moreover, that new ones are being laid all the time, so that great significance attaches to the issue of how we locate these landmines and destroy them, primarily in human terms - that is, about ensuring that people do not get hurt in the process - but also in economic terms - that is, about keeping costs down."
"I would like to encourage the Commission to make the right use of the funds that we have inserted in the Budget for research purposes."
"In recent years, we have kept on adding funds to the research framework programme for the purpose of researching new technologies for locating landmines, so they should be used for that purpose."
"Progress has been made, and for that I want to express my gratitude, but these things are extraordinarily complex, and I would like again to encourage you to help, perhaps by developing some sort of multifunctional location device."
"For my final comment, I turn to disarmament."
"There are other things - weapons of mass destruction, for example - that have to be disposed of."
"Every year, our Budget allocates some EUR 100 million to the disposal of chemical, biological and atomic weapons in the countries that formerly made up the Soviet Union."
"I would like you to submit a report on this, and for us to have a debate on it or produce a statement on the subject."
"After all, a great deal of money is involved and this is, above all, very much a live issue."
"Mr President, I have to confess that I am rather concerned and astonished after hearing the Commissioner's statements."
"We are on the eve of a war which we seem likely to wage on the basis of a mere suspicion: the suspicion that there may be chemical weapons."
"I am concerned and astonished at the ease with which our suspicions - the suspicion that depleted uranium might have been used in a number of conflicts and that it might have had serious effects on civilians' health - are being dispelled."
"I will mention just three facts."
"Firstly, Nato has not banned depleted uranium weapons, and the fact that it has not banned them leads us to fear, to believe that they have been used, that they might even have been used more than once."
"Secondly, a statement by the US Secretary of State for Defence in January last year referred to an increase in radiation emissions from depleted uranium weapons in Afghanistan."
"Thirdly, a number of medical tests carried out - under very difficult conditions because of the situation - in Afghanistan by a Canadian NGO found depleted uranium levels a hundred times as high as usual, due - it is extremely likely - to the use of depleted uranium weapons."
"Now, in the light of all this, it would seem to be too easy, too hasty to claim that we do not have enough information to be able to presume to raise our voice and call for these weapons not to be used in any conflict and, in particular, to call for the danger of such weapons being used in Iraq to be avoided."
"This is the essence of our resolution but, tomorrow, it will be the responsibility of the Council and the Commission not just not to exclude the possibility of this danger being fully prevented once and for all but to demand it."
"Thank you, Mr President. I have just one comment to make because a question was asked about Greece and the anti-personnel landmine convention."
"I should like to point out that the Greek Government has signed this convention."
"The convention was ratified by the Greek parliament and I did not understand the insinuations or what exactly the two speakers were trying to say."
"The debate is closed."
"I should like to inform the House that I have received 6 motions for resolutions on this subject under Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure"
"Mr President, Commissioner, as the Commission has just said, we are dealing with a report which we will vote on tomorrow, which has been approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and which in overall terms has supported the report produced by this rapporteur."
"Forest Focus replaces two regulations in force until December 2002, the legal basis of which, changed from the former Article 130 to the current Article 175, was changed on 25 February."
"In other words, it became subject to approval by co-decision."
"This report studied both protection against fires and atmospheric pollution, and now actions in the field of biodiversity, climate change and the retention of carbon are going to be included."
"Actions in the sixth framework action programme in the field of the environment which the European Commission and the Community are obliged to implement."
"However, the proposal replaces the majority of the measures on fire prevention in the former Regulation (EEC) No 2158/92."
"Now, the Commissioner has just told us that these measures are included in the rural and regional development programmes which he mentioned."
"I must say to him that the Member States have already presented the plans of the rural development Regulation, which was approved in 2000, but which has not been able to take account of fire prevention plans."
"Therefore, it does not seem to make sense to have asked the Member States to guess that in 2003 or at the end of 2002, as it should have been, this Parliament and the Commission were going to debate the replacement of the Regulation and that it was going to be transferred to the rural development programme and furthermore that it was going to be transferred with a miserable budget of EUR 5 million, because this quantity does not appear in the rural development programme."
"It will therefore have to appear in order to balance the 2002 budget."
"That is, EUR 18 million per year."
"Now, Commissioner, we are spending EUR 18 million."
"That is what is balanced and consolidated in 2002."
"The Commission proposes EUR 13 million."
"It seems absurd that we want to take the same measures, plus those relating to biodiversity, climate change and the retention of carbon, with such a significant reduction in the budget."
"I believe that considerable efforts have been made, both by the Council and by this Parliament, to reach to a compromise agreement, with compromise measures which ended in 2006."
"It appears that it has not been possible for the Commission to reach this agreement."
"I am sorry, Commissioner, but this is a regulation which is decided by means of co-decision in this Parliament and I therefore believe that the proposal which was originally on the table has been withdrawn by this rapporteur in Amendment No 44 so that we can all discuss it on equal terms."
"I believe that we all have to make a move, not just Parliament."
"Of the amendments presented by the Group of the European Socialist Party, this rapporteur accepts Amendment No 48."
"However, Amendment No 47 is not acceptable since it would go against the spirit of the report."
"There are other amendments presented by this rapporteur: two of them are amendments of a legal nature, and a third in which all we ask is that the idea already included in the recitals of increasing the scope of the European forest information system be incorporated into the Articles."
"I would have liked to have introduced some other ideas, such as prioritising certain methodological projects and also promoting 'old' activities, if I may put it like that, and not just those proposed in the new modules."
"I also believe that it would most advisable for the time periods to last one year, and that there be a pilot period, which needs to take account of the frequent interactions of the experts."
"I do not believe it is a good idea to transfer these issues to the rural development programme, Commissioner, since that would mean moving from the only regulation which is currently subject to co-decision and it is the only regulation which protects our forests."
"I would say, to use rather unorthodox terms for a plenary session, that this would be like leaving a sweet at the gates of a school."
"Commissioner, we have time to clarify both the budget and the harmony of these regulations."
"I believe we are obliged to do so."
"Mr President, Mrs Redondo Jiménez has drawn up an excellent and comprehensive report on the monitoring of forests and environmental interactions, for which I thank her sincerely."
"The Commission proposal combines two former regulations, one of which concerns the protection of the forests from air pollution and the other forest fire prevention."
"The Committee on Budgets has delivered an opinion on this matter."
"In its first opinion it said that the financial statement of the Commission proposal is compatible with the ceiling of heading 3 of the financial perspective and that it will not restrict other action in the period 2003-2006."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, however, raised this financial framework of EUR 52 million to EUR 67 million."
"This being the case, the Committee on Budgets stated that the framework was compatible with the ceiling of heading 3, if necessary through a reduction of other policies or through recourse to the provisions of the interinstitutional agreement."
"In practice the Committee on Budgets is warning that reductions in other areas of policy will have to be made or increases in the financial perspective will have to be resorted to, which will be politically very difficult."
"The opinion of the Committee on Budgets is based on the new Rule 63a in Parliament's Rules of Procedure, which obliges a committee to adopt a position on the compatibility of proposed legislation with the financial perspective."
"This is meant as a guiding principle for the plenary debate, which of course is free to take its own decision."
"This week Rule 63a is being applied not only to this report but also to that by Ulla Sandbæk, for example."
"It should be noted that if the committee responsible increases the financial framework in question it must once again request an opinion from the Committee on Budgets."
"Verification of compatibility does on no account constitute a position on whether the proposal by the committee responsible regarding a larger financial framework is appropriate or reasonable."
"This procedure will hopefully become automatic and natural."
"The plenary session must have knowledge regarding the compatibility of the financial framework with the financial perspective so that it can take its decision."
"The procedure increases the responsibility of the committees responsible for the legislative proposal being debated at the time."
"Activity-based budgeting, which is already established, also has the same objective."
"Verification of financial compatibility under Rule 63a thus serves, above all, the interests of the committee responsible."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with a timely and relevant saying."
"It goes, 'The culture of peoples is measured in terms of their love for trees' - and I would like the peoples of the European Union to demonstrate this."
"When we talk about forests we are talking about one of the most important ecosystems on Earth given their wealth and importance for the international community, since they offer both productive and protective services."
"The European continent shows the general characteristics of a region located in the planet's northern hemisphere and has forests with highly differentiated coniferous and non-coniferous species which reflect the regional biodiversity and bio-climatic wealth of the old Europe."
"In view of all of this, we must recognise the importance today of the report by Mrs Redondo Jiménez for nature in the European Union."
"I believe there are various reasons for this."
"On the one hand, the report considers in a general sense the general actions necessary to prevent the deterioration of Community forests as a result of atmospheric pollution and insists on implementing a specific European Union policy to combat forest fires, which are one of the factors threatening the survival of the forests."
"Furthermore, it specifically recognises the ecological wealth of certain European regions, such as the so-called outermost regions, in which certain forest ecosystems stand out, which in some cases are genuine natural botanical museums, as in the case of the region I come from, the Canary Islands, where forest observatories should be established in these unique Macaronesian islands, one of the bio-geographical regions of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) with the greatest biodiversity in the European Union."
"But all of this could come to nought if the Commission does not allocate the funding needed to adopt the measures necessary to achieve an appropriate European policy on forests."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on her sensitivity to the problem of forests and on her courage in defending the Community forests."
"Mr President, it is important to remember, in the context of this debate, the importance of the actions undertaken under Regulation 2158 on the protection of Community forests against fires because this complementary action has contributed to and indeed made possible various projects intended to achieve prevention through actions to combat the causes and forest fires that represent a veritable scourge for various regions, especially in Portugal."
"Between 1992 and 2002 around 800 projects and 18 national programmes were funded in six countries, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal, totalling around EUR 123.6 million, which demonstrates the importance of this Regulation."
"Consequently, taking account of the degree of efficiency and budgetary execution of the programme, which has always lacked further means, it becomes important to keep up actions to protect forests (both actions against both pollution and fires) included in the same Regulation, thereby honouring commitments, which will become redundant with the entry into force of the current regulation."
"We must take account of the fact that whereas pollution affects northern Europe more, forest fires are a scourge of the South, which means that the exclusion proposed by the Commission makes no sense, especially given that the preventive measures included in Regulation 2158/1992 contain actions not covered by the regulation on rural development, which has other aims for forests and forestry, despite what the Commissioner has said."
"The failure to include these preventive measures in this regulation would mean a reduction in funds for fire prevention and would call into question a set of projects already underway, which have already demonstrated the added value of Community action."
"I therefore agree with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur, seeking to uphold fire prevention actions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez for this report."
"Our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can support this report in its entirety and without reservation."
"Whilst I think it very much something to be welcomed that we at last have a commitment to woodland at European level, I share Mrs Figueiredo's view that we have to try to concentrate more on biodiversity, changes in climate and the database for monitoring purposes, and that perhaps less prominence should be given to forest fires."
"We must be clear in our own minds about one thing: this, too, is a matter of environmental concern, and so we should try to give this important step our support."
"We hope that this report can be adopted as soon as possible and will enjoy broad support in Parliament as early as first reading stage, so that we can start to implement this programme as soon as possible and so that the Member States have the resources to at last implement this programme in a practical way."
"Today marks the first occasion on which I have not needed to make use of all my speaking time, as I believe that we all agree that what matters is that we assign greater importance to European woodland, seeing it as an essential habitat and making it clear that changes in climate have to be monitored, and that the Commission's approach has to be widened a great deal to take account of biodiversity."
"We therefore give the report our full support and hope that the Member States will be able to get down to work as soon as possible."
"My thanks again to all those who have given their assistance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, year after year Portuguese forests are the silent victims of fires, which are becoming increasingly frequent, intense and devastating."
"Every summer brings with it this national scourge and its consequences, which are tragic at various levels: economic, ecological, social and human."
"Our forest heritage is gradually burning down and disappearing."
"Sustainable forest management is becoming increasingly complex and technical."
"Apart from fires, forests are exposed to other, more recent threats, caused by atmospheric pollution and climate change."
"It is always worth reminding fellow Members and making them aware of the importance of forests and their resources."
"To do this, it shall suffice to state that forests represent around 40% of the Union's territory, a percentage that will increase once the process of enlargement is concluded."
"I therefore warmly welcome the Forest Focus Programme, a Community initiative that will help to protect and value forests in Portugal and throughout the Community."
"European Union policy dovetails perfectly with cooperation in gathering data and in sharing experience and information amongst the various Member States."
"The Commission's initiative takes account of the legislative framework in force to protect forests against fires and atmospheric pollution and furthermore introduces a new Community mechanism for the long-term monitoring of forests and environmental interactions."
"For this programme's financial support, it has been decided to allocate it a multiannual financial framework, covering the period 2003-2008, totalling EUR 67 million."
"Monitoring is actually the key word in this proposal."
"I therefore heartily support Mrs Redondo Jiménez's idea that it makes perfect sense to maintain specific measures for fire protection and rural development."
"I also agree that this proposal must cover the commitments given in the Convention on Climate Change, which portrays forests as sinks full of greenhouse gases."
"Lastly, I am bound to regret the fact that the Commission proposal abuses the principle of subsidiarity, giving the Member States a rather passive role whereas it is their forests that suffer the damage."
"Even more serious is the fact that the Commission proposal does not cover the measures to prevent forest fires previously funded under Regulation No 2158/92."
"I therefore support all the amendments to the proposal that are intended to give the Member States greater involvement."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Redondo on the magnificent work she has done on her report."
"I believe that all of us here consider it very important to continue improving and fighting for these measures against the factors which contribute to all the deterioration of the European Union's forests, such as fires and acid rain, to which we can now add the Commission's proposal, relating to the fight to improve biodiversity."
"In view of the obvious deterioration of the forests, I believe you should be sensitive to Mrs Redondo's proposals."
"One of the issues I know best and which I believe is highly topical relates to the southern European regions, which are - as you know - most sensitive to the risks of forest fires."
"With regard to these regions we must continue to develop and expand a specific policy and we must combat forest fires."
"In relation to the Mediterranean forests, although they offer a great variety of strategies for combating drought, at the same time these strategies make it very easy for them to catch fire."
"The dry, arid climate, accidents - caused voluntarily or involuntarily - are reasons for the vulnerability of an ecosystem which is under a lot of pressure and which requires a lot of assistance if it is to be conserved."
"We will therefore support Mrs Redondo's report, and we ask the Commission to be sensitive to her amendments, and also, the great majority of the speeches of those of us who are trying to support the report by Mrs Redondo."
"Prevention and safety are very important in terms of maintaining all the European forests, above all in view of the characteristics of the southern forests."
"It is essential that the Commission take note and that it be sensitive to this report and our speeches defending the forests."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is hardly necessary to talk about the importance of forests to the European Union, in light of the fact that they occupy 40% of our territory and that they provide two and a half million jobs, not to mention their importance to the environment, as the Kyoto protocol recently acknowledged."
"It is therefore hard to understand why this Commission proposal excludes the cofinancing of measures to prevent forest fires, measures that were previously funded under Regulation 2158/92."
"The southern parts of the European Union are at greatest risk of desertification, as various speakers have already said, due to their hot, arid climate, which is extremely propitious to fires."
"Therefore, if we wish seriously to preserve the forests of southern Europe, we will have to provide for the funding of fire prevention measures."
"Unless the Council adopts Parliament's amendments to achieve this, the countries of southern Europe will not have the means to continue the actions they have embarked on to prevent forest fires, actions which, by their very nature, cannot be separated from monitoring actions provided for, incidentally, in the regulation."
"Unless forests are protected from fires, there is no point in talking about biodiversity, because when fires occur, they burn down everything."
"Neither plants nor animals survive."
"Tens of thousands of hectares burn down every year in Portugal and in other Mediterranean countries."
"Parliament has been sensitive to this scourge and has therefore proposed - and I hope will adopt - the amendments presented to us by Mrs Redondo Jiménez."
"Unless the Council is able to understand this, doubts will remain as to its ability to understand the reality of the situation of Europe's forests."
"I thank and congratulate Mrs Redondo Jiménez, who has guided us through this matter extremely ably, with great skill and tenacity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I, too, am sincerely grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo."
"The way that this new proposal Forest Focus combines two old demands, that woodland be protected against environmental pollution and against fires, meets with my fundamental approval."
"Just so that you realise that I know what I am talking about, Commissioner, I will say that I have a background in forestry, but in a northern country."
"I want to strongly emphasise the point of principle that forestry policy must remain in the hands of the Member States, and to keep on reminding the Commission of the principle of subsidiarity."
"Will Forest Focus have a beneficial effect on woodland and on those who own it, or is this just another exercise in keeping new hordes of bureaucrats employed and fed?"
"I have to tell you that, representing as I do the German province of North Rhine-Westphalia, I get the impression that Brussels takes absolutely no notice of what is really going on in European forestry."
"Within the European Union, 65% of the woodland is owned and managed by 12 million forest owners, and this branch of agriculture causes them serious problems as far as profitability is concerned."
"Two years ago, we ran a conference on this subject in Brussels."
"In my homeland, Commissioner, young farmers no longer have any interest in woodlands or in forestry."
"The property rights of woodland farmers are constantly being eroded."
"Why should a forester give his all without getting financial compensation, often without his efforts even being recognised by society?"
"If we say yes to it, Forest Focus will have to cover the social, economic and ecological fields in Europe."
"Bio-diversity and monitoring have a nice sound to them, but they do not give woodland farmers any financial entitlements in respect of the work they do."
"Let me say in conclusion that it is not those who are constantly discussing woodlands who are engaged in caring for nature and protecting it."
"I can tell you that if we do not succeed in making forestry a more profitable proposition overall for agriculture, young people in my homeland will simply throw in the towel."
"Even now, they are no longer prepared to clear up storm damage, for they take the line that this is a luxury they cannot afford."
"Let us not start imposing more and more new demands on them."
"Let us help to clean up the air."
"Let us help provide compensatory measures as well, so that they can do such things as fertilising the soil with manure and lime. Things really have to be said on the basis of practical experience, instead of just the empty forms of words that really do try my patience this late in the evening."
"Forests are an environmental, economic and national resource of incalculable value, as well as a source of health for the whole world, for the whole of Europe and for each individual country and, if we do not wish to become poorer by the year, the Commission and the national governments should treat them as such."
"I therefore consider that the Commission's proposed 'Forest Focus' places the emphasis on the right direction."
"However, I must point out that this proposal precludes the fire prevention measures for which provision is made in Regulation 2158/92, but which were not included in Regulation 1257/99, resulting in a very silly situation in which we have more money for monitoring forests and less money for preventing forest fires."
"If you cannot stop the fires, what is the point in monitoring the forests?"
"I therefore suggest that attention should be given to continuing and increasing funding for preventive measures."
"Neighbouring countries need to cooperate, so that they can prevent and fight fires efficiently, because fires do not recognise and more often than not cut across borders."
"If we are to be able to implement an ambitious programme, the budget of EUR 52 million for 2003-2006 needs to be increased to EUR 67 million, with provision for a proportionate increase following enlargement."
"The next item is the report (A5-0020/2003) tabled by Mrs Ulla Margrethe Sandbæk, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries [COM(2002) 120 - C5-0114/2002 - 2002/0052(COD)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets for this report, I must say that we issued our opinion last June with necessary speed for the multi-annual programme, which covers 2003-2006, to be fulfilled within the scheduled time period, but it was no use because, in view of the dates we are dealing with, it has clearly not been fulfilled."
"Without getting into an assessment of the main report which, naturally, is the responsibility of the Committee on Development, from a budgetary point of view I would like to say that the new financial framework proposed by the Commission meant an increase of 78% in the new programme in comparison with the previous one, which ended on 31 December 2002, which reflects the importance the Community attaches to this programme with a view to improving the reproductive health of people without sufficient economic resources in the developing countries."
"The financial framework we voted on in the Committee on Budgets was the one that appeared in the Commission's preliminary draft budget and which was finally ratified in the 2003 budget."
"It will not be possible to increase the amount proposed without reducing other policies in the same heading, because the financial ceiling has already been reached."
"The new Rules of Procedure have already entered into force and we therefore have Rule 63, which says: 'When the committee responsible amends the financial endowment of the act it is considering, it shall request the opinion of the committee responsible for budgetary issues'."
"This is not trivial."
"The Committee on Development, for its part, has increased the amount without requesting the opinion of the Committee on Budgets."
"In turn, at the meeting of coordinators of the Committee on Budgets it was agreed to present an amendment on behalf of that committee to the legislative proposal in order to clarify this issue and re-establish the initial amendment presented in my report."
"I am aware of the efforts made in the Committee competent for the main report to reach a consensus which would allow it to be approved at first reading and I congratulate them on their work. I am also aware of the thankless role the Committee on Budgets has to play on this issue, since it makes it the final judge of sensitive programmes whose verdict is based strictly on the budgetary framework."
"And I have already said that I am not going to get into assessing the fundamental aspects of the report."
"I believe we must be coherent with what we approve on this new regulation and we must use it, because that is what differentiates us from a secondary school assembly."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, for the sake of responsible and coherent parliamentary conduct, I would urge you to vote in favour of the amendments presented on behalf of the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, we too, the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, have been able to discuss this regulation."
"Moreover, we have had plenty of time to do so, for the opinion was, I believe, expressed last September."
"Indeed, we were aware of the importance of not leaving a gap between the adoption of a new regulation and the expiry of the previous one."
"In the Committee on Women's Rights, we decided to emphasise, first and foremost, the need to accompany these policies with a literacy programme promoting education, training, knowledge and culture, including basic information services on communicable diseases, hygiene, health and human rights."
"Great importance and value were accorded to this element, precisely because we believe that all the agreements we negotiate should be accompanied by the requirement of strict observance of human rights and, in particular, by a clear demand for policies of gender equality, as a precondition for any policy on the countries in question."
"We are convinced that reproductive health problems are also closely linked to issues of poverty and underdevelopment. We therefore believe that it is only by pursuing this line that they can be resolved."
"There is, of course, an urgent need, a need which we intend to address, first and foremost, with preventive and aid policies relating to pregnancy and birth but also responding to the need to combat diseases communicable from mother to child."
"Mr President, I would, first, like to congratulate Mrs Sandbæk on her report, which has achieved a broad consensus on a controversial issue."
"Reproductive health is one of the fundamental aspects of development and principally, but not solely, affects the developing countries."
"In those countries, pregnancies and births are the main cause of death and illness amongst women, as has been said previously."
"Therefore the Group of the European Socialist Party will undoubtedly support an active European Union policy on this issue which does not involve any moral stand, but rather a universal ethical imperative, human rights and development, and we therefore support the regulation being debated today."
"This regulation comes at a very appropriate time for the European Union to demonstrate its determination, when other large donors, such as the United States, are pushing for a reconsideration of the commitments made in 1994 at the Cairo Conference on Population and Development."
"That conference represented great progress, by correcting the political view of population which traditionally focussed on demographic objectives, and since then it has focussed on women's rights."
"No less than 179 countries agreed to an action plan on this new basis."
"However, at the 5th Conference on the population of Asia and the Pacific, held in Bangkok in December, there was a desire to remove any reference to rights in the field of reproduction and services relating to genetic health in order to conserve United States aid, which refuses to fund organisations which promote family planning, including the United Nations Population Fund."
"In reality, in order to reassure those people who are fundamentally opposed to rights relating to genetic health, we must make it clear that family planning, information and access to reproductive health services prevent abortion and, if it is carried out, it is better that it happens under safe and hygienic conditions in order to prevent the 78 000 deaths per year caused by unsafe abortions."
"This report and this regulation do not deal with abortion, but the European Union's contribution to social development, the population's access to information, to contraceptives, to health care during pregnancy and birth and responsible sexuality."
"The European Union must be generous."
"Therefore the Group of the European Socialist Party will do all it can within the framework of the financial perspectives and in accordance with budgetary authority to increase the funding for this regulation."
"We will vote tomorrow in favour of the amendments relating to funding and against any other amendment that may affect the content of this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is really amazing that we only hear voices of agreement in this Chamber this evening when behind the scenes so many obscure forces are trying to undermine the regulation and the financing of it."
"This has to do with the fact that the right to autonomous control over your body, your fertility and reproduction has never been completely accepted."
"In some circles people evidently still do not understand that women cannot be denied this right."
"Nor men either, but there has always been more sympathy for that in the past."
"When we consider the situation today, we see big differences in theory and in practice."
"If we look at the European Union, we find something that has not been discussed today that there are many cases in which men's, and especially women's, desires with regard to having children cannot be fulfilled because this is so difficult to combine with a demanding professional life and a busy life in general."
"Up to now we have not seen this as a collective problem."
"But in any case we know that very many women would like more children than the average 1.4 per family that, for example, is reached in Belgium."
"In the third world it tends to be the other way round."
"Of course a woman's fertility is a blessing there too, but it is also a curse because the number of children born is often more than the number she wants and more than she can give a decent upbringing to."
"That is, of course, because of the poverty in which the women and children live, as, of course, do the men too, but the number of women in the third world having to bring up children on their own is increasing more and more."
"The situation is very grave."
"At the time of the elections in Kenya, a social worker in one of the slums of Nairobi told me that the women find it so difficult to bring up their children that they are refusing to marry, because then they would have another person to look after and one who hits them."
"Family life is so disrupted by poverty that they say: we would rather try on our own."
"Of course the children have different fathers who do not care about the women or the children."
"We have not explained the need for this programme at all, because if we had we would set all the budgetary concerns on one side and give it far more resources."
"But I was talking about the social implications."
"In the European Union and the other rich countries this leads to the phenomenon of an ageing population, in the poor countries it leads to overpopulation and worsening poverty that often takes on structural forms."
"But your regulation is absolutely not targeting those large-scale societal phenomena."
"It is actually elementary, the help, the access that women and men but especially women must have to escape the frightful consequences of unwanted pregnancy, the frightful consequences of rape and also the frightful consequences that occur in other communities."
"I heard of a case of Roma women who are sterilised against their will at the moment they give birth."
"They are made infertile without knowing it."
"All this results from ignorance, of course, but it mainly due to grinding poverty."
"That is why we will support the Commissioner and the rapporteur and those who submit amendments, in order to oppose those in the world who through their resistance attempt to smear these regulations, the resources and the people who are working hard to promote reproductive health."
"We will make every effort to get these financial resources increased in the future and to see that they are used well."
"In view of the spread of AIDS, it has to be said that all our resources are insufficient at the moment."
"Fortunately official policy has come back to that meanwhile but in Kenya a few years ago people used not to tell pregnant women infected with the HIV virus that they had it, because they did not have the means to do anything about it."
"Now fortunately we have the means to prevent this dreadful disease being passed from mother to child."
"That 36 million people have to live with the HIV virus and that millions die of it every year must surely make an impression on those who only care about unborn lives and leave those who have been born to suffer and die."
"Mr President, reproduction and sexual health and rights are a very important issue for developing countries where so much could be done to alleviate maternal deaths and the by-product ills of illegal abortions."
"Health care is desperately needed yet, as this bundle of e-mails shows, it is also a highly sensitive subject and one that must be treated with respect by those at both ends of the spectrum."
"I would therefore begin by thanking Mrs Sandbæk for the long negotiations she has had, firstly with the Council and Commission representatives, and then with the co-ordinators, the political parties in this House."
"In any such sensitive issue, no one will be completely happy with the outcome."
"That is why - even with the strong feelings I have on this subject - I genuinely believe that the compromise reached in the Committee on Development and Cooperation gives us a package that this House should accept."
"I know there is a problem with the budget aspects of this report, but I hope that the amendments tabled are acceptable so that this report can have a clear majority in favour at first reading."
"It would be a tragedy for sick women in developing countries if this report were delayed in any way because of budget technicalities."
"The facts speak for themselves."
"At least 75% of all maternal deaths and injuries could and should be prevented through reproductive health care."
"Reproductive health in the context of this report covers all areas related to reproduction and associated diseases such as HIV-AIDS."
"Through long-term investment in reproductive health supplies, services and the appropriate counselling much can be done to stop unwanted pregnancies and to go some way to controlling the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases."
"I sincerely hope that honourable Members of this House will support this report."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Sandbæk on her work and secondly I would like to express my indignation and condemn the harassment which the Members who have supported this report from the outset have once again been subjected to."
"In recent days we have once again suffered - as also happened during the committee procedure and as also happened in this House in the case of the Van Lancker report - the bombardment of our e-mail systems with messages which have always been threatening, aggressive, laden with insults and furthermore always, without exception, lacking in arguments or a rigorous analysis of the content of the report, which is solely attributed with the aim of imposing mass sterilisations, and I will read out a fragment of an e-mail I have received: 'If this report is approved, the European Union would become one of the major promoters of abortion and the culture of death, and its approval would mean accepting the annihilation of the poor'."
"Accusing this Parliament of wanting to annihilate the poor leads me at least to entirely reject the content of such positions and virulent expressions which attempt to conceal a complete lack of arguments, because these groups who harass us and who claim to be pro-life, resorting to their religious convictions, are the ones who condemn poor women to the illness and death resulting from their reproductive role."
"In order to explain the true significance and importance of approving this report it is necessary to highlight certain crucial aspects."
"On the one hand, the importance of women as the main promoters of health, and on the other, the ratification - as has already been said - of the idea that there can be no social development without a healthy society and that the health of women is directly related to their reproductive role."
"Currently, 20% of the world's population is at the reproductive stage of their lives and it is therefore crucial that information on their sexuality and their reproductive capacity is available, in order to ensure that that population is protected from unwanted pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases."
"By ignoring the reproductive rights of women and denying them the power to chose, we are condemning them, their families and the communities they live in to illness and poverty, because we must not forget that health is undoubtedly a decisive element in the fight against poverty, a fight which the European Union advocates and is committed to."
"That commitment - made many years ago by the international community - must be reinforced at this time when we are faced with a cut in the funds allocated to sexual and reproductive health by certain governments which take a false and hypocritically moral approach to life."
"It is not possible to be in favour of life and then deny women in developing countries their right to information and to controlling their sexuality and reproductive capacity."
"In the developing countries female mortality relating to pregnancy and childbirth is 33 times greater than that in the industrialised countries."
"Reproductive health services are included amongst the indicators selected for evaluating the millennium development objectives."
"Improvements in reproductive health lead to lower pregnancy rates and reduction in dependency."
"Bad health leads to higher pregnancy rates and condemns families to poverty."
"In 2015 there will be 742 million people requiring sexual and reproductive health services or supplies."
"Control of their sexuality is a woman's right, but this is only recognised in the rich countries."
"The illnesses and consequences which women in the poor countries suffer principally originate from their reproductive role."
"Feminine health is an essential element if the poor countries are to make progress."
"Mr President, this is indeed an issue of the utmost importance."
"The relationship between poverty and low levels of development and sexual and reproductive health is very close and makes it incumbent on us to adopt measures that will enable us to end or at least to mitigate the extremely worrying situations we are seeing today in this field which, unfortunately, are growing worse."
"Hence the importance of this proposal for a regulation and the report by Mrs Sandbaek."
"I must point out, with regard to this report, the rapporteur's efforts to improve and to achieve a compromise, even at first reading, which enabled a broad consensus to be achieved on the proposals we are studying today."
"These efforts are all the more noteworthy because of the vague suspicions and frustrated attempts to include groundless justifications in the guidelines in question."
"Fortunately, the rapporteur, the political groups, the other committees involved and also Commissioner Poul Nielson, and everyone who has worked on this issue have been able to focus on the essential and I am sure that plenary will adopt the same approach."
"The essential lies in what has been acknowledged by the various international conferences on population and development, in understanding that access to reproductive and sexual health services forms a crucial part of the fight for development and against poverty and consequently the prevention of communicable diseases such as AIDS."
"Nor should it be swept under the carpet in this context that pregnancy and childbirth are the main causes of death and disability of women in less-developed countries."
"Nor should it be forgotten that a major proportion of maternity-linked deaths in those countries are closely linked to abortions carried out in unsafe conditions."
"These are undeniable and enormously serious occurrences that must be ended by means of appropriate measures, such as those now being responsibly proposed."
"This is also why means are also necessary and these have been clearly insufficient."
"This is why it is essential to make an effort, with the European Union leading the way."
"This is also why I believe it is crucial for Parliament, in accordance with its powers and responsibilities, and in the spirit of consensus and balance, to now earmark the amount proposed for this purpose."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for what he has said, and also Mrs Sandbæk for so eloquently defining why this is such an important and urgent regulation for us to deal with tomorrow."
"The WHO estimates that 88-98% of all maternal deaths are avoidable if women have access to proper reproductive and obstetric health services."
"Recently on a visit to Rwanda I learned that 2 000 women die per 100 000 live births."
"In my own country, the United Kingdom, that figure is seven."
"Maternal mortality continues to rise in developing countries."
"Women die from haemorrhaging, from infections, from high blood pressure, from obstructed labour."
"They also die from unsafe abortions."
"The last speaker talked about the rights of governments to choose."
"I would emphasise that women in these situations also have the right to choose."
"If women in a country like mine have that right, then I would also argue that a woman who wishes, because of a variety of different circumstances, to make that choice, then that should be her right."
"Providing for reproductive health is not a euphemism for abortion services."
"Women have the right to reliable information and to compassionate counselling."
"We must at all costs avoid being drawn into debates which are only about us reflecting United States domestic policy."
"The reality is that if we do not receive a positive vote tomorrow, there will be no budget line."
"We will be guilty of turning our backs on a maternal carnage such as we see in developing countries."
"Is that the signal we want to send from this Parliament to the suffering women of the developing world?"
"Now the European Union - and I emphasise also the governments of the south - needs to do more on maternal mortality, on HIV, on reproductive health and on contraception."
"North and south need to work together on everything from the country strategy papers which we produce with developing countries to prioritising gender issues and reproductive health and rights."
"Finally, I should like to say that it is very important that we have an understanding of gender and reproductive rights as a cross-cutting issue."
"We must invest more resources and interest to ensure that women can bear children in safety and with the freedom to choose if, when and how often to do so."
"(Applause from the Left)"
"Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Sandbæk and also Commissioner Nielson for his clear political direction on this issue."
"His very significant decision to substitute the funding through UNFPA that the Bush Administration wrongly withdrew is a hallmark of his distinguished record as Commissioner for Development."
"The European Union and Parliament, this week, have been subject to fundamentally misleading lobbying and publicity concerning the purpose of this regulation."
"For example, this e-mail from one of my constituents in Cambridge accuses us of 'obliging EU Member States to fund abortions', and adds the labels 'mad', 'irrational' and 'politically correct' for good measure!"
"As colleagues across the House have made clear, the regulation clearly incorporates the Cairo Agreement that specifically prohibits abortion as a method of family planning."
"Instead, these people, sadly given succour by some in the House tonight, want to prevent good reproductive health for women in developing countries, where 600 000 entirely preventable deaths of women in childbirth still occur each year."
"This is also absolutely essential to halt the spread of HIV-AIDS, which currently kills 8 000 people every day."
"This is about saving lives, not about losing them."
"Men as well as women must take responsibility for sexual health."
"As a man, that is why I joined with other men and women in this House to seek extra money this year for the reproductive health programme, in my role as budget rapporteur."
"One has to recall that 160 Members denied us the qualified majority, and EUR 6 million was lost."
"That money would have helped over 2 million women around the world to have safe pregnancy and birth."
"I hope that tomorrow we will be able to reinstate this funding, subject to the agreement of our budget colleagues."
"In April my own partner is expecting our second baby."
"I hope and pray that it will be a safe birth, knowing, as I do, that in Europe we have access to the best medical facilities, trained staff and health services that minimise the risks to mother and child."
"I do not see why any mother, anywhere in the world, should not have the right to the same protection."
"That is why I will support this vote and call on others to do so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission and Mrs Sandbæk have my support when they propose that the European Union should seek greater involvement in the areas of contraception, the fight against sexually-transmitted diseases and improved gynaecological provision in developing countries."
"I myself spent some time working as a doctor in Guatemala, an impoverished developing country, where I could see how necessary such aid is."
"Throughout these discussions, I have had in my mind's eye a woman who was one of my patients at the time and who had her eighth child at the age of twenty-four."
"I believe that we are under an obligation to bring to these women's attention what options are available by way of contraception."
"We are also, for example, under an obligation to increase the availability of condoms."
"Let me remind you, Commissioner, of how Mr Schmid of the Group of the Party of European Socialists proposed - all of two years ago - the establishment in Africa of a factory to manufacture condoms, enabling these to be made available there at low prices."
"I would ask the Commissioner to reconsider that."
"It is also my belief that 'contraception and birth control' is not just an issue of concern to women alone."
"I do believe that we have to give more support to science in its search for contraceptives for men."
"An international consortium has submitted an application in this area to the 6th research framework programme, but the Commission has, unfortunately, not considered it yet."
"One example of why I consider this very important is the medical fact that many women have an intolerance to the contraceptive pill, so alternatives are a matter of necessity, and this is one area where men cannot go on holding back."
"I do believe, though, that we have to make a very clear distinction between the issue of abortion and that of birth control, as well as the other issues discussed in the report."
"Abortion is a sensitive subject, and rightly so."
"I do not think it would be a good thing for the European Union to allocate to something like that any of the limited resources we have at our disposal for the support of people in developing countries."
"When I was, for five years, a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I constantly heard the Commission saying that there was not enough money."
"That was why they rejected many projects put before us by NGOs - projects that were not in the least controversial, and which everyone said we should support."
"As a result, I would have preferred it if this report had expressed, more clearly than it had done, that we support a great number of things - things that Parliament does not regard as controversial - but not abortion."
"I think Amendment No 53 expresses this very appropriately."
"I am glad that this report has been successfully focussed on the prevention of unwanted pregnancy and on the provision of real help for women."
"Above all, I wish to thank Mrs Martens for her great commitment."
"I would have liked us, however, to have put things in more precise terms - and perhaps tomorrow will find us managing to do that - so that we can indeed be united in our endorsement of this programme and of this report."
"Mr President, I am glad that Mrs Scallon is in the House tonight and that she is listed to speak."
"I want to hear her apologise to this House for the scurrilous lies that she told in the Irish media about this report: claims that EUR 50 million was being taken from Irish fishermen in order to promote abortion in the world; claims that Irish taxpayers' money was going to be used for promoting abortion in the world."
"They are scurrilous lies that should be retracted."
"We should have an apology here tonight from Mrs Scallon for promoting these falsehoods."
"I am pro-choice."
"I believe it is the responsibility of every man and woman to choose the number of children and the spacing of their children, as and when they choose."
"It is not for me to decide or for Mrs Scallon to decide."
"It is for each individual to decide."
"If I came across a woman who was pregnant and drowning, I would not ask her if she was pregnant, an abortionist, or if she would likely have her pregnancy aborted, before I threw her a lifeline."
"There are 600 000 women this year who will die, who probably have other children, certainly parents and certainly lovers or husbands who want them to live."
"We are being asked to deny them the right to life."
"Unfortunately, we are not giving enough money in this programme to save them all, but at the very least, we have the right and a duty to provide what we propose to provide and not pretend that we are in some way saving lives by opposing this programme."
"The attitude of Mrs Scallon and President Bush is based on heartless, theological hair-splitting which has nothing to do with life."
"We should stand up and be counted on this issue in this House and make it clear that we are 'for life' and 'for the lives' of the 600 000 women who die every single year."
"(Applause from the Left)"
"Mr President, I am convinced that by supporting this regulation, as agreed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Parliament will allow us to fund operations and agencies working to reach the international development targets, to empower women and to reduce infant, child and maternal mortality."
"The amendments voted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation have received wide support and strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation, without altering its main objectives."
"The Commission welcomes them."
"On Amendments Nos 46 and 47 on the financial proposal, I am not able to commit the Commission formally tonight because the broader discussions on allocations have not yet been concluded."
"However, I do not see this as something that should lead to a second reading."
"I am confident that we will find a solution."
"The new amendments tabled in plenary - Amendments Nos 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 and 53 - skew the focus and the substance of the regulation and are not acceptable to the Commission."
"Mr Ribeiro e Castro and a few others have remarked that laws are different in Member States and also said something about the competence of the European Union on these matters."
"We are on very firm ground in what is happening here."
"We are not discussing abortion policy in European Member States."
"We are discussing development policy and we are proposing to do what is clearly in line with what has been internationally agreed."
"This is the purpose of all this."
"I warn against changing this discussion into something totally different."
"Mr Ribeiro e Castro said that Amendment 49 is about clarification."
"I disagree."
"It is a change of the substance."
"We may not have this meeting taking place in full daylight, but I find it light enough in here to make the following remark."
"In the existing text, no support is to be given under this regulation to incentives to encourage sterilisation or abortion."
"Amendment 49 says: 'no support is to be given under this regulation to sterilisation or abortion, nor to ?'."
"This is not a clarification."
"This is a change of the substance."
"A spade should be called a spade and a text should be called a text."
"In reply to some of the other remarks made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I warn against throwing around quotes which are very difficult to verify."
"This debate has already had an overdose of that sort of input."
"One strong reason to remain with what the Committee on Development has concluded, as expressed by Mr Corrie and others, with whom I agree, is that it reflects the Cairo consensus - no more and no less."
"To Mr Ó Neachtain I say that I can subscribe to his observations."
"They are a precise account of the reality and the formalities of the issue, as stated."
"Anything other than what is now emerging here as the consensus from the Committee on Development and Cooperation represents an unacceptable deviation from Cairo."
"I advise that we stay on track."
"When following the international discussion on these issues over the last few years, we have repeatedly seen that proposals or attempts to backtrack from Cairo or to go beyond Cairo in all cases have been futile."
"That is another good reason for the European Parliament and the European Union to stay on track."
"I hope that we will be able to stay on track on this issue."
"(Applause)"
". (IT) We feel Mrs Sandbaek, Mrs Martens and Mrs Ferrer's work is satisfactory, considering the different starting points."
"We should always be mindful of our ability to produce texts which require respect for human rights, inviolability, self-determination and responsibilisation of the individual as a priority."
"The violent practice of abortion should therefore be excluded as a general means of family planning."
"A regulation whose objective is to protect health cannot contradict itself and attack life, the supreme good of the individual from the moment of conception."
"Another general consideration is countries' approach to these instruments, which reflect the responsibility that every State, every community and every individual should feel to protect life."
"With the help of the donor countries, the governments of the developing countries must provide information, education and appropriate instruments and encourage responsibilisation of the individual, to free people from ignorance, taboos, superstition and the archaic practices which go hand in hand with underdevelopment."
"My last point concerns the issue of the subordination of women to men."
"The culture of the hierarchy of force must be eliminated once and for all during the Third Millennium."
"The Third Millennium is characterised by the culture of information and knowledge and, therefore, must provide the conditions for free exchange between minds."
"Women must be able to dialogue with men without being affected by any form of sexism."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0026/2003) by Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: 2002 Review of the Internal Market Strategy - Delivering the promise [COM(2002) 171 - C5-0283/2002 - 2002/2143(COS)]."
"Mr President, this is a very important topic, one of the bases on which the European Union rests."
"Last November, I challenged Parliament to come up with bold new ideas for improving the internal market."
"The Harbour report more than meets that challenge."
"Ten years of the internal market have given us 2.5 million extra jobs and EUR 900 billion, cumulatively, in extra wealth."
"But that is not enough."
"Too many barriers are still holding us back."
"Enlargement makes it all the more urgent to clear the decks."
"As any engineer will tell you, if you add a couple of storeys to a building, which is what enlargement in essence will do, you must make sure that the foundations are sufficiently strong."
"Hence the emphasis in the forthcoming medium-term Internal Market Strategy for the years 2003-2006."
"The emphasis in that medium-term Internal Market Strategy - a document that the Commission will present in April - is on going 'back to basics'."
"Foremost among this move 'back to basics' is the matter of implementation and enforcement."
"I welcome Parliament's support for strengthening the Commission's enforcement powers in the future IGC."
"The Harbour report also calls on the Commission to calculate the economic costs of transposition delays."
"I can see the attraction of that idea, but the transposition deficit is a moving target which reflects different directives with different economic impacts over time."
"However, I have asked my staff to look into the feasibility of making such a calculation and I will report back to you as soon as possible."
"It is not yet as easy to trade within the internal market as it is to trade within a Member State."
"Borders still exist, not perhaps in the real world, but certainly in the minds of national officials who often do not yet think or act in a European way."
"We may need to put some disciplines in place to get a change in behaviour."
"As you may know, the Commission is giving very high priority to making a proposal for a horizontal instrument to remove barriers in the services market by the end of the year."
"We are also considering ways of making trade in goods easier."
"EU citizens and businesses deserve more and better information about their internal market rights."
"Mr Harbour's report calls for a second Internal Market Forum as a means of connecting with citizens."
"I welcome the idea of a second forum and I shall be honoured to take part - if you invite me, of course!"
"Removing tax obstacles is another key priority."
"I welcome Parliament's support for the Commission's communications on the taxation of persons and passenger cars, a subject dear to the heart of Mr Vatanen, who spoke to me at length about that."
"I respect his energy in pursuing that subject."
"The Commission will bring forward proposals this year to modernise and simplify VAT rules so as to reduce the burden on businesses, particularly on SMEs."
"This list is not exhaustive."
"We all know that the internal market covers a multitude of subjects."
"We are still open to ideas."
"I should like to work closely with Parliament in the coming months as our strategy takes shape."
"I will end by endorsing the opening paragraph of the Harbour report which states that the internal market should be the top priority for this year's Spring Summit."
"I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Harbour on that and call on Parliament to do everything it can to ensure that this comes about."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the third time in the space of the last few days that we find ourselves discussing the significance of the internal market."
"On Monday, we discussed the fallout from the World Economic Summit in Davos, and today we have already had a debate on the Spring Summit."
"Circling around the future of the internal market and the Lisbon targets, both debates made clear how important the internal market is to us."
"Both the Commissioner and the ten-year balance sheet documented and demonstrated the benefits brought by the internal market, in terms of growth, employment and competitiveness, to all our continent's citizens."
"Yet, despite these manifest advantages, the internal market is not yet complete and still has a large number of weaknesses."
"Allusion was made to the facts that 50% of the objectives have not yet been achieved, that the progress made is less than what had been aimed for, and that 2.1% of all the directives on the internal market have still not yet been transposed."
"We therefore call on the Commission and the Council to avail themselves of all the options available, including sanctions, coordination and the initiation of legislation, in order to bring to fruition those things to which we have jointly committed ourselves."
"The Lisbon targets are ambitious, and we will not achieve them without a successful internal market and without adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"The internal market and the Stability and Growth Pact are the essential instruments for achieving the Lisbon targets by 2010."
"Their importance lies in the credibility they give to long-term objectives."
"They have an essential contribution to make in building confidence in Europe's goals on the part of the public, of enterprises and employees."
"There is a blatant discrepancy between what is piously promised at summits and what is transposed at home, and so we demand that all the directives on the internal market be transposed into law."
"We demand that coordination of this process be taken charge of by the Commission, and that its right to initiate legislation be extended."
"This is no longer a matter of apportioning guilt, but of specifying short-term targets - and responsibilities - on the way to the overall objective."
"This has to do with fiscal policy, with the various competences involved, which still lead to distortions of competition and to new obstacles. It has to do with studying the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises as we progress towards this great internal market."
"Of course, it also affects the internal market in financial services, which would alone account for 1.1% - or EUR 130 billion worth - of growth, and it has to do with the creation of the internal services market."
"There is much for us to do, and, although we see from the balance sheet that we are on the right road, we must not slow down or come to a halt; instead, we have to discover a new dynamism."
"So I thank the rapporteur for having made us aware of these things in such an impressive way and also for defining new objectives."
"Mr President, I should like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur for the work he has done on this report."
"I always find it somewhat amazing that on this graveyard shift on a Wednesday night, which Mr Harbour and I have shared on many occasions, we have ended up discussing perhaps one of the most important pieces of legislation that the European Union has passed, but the way this Parliament operates, that tends to be the way of things."
"It is just over ten years now since the internal market came into operation."
"In that time, vast strides have been made towards the completion of the market."
"That said, however, there is still a long way to go."
"There are still a number of barriers - barriers to trade."
"We look at the different tax regimes in the Member States, whether it be indirect taxation or direct taxation - all are used as barriers to trade."
"We look at different employment legislation in Member States - this too is used as a barrier to trade."
"We look at our own failure to decide upon a Community patent - again that is a barrier to trade, but the solution there is in our own hands."
"However, it is not only the free movement of goods that we should be concerned about."
"It is also about the free movement of workers, the free movement of labour."
"At the moment within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market we are discussing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications."
"The sooner that is sorted out, the sooner another barrier will be removed."
"In today's climate, however, there is another barrier."
"It is a barrier of fear and suspicion which has developed since 11 September, but was probably there beforehand."
"That is a barrier restricting the free movement of workers."
"We cannot allow ourselves to become a fortress Europe by setting up internal walls."
"I was interested to hear what the Commissioner had to say."
"The onus is on him, however, to take a long hard look at every Member State to see where these countries, while proclaiming the benefits of the internal market, are at the same time blocking its completion by using internal rules to flout it."
"Most of the time this is for short-term political gain."
"We have an opportunity to bring about the completion of the internal market."
"Commissioner, you challenged this Parliament to come up with a hard-hitting report which you have now got."
"We challenge you to finish the job - and you have our support."
"Mr President, I would like to join others in congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Harbour, on his report, which is very complete and which has been negotiated with a creditable willingness to seek consensus."
"I have tried to cooperate with the fundamental objectives of the report - with which I may say I am in total agreement - with certain amendments because I thought it would be useful to incorporate certain points."
"The first, in line with what Mr Martin has just said on behalf of the Committee on Industry, is to reject - and this has been done very intelligently by the rapporteur - the equal treatment, undoubtedly hasty on the part of the Commission, of Parliament and the Council with regard to the causes of the delay of certain rules of the internal market."
"As we say in our country, 'every candlestick should support its candle' and we should not all be judged equally in relation to responsibilities that are different."
"The second aspect was the need - and Mr Harbour agreed immediately - to incorporate workers' organisations into the cooperation which were and are laid down in the report between the consumers' organisations and the employers' organisations."
"For those whose political doctrine consists of a social market economy, this involvement by all social elements seems to us to be significant."
"I would like to take up a statement by the Commissioner: as long as all active sections of European society fail to take on board the idea of the internal market, all imaginable rules and actions will be insufficient to make it a reality."
"If on the other hand society is mobilised, this objective will be achieved much more easily."
"The rapporteur has also accepted my request that greater attention be paid to the existing obstacles to the creation of small businesses and the necessary initiatives to overcome them."
"Because, Mr President, we can go on and on about employment in large companies, but the people who really provide work in the European Union, in really huge quantities, are the small and medium-sized businesses."
"And we must ensure that they can be incorporated into the internal market without obstacles, as Mr Karas has said."
"Finally, I would like to acknowledge the progress made thanks to the efforts of Commissioner de Palacio - it is fair to say - on liberalisation, not 'liberation' as the Spanish text mistakenly says, in the field of gas, electricity and air transport."
"I would like to thank Mr Harbour for incorporating these points, as well as the fortunate way he has incorporated the principle elements of my Amendment No 40 into paragraph 33; by the way, Mr President, and for the benefit of the services of this House, I would like to make the observation that this paragraph 33 of the English text does not exist in the Spanish text, and it should also be included in our language."
"I will therefore vote in favour of this excellent report, on which I congratulate Mr Harbour once again, and I would also like to thank him for his kind words for Mrs Palacio, not the Commissioner, but her sister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has cooperated so fully in the work to implement the internal market."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.55 p.m.)"
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"We begin by voting on a request to apply urgent procedure to the proposal for a Council Regulation amending, as regards the exemptions to the freezing of funds and economic resources and for the tenth time, Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda network and the Taliban [COM(2003) 41 - C5-0048/2003 - 2003/0015(CNS)]"
"I would first give the floor to Mr Hernández Mollar, Chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"(ES) Madam President, yesterday, the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, of which I am chairman, did indeed hold an extraordinary meeting to deal with this matter and it was agreed to refuse urgent procedure, and for two basic reasons: firstly, because the urgent procedure is not authorised to be applied on one day for the next; in the meeting, neither the Commission nor the Council presented good enough arguments; and, secondly, because I believe we must demand of the Council that it justify urgent procedure and, also, not to treat Parliament as a mere formality, even though it has to be said that, in this case, the content of the proposal also reflects the opinion of Parliament."
"In any case, this matter will be dealt with next Monday in our committee's ordinary session."
"If no one else wishes to take the floor, we shall vote on this request for urgent procedure."
"We shall now proceed to the vote on the request for urgent procedure."
"(The decision was made not to apply urgent procedure.)"
"The next item is a report (A5-0021/2003) by Mrs Malliori, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence [COM(2002) 201 - C5-0270/2002 - 2002/0098(CNS)]."
"Madam President, this proposal for a Council recommendation is based on Article 152 of the Treaty, which stipulates that Community action complementing national measures is to cover the fight against the major health scourges."
"The Treaty cites drugs and drugs-related harm in the following way: 'The Community shall complement the Member States' action in reducing drugs-related health damage, including information and prevention.'"
"May I also remind you that one of its main initiatives in the fight against drugs - the EU Drug Strategy 2000-2004 - includes amongst its three main public health targets one to reduce substantially drugs-related health damage and the number of drugs-related deaths."
"The reported number of deaths related to drug overdose in the European Union is approximately 7 000 per year."
"Deaths indirectly related to drug use, such as AIDS, traffic accidents, violence or suicide, bring this figure to approximately 20 000 a year."
"Preventing the use of illegal drugs is a top priority."
"This can be achieved by reducing both the supply and the demand for drugs."
"This proposed recommendation particularly covers the demand side and takes over where law enforcement fails to stop the supply of drugs."
"Clearly, we should try to persuade people not to use illegal drugs in the first place."
"However, when an individual cannot be stopped from taking drugs, it is of vital importance that every effort is made to decrease the damage to the person involved, as well the indirect damage the user can cause to others."
"The addicted individual needs to be actively involved in these efforts."
"This is called risk reduction - or sometimes harm reduction or harm minimisation."
"This is what the main part of the recommendation is about."
"The risk reduction methods that feature in the recommendation are well established."
"They have been used in most or all of the Member States, but to varying degrees."
"Opiates, such as heroin, are the root cause of most drugs-related deaths."
"One of the oldest of the risk reduction methods is controlled use of methadone tablets as a substitute for injected heroin."
"Methadone first appeared in the EU in the late 1960s in response to emerging opiate use."
"The emergence of HIV in the 1980s led to the introduction of needle- and syringe-exchange programmes."
"In recent years, the number of acute drugs-related deaths at EU level as a whole has stabilised, in spite of increasing drug use."
"Many factors may have contributed to this development."
"Injecting drugs has decreased in some countries and medical treatment of overdoses has improved."
"However, the risk reduction methods covered by this recommendation are likely to have made a large contribution to this favourable development."
"Drug services need to be easily accessible, reaching out to the place where the drug user happens to be, not where we want him or her to be."
"These are termed 'outreach services'."
"Such services should also be offered without unrealistic demands - sometimes called 'low threshold services'."
"The aim is to prevent further deterioration in the health and social circumstances of users and motivate them to seek treatment."
"The more controversial risk reduction methods are not mentioned in the present recommendation, although they are being used in some of the Member States."
"Methods such as heroin injections under supervision, injection rooms, open-drug scenes and on-the-spot anonymous testing of substances require more research and evaluation before they can be generally recommended."
"The recommendation emphasises evaluation as a key tool for improving drugs-related measures."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in Lisbon plays a crucial role in the development of key indicators for monitoring and comparing drug use in the Member States."
"It also assists in providing guidelines for the evaluation of drugs-related projects and evaluates different programmes and policies."
"The Commission has received invaluable help from the Lisbon agency in preparing this recommendation, which I see as a positive step for drug users as well as public health in general."
"Madam President, Commissioner, unfortunately, drug abuse is one of today's major social problems, meaning that the measures and policies applied so far have been inadequate."
"Drug use is increasing along with the other problems facing modern society."
"The 2002 annual report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction shows that the level of drug use is fairly stable, with 2 to 9 users per 1 000 population in the 15 to 64 age group, 500 000 to 1 000 000 of whom are drug injectors, that is, heroin addicts."
"That is why, even though the primary objective when dealing with this problem is still and always will be prevention, I think this is a very important initiative and I congratulate you, Commissioner, on your proposal on the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence."
"I make no bones about the fact that I would have preferred this particular proposal to have been a legislative proposal because it is common European policy or at least a legislative approach that makes our policies effective."
"Nonetheless, I think that the proposed recommendation is an important step towards protecting both public health and the personal health of users and that we are sending out the right political message; that addicts are patients in need of medical and social care, not just offenders, as most societies today believe."
"Our proposed amendments mainly specify the action needed at local level if we are to achieve maximum possible results in this difficult and sensitive sector."
"Raising public awareness in order to gain acceptance of various forms of treatment and other user protection programmes is vital if we are to be able to implement the proposed recommendation."
"In other words, when we talk of measures to reduce the harm done by drug use, the main objective is still to cure the user."
"However, as we know, a large number of drug addicts do not sign up for treatment programmes, and it is basically this group that has the most problems."
"We can only stop dangerous diseases such as hepatitis, AIDS and tuberculosis from spreading if we educate this group on the health risks."
"This should also encourage users to be more careful when taking drugs and adopt a healthier lifestyle."
"It is also vital to include measures targeting high-risk environments, such as prisons."
"The proportion of inmates in the EU reporting having used drugs varies according to prisons and countries from between 29 and 86%."
"Prisoners are highly exposed to illnesses through the use of common syringes and needles and sexual contact."
"Inevitably, the prison staff also face an immediate danger and a number of amendments have been proposed in order to reflect this."
"As you know, Commissioner, the drug debate has been a topical debate for quite some time now and always gives rise to a great many, usually conflicting views."
"Nonetheless, and my thanks here to all my colleagues, especially the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation, we have managed to table a relatively well-endorsed proposal in plenary today, despite the 103 original amendments."
"I think that, if the Member States implement just some of the proposed measures, both users and their families and European citizens will feel that we are determined to do something about this complex and difficult problem."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report and the Commissioner for bringing forward this proposal."
"I think the Commissioner is right at this stage that it should be a recommendation."
"There are different cultures in different Member States and we need to respect that, and so recommendations on good practice are probably the way forward at this stage."
"I should also like to point out to him and to you, Madam President, that he needs to go through the text of his communication to make absolutely certain there is nothing in it which will frighten people into thinking that this recommendation is in any way promoting drug use."
"There is no safe drug abuse, it is a question of how we reduce and prevent the harm that arises from such abuse."
"In my country we have 3 million people on illegal drugs, 28% of them are 16-29 year olds, 14% of them are 14-15 year olds."
"We have 12 000 new notified addicts, 70 000 drug offences and 1 200 drug related deaths per year."
"If you look at the European figures from the MCDDA, offences in the EU have doubled since 1991 and quadrupled in some countries such as France, Greece and Spain."
"Acute drug related deaths have doubled since 1985."
"There are those who use the same arguments as we sometimes hear on AIDS, saying that we can forget about those people who are infected, but should protect and save the rest."
"However, we must not abandon people who are hooked."
"Many of them, as those figures show, are children."
"We are losing the battle but we must not give up the fight."
"Our aims must be to target the growers and manufacturers, the traders and pushers, and to educate, deter and prevent, but also to reduce the harm to those addicted and to those with whom they come into contact. This recommendation does exactly that."
"No Member State is forced to do anything."
"This sits alongside measures on prevention."
"To my colleague Mr Santini I would say that if his amendments 60, 61, 63 and 64 were in addition to the proposals in this report then I would be happy to accept them."
"It is only if they replace the proposals that I am less happy."
"This is not the occasion for a debate on legalisation and I know there are some amendments on that."
"That is why I would reject the legalisation and decriminalisation arguments on this occasion."
"The report does not replace harm reduction with other measures, least of all 'JUST SAY NO', which does not work."
"I know that from having been Minister responsible for drug addiction in my own country."
"You have to tell young people in particular the truth."
"They have to know the upside as well as the downside."
"We had the case of Leah Betts, a young girl who died taking ecstasy, an amphetamine."
"Afterwards, her parents very bravely allowed a video of her body to be shown, so that young people would understand the effect of taking ecstasy."
"They also joined us in making sure that we issued guidance to night clubs on how to avoid this catastrophe affecting other people."
"It is a question of water provision and 'chill-out rooms' and so on, and not a question of 'shooting rooms', which is a completely different matter."
"There are so many young people who need and deserve our support."
"There are needle exchanges, which protect not just the addicts, but also the people with whom they are in contact. Prison health needs to be looked at and we need to stop the abuse of drugs in prison, but we also need to ensure there is harm reduction and that we do not incorporate perverse incentives to further drug taking."
"I welcome this report."
"The whole subject needs to be treated with care, and I know the Commissioner will ensure that this is the case as we move forward to take on good practice throughout the European Union."
"I give the floor to Mrs Sandberg-Fries, whom I would take the opportunity to welcome back to the European Parliament."
"Madam President, this report concerns the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence."
"From the beginning, we Swedish Social Democrats have held the view that the recommendation focuses to an unduly high degree upon harm reduction."
"Our point of departure is that the most important measure for reducing harm is that of preventing dependence itself."
"That does not mean that we deny the need for efforts to reduce harm."
"Such efforts must, however, form part of a coherent strategy aimed at bringing about lasting change and lives not dependent upon illegal and other drugs."
"On this point, the committee has complied with quite a few of the proposals we have tabled."
"It is therefore very odd that the same committee in the same report should also have accepted a number of amendments in quite the opposite vein."
"I mean the proposals concerning so-called chill-out rooms, drug classification, special injecting rooms and positive information about drugs."
"These are proposals that we cannot under any circumstances support."
"Such measures would imply social acceptance of drug abuse. Nor, obviously, do we accept proposals that are basically contrary to the UN Convention on Drugs."
"The fact that a drugs policy based upon the three components consisting of prevention, treatment and control really can be successful is, I think, confirmed by the latest major survey carried out in Swedish schools."
"This survey shows that 92 out of every 100 pupils in Swedish schools have not even tried drugs."
"This is a result that, in an international context, is extremely encouraging."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am keen to do again what I did in committee, that is, to express my support for our rapporteur Mrs Malliori on this subject, which is, to say the least, a controversial subject that evokes passion."
"The approach deliberately chosen by the committee and by our rapporteur, that of focussing on providing, on a local scale, step-by-step programmes targeting persons addicted to hard drugs, seems to us to be the right one, the one most likely to yield tangible results at grass-roots level and to reverse the current, rather disturbing, tendency."
"Drug-related deaths are on the up, and that seems to be the case in most of the Member States."
"For all these reasons, the Liberal Group welcomes the amendments that add value to this recommendation in terms of public health."
"Our governments must indeed give priority to high-risk environments."
"Streets, the penal system, nightclubs, raves, are all places where hard drugs circulate freely and without regard to the minimum standards of health and safety."
"We must of course prioritise action programmes on the street, in prisons and also in places of nocturnal entertainment where the simultaneous consumption of more than one drug is prevalent."
"As regards this latter practice of using drugs and alcohol at the same time, which is cutting swathes through young people in particular - and they are getting ever younger - it is imperative that, in parallel with one another, schemes for prevention, information, analysis of chemical substances and providing a rapid response in the event of illness or withdrawal, should be operated and made widely available."
"The 8000 citizens who are dying every year in the European Union, from overdoses, from adulterated products, or as a result of shared needles, deserve a full-frontal approach to risk reduction on the part of the European Union."
"Let me say now that I regret the fact that we have not, in this report, completely succeeded in focussing our attention on this specifically health-related aspect, at the risk of watering down our message and reverting to an ethical and generalised debate, which would again be futile and would attempt to set up prevention and suppression in opposition to each other."
"I wish to say that I go along with Mr Bowis' arguments and that I am unable to accept those put forward by Mrs Sandberg-Fries."
"My conclusion, Madam President, is that we need to set ourselves realistic targets if we are to be able to say, tomorrow at least, that the EU's new action plan on drugs has been a success."
"Madam President, I should like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Malliori, who, as do other rapporteurs in the case of all the reports we prepare, relies on the opinions of the other groups with a view to obtaining a final outcome that we can all accept."
"It seems that, in this case, there are some differences of opinion, but I believe that it will be possible for the report to be approved by a majority of this Parliament."
"The report and the Commission communication refer to the prevention and reduction of risks."
"Every Member will express his or her opinion in this Chamber on how risks are to be prevented and reduced."
"Mrs Malliori's report clearly refers to reducing supply and demand, to integrated policies, to the exchange of good practice and to a concern for social re-integration."
"These are the bases of the report."
"To achieve these aims, a variety of methods, including prevention programmes, are required, as are assessments of various methods of treatment and rehabilitation, taking into account the work of former drug addicts, their families and the communities that work with them."
"In my own region of Asturias, the organisation 'Proyecto Hombre' operates in this way and obtains results that I can see every day, encouraging local communities to set up, on the one hand, mobile units able to provide information, advice, assistance and first aid in the event of overdoses and, on the other hand - and, in this connection, I do not understand some of the amendments tabled - mobile units to dispense condoms, needles and syringes, something that has been proven to reduce AIDS infection and other illnesses."
"Furthermore, it is necessary to support the innovative proposals reflecting experiments carried out with, as one approved amendment states, some success by a number of Member States with a view to preventing deaths and reducing risks."
"I know that, on this subject, there are differences, including in my own group, where my Swedish fellow MEPs do not share this position of mine."
"In this case, I agreed with an amendment by Mr Davies - defeated in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - that proposed authorising and evaluating the professional prescription of heroin to addicts so that they might escape the clutches of dealers."
"In my own country - and I heard the Commissioner say that he is now ready to approve this option - a pilot programme is to be carried out in one autonomous region, specifically Andalusia, involving chronically ill people who have completed re-integration programmes and entailing controlled doses of heroine being administered professionally only to those drug addicts who have shown that they are unable to give up the drug."
"An assessment will be carried out in due course."
"One hundred and thirty people chronically addicted to the drug have been selected to see if the programme produces results."
"I, for my part, Commissioner, think that this programme is very worthwhile because it may help us all in the future."
"I shall conclude by pointing out that the report also deals with the situation in prisons."
"Depending upon the particular country, the situation in prisons is very serious, and there are a very great many prisoners infected with a variety of illnesses, precisely because they have taken drugs and used infected needles and syringes."
"Madam President, a report like this, on how to deal with drug abuse, will always be controversial in this House."
"This is because it touches on our inability to control reality, and that is difficult for us as politicians."
"I therefore think that it is courageous and commendable that the rapporteur has managed to keep both feet on the ground."
"She says in her explanation, and I quote: 'In an ideal world there would be no drug abuse."
"In the real world, drugs have always been a fact of life.' and that is the way things are."
"Zero tolerance or simpler still, closing your eyes, is not a solution."
"The question to our politicians is therefore how can we bring about an improvement to a reality that we do not like."
"One such possibility is described in Amendment No 24, which encourages Member States to facilitate the testing of synthetic drugs."
"These are drugs that are mainly used by young people at discos, concerts and parties."
"A lot of young people use them, perhaps even our sons and daughters, but many of these drugs are not innocent - certainly not if they have been tampered with to increase the profit margin even further."
"I am in fact talking about ecstasy, the consequences of which have also just been set out by Mr Bowis."
"It often results in fatal accidents."
"Testing can reduce the health risks."
"It puts social workers in touch with users, and it also helps assess the dangerous substances that are available on the market."
"Testing can take place in testing centres throughout the country or in situ at parties or concerts."
"You will of course have to be careful and make sure that the approval of a pill cannot be interpreted as a statement that it is a good idea to use it, because of course it is not."
"Advice, the provision of information and prevention naturally remain key, but I nevertheless think that it is also extremely important for the government to try to make nightlife a little safer."
"The use of these pills by young people is a fact, and I think that it is important for us to prevent fatal accidents from happening in our children's nightlife."
"Madam President, given the seriousness of the drugs problem I find it incomprehensible that Mr Byrne and the Malliori report are recommending a 'beating your head against a brick wall' policy in this way."
"Parliament's resolution on the Action Plan to Combat Drugs (2000-2004) clearly indicated at the time that drug abuse results in biological, psychological and social problems, disease, problems with families and at work, committing offences, traffic accidents, and so on. Drug abuse is also a threat to young people."
"For these reasons, in 1999 the same resolution called for everything to be done to give priority to protecting children under the age of 18 and to reduce the number of drug-related deaths."
"It is well known that there are differences between different kinds of drugs."
"The most serious drug problems affect intravenous drugs users, of whom there are, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, between 500 000 and one million in the European Union."
"Intravenous drug use inevitably results in social exclusion, as it soon excludes the essential elements of normal life - work, family, personal relationships and a permanent home."
"That is not to say, however, that there is nothing wrong with other drugs."
"It was wrongly stated in the discussions that so-called soft drugs are harmless."
"It is partly on account of this belief that the use of cannabis has increased enormously."
"It has furthermore been scientifically proven that there is a relationship between the use of these drugs and mental health."
"For example, the chance of developing schizophrenia is 30% to 50% higher for cannabis users."
"I am quoting the British Medical Journal of 23 November 2002."
"What is more, the policy of tolerance of soft drugs - as in the Netherlands - has resulted in an increase in use, particularly among young people."
"In practice the switch to hard drugs has also been shown to be much easier; after all, the use of drugs is already accepted."
"The recommendation before us is about the health risks associated with drug addiction."
"The European Commission mainly places the emphasis on limiting the risks instead of prevention."
"The rapporteur is arguing for additional measures, particularly for the care of drug users at local level, for example by helping drug users achieve a healthier life."
"The rapporteur cites the provision of a number of elementary health services such as clean hypodermic syringes and blood tests."
"This may perhaps go a little way towards achieving better hygiene, but does not contribute to solving the problems."
"I am firmly convinced that kicking the habit is the best way of achieving a healthier life."
"The policy of harm reduction does not work, as it has been shown that the overload caused by users increases again after a while and the provision of free methadone seems only to result in additional addiction."
"The negative effect of a liberal drugs policy has the effect of drawing people into certain other areas."
"Crime, decay and the lack of safety in certain parts of towns and cities have taken on serious proportions."
"To dismiss these arguments with the argument that this recommendation is only about the effects on health is misplaced."
"The effects on health can best be reduced by means of a restrictive policy."
"In addition, I am also in favour of proper help for addicts."
"It does depend on how this is done, however."
"We do not help drug addicts by only treating symptoms."
"If we want to get drug addicts out of the downward spiral, kicking the habit - either voluntarily or otherwise - is the best option."
"In the Netherlands there are fortunately examples of so-called hopeless cases who, with the right motivation, have been helped to achieve a drug-free existence."
"This approach does most to benefit health."
"I cannot accept Mr Bowis' suggestion for Amendments Nos 60, 61 and 64 to be regarded as additional ones."
"Madam President, Commissioner, it is a matter of concern that the use of drugs is everywhere being treated as unimportant and commonplace."
"This phenomenon goes hand in hand with the social acceptance of the marketing of them for recreational purposes, sometimes on a daily basis."
"Drugs are not, though, an accident of fate to which one must resign oneself."
"They involve serious risk of infection and lead to people being socially excluded in a very real sense."
"You have to call a spade a spade."
"This report speaks of risks, for the danger is indeed there."
"Let me say that I am astonished that the report does not retain the amendment I had tabled in committee with the aim of avoiding the pitfall of trivialising drug use."
"How do you combat evil if you start from the premise that it is inevitable or even necessary?"
"To do so demonstrates a sad detachment from reality."
"The risk will be no less if we sink into politically correct indifference."
"Drug addiction is not tolerable."
"It is a scourge that must be fought against."
"There are no soft drugs."
"There certainly needs to be information, but the trivialisation of drug use is a snare and must be combated."
"As for a policy of risk-reduction, it could not do other than appear like fatalistic acceptance of the dangers."
"This not about marginalising drug users still further, nor about scuppering risk reduction schemes, but about demonstrating at last the will to undertake preventive measures, which must have a simultaneous effect on both supply and demand and on our sense of social responsibility."
"The refusal to trivialise drug use means taking up our responsibilities, both as regards our young people, who are most affected by this, and also with respect to social cohesion, which must always unite us all."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I am one of those who take the view that, where the global repercussions of drug addiction for public health, crime and insecurity are concerned, it would be preferable, wherever possible, to develop European approaches."
"I therefore welcome this proposal for a recommendation and the excellent report by Mrs Malliori."
"Our policy for combating drug addiction has proved to be a failure: the prohibitionist approach has given trafficking oxygen, allowing it to thrive and to make ever-greater profits, boosting both organised and petty crime, corrupting regimes and humiliating us for being powerless to do anything about it."
"Furthermore, the deterioration of drug addicts' health is of concern, but also the health risks arising from infection such as HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, as well as the increasing number of deaths from overdoses and poisoning."
"Faced with such problems, it is impossible to be absolutely sure of what approach to take."
"We must, however, move in a new direction."
"Although I believe that the debate must continue calmly in the United Nations on the impact on public health and crime of the possible decriminalisation of some drugs, I do not think that this should be our priority."
"Our priority should be, firstly, to draw up rational prevention policies based on scientific knowledge of each drug and not on an emotional response and on the radical approach which, by treating all drugs equally, ultimately removes the credibility of preventive action."
"Our second priority is to develop a risk-reduction policy."
"For those infected for whom free drug treatments have not achieved positive results, methadone substitution programmes must be pursued."
"It is also important that experiments involving administering heroin under medical supervision to patients with a long history of failure to respond to treatment and chronic illnesses are pursued and implemented in other States."
"We must also be able to undertake an evaluation of these results."
"Many of these experiments have shown positive results in reducing crime, the number of overdoses by poisoning and the number of those infected with HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and hepatitis C."
"Madam President, drug addiction is a complicated problem with significant social consequences for the user and for his or her environment, with risks to health and ongoing crime."
"There are, however, not only social consequences, but also social causes."
"Our rapporteur, Minerva Malliori, deserves our firm support for her approach."
"A tailor-made approach; as drug users are not all the same, the prevention of drug use and drug addiction must be based on respect for the drug user."
"There has been a great deal of disagreement over the years about the approach to the drugs problem, all of which involve firm stances."
"The Commission has opted for a policy of risk reduction or damage limitation."
"Rightly so, as risk reduction can limit the impact on health."
"A policy of monitoring substances and clean hypodermic syringes can save lives."
"Naturally risk reduction must not lead to complacency, however."
"We cannot relax about the addiction problem."
"Conversely, the policy of damage limitation is precisely what makes a convincing approach to drugs crime possible."
"There thus does not need to be a huge contrast between the policy of damage limitation and the policy of drug prevention."
"We should be receptive to the benefits of each approach. Mrs Malliori's local approach can achieve a great deal, and the establishment of mobile low threshold help services is a good idea."
"We do not, however, have to strive towards a uniform approach, although we must be willing to learn from one another."
"We must compare the approaches to see which is effective in countering addiction."
"This report is a good opportunity for us to familiarise ourselves with the approach in various countries."
"I warmly invite my fellow Members to come and see how it is done in the Netherlands."
"My thanks and appreciation to Mrs Malliori again."
"Madam President, hundreds of thousands of people die each year from the use of perfectly legal drugs."
"Yet we subsidise the growing of tobacco plants while we cut down cannabis plants."
"It is all complete nonsense."
"The truth is that prohibition lies at the very heart of many of our problems."
"Prohibition creates huge profits for criminals, who seek to extend their market."
"Prohibition fosters corruption and theft."
"Prohibition denies drug users the information about content that is available to everyone who enjoys an alcohol drink in the evening."
"If health messages are to work and society is to be protected we must replace prohibition with government regulation."
"The criminals must be denied their profits if we are to bring these problems under control."
"This paper is an excellent step forward."
"It ignores the moral outrage which has been expressed so often in the past."
"It concentrates on pragmatic and sensible steps to inform people and reduce harm."
"It is in complete contrast to the Swedish approach, which I find utterly appalling."
"As Mr Bowis said, just saying 'no' does not work - it certainly does not work in most of the societies in which we live."
"The idea that we should try and prevent needle exchanges, for example, will simply mean more deaths, more blood poisoning, more AIDS."
"It is a vicious and cruel approach."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian Radicals do not support this report either."
"At a time such as this when we have an opportunity to discuss drugs, the Malliori report does not provide Parliament, particularly in the light of the disastrous effects of 40 years of prohibitionist policies and insubstantial endeavours - 'lightweight' measures - which have failed miserably to control the spread of illegal drugs and, on the contrary, even exacerbated the social effects and effects on people's lives and health - does not provide the European Parliament - with the opportunity to state some very simple truths: that prohibitionism has failed and that we therefore need to take steps, even one step at a time, to separate the markets, for example, to prevent the black market attracting consumers of hashish or marijuana, which are not drugs, and inducing them to approach the markets of other drugs."
"We need to look carefully at the experiments with public injection rooms, at the experiments carried out in Switzerland and other European countries, to find a different path from that of the current policy which has led the European countries, and all the countries striving in vain to combat drugs, to continue with their prohibitionist policies."
"This is why, together with other Members and the International Antiprohibitionist League, we have launched a large-scale campaign condemning the UN Conventions."
"This is our position and we will therefore vote against the Malliori report, for it contains nothing new and just stresses the severity of the problems without proposing any solution, in some cases even changing the approach for the worse."
"Madam President, when we talk about drugs, we clearly mean out-and-out war. We cannot just be content with a few short battles."
"The battles we are talking about today are preventing and reducing the damage but, clearly, all these measures are, in any case, dependent upon the success of other measures such as combating drug trafficking and consumption."
"It must be pointed out that we need to start by addressing a human condition, the condition of drug addicts."
"We need to change our approach: drug addicts must be treated as people who are ill rather than criminals, and so we need to take lines which are consistent with this view and, therefore, employ treatments which bring about the recovery of drug addicts rather than social exclusion."
"That is why, out of the two kinds of treatment still being debated, many of us still prefer the more human approach of rehabilitation communities, therapeutic communities, to the administration of chemical substances which are alternatives to or substitutes for drugs."
"We do not endorse the use of substances such as methadone, except in extreme clinical cases."
"In addition to medical and pharmaceutical care, we need to provide drug addicts with psychological help too."
"First and foremost, we need to step up the fight against the network of traffickers who continue, I regret to say, to be on the scene."
"Turning briefly to methadone, I would say that it is a substitution substance which does not resolve the problem of drug dependence and, worst of all, does not bring about the recovery of the drug addict: it is a bit like drugging up someone who is ill and administering pain killers without ever giving them an operation."
"Mr Blokland and other Members have also mentioned the unsuccessful results of attempts at liberalisation and legalisation in this field: these kinds of approach must be abandoned."
"That is why, therefore, I too have taken the liberty of tabling some amendments, which Mr Bowis is kindly going to illustrate during the vote, presenting them to our rapporteur not as replacing but as supplementing the contents of the report."
"They are amendments which relate, above all, to prevention."
"Amendment No 60 proposes some ideas for freeing addicts from their dependence, striking at the root of the evil."
"Amendment No 61 relates to treatments which are not based on drugs but which include a great deal of psychological help for the ill drug addict."
"Amendment No 62 recommends great caution in providing access to needles, condoms and syringes."
"Amendments Nos 63 and 64 are on the subject of preventive and preparatory measures, first and foremost, for the people responsible for implementing these measures."
"Lastly, the other amendments propose measures to combat drugs in prisons, to encourage data collection on prevention and, once again, to discourage substitution treatment, which not only fails to reduce damage and consumption but increases, boosts, the black market."
"Madam President, I am deeply concerned, Commissioner."
"Listening to our fellow MEP, Mr Davies is extremely depressing."
"More and more young people in Europe are ending up in the type of squalor brought about by drugs."
"The trend is in the wrong direction."
"Mr Davies thinks so too, but more and more EU countries appear to have given up."
"In this Chamber too, voices in favour of legalising and liberalising drugs and classifying them as dangerous and less dangerous are being heard more and more often."
"Here in Parliament, there is a desire to tear up the UN conventions on drugs."
"These are what we have to hold onto, Commissioner."
"I am afraid that European drugs policy is on the decline."
"The overall tenor of Mrs Malliori's report is, unfortunately, along those lines, even though certain parts of it are constructive, for example the demand for drugs-free prisons."
"That being said, it is quite unreasonable to begin talking about the 'upside' of drugs and about chill-out rooms and injecting rooms."
"Drug policy must free addicts from dependence, not sanitise dependence."
"The only way to achieve that goal is through a combination of bans, care, preventive work and international cooperation."
"The objective, which has to remain in place, must be a drugs-free society."
"We Swedish Liberals will vote against the report because it lacks this overall combination."
"Madam President, I would like to use the mere seconds I have been given to speak in to firstly point out to my fellow Members that the government in my own country, Flanders, in Belgium, has, over the past few years and in the most outrageous way, been neglecting the drugs problem and trivialising drug use."
"In my country the use of so-called soft drugs has been de facto legalised, and this has also been advertised to young people in television programmes with ministers in office acting as if they were smoking dope."
"At this moment nobody in my country knows what is actually legally permitted and what is not legally or socially permitted, with all the extremely serious consequences this entails."
"Young people and children in my country currently do not know where they stand."
"What we ought to be sending out today is a signal from a Europe that is engaging in the fight against drugs in a serious and consistent way - by means of prevention, certainly, by supporting addicts and their families, certainly, but also if necessary by means of compulsory detoxification programmes for addicts and by means of the toughest possible penalties for drug dealers."
"I regret the fact that the present recommendations do not contain these two necessary components, and so I am unfortunately not able approve the report."
"Madam President, Mrs Malliori's report is mainly acceptable in itself."
"The main basis of the report is health grounds, but its general tone could be interpreted as permissive with respect to drugs."
"For that reason I would stress that we must tackle the drugs problem strictly and that in the EU we must achieve minimum norms in legislation as well as in the penalties we impose."
"The credibility of our fight against drugs is weakened by the fact that in the Member States the use of those other intoxicants, alcoholic drinks, is viewed permissively or even idealised."
"It does Mrs Malliori's report credit that it should mention that problems with alcohol are on a par with drug problems."
"This is the way we should be going."
"The EU must agree to raise taxes on alcohol, hence reducing consumption and the harm it does."
"Social welfare and healthcare costs will then come down, so allowing us to cut other forms of taxation."
"The Member States must also be able to maintain a protection from imports system that would make possible a national, health-promoting policy on alcohol."
"Madam President, initially we denied that the problem existed."
"Then gradually we moved from denying that the problem existed to playing down its importance; it varied depending on the country and the society concerned."
"I think that this report now presents us with a more holistic approach."
"I find the report positive overall, although it could certainly be improved."
"The analysis is very comprehensive and good."
"If we consider the five different levels - production, transport, marketing, consumption and consequences - we realise that as a society and as a legislator we are going to have to intervene in various different areas and sectors."
"Where production is concerned, I think that we need to intervene much more decisively through development aid, which is a different field, but one that is entirely relevant here."
"Because if we are not in a position to share of our own free will now, then we will certainly have to do so in the future."
"As regards transport, marketing and the criminality associated with them are concerned, I think that this is where more effort needs to be made, and it is essential that this go hand in hand with tightening up the relevant measures on prevention and care."
"Although this is not directly our responsibility, I do believe - indeed I am convinced - that this issue needs to be raised."
"Consumption is generally presented as an individual problem."
"But it is not just an individual problem; it is an issue not only for the individual, the family and their immediate circle, but also for the local community and society at large."
"The consequences, as it states in detail in the analysis contained in the report, are also a public health problem."
"It is then an issue for the whole of society and I believe that this phenomenon - which after being played down is now once again entering a new phase in which a holistic approach is being adopted - can only be tackled through dialogue and with the help and willingness of the entire community - the local community in particular - to provide care."
"I hope that society's attitude gradually changes in this regard and that people become more willing to show greater commitment here, because that is what is required if we are to be successful in combating this scourge."
"."
"Madam President, I very much appreciate Mrs Malliori's report and in particular the many wise remarks in her explanatory statement, which demonstrate a profound knowledge in this field and a positive attitude."
"Let me first make it clear that prevention will always be our priority."
"The scope of the recommendation is, however, focused on risk reduction."
"This is not an alternative, but an important other element in the fight against drugs."
"Most of the suggested amendments strengthen the recommendation."
"I am pleased to say that the Commission agrees with 41 out of the 66 proposed amendments."
"A number of those amendments overlap and redrafting may be necessary for other reasons."
"Those involving financial commitments should be dealt with according to normal procedures."
"I particularly welcome Amendments 12 and 24 suggesting the addition of risk reduction methods related to the use of new synthetic drugs such as ecstasy."
"Strictly speaking, this might be regarded as on the periphery of the scope of this recommendation, as most users of these drugs are not actually addicted."
"But the use of these drugs is on the increase."
"Some users show a compulsive use pattern and they are frequently part of a network where drug use is very common."
"As I have said, many of the suggested amendments can be supported, but time does not allow me to mention all of them."
"There are 25 amendments that I cannot support, not necessarily because I disagree with the thrust of their content, but because they clearly fall outside the scope of this recommendation."
"I have arranged for a list to be handed over to Parliament's secretariat for inclusion in the Minutes of this debate for greater clarity and precision."
"Thank you, Commissioner Byrne."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at midday."
"The next item is a report by Mrs Stihler (A5-0008/2003), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the communication from the Commission on community and national measures in relation to breast implants [COM(2001) 666 - C5-0327/2002 - 2002/2171(COS)]."
", rapporteur."
"Madam President, I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to this debate."
"Throughout this process there has been a lot of consensus and, for a change, most colleagues agree that action needs to be taken."
"That is why I accept all three amendments which have been tabled to this report."
"How did we get to this stage?"
"Over eight years ago a woman called Margot Cameron attended a surgery held by my colleague, Mr Miller."
"She said that nobody would listen to her."
"Her story so inspired my colleague that a petition was lodged with the European Parliament which showed that Margot was not alone."
"There are many Margots in the UK and across the EU with similar stories concerning problems with silicone."
"The petition has led to the Commission reclassifying breast implants as a Class III product under the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC."
"Member States are to adopt and publish laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive no later than 1 August 2003."
"If I am not mistaken, this is the first time that such a petition has led to direct action by the Commission."
"I hope that more and more EU citizens will find solutions to their problems through this route."
"However, much as Parliament welcomes the Commission's actions, we would like to take this matter still further."
"As more women choose to have implants - whether for purely cosmetic reasons, reconstruction after breast cancer or breast deformities - we must ensure that people make informed choices and we must put patient safety first."
"My report aims to answer both the legitimate concerns of thousands of women and the need to put patient safety first."
"Therefore, the report recommends Member States to take measures to increase and improve information for patients through tracking and surveillance, quality control and assurance."
"In this perspective, I particularly want to emphasise three main points."
"Firstly, the need for responsible advertising."
"This includes all forms of direct advertising, such as in magazines and the use of 'before and after' pictures."
"We must clamp down on this misleading advertising that is fuelling demand and which many women pin so much hope on."
"Perhaps 'before and after' photographs of women who have suffered from ruptured implants would tell a very different side of the story to the readers of glossy magazines."
"I would like to see the 18-year age limit applied - apart from where there is medical need - in order to protect young women from making ill-informed beauty choices."
"Secondly, the need for information requires proper labelling and marketing, including health warnings explaining the health risks involved."
"For instance, women should be aware that breast implants will have to be replaced after a time period."
"It is a grave state of affairs that for too long cosmetic cowboys have got away with not explaining these simple facts."
"It is for this reason that we require the creation of an international register of accredited plastic surgeons."
"Finally, there must be responsible research."
"Before breast implants are placed on the market, manufacturers must collect clinical data on the characteristics and performance of their product."
"It also means that breast-implant producers need to trace their products."
"Therefore, the creation of a national breast implant registration to keep women informed in the event of a product fault is vital."
"This issue will not go away."
"I hope that in the future more women will be able to make informed choices and they will not have to suffer in the way that so many women like Margot have in the past."
"I hope that the Commission will be able to report back to Parliament on how far the Member States have gone in implementing this reclassification, and will continue to monitor the issue of silicone-gel breast implants, always putting patient safety first."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Stihler and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for their excellent work."
"The same applies to the members of the Committees on Petitions and Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities who also played a part in the process."
"The report reflects the policy consensus between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"I am pleased to inform Parliament that, last week, the Commission adopted a directive reclassifying breast implants in the context of the legislation on medical devices."
"Breast implants are now subject to the most stringent assessment procedures."
"More precisely, breast implants have been reclassified from class IIB to class III."
"It requires, in addition, clinical data and design attributes, namely on biocompatibility, physical and mechanical properties."
"This will increase the level of safety of breast implants."
"Furthermore, at the request of the Commission and the Member States, CEN, the European Standardisation Body, is proceeding to an in-depth review of the European standards on breast implants."
"The Commission received encouraging information from Member States regarding national measures taken, or further developed, under the recommendations set out in our communication of November 2001."
"This information will be made available to Parliament in a Commission staff working document on national measures adopted or planned to be adopted by Member States in relation to breast implants."
"This paper will be finalised in the coming weeks."
"The Commission believes that its communication and the production of the forthcoming working document have produced a significant effect."
"All Member States have acted by verifying existing national policies and by starting to introduce measures as recommended by the communication."
"Both documents will continue to be a useful element that interest groups and national authorities may use, at national level, to promote best practice and inspire further actions."
"The excellent cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on this subject should be highlighted, since the overall result has been extremely positive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thousands of women have petitioned Parliament to take a stand on the dangers inherent in the use of silicone breast implants."
"Breast implants are subject to the standard quality and safety requirements for medical devices, being covered - as you also mentioned, Commissioner - by Directive 93/42/EEC."
"It was lobbying from self-help groups of women suffering adverse effects from silicon-gel breast implants that prompted the Commission Communication."
"Silicon implants were used for years before there was regulation or surveillance of their use."
"The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who unfortunately is unable to be here today, refers in particular to the need for open and transparent information about silicon implants."
"Public health and healthcare issues are for the most part the competence of the Member States."
"Together with Mrs Stihler, we now call on all of the Member States to introduce a national register including information about how medical aftercare is provided and how it is taken up."
"Personal privacy must be protected."
"Access to the registers will therefore have to be restricted and their contents treated as confidential."
"Best practice will have to be publicised and then applied Europe-wide."
"We need research and further development work to be carried out on safety and implant toleration."
"Here the introduction of a passport for implant recipients and compulsory aftercare examinations might also be helpful for gathering data."
"Accurate information must not be given in the form of advertising."
"Advertising will increase demand for implants."
"What is needed, however, is balanced information."
"Doctors and nurses - both male and female - have a particular responsibility here to provide patients with objective, complete and scientifically up-to-date information in writing about all the details of their implants, such as the identification number, volume and type."
"I should like to thank Mrs Stihler for her balanced report."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in my view, breast implants are also an integral part of health."
"They are needed to reconstruct breasts."
"Aesthetic reasons do often play a role, but if someone thinks that they are inferior then it is their general health that suffers."
"With the help of implants their sense of well-being can be restored."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was in 1998 that the Committee on Petitions received two petitions with a total of over 1 000 signatures, which, as Mrs Stihler has said, were those of women concerned about this issue or who had themselves suffered, and who asked Europe to consider the problems presented by breast implants, especially those made of silicon."
"The Committee on Petitions, with its ear open to the public, reacted at that time by asking STOA to carry out an independent and intensive study of implants."
"Following this, it organised a hearing that attracted wide media coverage, and, as rapporteur, I was entrusted with the task of drafting a resolution, which Parliament adopted unanimously on 13 June 2001."
"It will therefore be evident that our vote today on a communication dealing with Community and national provisions on breast implants is a matter of twofold satisfaction to me; firstly, because it gives recognition to the action taken by the Committee on Petitions, which was the true initiator of this communication, and then because Mrs Stihler's excellent work takes up and gives added weight to almost all the proposals made in the June 2001 resolution, especially as regards advertising, the information required to be given to patients, the guarantee of the implants' high quality, research, the responsibilities placed not only on manufacturers, but also on surgeons and clinics, as well as the invitation extended to the Member States to maintain national registers and to make provision for a consent form."
"My only regret is that the idea of issuing a passport to the patients was not retained in the initial report, and it is for that reason that I will be supporting Amendment No 3 to paragraph 10 (ii), resubmitted on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which aims to reintroduce such a passport."
"Although some may object that this is just one more piece of paper, I consider it an effective way to replenish the future European database."
"Moreover, such a system would, above all, allow the patient to have real knowledge of the implant's specific characteristics."
"Let me conclude by saying that I rejoice to be able to vote on this resolution, which itself demonstrates how well the Commission and our Parliamentary committees can work together to meet the expectations of Europe's citizens."
"It demonstrates that the Committee on Petitions, which the public tends to use as a means of bringing to light the Community system's failings, can also play its part in developing creative and positive Community initiatives."
"It is also a way in which we can show the petitioners that we do indeed honour our commitments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, very much for her excellent report and for the remarkably good cooperation, also on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who cannot be here today for an important reason, namely an investiture ceremony in the Netherlands."
"She sends her apologies."
"Breast implants are covered by the directive on medical devices."
"I am very pleased that the Commission - as Commissioner Byrne also explained earlier - has recently announced that it is reclassifying breast implants and is pressing for higher levels of safety for patients."
"Broadly speaking, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats can support the Commission Communication and the report tabled by Mrs Stihler."
"We have to face up to the following fact in Europe: every year 160 000 women in the European Union suffer from breast cancer."
"It affects one in eight women."
"In Germany alone, that means over 50 000 women every year."
"Parliament is acutely aware of how topical and sensitive this issue is."
"In the post-operative care of breast cancer patients, breast implants are often a decisive factor in increasing their quality of life."
"Where breast abnormalities and surgical beauty treatments are concerned, the options available must also be explained and safety guaranteed."
"We are therefore calling for a number of decisive measures to be taken, above and beyond the Commission's proposals."
"It is essential for a minimum age to be set for cosmetic breast operations."
"These should not be carried out on young women under the age of 18."
"Operations for medical reasons would be exempt."
"In addition, advertising for such implants that is directed at the general public should be banned along the lines of the French model."
"It would then only be permitted to publish objective information in a non-commercial context."
"It must be guaranteed that advice and information will be provided prior to the operation by a doctor specialising in plastic surgery."
"We think it is vital for this meeting to take place at least four to six weeks before an appointment is agreed for the operation, so as to give the women concerned a cooling-off period to reflect on the objective and reliable information that they have received."
"As in other areas, more emphasis needs to be given to providing patients with information."
"Before the operation date is agreed, the women concerned should therefore also be given an information sheet."
"It is important for this to be based on the content already developed by EQUAM."
"It should contain both a warning about the potential health risks and also a clear appeal only to agree an operation date once all remaining questions are fully resolved."
"This is also the point made in the amendment that I have tabled to paragraph 9 of the report."
"Where silicon implants are concerned, we need high standards of safety and quality at international level."
"For this reason, we need cross-border registration of breast implants to be made compulsory at international level."
"In this context, the EU Member States should be advised to become members of the international breast implant register."
"The scientific research carried out over the last few years has yielded some decisive findings in this field."
"We therefore also think it is important to support this research and guarantee that the scientific work continues across Europe."
"Overall the Commission Communication, together with the amendments proposed by Parliament, constitutes an important step in the right direction."
"It is not a question of making it more difficult to use breast implants, for either medical or cosmetic reasons."
"The aim of this initiative is to guarantee the highest levels of product safety, ensure that comprehensive information is provided and ultimately to increase the quality of life of the women concerned."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to thank Mrs Stihler very much for her excellent and, above all, important report."
"Time and again, women complain about the damage suffered to their health following the use of breast implants or about operations that have had undesirable cosmetic results."
"Incidentally, 80% of breast implant operations are carried out for purely cosmetic reasons."
"The constant physical and emotional suffering caused by the implant operations is often immense."
"As a rule this ought to be avoidable, as the cause is not the implants per se."
"This has been confirmed in studies, and particularly impressively by the STOA study from the year 2000."
"The causes are more usually the implants not being fitted by specialists, the device not being replaced automatically after a few years and the continuing lack of regular medical aftercare, not to mention the fact that women are still not fully informed about the potential risks, which vary from case to case, before the operation."
"That is why there is an urgent need to impress on the Member States that they must finally ensure that women are fully informed before an operation of this kind and, above all, that they must stop a plethora of insufficiently qualified beauty surgeons from working by introducing additional qualification requirements and subjecting their clinics to more stringent inspections."
"If we want to optimise quality assurance then this is the second step, now that we have already taken the first step, together with the Commission, of putting in place stricter product safety standards."
"I am thinking of the recent decision to reclassify breast implants as class 3 medical devices."
"My group is also calling for an implant passport to be introduced, which would give information both about the characteristics of the implant and about the necessary post-operative care and would identify the surgeon."
"The passport should be signed by the doctor and the patient before the operation as a clear declaration of consent."
"In the light of the many complications that can arise after breast implant operations - which were brought to our attention not least by the petitions sent in by thousands of women in 1998 - I think it is quite frankly scandalous and completely incomprehensible that so far only one Member State has introduced a national implant register."
"It will come as no surprise either then to learn that at the moment we do not have either precise figures on the implant operations carried out or complete scientific findings based on the adverse effects suffered by the women."
"That is why it is of the utmost urgency to start setting up a national register for breast implants in all of the Member States immediately, and to join the international breast implant register."
"In my view, this whole sorry tale also illustrates yet again why we urgently need multidisciplinary breast centres, in which benign and malignant diseases can be treated and beauty operations carried out under one roof, and where quality is guaranteed."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, every year, tens of thousands of women undergo surgery for the insertion of at least one breast implant."
"In Belgium alone over the past ten years, over 4 000 prosthetic implants were inserted, with, in 1999, 313 women needing hospital in-patient treatment because of complications."
"So there are at least three reasons to justify this action being taken at Community level: improving information for patients in certain cases; shedding the maximum possible light on the potential secondary effects of having a breast implant, in particular by means of research; and, of course, taking into account the petitions presented by citizens' groups, giving consideration to whether or not their request that silicon implants of this sort be subject to an immediate ban is well founded."
"These three aspirations are set out clearly by Mrs Stihler, whom also I wish to congratulate, in her report, the broad outlines of which the Liberal Group endorses."
"I am thinking especially of the prohibition of advertising aimed directly at the public, and of the authorisation of prosthetic implants for young women under the age of 18, strictly and solely for medical reasons."
"The Liberal Group does not, however, support all the measures advocated by this report, specifically mandatory entry in national registers, or Amendment No 3, which proposes the introduction of a passport for wearers of implants, which strike us as being like so many ideas which appear to be good but turn out to be misguided."
"Over and above that, primarily, where the cost and feasibility of such interventions is concerned, should we be contemplating the imposition of requirements that go well beyond those in place for other equally invasive and extensive surgery?"
"I am thinking, for example, of heart surgery, the requirements imposed on which by the Commission are sufficiently restrictive."
"In conclusion, Mr President, what women expect is clear answers to issues that frequently cause them anguish or even traumatise them, when raised in the event of an illness."
"It is self-evident that what we owe them is the truth, and the truth is not about imposing a ban that risks simply sending these women across our European borders."
"The Liberals therefore give their active support to Amendment No 2 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists."
"The truth is that women tempted to undergo this sort of operation which - as has been said - is becoming increasingly common, need to be informed and protected, and that is what we have tried to do."
"Mr President, as Mrs Fourtou said very clearly, this resolution stems from the Committee on Petitions and is motivated by the petitions of thousands of women who attended a hearing in the course of one morning at which they expressed their concern and anxiety about the consequences that certain implants had had in terms of their health."
"This gave rise to the STOA report, according to which there was apparently no evidence of a relationship between silicone implants and, for example, cancer."
"There was, however, a clear indication of the various kinds of inconvenience caused to women who wanted, or felt obliged, to undergo implant operations."
"I believe that Mrs Stihler's proposal acknowledges the suggestions, with which we too agree, that were put forward both in the study made of the STOA report, as well as elsewhere, and that, in general, ask for special measures to be adopted as a matter of urgency, one of the most important being an improvement in the independent information provided to women who wish to undergo implants."
"It is also proposed that the information not come from the private clinics that are to carry out the implants; that the information be exhaustive; that there be a period of reflection so that the women concerned might consider the pros and cons of having the implants carried out; that prior consent be given; that there be follow-up and monitoring where the implants are concerned, as well as a basic investigation into the latter; and, above all, that the Member States subject all the clinics, especially the private ones, to rigorous controls."
"In my own country, there was a case, which gave rise to a national debate, of a hairdresser's in the Canary Islands that had given implants to a large number of women without providing any medical guarantee."
"The problem became public knowledge because one of the women who had been given implants had to have both her breasts removed."
"I believe that this is an extreme case, and something which obviously does not usually happen, but it is vital that the Member States exercise rigorous control over all clinics and over all products that serve as implants, so improving the situation of those women who, for one reason or another, feel obliged to undergo implant operations."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on an excellent report."
"One of the key issues is the ban on the direct advertising of breast implants to the public."
"The provision of non-commercial information through national public health services is the way forward."
"France has already introduced a ban."
"All Member States should do the same in relation to breast implants because they always involve certain risks."
"The promotion of cosmetic surgery in general is a major problem."
"Action should be taken to prevent situations whereby women and indeed men are coerced into unnecessary surgery which may involve particular risks."
"It is true that there are, in many cases, health and psychological reasons for breast implants, but we need to be careful in that regard."
"I agree with the rapporteur concerning the age limit."
"Implants in women under the age of 18 should be authorised only on medical grounds."
"Anyone under 18 years of age is extremely vulnerable and could be coerced into something they may regret in later years."
"Advertising for cosmetic surgery should carry clear health warnings."
"We need to focus more on promoting and securing acceptance of women as they are, rather than allowing the advertising industry to impose some sort of idea of beauty as the norm."
"This applies not only to women but also to men."
"If you look in the back of women's magazines you can see a huge number of adverts encouraging women to put extra things into some parts of their bodies, and to remove parts elsewhere."
"The advertising industry has a huge amount to answer for."
"There are cases where it is necessary on health grounds, but it also needs to be - as the rapporteur has said - very well tracked, and information must be made available to patients."
"In terms of implants for purely cosmetic reasons, we need to look at what the advertising industry is doing in relation to coercing people into something that they may regret in later years."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report."
"As an oncological surgeon and university research scientist, I read the report very carefully and support many of the proposals it contains."
"I feel, however, that the tone is excessively alarmist and I will tell you why."
"For 50 years or so, silicones have been widely used in products for large-scale consumption such as drinks, puddings, cakes, drugs, paediatric materials, pacemakers, cardiac valves, lipsticks, creams and fabrics - and it has been proved that none of these cause cancer in humans."
"For 40 years, silicone breast implants have been used throughout the world for both aesthetic reasons, as in the case of serious psychological problems, and for reconstruction, as in the case of mastectomies carried out to remove breast cancer where there are no age restrictions."
"In 1986, the University of Los Angeles examined 3000 women who had had implants for at least six years and found no risk of increasing neoplasia or to mobility."
"In 1992, the University of Calgary, examining 11 000 women, reached the same conclusions."
"The American Association of Rheumatologists also promoted two studies on the risk of autoimmune pathology in women with silicone implants, which recorded good tolerance in all cases."
"It was discovered that the average life of implants is between 15 and 25 years and spontaneous rupture is often asymptomatic."
"There are therefore no sufficiently serious grounds for preventing the use of implants, except in young women less than 18 years old."
"I must point out that the report makes no reference to breast implants inserted as preventive treatment in cases where the results of predictive genetic tests have shown a high risk of carcinogenesis in patients, tests carried out particularly on the children of mothers who have suffered from cancer, which is a practice which will become increasingly widespread."
"As regards paragraph 10a, I would like to point out that patient consent forms are already in use in all the States of the Union. It is compulsory for the patient to sign a form after receiving all the necessary information, before any treatment is applied, including implants."
"I therefore feel it superfluous to mention a passport."
"I also feel it would be useful to set up European and national registers containing data collected on both aesthetic and therapeutic breast implants."
"Furthermore, it is important for an annual check to be carried out by a breast specialist and a free echography performed, without the need for invasive examinations such as mammographies or CAT scans , which still subject patients to radiation and are practices which are on the expensive side for national health services."
"The collection of data on implants and regulated follow-up would contribute to the production of a valid survey allowing a more precise assessment to be carried out, which would certainly be reassuring for all women."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with a few exceptions, including the last speaker - perhaps the fact that he is a man has something to do with it - there is significant consensus among the political groups on this subject."
"It is for good reason that it is mainly women who are speaking here."
"I do not think that this has anything to do with personal experience but rather with the fact that we do, after all, feel a close bond with the thousands of women who submitted the petition to Parliament."
"It was not that we woke up one morning and said: we must regulate this."
"The question came from grass roots level and on this basis we have already spent a long time working on creating a good Community framework."
"I would also like to thank Mrs Stihler very much for her excellent report, and also the Commissioner who I hope will soon present the report from the Member States, as he promised a moment ago."
"I hope that he will also work hard on following up what we recommend today."
"Without wanting to repeat what has already been said, I would just briefly like to ask what is particularly important, and what our starting points are."
"Our main aim is to see patients protected."
"We do not want to patronise them; we want to protect them."
"That is crucial."
"We do not want a ban; a woman must be able to decide for herself in good faith whether she wants breast implants or not."
"What we do want is to ensure that she is properly informed and that she knows what the disadvantages and potential dangers of a breast implant are."
"We want to guarantee that."
"That is why we have such a problem with advertising."
"This is not the same as selling a coffee machine; this is about a medical intervention."
"We do not want women to be persuaded to change their breasts on the basis of misleading advertising."
"Why is compulsory registration so important?"
"In Europe we know too little about breast implants, we know too little about the dangers, we know too little about where these women are and what the consequences are."
"That is why proper registration is essential."
"Finally, protecting the patient."
"Yes, protecting young people, yes, making sure that they are given time to think things over."
"Mr President, people who have to do without a part of their body as a result of an accident or an operation are generally happy that these days there are ways of restoring their lost functions."
"In cases in which they cannot be restored, they at least want to make sure that the external damage caused is made as invisible as possible."
"This naturally also applies to women who have had an operation as a result of breast cancer."
"They thought it was a good solution to replace the lost part of their bodies with an artificial substitute that has the same suppleness as the original living material."
"These days there are disappointed women who find that they have been poisoned after such treatment."
"These are the people who are warning against this happening again and are pleading for a ban."
"The new material generally lasts only a few years; after that the silicone may leak or escape into the body."
"Those affected by this may have been beautiful for a short time but are ill for a long time afterwards."
"A positive point in the rapporteur's proposal is to prohibit advertising for this solution and to improve advice on the negative consequences and on alternatives."
"It may be possible to live with silicone breasts if they are periodically replaced with new material."
"This approach takes better account of women who are in danger of psychological problems following an operation than does an outright ban, and prevents these treatments from being performed illegally without proper information."
"A possible advantage is still the fact that gullible women who are not able to check out the dangers and who retain old replacement material in their bodies because they cannot afford or are afraid of repeated operations will continue to get into difficulties in the future."
"I agree with Mrs McKenna that if it is not possible to severely restrict these practices, a ban may soon be unavoidable."
"Mr President, I also wish to thank the Commission for this proposal and to congratulate Mrs Stihler on an excellent report on a very important subject."
"It is an area that touches upon many aspects of health and consumer policy."
"Thousands of women who have had problems have contacted the European Parliament and want us to express an opinion on the dangers associated with silicone breast implants."
"This shows that those who carry out these operations are not always reliable and that there is an extreme lack of information."
"The image, often presented in advertisements, of how young women should look - all slim waists and large breasts - means that there is a considerable increase in the number of breast implants carried out on very young women."
"The weekly magazines fuel this trend by showing 'before and after' pictures."
"It is therefore high time that, as responsible politicians, we protected patients by beginning to bring some order to this very confused area."
"I completely agree with Mrs Stihler that this is only a step in that direction."
"I believe that many more binding commitments are required on the part of those who carry out these implants."
"What I think is the most important part of the proposal is the '18 years' old' limit whereby non-medical implants are to be prohibited in the case of girls under 18 years of age."
"The proposal that surgeons and clinics must issue guarantees is also important."
"Unlike my colleagues, I think that registration at both national and EU levels is justified."
"When there is insufficient research, a register is needed."
"I am very satisfied with the report."
"We, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, fully support the report and the amendments tabled."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and all colleagues who have worked on this report for keeping this issue in the spotlight."
"The rapporteur told you a story about a woman called Margot Cameron who came to see me eight years ago."
"She wandered in, nobody would listen to her, and we sat down and looked at the problem she had and started campaigning."
"It is a success story, because here we are today looking at legislation that we are putting through this Parliament, which is great."
"I would like to tell you another story, which does not have such a happy ending."
"As I have said, this all happened eight years ago when Margot Cameron came to see me."
"We started campaigning and raised the issue at national level and finally took it to European level."
"By that time we had contacted groups throughout Europe and brought the issue to the Petitions Committee in 1998, though looking around this room and I do not see anybody who was at that Committee."
"I remember going to that Committee and arguing, along with the women, for that petition."
"However, I also remember the Commission saying: 'sorry guv, nothing to do with us - it is a Member State issue'."
"That delay set us back years."
"It was 2001 before we got any satisfaction out of the Commission."
"In that period 28 000 further operations were carried out in the UK alone."
"It is estimated that 20 000 of those implants have either leaked or ruptured during that period."
"What happened as a result of that delay?"
"We let down not only the women who had signed that petition, but also a lot of women who had gone down the road of getting implants."
"This shows that we have to address these issues and problems more speedily when they arise and not let women suffer in the way they have in the past."
"Many Member States have banned trilucent implants and have banned saline implants."
"We have got to look in the future at a ban on silicone implants."
"Why?"
"Because they affect people's health."
"If it were men getting the implants, there would be a ban tomorrow, but that is not happening because men are not getting them."
"I would like to make one final point."
"This report is entitled 'breast implants', but it is also possible to get silicone implants for other parts of the body, and they cause the same damage."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have come here to voice my solidarity with the people who for years have been making efforts to finally get this problem onto the political agenda."
"The fact that prostheses are available for the many women who have had to undergo mastectomies is naturally an advantage, and we must not forget that this represents important progress in itself."
"It is, however, a real disgrace the way people are brazenly abusing the naiveté of many women these days by convincing them that they will have heaven on earth if they have breast implants fitted in order to improve their aesthetic appearance."
"For whom actually?"
"And what for?"
"I think it is a real scandal that people like my colleague Mrs Van Brempt have had to take reproaches from those who are earning big money from this."
"I am therefore happy to endorse the congratulations to Mrs Stihler, the congratulations to the people who started this petition campaign at the time and the congratulations to the people who want to take this matter in hand - namely to impose a ban on advertising and to ensure that young people in particular are not caught in the trap of this misleading advertising, to ensure that products are of course reliable and that medical aftercare is organised efficiently at Member State level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are, then, well and truly members of a society with wall-to-wall media coverage, one that is inclined to favour certain aesthetic notions that tempt not only many women but also many men to change their appearance."
"A number take the plunge and have recourse to cosmetic surgery."
"For others, such surgery takes on a reconstructive role and helps them heal their wounds and rebuild their bodies. In the former case, however, it is material external to themselves that their bodies are having to incorporate."
"In every case, it is essential that prostheses in the form of breast implants be subject to investigation and regulation and that all surgery be accompanied by safety information and be followed up, over the very long term in the case of women patients."
"In the light of all this, we can but agree with Mrs Stihler's report and approve the changes proposed with a view to better informing and protecting not only female, but also male, patients."
"I would note, for my part, a number of areas on which our activity must be focused."
"Although silicone implants are highly disparaged and have been subject to many studies, silicone is not the only component of the prostheses."
"I therefore think it essential to pursue research and clinical studies in this area, especially where women are concerned, by focusing the research on the long-term risks and on the other components."
"Moreover, I think it important that our nations and their health services be able to work as part of a network and to share information and good practice in this area so that all women patients in Europe might benefit from the same information and the same guarantees and so that impetus might be given to research."
"Since we are concerned here with the provision of information and follow-up, it is essential that all patients possess all the data concerning their implants and the surgery that they are to undergo."
"It is also important that they be warned of the risks, the costs, the advantages and the disadvantages connected with the insertion and wearing of breast implants."
"I should think it worthwhile if, for once, Europe were to take its cue from Thailand and perfect measures designed to protect consumers against this advertising and fashion phenomenon and, in particular, to ban very young women from receiving implants."
"It is more and more important for all sections of the public to be given clear, scientific and comprehensible information if they are not to be the victims of false advertising and misleading images."
"For the well-being of patients and the medical follow-up they require, I would therefore defend the idea of setting up national and European registers and of centralising data and other information in this field."
"In compliance with the law on the protection of personal data, such information should of course only be used for the purposes of studies and research in the field of health, particularly women's health."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Ms Stihler for drawing up this report and indeed the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I first came into contact with this as a political issue in the Committee on Petitions when the long and hard work done by Mr Miller came before us."
"We finally got some movement from the Commission on the matter."
"I therefore welcome the announcement today by the Commissioner that implants have been reclassified as medical devices, and the effects that will have on how they may be controlled."
"Breast implant advertising specifically - indeed implant advertising of any kind - should be regulated."
"It is not acceptable that these implants should be advertised as simple and straightforward, with no indication that there are medical risks involved."
"There is a particular need to ensure that people under 18 years of age may only have implants as a medical necessity, and their guardians should also be fully informed of the implications of such operations."
"There is a particular need to follow up on research in relation to the effect of breast implants and, as has been pointed out by Mr Miller, implants in other parts of the body."
"There are question marks relating to silicon implants which have not been answered by studies to date, and I would urge further research on that."
"Finally, could I gently take issue with Mrs Van Brempt, who has done a lot of work in this area, and point out to her that my gender certainly did not pre-programme my views on this issue."
"I do not think it is necessary to draw attention to the gender of Members who speak on issues in this Parliament."
"Mr President, I am intervening to ask the House's services to arrange for an error that has occurred to be rectified and for the term 'woodland ecosystems', used in one of the approved amendments, to be replaced by the term 'woodland'."
"I would ask for this change to be made, noted and taken into account."
"I would also request, above all of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - who are not at present listening - that attention be paid to Amendment No 41, which has been corrected."
"We must vote against this amendment, or else our own amendment will fail."
"Mr President, I fail to understand how the voting list was put together, but what has happened is that the second part of Amendment No 49 was exactly the same as the second part of Amendment No 15."
"I do not understand why the majority has rejected the second part of Amendment No 49, but this is in fact what they have done."
"Consequently, having rejected the second part of Amendment No 49, I fail to see how we can now adopt the second part of Amendment No 15, which is exactly the same."
". (FR) Single market though there may have been since 1986, no actual common market has been achieved."
"Enlargement to include ten new countries will take us further away from that objective, and the 2013 deadline will be put back again."
"The difficulty is not so much that of managing to adopt a directive supported by everyone or by the majority, but that of producing a comprehensible document that can be put into practice."
"Given the number and significance of the details, there are ever more conflicts of interpretation and procedures to deal with violations."
"The strategy must be to reduce such conflicts, not to resolve them by legal force."
"Confronted by the economic and social realities, all that matters is the will and the capacity to apply the wordings."
"Rather than parade new ambitions, the Commission should have been pulled up for its ill will and bad faith when it comes to assessing the impact of the liberalisation of public services."
"With the standardisation of health services as its objective, the report explains that a safeguard clause might undermine uniformity."
"That is nothing if not proof of the dangers to which existing forms of cohesion are vulnerable and of the hostility that exists in principle to taking any account of diversity."
"We are, in practice, opposed to this report."
". (PT) The rapporteur stands firmly behind the philosophy underlying the Commission Communication to speed up the processes of liberalisation now underway and closely follows the proposals of the summary report for the Spring Council, which seeks to speed up the 'Lisbon strategy'."
"This is an attempt to maximise the potential benefits of the internal market, overlooking the high levels of poverty, exclusion and inequality in the EU, the lack of quality in the jobs that are created, most of which are precarious, and the promises given in Mr Delors' famous White Paper, which predicted the creation of 15 million jobs; a target that has now been postponed to 2010."
"The rapporteur also overlooks the opportunities for economic growth that have been wasted by implementing restrictive monetary and budgetary policies, with relatively low levels of global investment and real wage increases."
"These factors have undermined internal demand and increase risks of deflation in the Eurozone, particularly in Germany."
"The most serious aspect is that, given all these problems, instead of rethinking current policies, the rapporteur advocates speeding up the policies of liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation currently in place and even proposes that the Member States should sign a formal declaration in the aim of speeding up the completion of the internal market ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I congratulate Mr Harbour on the excellent report he has drafted on the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: 2002 Review of the Internal Market Strategy."
"Delivering the promise, which I fully support, in particular with regard to the need to establish measures and initiatives that encourage the full completion of an internal market for services, particularly measures intended to improve the transposal of measures for the internal market and to eliminate overly complex transposals."
"In this context, I wish to highlight the importance of cooperation between Parliament and the Commission in organising a second Internal Market Forum that will enable citizens and industry, especially SMEs, to express their concerns and to study solutions to the completion of this internal market and to define this issue as a main priority of the 2003 Economic Summit."
"I abstained from voting on this report on the Commission report on the Internal Market Strategy."
"A fully operational internal market for goods and services is an integral part of the Lisbon objectives for economic reform."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur when he states that a fully operational internal market for services will increase consumers' options and will enable them to benefit from services provided in other Member States."
"I disagree, however, with the pressure the rapporteur puts on Member States to limit to the very minimum the use of safeguard clauses, and even urging the Commission to provide for the establishment of adequate guarantees that it will draw up safeguard clauses and oversee them."
"Furthermore, the rapporteur even claims that the use of safeguard clauses by Member States is likely to damage the uniformity of Community legislation."
"Member States' sovereignty must be respected when considering the need to establish or improve safeguard mechanisms in certain areas of their economies."
"Otherwise, things will be totally regulated by the Community, which would damage the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
". (FR) We are opposed to the Forest Focus regulation, as we are to the Redondo report, and for the following reasons."
"First of all, there is the absence of agreement between those active in this field - foresters, paper-makers etc - who have unanimously rejected the European Commission's proposal."
"Secondly, the change of legal basis causes us concern."
"Forests will no longer come under the heading of agriculture but will become a new component of environmental policy."
"Are we heading towards a CEP - Common Environmental Policy - in order better to destroy the CAP?"
"The definition of 'forest' at Community level is unrealistic, being too restrictive in terms of surface area when it talks about 'tree crown cover ? of more than 10 per cent and area of more than 0.5 ha'."
"Practically every grove of trees would fall within the scope of the regulation."
"Given the diversity of terrain and of geographical and climatic conditions in the EU, there is, moreover, no reason for incorporating forests into the EU's common policies."
"The Commission wants to turn the Forest Focus programme into a regulation complementing the 'Birds' and 'Habitats' directives, something we find unacceptable given the difficulties in applying and funding these two directives."
"Finally, the Commission forgets the primary function of forests in rural areas: that of economic development."
". (PT) While I consider the motion for a resolution to be very positive, there is an issue which I believe should have been dealt with in more depth - the role of forests as carbon sinks."
"The United Nations Conventions on Climate Change consider that one of the policies which should be implemented with a view to mitigating climate change is the promotion of forests as fixers of carbon, through forestation and reforestation activities."
"The Kyoto Protocol lays down the maximum quantity of carbon sinks which may be used by States with a view to compliance with their objectives for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions."
"However, owing to the fragility of the scientific basis for the role of forests as carbon sinks, the European Union was never enthusiastic about considering this measure in the Kyoto Protocol and it was eventually accepted as a concession which was essential for reaching an agreement, particularly with Japan and Russia."
"Now that this issue has been decided upon, especially following the Marrakech Conference, the EU should take advantage of Forest Focus to develop a European strategy for the use of carbon sinks."
"I voted in favour of this report because of its enormous importance, within the framework of sustainable development, for the adoption of better measures with which to combat the factors contributing to the deterioration of forests in the European Union."
"This is of considerable importance to Portugal which, having the highest density of forest in Europe, is every year the victim of the scourge of forest fires."
"It is extremely disturbing that 1% of Mediterranean forest is lost every year as a result of fires."
"Establishing new activities to monitor the biodiversity of forests, soil, climate change and the setting of carbon in forests is an essential prerequisite for guaranteeing the conservation of our environmental heritage, which Europe must jealously protect."
"Forests are the most complex form of ecosystem and, although large tracts of forest still exist and they enjoy a high level of biodiversity, they have limits, that we have to watch carefully."
"Sustainable use of forests is crucial, as we are told by a specialist in these matters Masahiro Saito, in favourable conditions, only after twenty years does a forest producing wood and charcoal regain its original volume, and allowing it to be used again."
"We must adopt fire prevention action, bearing in mind especially that these must be in ..."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Mr President, I support the crucial regulation, and actions to support mothers or future mothers in developing countries, advising on reproductive health, especially through educational and information campaigns."
"I want to see the fight taken to poverty and the prevention of appalling human and social situations."
"Nevertheless, I deplore the fact that the majority should have prevented a consensus from being achieved and rejected special provisions for mothers in difficulty."
"I regret the fact that there was an insistence on not clarifying the language used and that confusion could allow international sponsorship of abortion policies with European Union funds."
"The speeches given in plenary yesterday by supporters of the report and by opponents of my amendments speak for themselves."
"As a supplement to what I have already said, I shall quote a representative of Marie Stopes International, which I did not have time to read out fully yesterday."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"In the context of aid to the poorest countries, the US cannot impose a development model by implementing measures related to sexual and reproductive health rights."
"I am referring specifically to sterilisation and abortion."
"Under the guise of altruism in granting aid, the EU cannot promote and even less encourage these practices, for two fundamental reasons: the first is respect for human rights - and in particular to protect the right to life - and the second is due to the limits imposed by the sovereignty of the States and populations who will benefit from our financial aid."
"The content of this report is ambivalent and could lead to abuses as a result of its implicit promotion of abortion."
"Any options or measures decided on in this field, in the context of health, can only be determined by States in accordance with their national laws."
"We can only vote in favour of a report that safeguards the incontrovertible principle of the right to life and of respect for the sovereignty of States."
"We have no misgivings about the report's assertion that abortion cannot under any circumstances be considered to be a method of family planning, and much less a service in the field of sexual and reproductive health."
". (FR) This resolution proposes to create a new budget to be used for combating mortality during pregnancy and childbirth in the poor countries of the world."
"We have supported this initiative in spite of its limitations."
"Indeed, this new budget item is not accompanied by new funding."
"The necessary money would be taken from the existing budget."
"We, for our part, ask that this aid be funded from the budget for aid paid to companies because, whatever the pretexts invoked for paying this, it is used not to preserve jobs, which continue to be destroyed on a huge scale throughout Europe, but, in reality, to put yet a little more money in the pockets of shareholders."
". (FR) I have voted in favour of this report even though, on certain points, my assessment, and even my approach, were in some ways different."
"The European Parliament has, in fact, succeeded in resisting the reactionary pressure exercised by the fundamentalist Right."
"- (FR) It is hard to understand what has turned the Sandbæk report into such a bone of contention, for the need to improve health services and infrastructure in the countries concerned could easily have been the subject of genuine consensus."
"It is just that there is terrible doubt hanging over the rapporteur's and the Commission's true intentions concerning recourse to abortion, a measure which would therefore be funded by the European taxpayer."
"Once such a measure is provided for, it becomes legitimate, whereas stances on this subject are very diverse and, above all, irreconcilable."
"To institute at Community level a policy rejected by a number of our Member States, or in other words to impose at European level choices about which our respective populations have reservations, or to which they are even hostile, is unworthy of a democratic assembly."
"As for the self-styled compromise that has emerged from the relevant parliamentary committee, one might have expected better than a suspect accumulation of evasions that has conscientiously set aside all attempts to bend the wording in the direction of human dignity, namely compatibility between women's health and children's lives."
"With only the caricature of a choice before us - either we vote for or against - we choose to embrace what amounts to a simple precautionary principle by voting against this report."
"- (FR) The Community policy of cooperation and development is designed to promote lasting development and economic expansion in the developing countries, as well as the latter's integration into the world economy and the fight against poverty."
"If the obvious correlation is borne in mind between poverty and the absence of rights where reproduction and sexuality are concerned, achieving such an objective necessarily entails putting in place a Community tool designed to further policies and actions relating to health and to rights in connection with reproduction and sexuality."
"It is in fact very clear to me that one of the results of development is a lasting improvement in the health and well-being of populations."
"It is therefore a matter of urgency to provide support to the women of these countries, which account for 99% of the 600 000 women who die each year as a consequence of pregnancy, and, through modern family planning, to provide help and information to couples, so enabling them to decide freely and responsibly how many children they want."
"Each year, a third of pregnancies are in fact unwanted or unplanned."
"This situation leads women to have recourse to abortions carried out in dangerous conditions, and it causes as many as 78 000 deaths each year."
". (FR) It is a good thing that the European Union should help the developing countries take care of their populations' health."
"Aid does not, however, mean imposing our European models on countries with different cultures and traditions."
"It is morally unacceptable to make our aid conditional upon denying nations' identity and upon their having to adopt our conception of family planning."
"Moreover, setting abortion up as a new method of contraception is out of the question."
"That, however, is what this report is leading up to, even if Mrs Sandbaek says it is not."
"Abortion is a crime that kills the child and destroys the mother."
"By offering women abortion as their only option, rather than helping them, a further trauma is added to their difficulties."
"That is why I am in favour of the amendments aimed at developing a policy for receiving and supporting mothers to be who are in distress, with a view to supporting them in choosing to have their babies."
"That is how it will be possible to provide them with the psychological and material aid that they need."
"That is also why I shall vote against this report which, far from helping populations in difficulty, will succeed only in adding to their feelings of helplessness."
". The vote on the Sandbaek report today was a clear endorsement of the need for an urgent response at first reading from the European Parliament to the Regulation on Reproductive and Sexual Health and Rights in Developing Countries."
"By supporting this Resolution, we have cleared the way for the Commission to fund operations and agencies which focus on the need to reduce infant, child and maternal mortality."
"We have acknowledged the right which all people have to care and services, and to choose how many children to have and when to have them."
"We have voted to renew and increase funding to EUR 74.95m."
"The Commissioner emphasised he could not formally commit the Commission to that figure, but made it clear that this should not deter us from having an agreement at first reading, saying he was confident we would find a solution."
"We rejected new amendments designed to distort the focus and substance of the Regulation."
"The Development Committee and Parliament have agreed a text which does no more and no less than was agreed in the Programme for Action of the International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo in 1994 and the Kay Actions adopted in 1999."
". (FR) My colleague's, Mrs Sandbaek's, report has given rise to much debate and triggered some passionate feeling."
"The report contains only sensible amendments, however."
"Reducing the mortality rate among pregnant women and encouraging equal access to care and benefits when it comes to health in pregnancy and to reproductive rights are objectives that I vigorously support and that stem from the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD)."
"In many developing countries, women fight for their reproductive rights and for control of their sexuality."
"For these women, achieving these rights and this control entails being able freely to choose the number of children they have, as well as the gaps between the birth of one child and the next."
"By opposing this access to information and a situation in which these rights are granted across the board, the door is closed to the fight against poverty and a delay imposed upon economic development, which is closely linked to improvements in the health and health care of the populations of the developing countries."
"A number of colleagues have, however, chosen to deny women these basic rights by proposing another route, that of supporting them in choosing to have their babies."
"This is a covert way of denying women's inalienable right to abortion."
"For all these reasons, I have, in all conscience, supported Mrs Sandbaek's report."
". (FR) This good report, which is going in the right direction, towards realism rather than a reactionary ideology, has been widely approved."
"That is a good thing! That is why I also voted in favour of the report."
". (FR) During the 1990s, the use of cannabis considerably increased in most EU countries."
"However, users of hard drugs by injection are a more elusive group that is therefore bound to be condemned to social exclusion, as the report indicates."
"We must respond to this."
"First of all, it is now essential that we advocate prevention through information channels."
"In order to do this we need to set aside financial resources and take action by organising campaigns, mainly in schools, in order to raise awareness among young people."
"We need to inform over and over again in order to prevent current standards from becoming blurred in the eyes of the young people of Europe."
"Secondly, it is essential that we involve everyone: parents, but also teachers, the police and the justice system, and finally and above all, associations that support drug addicts."
"That is why we should welcome the recommendation inviting local groups to help drug addicts to opt for a healthier life."
"The report is broadly to be welcomed, and so we voted in favour of it."
"Nevertheless, we must emphasise that it is crucial to ensure that intervention in highly risky and complex situations, as frequently happens in the field of drug addiction, adopts a multidimensional approach, so as to create synergies for much greater effectiveness."
"For example, there will be situations in which intervention in reducing the risks and minimising the harm entailed by the consumption of illegal drugs must go hand in hand with improvements in people's living conditions and quality of life, with job offers, social reintegration, the recovery of the urban fabric, with combating drug trafficking and effective action for primary prevention, either in schools or targeting groups of young people in high-risk situations."
"This type of situation requires multidisciplinary intervention structures and multifaceted leadership and resource management, to suit a given situation, which is only possible if responsibility is taken by each Member State."
"It would therefore be welcome if the resolution were to suggest the creation of structures at this level - genuine response measures for extremely serious situations - where necessary and did not lay down vague and diffuse responsibilities for families and communities in this area."
"- (NL) I welcome the resolution of the European Parliament on combating the drugs problem in Europe."
"It is a good thing that MEPs are at last receptive to the way we treat drug addicts in the Netherlands."
"The Netherlands has been treated as a pariah for years, but now we are being praised for the way we are dealing with these matters."
"The results of this vote are an endorsement of Dutch drugs policy."
"I am pleased with the members' decision to call on Member States in this report to place prevention and risk limitation at centre stage in our drugs policy."
"In this context, we should be offering facilities to help drug addicts kick their habit."
"We should also be making better use of the experiences of former drug users in the information we provide in places like schools and community centres."
"By providing better information we should be able to give young people a better idea of the consequences of taking drugs."
"We will have to pay specific attention to prisoners."
"I believe that it is a good thing for Member States to get prisons completely free from drugs."
"I have therefore voted in favour of this proposal."
"."
"(NL) The debate on drug addiction and its consequences is often hindered, on the one hand, by those who believe that you can simply wipe out drug use through statutory prohibitions, prison cells and the deployment of the police; and on the other, by those who advocate complete freedom, regarding the opportunities to take drugs that arise in practice as an acquired right in which the government should not get involved at all."
"Both points of view get in the way of proper information and the achievement of good health."
"Instead, it is much better to distinguish between soft drugs and hard drugs, and to focus the fight against hard drugs on informing a young generation on the very adverse consequences of taking drugs."
"In this regard we can learn from the struggle against alcohol and tobacco addiction."
"I support the rapporteur because she wants to use the experiences of former drugs users and wants to ensure the provision of advice, support, health care and more opportunities to help people get rid of their addictions."
"She is right to call for supervision of the chemical composition of substances like ecstasy, which is unfortunately often used by young people at parties, and to call for a better specification of best practices and lowest risks."
". As an MEP for London, I have a strong interest in combating and reducing drug-related deaths and drug-related illnesses such as HIV, hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis, one of the targets of the EU Drugs Strategy (2000-2004) endorsed by the European Council in 1999."
"I support the Malliori report with some minor exceptions."
"Although it proposes a range of non-binding measures, the stress on the role of local communities, especially police, social workers, local authority healthcare staff and others is the right emphasis."
"I am particularly supportive of the call for Member States to pay more attention to high-risk environments, like prisons, and the call for action on new 'drug patterns' such as 'designer drug' use, which is increasing in my constituency."
"I abstained from voting on this report."
"Although I share the rapporteur's concerns and her ultimate aims, I feel bound to regret the report's inclusion of points that I believe will do precisely the opposite of what they are intended to."
"I also regret that the excellent amendments tabled by Mr Blokland and Mr Santini, because their rejection by the slimmest of majorities suggests a desire to reject the possibility of a balanced text, which enjoys a broader consensus."
"I therefore regret the hesitant nature of many of the provisions adopted, which, whilst appearing to be democratic, could lead to failed models and distorted viewpoints being imposed on the fight against drug addiction."
"The rapporteur could have gone further in combating the ambivalent discourse on the use of drugs. So common amongst some parts of the European Left, which refuses to see drug consumption as the breaking of each citizen's responsibility towards their fellow citizens."
"The 1997 report by the United Nations Office on Drug Control and Crime Prevention (ODCCP), stated that 'efforts to reduce world consumption will be less effective if programmes for reducing demand are undermined by calls for drugs to be legalised'."
"The truth is that, unfortunately, mistaken policies always result in human disasters on the ground."
". (FR) This whole discussion about the best way to kill neatly or to fight a war without killing any civilians is in itself surreal."
"Even more so given today's circumstances, when we are aware that the United States, with the open or hypocritical cooperation of the great European powers, are preparing to start a war against Iraq in the next few days which, even if it ends with the fall of the dictator Saddam Hussein, will kill thousands of civilians."
"For our part, we are using this opportunity to protest against the imperialist war against Iraq."
"We voted in favour of the few passages that propose banning anti-personnel mines, while being aware that the proposals are quite irresolute and will not become a reality."
"However, we voted against the text as a whole because, on the pretext of wanting wars 'that conform with international law' it justifies past, present and future imperialist attacks."
"The texts Parliament has voted on, concerning the 'dangers of the use of depleted uranium in weapons', confine themselves, as did their predecessors of two years ago, to repeating accusations that lack any basis in fact or scientific credibility."
"These texts distort the problems and damage the credibility of our parliamentary institution."
"Depleted uranium, which is present in many devices all around us, does not pose any danger of radioactive contamination, and is even used to provide protection from radiation."
"The danger of chemical contamination, especially during combustion, is indeed high and hence the justification for the protection advised by western military manuals available on the Internet."
"In any event, when dormant in nature, depleted uranium is no more dangerous than the lead in hunting cartridges or in water pipes."
"The use of plutonium/mox' or other nuclear waste to replace depleted uranium, should indeed be subject to careful scrutiny."
"The presence of uranium 236 in blood tests of soldiers who served in Kosovo - as one newspaper has claimed - could indicate that this is the case."
"This is what the European Parliament should be discussing and investigating, instead of adopting declarations that are nothing more than demonstrations of prejudice and ignorance, from which I feel forced to distance myself."
". (PT) Although I strongly disagree with some aspects discussed in the resolution, specifically its acceptance of the European Security and Defence Policy and of military action under this policy, I think that it contains positive aspects, particularly in the context of the current international situation, such as the unacceptable, illegitimate and illegal threat of military aggression towards Iraq by the US administration."
"Amongst other aspects, I value the request to establish an immediate moratorium preventing further use of explosive fragmentation devices and ammunition containing depleted uranium (and other warheads containing uranium), with a view to banning them outright once a study has been undertaken."
"As a matter of fact, and with regard to this issue, I must use this statement to give my own feelings, having visited Iraq recently, of disgust at the effects that the use of such weapons have by the US military in that country on the population and most intolerably on the children that I was able to meet."
"Lastly, I would highlight the political significance of the parliamentary group of the PPE-DE having withdrawn from the joint resolution and having voted against."
". (EL) It is two years since the outcry about the numerous - sometimes fatal - illnesses caused by the depleted uranium weapons used by the USA and ???? in the Gulf and Yugoslavia, and still nothing has been done."
"On the contrary, there is an immediate danger of these and/or even more dangerous weapons being used again in the imminent war against Iraq, where numerous cases of babies with birth defects and children with leukaemia and other forms of cancer have already been reported."
"Greece too has soldiers who have been affected and are now suffering from various forms of cancer and being treated in secret."
"These weapons are scattered all over Greece."
"The government, having initially lied and denied that the armed forces had any such weapons, has since tried to play down the problem."
"As the Greek Medical Association for the Protection of the Environment Against Nuclear and Biochemical Threat rightly stated recently, 'what we have is a small nuclear war that has already irreparably contaminated the Balkans'."
"The good old international community, despite its meddling in terrorist laws and rapid reaction forces, has done nothing to ban depleted uranium weapons."
"The European Parliament resolution makes some good points but fails to come down in favour of a complete ban, merely calling for a moratorium pending further study."
". (FR) As we read in the explanatory statement, 'The focus on silicone-gel implants since the 1990s has led to many different epidemiological studies that have consistently showed no evidence of serious risk for major diseases'."
"Over recent years cosmetic surgery has made considerable progress and the techniques used have reached a more than satisfactory level of safety."
"However, if the danger warnings are increased and consumers are overprotected, doctors could become disheartened."
"Let us take the example of Caesareans."
"They have dramatically increased, because women are gripped by the idea of a lower risk."
"Therefore it is their trust in the medical profession that is called into question."
"While we need to protect patients, we also need to preserve the service providers by placing a degree of trust in them."
"- (NL) I understand the need to provide better information and more quality guarantees for breast implants."
"It is, however, going too far for Europe to say that women should protect themselves."
"We should not regulate 'self-esteem and other conceptual alternatives to breast implants' in Europe."
"Nor should Parliament urge Member States to 'concentrate on promoting and securing acceptance of the image of women as they actually are'."
"Europe must not prescribe a 'national breast-implant register' or annual 'compulsory aftercare examinations'."
"This reinforces the patronising image that the European Union already has."
"It would be much better for Member States to issue their own legislation in this regard."
"I believe that women are perfectly capable of taking decisions for themselves and can be advised very well by their doctors, and that a ban on advertising is therefore not necessary."
"We are always getting bogged down in details."
"Is this Europe's business?"
"Sometimes you wonder which bureaucrat sitting behind his desk thought this one up."
"I have therefore voted against the resolution."
". (PT) Given the huge number of accidents with breast implants and the increasingly common use of these, especially in minors under the age of eighteen, this European Commission communication is greatly to be welcomed."
"I think that the EP has played a role in improving the initial proposal by tabling amendments that seek to ensure: a commitment to scientific research, better public information, medical monitoring and observation following implants and a ban on implants in persons under the age of eighteen, except where there is a medical need."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the crisis in the steel sector and the measures to be taken at Community level."
"Commissioner Byrne has the floor."
"Mr President, the European steel industry has been through a difficult period over the last 20 years."
"There was a need for an overall restructuring of the sector."
"Nowadays the European steel industry is very competitive."
"In order to maintain their global position, however, companies need to engage in a continuous process of adapting their structures."
"The industry is still striving for efficiency, but even if remaining overcapacities are closed down, from an industrial point of view, we cannot talk about a real crisis on the scale that we had in the 1980s, but rather about a social crisis due to new closures."
"Restructuring is often a synonym for job losses which can have tragic consequences on the social fabric of any region, but in particular on those regions facing a low job creation potential."
"The Commission is acutely aware of the need for citizens and workers to feel secure in taxing times."
"We have observed again in recent weeks extremely different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring."
"In some cases, these operations are prepared well in advance, fully involving workers' representatives, with due care being taken to search for less damaging solutions, and seeking actively and in good time to prepare workers likely to be affected to face the challenge of sudden unemployment."
"In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with no care or concern at all for those affected."
"On every occasion in the past, the Commission has always highlighted the following basic principles. Firstly, decisions on corporate restructuring remain a prerogative, as well as a responsibility, of management."
"This means that when contemplating actions likely to have serious social consequences, companies should always actively search and choose the less damaging solutions."
"Secondly, when dismissals prove to be inevitable, the utmost must be done to improve the employability of those concerned."
"This requires anticipation and adequate management of those processes."
"Thirdly, nothing can justify the absence of timely and effective information and consultation with workers' representatives."
"These basic assertions attract a wide consensus in Europe."
"It is, thankfully, increasingly rare to see companies embarking on damaging restructuring operations, ignoring these fundamental concerns, but it does sometimes happen."
"The way in which Metaleurop conducted the closure of the Pas de Calais plant is the worst possible example of disregard for the interests, the concerns and the rights of workers, as well as for the health and safety of the surrounding population."
"It is, of course, fair and necessary to underline other approaches: at the other extreme, Arcelor is also facing a restructuring process with unavoidable pain for its workers, but is tackling it differently."
"The Commission does not wish to interfere in the economic logic behind the management's intentions, it is the management's role to do that in close consultation with workers' representatives."
"Arcelor took a number of positive and productive steps, well before the recent announcement measures had already commenced, to anticipate the problems."
"Again recently, the management reaffirmed its intention to enter into effective consultations with workers' representatives at all levels."
"The consultation process encompasses: the economic reasoning behind the projected closures; taking independent expert advice on the whole affair; taking all possible measures to avoid the closures or limit their social impact; and seeking to clean the local environment and re-industrialise the closed plants."
"This extensive programme is serious and is considered to be so by all stakeholders."
"It is the result of a different kind of industrial relations which have led, for instance, to an agreement on transnational information and consultation of workers that is widely recognised as being very advanced and effective."
"The three seats on the board for workers' representatives, although there is currently no legal obligation for this, also illustrate that same positive approach."
"This in fact anticipates the European Company Statute."
"We have built over recent years in the European Union a wide range of instruments that meet these concerns."
"The directives on collective redundancies, transfers of undertakings, information and consultation and the European Works Councils directive are some examples."
"The most recent texts clearly promote upstream worker involvement, notably on strategic issues and on the foreseeable evolution of employment within companies."
"This is the only way to help the European workforce face the challenges of change successfully in that it allows for the timely development of the employability and adaptability of workers."
"The two cases I mentioned before can only confirm those assertions, one positively and one negatively."
"It is up to national courts and other authorities to ensure compliance with Community directives."
"The Commission will, of course, fulfil its ultimate role of control of the application of Community law if breaches are not effectively sanctioned."
"Those aspects will constitute some of the main elements of the forthcoming revision of the European Works Councils Directive."
"More importantly, the Commission very much hopes that the European social partners identify and find the means of developing good practices of corporate restructuring throughout the EU, as they decided to do when responding positively to last year's consultation on this issue."
"Those good practices go well beyond the information and consultation of workers."
"They cover actions with a view to anticipating the market and technological developments, investing in people on a permanent basis, developing employability, seeking alternatives to closures and redundancies, redeploying, whenever possible, workers affected by restructuring operations and so on - precisely those good practices which I hope will help Arcelor's workers overcome the present difficulties, and which are dramatically absent in the Metaleurop environment."
"It is also useful to recall in this context other initiatives of the Commission relating to corporate social responsibility, social dialogue and the European Monitoring Centre on Change."
"Besides those policy aspects, our immediate concern today is the recent cases of restructuring."
"The Commission would like to state clearly that, above all, we share your regret and concern on the possible social consequences for those who may be affected."
"I sincerely hope that every effort is made to prevent or attenuate them through dialogue between all parties concerned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I must admit to the Commissioner that I found his speech extraordinarily disappointing."
"He gave a series of general considerations on a situation that we are well aware of."
"Those considerations were centred around the restructuring of companies in a series of sectors, but did not specifically deal with the problems that we are currently experiencing in several regions."
"I must admit that I was very surprised to hear the Commissioner condemning the attitude of a company that everyone considers to have behaved in a particularly scandalous manner, Metaleurop, and at the same time praising another company which has been headline news in recent months, Arcelor."
"The decision taken by Arcelor to gradually close its hot-working steel facilities on its continental sites was, of course, received with concern in the regions concerned."
"It was also received with anger, in particular in the Liège region, because it is ruthlessly breaking the commitment made by Usinor before merging into the new Arcelor group to invest in the smelting works in Liège, in order to ensure that hot-working production lines were maintained."
"Along with this commitment there was a commitment in return from workers to make efforts towards productivity to ensure that the site was competitive."
"The workers' commitments were kept but Usinor's have now been betrayed and the workers feel they have been duped."
"This is why all of the movements in the region and also the Walloon Government and the Belgian Federal Government are now asking Arcelor to explain itself."
"I think it is important that the European Commission also takes this stance."
"The resolution that we have all put forward together has the prime objective of ensuring that Arcelor keeps its commitments."
"There is all the more reason for Arcelor to keep its commitments given that you said - and this is the important element in your statement - that the steel industry was not in crisis, that companies in general were competitive, and that there is therefore no reason for Arcelor to want to go back on the commitments that it made unless it is for purely financial reasons."
"We should not therefore envisage first of all restructuring processes with Cockerill-Sambre, and then with Usinor."
"The Liège region has already experienced and paid heavily for the steel crisis."
"What is needed now to ensure restructuring is time."
"What the Liège region does not accept is for commitments to be broken, shortening the deadlines that were set for us, and we therefore clearly ask the Commission to remind Arcelor of its commitments."
"We should also question Arcelor's behaviour, as we are learning that it intends to purchase a number of sites in a candidate country that will be part of Europe in the future."
"That raises a number of questions at European level."
"Mr President, first of all, in keeping with the spirit of the speech made by Mr Hansenne, I would like to remind the honourable spokesperson for the Commission that it is the heir of the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community, which was not created to organise the burial of industrial activity in Europe, nor to catalogue the different ways of burying industrial activity in our regions, or to act as the social Red Cross for workers and regions that have been severely wounded."
"What I am saying is how much, like Mr Hansenne, we think that a Commission declaration was more necessary than ever, but we also think that it is largely inadequate."
"This is particularly true in my case, because I sent the Commission proof of Arcelor's desire to set up on continental sites in Poland, while we have just recounted how in three European regions, continental sites are by their nature doomed to disappear."
"I will not say any more, Mr President, in order to allow my colleagues to speak."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to highlight an initial point that I think is fundamental: the Commission declaration is a poor one."
"The responsibility of the Commission today is effectively to take on the role of the public authority within the powers that it has inherited from the High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community."
"It should also be pointed out that the Commission should not be a spectator, but play an active public role in managing steel at European Union level."
"The resolution put forward contains some themes that we see as essential."
"I hope that the Commission is able to answer four quite specific questions on these four themes."
"First of all, being aware that European firmness is necessary in order for steel production to be fairly distributed at global level, is the Commission going to ensure that the Polish Government cannot intervene financially in the industrial processes to support any of the Arcelor's group's plans in Poland?"
"Secondly, does the Commission consider that it is still entirely capable of ensuring that the European Union can choose and maintain a steel industry, or is it simply waiting for the industry to disappear?"
"In other words, is the Commission aware that it still has a responsibility under Article 3 of the ECSC Treaty, or has it forgotten that article?"
"Thirdly, regarding regional restructuring and social support, is the Commission prepared, from now on, to use the resources of all of the European instruments as part of a programme negotiated with the responsible authority, that is, the Walloon regional authorities in Belgium, to ensure that any aid is focused on social support and restructuring, while ensuring that state aid is not paid to other regions?"
"The fourth question is: what measures does the Commission intend to take in order to ensure that existing European social law is respected before any decision is made by any group?"
"In particular this involves respecting a number of collective agreements."
"Along the same lines, is the Commission prepared, as far as company law is concerned, to invoke Article 5 of the ECSC Treaty, according to which the Commission has the task of ensuring that social activity continues as long as general production at European level is not threatened?"
"Mr President, today Europe must, through the Commission, show the rest of the world that it is firm on commercial matters and make the industrial choice to be socially pro-active and restructure industry in a useful way."
"Finally, the Commission needs to play its role as a public power, to make European employment law and company law a reality."
"I am looking forward to hearing the Commission's response, and I hope that the speech that will follow those of MEPs will not be of a general nature like the Commissioner's first speech."
"Mr President, I think that there is already a consensus emerging from the first few speeches: the Commission's response and its proposal do not currently respond to the situation."
"Indeed, one can only note and condemn the increasing number of companies being restructured, along with restructuring programmes and redundancies with disastrous consequences, of course for employees, but also for entire regions that are devastated as a result."
"Many sectors are affected by this, particularly the steel industry."
"People say that the context of a slowdown in growth is not favourable."
"It is true that the majority of companies wear out this argument that restructuring and closures of sites are necessary in order to deal with international competition."
"However, let us state the fact that company management take a fundamentally financial approach and not always an industrial one, far from it, when defining their strategy."
"Their aim is to achieve maximum profitability, without worrying about the social or environmental consequences."
"That often leads to relocations to third countries where rules on such matters are practically non-existent."
"Commissioner, you referred to Metaleurop."
"It is true that even though that is about the metal industry and not specifically steel, it is a useful example: this very polluting company is going to shed thousands of jobs without taking any social or environmental responsibility."
"I think, however, that the situation raises the broader question of what ambitions Europe intends to have in terms of drawing up a new Treaty?"
"Is the European Union going to accept such behaviour from companies which, we should remember, have greatly benefited from European political aid."
"You of course referred to existing legislation that needs to be applied."
"Nevertheless, I think that new measures need to be taken to inform unions and works committees about the aid received."
"Measures also need to be adopted forcing those companies to account for how they have used loans granted and to reimburse them if they do not respect the commitments made."
"When it comes to enlargement, which was referred to with regard to another company, Europe needs to equip itself with further resources in order to promote an ambitious industrial policy that will ensure that a strong steel sector is maintained and modernised, incorporating the necessary social and environmental standards within a framework of sustainable development."
"If that is not done, Commissioner, we will not move towards a Union of solidarity but towards a Union of terrible opposition between employees and between citizens."
"With regard to social governance, we need to legislate even more."
"I think that new European legislative texts need to be more effective in forcing companies established in the Union to take on their responsibilities."
"The Commission and the Member States need to adopt a more pro-active strategy in response to industrial restructuring and its social impact."
"I think that this is also a question of ethics."
"In a Europe that seeks to defend the fundamental rights of its citizens, can we stand by and do nothing while thousands of employees are thrown out onto the street as if they were just goods?"
"It is precisely the opposite approach that we need to promote in order to have a fresh impetus for industry in Europe."
"Employees should have new rights in companies at all levels."
"I am of course referring to the legislation on European committees."
"However, I think that establishing democracy within boards of directors would prevent many companies from being forced into being restructured and into liquidation by management that is mainly bowing to financial pressure and is far from responding to industrial demands."
"I therefore think that the Union should force the companies concerned to do more to take into account the alternative proposals from unions before making any decisions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the steel crisis and, in particular, the recent decisions made by Arcelor, are not a Belgian regional problem, but a European problem."
"You do not need to live next to a smelting works in order to feel the whole human impact of the decisions that have been taken, the way in which they were taken, and to be aware of their economic impact, which will reach far beyond the Liège region and even across borders."
"That is not the only thing, however, that demonstrates that the type of problem being raised here is not only regional but also European."
"The problem is not only confined to the steel industry."
"It is part of a business mindset in which financial profitability takes precedence over proximity - which was a genuine attribute - and in particular over respecting commitments made towards the sustainable development of the regions of Europe."
"As a result, if we respond to this with relatively weak declarations, we are confirming our inability, on the one hand, to ensure that basic social law is respected and, on the other hand to control or even prevent the use of public funds to create cheap jobs to the detriment of quality jobs that therefore have to be more expensive."
"The action that we can take today involves enforcing the right to control the use of public funds, far beyond promises and declarations."
"However, currently it appears that the resources that we have are, in my opinion, insufficient."
"This raises the question: what is our ambition for the Europe of tomorrow?"
"As we approach enlargement, it is vital that we define the social rules that the market will never define for itself, if we wish to prevent unfair and suicidal competition between the regions of Europe."
"Let us not forget that the financial rules, which are currently helping to drain certain regions of Europe to the benefit of others, will in the future drain Europe to the benefit of other regions in the world."
"This debate is, therefore indeed about the social future, but also about the economic future of Europe."
"National governments and parliaments, but also the Commission, therefore urgently need to equip themselves with effective tools to manage both an economic Europe and a social Europe."
"Enforcing the right to legislate in order to better manage the future is not a question of ability but a question of political will."
"What we need to do first of all is to get past the fatalism of liberalisation and the selfishness of certain regions and countries, entrusting to Europe what will be best managed at that level, so that we can have a strong economy but also a quality of employment that is worthy of the social model that we are always talking about."
"Mr President, Commissioner, from left to right in this House, there is a consensus, and this time it is not a weak consensus, but a genuinely strong signal sent out to the Commission."
"A resolution on the steel industry will be adopted soon."
"We entirely support it."
"Having said that, allow me, aside from the resolution, as a socialist from Liège living next to the first site that was affected by Arcelor's restructuring, to express my anger."
"We are all suffering now, as we have said, as the result of the lack of a regulatory framework allowing us to deal with the ultraliberal actions of the multinationals."
"I am aware that this phrase might make people laugh, but I stand by it."
"We can no longer tolerate decisions that are based on purely financial considerations and which can wipe a region from the world map in one fell swoop, without considering the families that live there, the workers that have built it and the children that will grow up there."
"Now it is Liège that is the target, next it will be Florence, Brême, EKO Stahl; now it is the steel industry, next it might be the hi-tech industry."
"There is no end to this arbitrary phenomenon."
"Commissioner, you presented Arcelor as the good student of Europe."
"In my opinion, this international steel company is doing a dreadful thing, which is both heinous and ridiculous."
"Not content with abandoning its commitments to Cockerill - developing technological innovation, renewing tools, promoting employment - Arcelor is making threats."
"Its directors are announcing that rationalisation must continue, otherwise they could close earlier, or even straight away."
"And the lock-out of nineteenth century capitalism is suddenly re-emerging out of the mouths of its directors."
"Moreover, at the same time as announcing the death of the European hot-working sites, the Arcelor group is seeking to purchase Polish companies, but above all it is heavily investing in the Brazilian continental hot-working steel industry."
"That it what is heinous, Commissioner."
"What is ridiculous, is the image that Arcelor portrays on its web site, a company, and I will quote without laughing, 'that is socially aware and which, conscious of its role in the Community, is supporting and sponsoring science, medicine, sport and the arts'."
"Unfortunately we are not talking about sponsorship, art or sport today, but the future of a region."
"And on this subject, Arcelor sees itself as being reassuring."
"It is promising a restructuring plan and early retirement."
"But who is it trying to fool?"
"Because as well as the 1 700 workers that are directly affected, who are therefore benefiting from a restructuring programme, what will happen to the other 5 000 or 7 000 sub-contractors, suppliers, who will be out of a job?"
"Commissioner, finally give us the means to support coherent, integrated European policies, bearing the stamp of the economy, no doubt, but also socially convincing."
"I ask the Council and the Commission to finally prepare a regulatory framework that will enable us to prevent the all-powerful financial considerations from shattering the alliance between Europe and its citizens."
"Because that alliance is fragile and what is the point in Europe being an economic giant if, like the ogre in the fable, it is now eating up its children?"
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has the floor, and I would like to welcome her back to this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it might appear somewhat strange that someone who does not live in the area concerned should be taking an interest in this problem."
"In the ELDR Group, however, we have had an extensive discussion on the ability of this industry to compete and in particular on the level playing field within which this sector of industry is supposed to move."
"I was therefore a little disappointed with your input with regard to what the European Union could do."
"After all, we must realise that the level playing field has not always existed throughout Europe - far from it - and indeed still does not exist in some places."
"In particular, the World Trade Organisation and the OECD still offer great opportunities."
"For the people in the region, whether we are talking about this industry, which is in difficulties or another region, it will be of great importance that much is done in the field of innovation and research."
"We have funds in Europe that we can work with."
"It is not as if the Commission is incapable of doing anything at all."
"I would like to remind you that when the European Union realised that we had fallen behind in the area of the information society, your predecessor Mr Bangemann brought into being a platform that encouraged European Member States to catch up."
"In this area too - in view of our imminent enlargement to include Eastern Europe - we should not be saying that companies must not relocate; we should be saying that we must try to retain control of innovation, and that means that the research funds can certainly have a part to play and that the European Commission can also be a source of encouragement."
"Finally I would like to draw your attention to the European social funds."
"It seems to me to be logical that wherever there is a good social charter and where companies make efforts themselves, an additional input should come via the European Social Fund so that if redundancies are in fact unavoidable, people are offered prospects for the future via retraining and are not left out in the cold."
"The question that we will be faced with in the future is whether we can work together to give Europe a different aspect from that currently presented to the world by the USA."
"I am very much in favour of a liberal Europe, but it must be a social liberal Europe."
"I also find that your speech gives too little indication of the incentives there could be both at European and at national level ."
"Mr President, the factory closures planned by Arcelor are scandalous."
"The group, which is the most powerful group in the world steel industry and is collapsing under its profits, coldly announces that it is going to close a total of six smelting works in Belgium, Germany and France, throwing out thousands of workers, condemning their families to poverty and devastating entire regions."
"For such a decision to be taken in secret by a board of directors, obeying the demands of a handful of financiers, shows the extent to which the system that you defend amounts to a dictatorship by money."
"The fact that this can happen, without even inciting a reaction from the political authorities aside from a few hypocritical groans, shows the extent to which the workers are unable to count on the authorities to defend them."
"We are told that periodical restructuring is inevitable in industry, but why is it always the workers that have to pay for that restructuring, and never the shareholders or the owners of the companies?"
"I know that the problem is not only with the steel industry."
"At the moment in France the airline Air Lib is also shutting up shop and making 3 200 people redundant."
"Air Lib is not a steel company, but behind it, two years ago, was the same financial group, Marine Wendel, which made a fortune through the sweat and pain of generations of workers, steel workers, if not their blood."
"It is the shareholders of the group and their ringleader, Baron Sellière of the employers' federation in France, Medef, who, by withdrawing their capital, were responsible for the collapse of Air Lib."
"This is why I say to the workers, both in the steel and air transport industries, and those going through the mass redundancies all over Europe, that we need to fight to establish a balance of power enabling workers to impose a ban on mass redundancies, on pain of expropriation."
"We need to take from the company profits or if need be from the personal fortunes of their owners and shareholders, in order to provide salaries for all the workers affected by the restructuring."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I also found the Commissioner's response distressing."
"I felt as though I were looking at the list of contents of a first aid kit, when the accident has happened and, of course, we believe it is inevitable."
"We should not, however, bury our heads in the sand, because here we are facing a perfect example of deregulated globalisation."
"When in March 2002 - almost exactly a year ago, so it will soon be the anniversary - the protectionist measure in the American steel industry was justified by the wish to protect their national steel against an alleged invasion of low-cost products, Europe decided, through Mr Lamy and the Commission, to retaliate."
"Commissioner Lamy therefore told us, before this House, that the European Union intended to defend its industries and jobs by taking all available measures."
"Mr Lamy also stipulated that these defence measures should take place within the strict framework of the Union's international commitments, namely within the World Trade Organisation."
"In the same speech, Mr Lamy described our steel industry as restructured, productive, strong and competitive, adding that he admitted we had paid an extremely high social and financial price between 1980 and 1990, but that we could now be proud because the overall result was positive and, in particular, because we no longer needed to fear the future."
"Around the same time, he visited the Sidmar de Gand factory, a production unit belonging to the Arcelor group, the same company that is now throwing thousands of workers out into the streets and plunging a region into despair."
"It was clearly out of the question for Europe to become a kind of Wild West, where everyone can do what they like, with the strongest inevitably triumphing over the weakest."
"The Commission recognised that the lack of legal rules left the field open for power struggles alone, and that is why we reacted by observing the rules and the law."
"We are now facing a disorganised world trade system, where Arcelor did not wait for market regulation because in fact that is what this is about."
"American protectionism has consequences for all of us, which led Arcelor to impose market regulation, in other words according to its own criteria, with a view to reassuring its shareholders, who were hungry for high profit margins."
"At European Union level, we are therefore becoming a real Wild West in social terms."
"On a daily basis, multinationals - and I shall spare you the large companies that consider workers and small companies as nothing more than disposable tissues that can be thrown away once they have served their purpose - decide to implement job losses and close factories in order to open others elsewhere."
"They force national social systems to compete with each other and drive countries to restrict workers' rights."
"Furthermore, these companies receive subsidies and sometimes even privileges."
"They do not respect their commitments, and find every possible loophole, even those that can still be found in the enlargement system."
"The legislative arsenal of the European Union on social issues is clearly insufficient and there are still European political leaders, in particular within the Convention, who say that the European Union must not intervene in social policy matters."
"Arcelor today, Renault Vilvoorde yesterday, these are the examples that have led us to fight, here in this House, to say that Europe must be a social Europe or nothing at all."
"In any case, we certainly cannot continue to infringe workers' rights as we are doing."
"It is essential to ensure that companies shoulder their social responsibilities on a purely voluntary basis."
"In order to do so, we need a number of commitments."
"Europe is adept at pointing out the rules of an ambitious industrial policy: what can we do to remain competitive in the traditional production sectors such as steel, telecommunications, gas and electricity?"
"This Europe could then, with no problems, observe in silence the restructuring and closures, and we, within this House, the elected Members of Parliament, representing the workers and the people, would accept that with our arms folded, opening the first aid kit and wondering how to call the Red Cross!"
"What is happening in the steel sector could have been anticipated."
"The Commission seems to be realising it for the first time, and we could be surprised."
"What I would like to say, Mr President, in conclusion, is that if the European integration process was conceived with the ECSC, whose obligations have already been recalled, if we do not want to tell the citizens once again that this Europe is not for them and that it is a Europe of money, I think we should develop a specific intervention model adapted to the steel problem."
"Mr President, I have listened with great care and attention and interest to this crucial debate."
"One cannot but be moved by the strength and passion with which Members of Parliament have expressed their views on this unfortunate issue."
"A number of interesting ideas were developed throughout the debate and the Commission will study all of them with great care."
"Most of the points raised were dealt with in my introductory remarks and I will not go into detail on them now."
"Let me underline again the basic principle according to which decisions on corporate restructuring are a prerogative of management, but also its responsibility."
"A wide consensus seems to exist in Europe on the way to address crises resulting from the need for companies to adapt, from industrial change and from corporate restructuring."
"Let me reaffirm again the importance of effective, timely and comprehensive information and consultation of workers' representatives."
"You have nevertheless expressed other types of concerns to which I would like to give you the Commission's preliminary view."
"Before I do that I would like to pick up one or two points that were made."
"There were references, for instance, to the European Coal and Steel Community, and I was asked whether Articles 3 and 5 have any application in these circumstances."
"It appears to be the case that Articles 3 and 5 no longer have application because the ECSC is no longer operational."
"Nor indeed are state aids possible. We all know that."
"There is no competence at EU level to deal with many of the issues that have been raised by honourable Members in this debate this afternoon."
"I can only quote what Mrs Zrihen said in her contribution just a moment ago, when she said the legislative arsenal is insufficient."
"That is indeed the case."
"There is not a lot that can be done in many circumstances in relation to some of the issues that you have raised because of the very point that Mrs Zrihen has raised."
"I shall now deal with some of the issues you raised."
"Firstly, with regard to the trade dispute in the steel sector between the USA and the EU, the Commission is pursuing a very active line with regard to the unilateral measures taken by the US to protect its steel industry."
"Those defensive measures include, besides intensive bilateral contacts with a view to solving the conflict, retaliation measures and using the WTO disputes settlement mechanism."
"My colleague, Commissioner Lamy, is forcefully pursuing that particular issue."
"Another issue that was raised in the debate was the issue surrounding the issue of enlargement."
"For the steel industry, as well as for many other industries, enlargement is above all a window of opportunity for them to develop their businesses in the interests of themselves and in the interests of their workers."
"There are issues related to compliance with standards in the new Member States, notably in the social and environmental fields."
"Those issues are, however, being dealt with through technical assistance to help their industries to adapt, as well as through the assurance that those new members will have to comply with the relevant Community law from the date of accession."
"A number of Members made reference to Social Funds and so on, and particularly to the free use of Community funds, notably the European Social Fund, to support the training and professional reconversion of workers affected by restructuring."
"I should like to make a few points on that."
"After the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the only possibility lies in the European Social Fund and in interventions from the Structural Funds."
"The main goal in the long term must be the reconversion of local industrial activities."
"This will have a much greater impact on the regions than direct social aid to the employees, although some transitional measures can be considered."
"We should recall that aid for the rescue and restructuring of companies in difficulty remains prohibited, in principle, for the iron and steel industry, as does any investment aid."
"The same rules apply to the countries applying for accession and with regard to new aid."
"There were also references to making public aid dependent upon the maintenance of employment."
"Generally speaking, public aid to companies is already subject to those kinds of conditions."
"A number of the existing instruments specifically link the obtaining of state aid funds to the obligation to keep people employed during a minimum period."
"The guidelines on national regional aid make it clear that aid for job creation must be made conditional on maintenance of the employment created for a minimum period of five years."
"Similarly, the Commission regulation on state aid for employment contains provisions stipulating that such aid can only be granted if the employment is maintained for a minimum period of three years, or two years in the case of SMEs."
"Continuous employment should also be granted to workers in the case of aid for the recruitment of disadvantaged and disabled workers."
"The Structural Funds regulations do not contain similar conditions, but it is clear that in so far as Structural Funds are used to cofinance state aid schemes, relevant obligations to keep people employed for a minimum period of time have to be respected."
"Some reference was made to the alleged ambitions of one of the companies involved to make acquisitions in Poland."
"Possible acquisition by Arcelor of certain factories in Poland or other third countries would be the subject of a survey by the Commission, pursuant to Regulation 4064/89 on the control of concentrations between undertakings."
"The Commission underlines that it only permits concentrations which are compatible with the common market."
"In its evaluation the Commission comes to a conclusion only about the competitive aspects without intervening in the industrial policy of a private company."
"I should also say that the Commission has no information to the effect that any such plans for acquisition by that company have been successful."
"Finally, industrial change has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion."
"However, it also provides opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed."
"Dialogue, transparency, proper worker involvement, anticipation, risk prevention and the development of employability are the key elements of our European response to this phenomenon."
"Let us do our best to build the instruments of a legislative or other nature which can promote these principles."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"To conclude this debate, I have received four motions for resolutions."
"Mr President, I have a request from my colleague, Mr António Mussa, who is temporary chairman of Parliament's delegation to Kazakhstan and for the countries in the region, for the vote on this motion to be postponed to another time."
"The parliamentary delegation was surprised that this motion was not submitted for its consideration."
"The situation in the region is apparently quite delicate."
"The delegation has followed it closely and the members, particularly the delegation's chairman, would have preferred to have the opportunity to study the motion."
"Forgive me, Mr President, I should have consulted the rules of procedure; amendments have been made and I am not absolutely sure of the procedural basis for my request, but I am fulfilling the request of a colleague who is chairman of a parliamentary delegation and I submit the decision for the consideration of the Bureau and the Chamber."
"Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I fully understand the request made by the chair of your delegation."
"I must ensure compliance with the Rules of Procedure, however, which state in Rule 146 that intentions to request the adjournment of a debate must be notified at least twenty-four hours in advance to the President who shall inform Parliament without delay."
"As this request did not reach us within the allotted period, the vote will therefore take place immediately after the debate, in accordance with the provisions of our Rules of Procedure."
"Please be aware that I understand your request, but I am obliged to apply the rules of our institution."
"The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolutions on human rights in Kazakhstan and Central Asia:"
"B5-0135/2003, by Mr Van den Berg and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Kazakhstan;"
"B5-0136/2003, by Mrs Morgantini and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on human rights abuses in Kazakhstan and Central Asia;"
"B5-0143/2003, by Mr Maat and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on human rights in Kazakhstan and Central Asia;"
"B5-0144/2003, by Mr Staes and Mrs Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Kazakhstan;"
"B5-0147/2003, by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the ELDR group, on the situation in Kazakhstan;"
"B5-0152/2003, by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD group, on the situation in Kazakhstan."
"Mr President, both Kazakhstan and Tajikistan are authoritarian regimes or dictatorships where fundamental freedoms are flouted, political activity suppressed and where torture still takes place."
"We naturally support the calls to respect democratic rights and freedoms in these two countries and we condemn the executions that continue to take place in Tajikistan."
"It should however be emphasised that the Kazakh regime's failure to respect human rights, which the European Parliament is preparing to condemn, does not bother the large oil trusts at all. These trusts are fighting it out with billions of dollars - 13 million, more than in Russia - for the Kazakh energy reserves, which are considerable."
"Nor does it bother the building groups, including Bouygues, which have made considerable amounts of money thanks to the construction of the new capital, Astana."
"This means that these trusts, among the main pillars of capitalism in the so-called democratic Western countries, are also the pillars of dictatorships, both in Central Asia, the Middle East, or elsewhere."
"Mr President, it is with a certain regret that we are again debating Kazakhstan, all the more because it is a fantastic country with fantastic inhabitants and perhaps even wonderful opportunities if you consider its economy and the fact that a fledgling democracy has been built up."
"That does, however, give us in the European Union a responsibility, in our cooperation with Kazakhstan, to talk about each other's position as good friends, and that is what is now a cause for concern."
"Our point of concern is about the development of democracy and the further curtailment of the freedom of the press."
"I will quote you the example of Sergei Duvanov, a journalist who was arrested after he had published some critical articles; he was also accused of an indecency offence on pretty dubious grounds and was not given a proper public trial."
"There are therefore quite a few examples of intimidation."
"The second important point is that it is, in fact, becoming increasingly difficult to form political parties and to set up social organisations there, as ever more stringent requirements are being imposed and what is gradually happening is that these organisations are only being allowed to exist if they can demonstrate that they really have tens of thousands of members in each region."
"This does not promote the development of a democratic constitutional state."
"In view of the cooperation agreements we have signed, we, the European Union, are partly responsible for our relations with Kazakhstan."
"That point in particular causes us concern, but it also makes us more responsible for the implementation of the agreements and for Kazakhstan's continued development."
"For this reason I am asking the Commission and the Council very explicitly to pay attention to the situation on the basis of these cooperation agreements and to contact President Nazarbayev and the government in Kazakhstan with a view to finding a way, as a true friend, of improving the development of democracy and of paying more attention to human rights."
"True friends tell each other the truth; we must be able to do this in this relationship."
"I hope that the Commission and the Council do in fact intend to play this role on the basis of the treaties we have signed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, unlike Mr Maat, we are satisfied that today, by means of this resolution, the European Parliament is sparing a thought for Kazakhstan and, through it, for Central Asia."
"Although it is true that certain regions of the world are attracting the attention of the European Union, this vast, fragile sub-continent, currently in transition, torn between Russia and China, all too often escapes our vigilance and our requirements."
"These countries are far from the eyes of the Union, and therefore far from its control."
"The signals coming from Kazakhstan, however, are more reminiscent of a return to Soviet methods than of a transition towards the rule of law, democracy and a system that respects human rights."
"How else can we interpret these cases of intimidation and persecution of journalists and the opposition?"
"What is the historical precedent for these fixed or arbitrary trials suffered recently by people such as Mrs Petrushova, Mr Abbyazov and Mr Zhakiyanov?"
"Does the fact that these phenomena are increasingly common not imply a return to the previous authoritarian regime rather than the inevitable ups and downs of a transition towards democracy?"
"More than a decade after the collapse of the USSR, these kinds of misadventures and alibis cannot be tolerated."
"Although there are still reservations regarding the European Union's vigilance with regard to these Central Asian republics over the past few years, the Union must now show genuine firmness in order to promote its principles and its values in this region of the world."
"Tomorrow, certain former Soviet republics will join our Union."
"Today, already, the Union is concentrating a key economic and industrial force in Europe and the world."
"It must use this as a political lever to demolish the non-democratic regimes of these third countries that are so eager to obtain Community investment."
"We clearly have ways of putting pressure on Kazakhstan, on the countries in this region of Central Asia which, at a time of globalisation and the enlargement of the European Union, are no longer, and must no longer, be outside our horizons."
"We have the power, and it is our duty, to bring the current situation in Kazakhstan into conformity with the international treaties and agreements and in particular with the partnership and cooperation agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan."
"I would like to plead the case of the Kazakh journalist Serguei Duvanov to this institution, as was the case here for Professor Baudajevski of Belarus or Mr Chbih Ould Cheikh Malainine of Mauritania. I would like the European Union to assess political and human rights developments in Kazakhstan."
"Mr President, in recital C of the present draft resolution, this House is also asking for attention to be paid to the increasing intimidation and persecution of religious minorities in Kazakhstan."
"This is entirely justified, as the Stichting Friedensstimme Nederland even mentions an unfortunate trend that has been ongoing for the past eighteen months."
"Insiders describe the increasing aggression on the part of the government and politicians, which goes hand in hand with disruptions of Christian acts of worship, as being reminiscent of the victimisation during the Communist era."
"Two non-registered Baptist communities were attacked at the beginning of this month."
"On Saturday 1 February police brutally raided a prayer centre in the municipality of Yevgenyevka in the north-east of Kazakhstan."
"Confiscations and destruction followed, with even the pastor's personal possessions being seized, even though Kazakhstan's constitution does not explicitly prohibit non-registered religious groupings, and this is not even to mention the underhand official fine imposed on the same community last year."
"One day later, on Sunday 2 February, a police officer accompanied by a colleague and two drunken 'witnesses' disrupted the morning service of the non-registered Baptist community in Leninogorsk."
"I call on the Commission and the Council to bring these abuses to the attention of the authorities in Kazakhstan and to urge them to improve the position of Christian minorities in society in that country."
"Mr President, I apologise to my colleagues in this debate for not anticipating that the debate was going to be brought forward."
"I was expecting it to start at 4.30 p.m."
"I had the opportunity to visit Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan briefly with the Central Asian Delegation at the end of September and the beginning of October 2002."
"I have to say that all the signs are that there is a danger of Kazakhstan slipping into authoritarianism."
"There is increasing intimidation and persecution of the press."
"The case of Mr Duvanov, sentenced to three and a half years in jail is well known and has been mentioned."
"The case of Irina Petrushova with Respublika weekly, sentenced to one and a half years in jail is another example."
"And there is a series of new criminal cases."
"A new law on the creation of opposition parties requires 50 000 citizens' signatures before they can be registered."
"Many of our parties in the European Union would not be able to register that level of support!"
"Of course, there is the increasing pressure on the opposition."
"We still have problems with regard to legislation, particularly the fact that the crime and the practice of torture still exist and there is no clear definition of what torture is."
"Clearly, we want a dialogue in Kazakhstan between the government and the opposition; we want them to respect international law."
"In the meantime, we ask the Council and Commission to raise these questions firmly at the next meeting between the Council, the Commission and the government of Kazakhstan."
"Mr President, can I reassure you that we have not changed offices for the delegation to Central Asia."
"I am still vice-president, Mr Di Pietro is still president and Mr Koukiadis is still vice-president as well."
"Mr Mussa very kindly stood in for us at a meeting yesterday."
"We welcome the genuine dialogue that we have with the Kazakh Government, parliament, the opposition and the wider community."
"Kazakhstan is travelling the road from a Soviet republic to an independent and democratic state."
"Our task is to help keep them firmly on that road."
"They have our sympathy and support in tackling the many problems they face: pollutants, locusts and AIDS, to name but three."
"We understand how far Kazakhstan has already travelled towards democracy and human rights."
"They understand our need to air concerns when they arise and when they are brought to us."
"To some extent, the tabling of this motion has already brought some answers."
"The ombudsman system, for example, could be expanded."
"Perhaps the European Union could help them do just that."
"But at least it is the first ombudsman system in a CIS country."
"Religious minorities were targeted by the government, but I am pleased to hear now that has been vetoed by the president."
"Mr Duvanov's trial was closed to the public."
"That is not entirely satisfactory."
"The US and Dutch embassies may have been represented but why were not the Kazakh human rights groups?"
"The Council of Opposition Parties has now been established, although one of the main opposition parties is not represented on it."
"We need to know more about the 19 January presidential law that was brought in on political parties."
"It inhibits the ability of some opposition movements to operate legally in the country."
"Kazakhstan must not slip on its road."
"We are watching, listening and supporting."
"The concerns that we have in this motion for a resolution need to be tabled."
"We need to ask Parliament's Central Asian Delegation to put these on our agenda for the PCA discussions we shall shortly be having with the representatives of Kazakhstan, and then report back to Parliament."
"Mr President, over the past years, democratic conditions in most of the countries of Central Asia have deteriorated."
"However, the Commission understands why the focus of Parliament's attention in this debate is on Kazakhstan."
"Once considered one of the 'hopefuls' in the region, the past two years have seen a crackdown on political opposition and critical media."
"Especially hard hit were those who had the courage to criticise corruption at the highest level, involving the President and his family."
"The Commission agrees that the court cases on corruption charges against Mr Ablyazov and Mr Zhakianov, the two leaders of the opposition movement Democratic Choice for Kazakhstan, had every appearance of being politically motivated."
"The Commission has furthermore viewed with great concern the campaign of intimidation that has been going on against a great number of critical media in Kazakhstan."
"This has included the firebombing of offices, the vandalising of transmitter equipment with a machine gun, a decapitated dog nailed to a newspaper office door and physical attacks against individual journalists."
"The perpetrators of these crimes have never been apprehended, and many cases have simply been closed."
"A number of newspapers, furthermore, have been subject to judicial proceedings, endless tax and safety inspector visits and heavy fines, in a number of cases resulting in closure."
"The Commission also agrees that the recent court case against Mr Duvanov on rape charges was marred by grave irregularities."
"We therefore strongly believe that the trial should be reviewed."
"It is against this background that President Nazarbaev's recent statements that Kazakhstan will seek its own pace of democratisation - to be achieved by 2030 - and that western standards should not be automatically applied to Kazakhstan, are to be met with due caution."
"President Prodi underlined our deep concern over Kazakhstan's recent democratic record during the President's visit to Brussels on 29 November 2002."
"On the other hand, it is important to take a number of positive developments in Kazakhstan into consideration as well."
"Prisons have been transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Justice, and we hope that pre-trial detention facilities will soon follow."
"A law on the humanisation of prison conditions has been passed and a serious effort seems to be being made to implement prison reform."
"Kazakhstan, as well as other countries in Central Asia, has also established the post of Human Rights Ombudsman, although much remains to be done in terms of strengthening their mandates and facilities."
"A 'Standing Council' for further democratisation and development in civil society was approved by Presidential Decree on 29 December 2002."
"It is to be hoped that its recommendations, for example those on the Law on Political Parties, will be followed up."
"The Commission notes that Parliament's resolution focuses on Kazakhstan only."
"The Commission believes, however, that the matter of human rights in Kazakhstan is to be viewed in its regional context."
"It cannot be denied that there has been a crackdown on non-governmental media and opposition in Kazakhstan."
"But the Commission does not believe that the state of democracy and human rights in Kazakhstan - nor, for that matter, in Kyrgyzstan or Tajikistan - is beyond repair."
"We believe that the EU can continue to have an impact on democratic conditions in these countries through critical but constructive dialogue under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements."
"We have deeper concerns regarding Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, on which Parliament's resolution remains silent."
"Uzbekistan has no independent press, whereas Turkmenistan has no press at all worthy of the name."
"Opposition parties do not exist in these two countries."
"Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have been under the close scrutiny of human rights watchdogs for some time now because of the deterioration in democratic conditions."
"This scrutiny has certainly been justified."
"But let us not forget that in Uzbekistan, and certainly in Turkmenistan, for years there has been no democracy at all left to deteriorate."
"In these countries, any opposition activist, critical journalist or simply any Muslim practising his belief, risks ending up in a torture chamber, a penal colony or on death row on charges of terrorism, religious extremism or an attempt on the life of the President."
"Opposition and civil society in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and, to an extent, Tajikistan, are under pressure, but this has, at least so far, not made them less resilient or vocal."
"Through constructive dialogue and targeted support, the EU can still make a difference in these countries."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolutions on Venezuela:"
"B5-0134/2003, by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and Mr Fernández Martín, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Venezuela;"
"B5-0137/2003, by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Venezuela;"
"B5-0141/2003, by Mr Van den Berg and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Venezuela;"
"B5-0146/2003, by Mrs Frassoni and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Venezuela;"
"B5-0149/2003, by Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and others, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Venezuela;"
"B5-0153/2003, by Mr Queiró and Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Venezuela."
"Mr President, for some time now, the European Parliament has been monitoring the situation in Venezuela with interest."
"I should like very specifically to draw attention to the delegation of MEPs that visited the country to assess the damage produced by the floods in the state of Vargas."
"When it returned, this delegation drew up a resolution and mobilised considerable financial resources in order to express the EU's solidarity with those affected."
"This Parliament's most recent official delegation to Venezuela detected the possible risk of an anti-democratic trend whose most important manifestation was the cancellation of the Venezuelan parliamentarians' mandate before the Latin American Parliament."
"Today, the country is undergoing a political, economic and social crisis that has produced many victims, as did similar crises this weekend in Colombia and, in the past, in Bolivia."
"Moreover, this is actually contrary to Venezuela's peaceful traditions."
"That is why I believe that the European Union in general and our Parliament in particular have to support the efforts of the Organisation of American States and of the 'Group of Friends' to try to bring about a situation in which the country is in some way able once again to feel the beat of economic and social development and to embark upon the path of stability, democratic consolidation and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms."
"The European Commission must, however, help us in this task and, of course, the measures taken the day before yesterday by the Commission to limit and modify the system of generalised Community preferences are not going to be of much help in handling the situations being experienced by Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela."
"I believe that this Parliament must respond and lose no time in setting out its priorities for helping these countries, which are subject to many threats."
"In the case of Venezuela, moreover, we have to obtain a peaceful, negotiated and democratic solution, given the grave situation being experienced by that country."
"Mr President, the political situation in Venezuela warrants the greatest possible interest and attention from the European Union."
"My group condemns the instigators of the coup of 11 April who irresponsibly attempted to overthrow the country's democratic, legitimate constitutional institutions."
"Most of all, we condemn the Council of the European Union's complicity with the instigators of the coup at the time."
"We have not yet forgotten that the Presidency of the Union immediately sent a message of support to the instigators of the coup, a black day for European diplomacy."
"It is important to respect the Venezuelan Constitution, which was drawn up by a democratically elected assembly and equally democratically ratified by a huge majority by the Venezuelan citizens."
"Indeed, the anti-governmental action against the government instigated by the part of the opposition known as the Democratic Coordinator lies completely outside the framework of the Venezuelan Constitution and, moreover, only served the economic and commercial interests of forces outside Venezuela which had no hesitation in reducing the entire country to poverty in order to continue to enjoy privileges and pursue specific goals."
"This does not, of course, mean that we blindly support all the actions of the legitimate Venezuelan Government."
"We support the moderating action of the Mesa de negociaciones y acuerdos working in Venezuela and we support the mediating work of the Carter Foundation, based on respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, which has several times been expressed democratically."
"It is important to remember that President Chavez has, on a number of occasions, declared that he is willing to respect the provisions of the Venezuelan Constitution and to submit to public consultation half way through his mandate."
"Respecting the political experiment in Venezuela means respecting the dignity of a people that has decided to take its fate into its own hands."
"We too have a responsibility to further this process and to ensure that the complexity of the situation in Latin America, not least, does not become such as to constantly jeopardise the autonomy of its people."
"That is another reason why our group calls for the motion for a resolution we have drawn up together to be adopted without amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Venezuela is an Andean Pact country which has a broad democratic tradition, has demonstrated generosity throughout its recent history and has experienced the advent of many new citizens in search of a better life who have made efforts to contribute to a prosperous Venezuela."
"This is a Venezuela that, in the past year, has experienced two completely new events in its domestic life that, in institutional, political, economic and social terms, have changed the ways in which the country can be governed."
"Firstly, there was a mini coup d'état on 11 April to oust President Chavez, who had been elected in 1998 in accordance with the Venezuelan constitution."
"Secondly, there was a civil strike, initiated at the beginning of December, which constituted a significant breach of the social fabric."
"Nor ought the issue of oil to be forgotten."
"Given this scenario of socio-political confrontation and crisis, government and opposition have turned to the international community in search of support in finding a negotiated democratic solution."
"To that extent, the European Union cannot remain on the margins because, over and above the response of democratic solidarity it needs to offer in the light of this serious problem facing Venezuela, it must take account of the fact that hundreds of thousands, not to say millions, of citizens of EU Member States reside there."
"That is why I think it right for this Parliament to get involved and actively help Venezuela to emerge from the crisis it is experiencing while, of course, respecting its sovereignty and independence."
"To that extent, I should be grateful if we were all to support the motion for a resolution."
"I should also like, however, to see support for the amendment tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, asking for the European emigrants living in Venezuela not to be forgotten."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to begin by thanking the previous speaker for his words because this is actually a point that we consider to be extremely important in this context."
"We in Portugal have been extremely sad and distressed to see what is happening to Venezuela; a country that is a friend of ours, where hundreds of thousands of Portuguese citizens live, especially from Madeira."
"The ties that bind us to the Venezuelan people and State run very deep."
"It distresses us to see the destruction of what was one of the most solid democracies and one of the most prosperous, stable and peaceful societies in Latin America."
"The unfortunate mandate of President Chavez, who it is true, was elected, bears enormous responsibility."
"It appears that he wanted to pursue a policy of inflaming Latin America, which is what unfortunately happened a few decades ago, with terrible consequences, including the violence that still besets so many Latin American countries that are friends of ours."
"We therefore support this resolution, but would like to make some clarifications, not only on the amendment we tabled, but also on a split vote that we requested."
"We believe that our role is to encourage moderation, dialogue, the progress of democracy and respect for human rights."
"Our expression of respect for the Constitution, as included in the text, could be used improperly in Venezuela by one of the parties involved."
"We are, of course, in favour of respect for the democratic Constitution, but we know that with regard to the issues concerning Venezuela currently being discussed, this is an argument that President Chavez has used improperly to block or to attempt to block the course of democracy in his country."
"Consequently, if we use the argument improperly in this context, we could be sending out the wrong signal."
"This is why we have requested a split vote for which we would also ask the Chamber's support."
"Mr President, the crisis in Venezuela's two-party regime led to a solution's being sought in terms of what we might call the populist panacea."
"What had happened is that, after 40 years of relative political stability, the two-party regime had been discredited as a result of accusations of corruption and malfunctioning of the democratic institutions."
"The solution took the form of a regime that, to most intents and purposes, was plebiscitary in character, with a new constitution and with a president possessing considerable popular support but in which the democratic institutions did not operate properly."
"In actual fact, this is not a phenomenon exclusive to Latin America."
"In Europe, too, there is a certain tendency at the present time to look for solutions in this type of populism, involving the discrediting of parliamentary and representative institutions."
"I believe that we can say, like Winston Churchill, that 'parliamentary democracy is the worst political system ? except for all the others', and I think that the Venezuelans will now have to reflect upon the new type of constitution they want."
"It is not, however, for us to tell the Venezuelans what to do."
"The motion for a resolution is not designed to recommend one course rather than another to the Venezuelans."
"It is the result of a compromise between various political forces, and that is why we, at this time, are rejecting the proposals for split votes on some aspects of the resolution tabled by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, even though we do in fact support his amendment about acknowledging the situation of immigrants."
"What would be required would be for the European Parliament, together with other Community institutions, to intervene to help create a climate of understanding between the Venezuelans themselves."
"This Parliament already has experience of intervening in crises, for example in Central America - more specifically, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala - as well as in South America: more specifically, Chile and Paraguay."
"Such an intervention, made in conjunction with parliamentarians from Latin America, could be useful in creating this climate of confidence required by Venezuela if it is to function properly."
"Mr President, the situation in Venezuela continues to give great cause for concern, at precisely the time when the election of President Lula da Silva and President Gutiérrez is raising great hopes of democratisation and recovery for the continent."
"We hoped never again to have to discuss attempted coups d'Etat or situations in which the democratic institutions might be overturned."
"Moreover, we would point out that the same President Chavez who is now under threat and was in danger from a coup d'Etat in April 2002 had himself attempted a coup d'Etat."
"It is clear, therefore, that these types of methods have, in any case, not yet been completely eradicated from the continent."
"In our opinion, the worst is now passed."
"We welcome this fact and we therefore support the resolution to this effect."
"We welcome the increasing attempts at dialogue which are taking shape and we are also convinced that the international role, the positive role being played by the Group of Friends and the Organisation of American States, is certainly a positive innovation in Latin America, where mediation in internal affairs is by no means the norm."
"We also feel that the crisis in this country, consisting principally of the strikes and boycotting in the oil sector, has led to destabilisation which is not entirely coincidental."
"I wonder what the European Union can do in this regard and I fully endorse what Mr Salafranca has just said."
"Mr President, if I am not mistaken all of those who have drafted motions or spoken in this debate so far are from the Romance part of Europe."
"This shows the particular solidarity that they feel, but I actually also want to make it clear that this problem of Venezuela concerns all Europeans to at least some degree."
"Venezuela is a country that plays a significant role, and not only in economic terms thanks to its raw materials, oil and many other natural resources."
"It is a country that has made a very considerable contribution to the political stability of the Andean region over a very long period of time."
"That is why I welcome the efforts that Europe is making to help this country to recover its internal stability by intervening here."
"I should particularly like to thank Mr Salafranca and others for being so ready to take on this task time and time again, and I believe that there are two points in this motion that are very significant."
"Firstly, emphasis is placed on the role of the Friends of Venezuela, this group of countries that is making a particular effort to offer mediation here."
"Two countries in the European Union, namely Spain and Portugal, belong to this group and have a special responsibility here, which they are responding to magnificently."
"I should like to thank them for this and say that the European Union hopes that Spain and Portugal really can play a pivotal and positive role here, and I am convinced that they will do so."
"Secondly, the motion stresses how important it is for the European Parliament itself to have a presence on the spot."
"I should like to underline this request and say that the European Parliament certainly does not want to interfere in politics the world over, but it does wish to offer good mediation services wherever a reasonably well-functioning democracy is in danger because it is under threat from populism on the one hand and fear and uncertainty on the other."
"The various different political forces need to be brought together around one table, because only by strengthening the rule of law, only by strengthening the institutions, but also only by strengthening pluralism in this troubled country will we once again be able to avoid a serious crisis there, and the lasting damage that this would do to that country and the region as a whole."
"As I said, I would therefore appeal for the European Parliament's offer to act as a mediator to be accepted."
"I do not mean that we want to go around telling other nations what to do."
"We do not have the right to do that, but we do have the duty to make our good offices available and to act as mediators."
"Mr President, the worst thing about this situation in Venezuela is that the two sides have stopped talking to each other."
"Their inability to enter into a dialogue is causing society, and even the State itself to fragment, leaving behind a vacuum that other undemocratic groups are only too eager to fill."
"At this stage I should therefore like to draw your attention to the fact that an initiative has emerged from the Latin American Parliament and the European Parliament to form a joint group, to establish a dialogue with Members of Parliament on both sides in Venezuela and in this way also to support the efforts of the Group of Friends of Venezuela to bring the two sides together."
"I hope that it will eventually be possible for us to build this bridge."
"Incidentally, I suspect that given the current crisis in Iraq, the longer this conflict lasts the more likely it is that the oil involved will lead the United States to call for action to be taken."
"The fact that well over 10% of America's oil comes from Venezuela is not without its consequences for them, or for the other countries of Latin America either, because rises in the price of oil are due, at least in part, to the situation in Venezuela."
"The man in the street in the countries of Latin America is the one who will pay."
"Apart from getting the two sides talking, what else is to be done?"
"I think that sooner or later we will have no alternative but to let the people decide."
"Here, though, I think it is important to keep the constitution as a basis, because despite all of its shortcomings the validity of this constitution has not been contested."
"Latin America's reputation for not respecting constitutions goes before it."
"This is all the more reason for us to ensure that where a constitution is actually recognised at international level, we do stick to it."
"If it is to be amended then it should be with the agreement of both sides to perhaps enable elections to be held at an early stage."
"But as I see it the only way out seems to be for the people to decide, and no one else!"
"Mr President, on behalf of the Communist Party of Greece, I welcome the victory of the people of Venezuela against the local and foreign forces undermining their democracy and constitution."
"A year after the failed American-backed coup, which was tacitly tolerated by the European Union and openly supported by Spain, which then had the presidency, the enemies of progress, democracy and social justice have again tried to overthrow President Chavez and the constitutional order."
"However, all the striking businessmen managed to do was to cripple the country's economy before retreating in disarray."
"The days of imperialists setting up dictators everywhere are over."
"The people of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, of Latin America as a whole, are stepping up their fight for democracy and social change and we offer them our solidarity and undivided support."
"the Commission remains deeply concerned about the current crisis in Venezuela and has emphasised the need for a democratic and peaceful solution through dialogue and with due respect for the constitution of Venezuela, human rights and democratic values."
"The EU fully supports the OAS, together with the UNDP and the Carter Centre in the tripartite working group, in their efforts to facilitate a national dialogue between the government and the opposition."
"The Commission has welcomed the creation of the Group of Friends of Venezuela (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and the US) and hopes that it will contribute to the OAS efforts to find a solution to the current crisis."
"The Commission considers that former US President Carter's proposal - suggesting, alternatively, a constitutional amendment that would lead to early elections or revocatory referendum on President Chávez's rule on 19 August - is a good basis for the negotiations between both parties."
"The Commission has approved a project to assist the OAS in its efforts to implement possible agreements reached between the parties of the OAS mediated dialogue."
"In addition to facilitating the ongoing dialogue, it has three main components: support for free and fair elections; investigation of the events of April 2002; and disarming the civilian population."
"The three components are included in the agenda of the 'Negotiating Table'."
"In addition, the Commission hopes that the freedom of expression of the media, used in a responsible way, could help overcome the current climate of verbal confrontation in Venezuela."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place shortly, when we have concluded the debates."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions on human rights in Zimbabwe:"
"?5-0112/2003 by Mr Van Orden, Mr Corrie, Mr Deva, Mrs Foster, Mr Parish, Mr Tannock, Mrs Banotti, Mr Gahler, Mrs Korhola, Mr Lehne, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Posselt and Mr Sacrédeus, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"?5-0138/2003 by Mr Sylla, Mr Cossutta and Mr Miranda, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on Zimbabwe;"
"?5-0142/2003 by Mrs Kinnock and Mr van den Berg, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe;"
"?5-0145/2003 by Mrs Maes, Mr Rod, Mrs Lucas, Mr Lannoye, Mrs Schörling and Mrs Isler Béguin, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe;"
"?5-0148/2003 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the human rights situation in Zimbabwe;"
"?5-0151/2003 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the situation in Zimbabwe."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of my friend, Mr Van Orden, and the British Conservatives."
"I also speak on behalf of the oppressed people of Zimbabwe who are crying out for justice."
"Yet again we find ourselves having to discuss Zimbabwe."
"Why, one might ask, are we doing so now?"
"The situation in Zimbabwe has gone from bad to worse, with enforced starvation and continuing human rights abuses and political oppression."
"However, the most urgent issue at this moment relates to action to be taken by the EU itself."
"It is unbelievable that there was a need for a lengthy Council discussion on the renewal of sanctions, which must take effect by 18 February."
"Who would believe that their renewal would depend upon the Council's agreement to Mugabe visiting Paris!"
"Mugabe is the prime instigator of the oppression and misery of the Zimbabwean people and the supposed main target of EU action."
"The problem with EU sanctions has been their lack of rigorous enforcement."
"Now the plan is to allow Mugabe and his entourage to travel to Paris."
"No wonder that the EU is not taken seriously."
"After all, we should not be trying to find ways of helping Mugabe to evade our own sanctions."
"Instead we should be trying to make sanctions more effective."
"If anything, they need to be widened in their scope!"
"We should not be surprised if African leaders are half-hearted in their support for international measures when the EU is seen to lack resolve."
"The EU's weakness is in marked contrast to the brave stand taken by the Zimbabwean cricketers, Henry Olonga and Andy Flower."
"Prior to taking the field for Zimbabwe's opening match of the World Cricket Cup, they said: 'we cannot in good conscience take to the field and ignore the fact that millions of our compatriots are (...) oppressed. (...) we are making a silent plea to those responsible to stop the abuse of human rights in Zimbabwe."
"In so doing, we pray that our small action may help restore sanity and dignity to our nation.'"
"They have put their lives and their livelihoods at risk by their courage."
"They deserve all the support we can give to them and to the suffering people of Zimbabwe."
"I call upon Members to support the resolution without amendment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is an example of exactly what we must not do."
"What Mr Deva has just said is the opposite of what must be done in this type of case."
"I think, on the contrary, that we have made a serious mistake."
"Recognising human rights abuses in Zimbabwe is one thing, but assisting the opposition and doing all we can to establish a democracy is quite another."
"Lastly, the increase in sanctions proposed by Mr Deva is inappropriate in a country riddled with famine and pandemics, because these sanctions will not affect Mr Mugabe, but the people."
"I still believe that our serious mistake was precisely cancelling the sitting of the equal ACP-European Union assembly."
"When Belgium grants a visa to nationals of a country, when the delegates concerned are present, when others then have the right to take part in a meeting and when we unilaterally and dictatorially refuse them access to this building, we deprive ourselves of the possibility for Africans and Europeans to adopt together a resolution that condemns what is happening in Zimbabwe."
"Instead of that, we have strengthened all those who support Mr Mugabe."
"We have provided him with superb publicity."
"What is not responsible is for you to say that France has no right to prohibit a man from taking part in a Franco-African summit in which he is involved, precisely because that would enable us to tell him what we think face to face."
"If we want lasting peace in this region, if we do not want discrimination and violence against the poorest to become even more widespread in these countries, we need to involve the regional organisations, and in particular the African Union, in our action."
"In order to do that, we need to sit down with them and hold discussions with them."
"What you are doing here is forgetting the colonial past of a country in which there is certainly violence today against white farmers, but which is currently also paying the cost, it should be recognised, of that colonial past where, for many years, the vast majority of the black population did not have access to land, whereas today the country is the subject of agricultural reform."
"We cannot, therefore, solve the problems by trying to attack Mr Mugabe, but by sitting down together around a table, and I completely disagree with you and your method."
"Mr President, there has been a little confusion."
"Mr Sylla was not one of the authors of the resolution."
"He is opposing the resolution."
"I do not know how that mistake was made."
"We in the PSE Group are supporting the resolution and will be opposing the amendment from Mr Posselt, because it waters down the criticism of Mr Mugabe."
"Zimbabwe is no longer a democratic country."
"Parliamentary, presidential and all local elections recently have been characterised by intimidation, repression, voting fraud and state-sponsored political violence."
"We have a situation where over 7 million Zimbabweans - over half the population - are on the brink of starvation."
"If you want government-controlled food, you are required to have a ZANU-PF membership card."
"Unemployment is running at 70%, inflation is at over 100% and 50% of the land is no longer being farmed."
"We also have the usual African problem of AIDS."
"Parliament has consistently called for a widening and rigorous enforcement of sanctions, as well as other measures, to make international action against the Mugabe regime more effective."
"This resolution condemns the lack of coherence in EU policy and calls on the Council and governments of the Member States not to seek exemptions from the EU's own sanction regime, which can be misread."
"Sanctions against the Mugabe regime should continue without interruption and without exemption."
"The charges against the opposition, against Morgan Tsvangirai, are spurious and unsubstantiated."
"We want to extend the existing sanctions to make them stronger and more effective."
"We want the Council and Commission to provide more information on the freezing of the bank accounts of those subject to sanctions."
"We want wider sanctions against the Zimbabwean regime, including an international sports and culture boycott. That would not increase the suffering of the population of Zimbabwe."
"We praise the courage of the Zimbabwean cricketers - Andy Flower and Henry Olonga - for wearing those black armbands to symbolise the lack of democracy and human rights in Zimbabwe."
"We support the belated stance of the England cricket team which has now refused to play in Zimbabwe."
"It is time for further action to be taken and for the sanctions to be strengthened and reinforced."
"Mr President, let me say, for the sake of precision, that I am not one of the authors of the joint resolution, I am an author of one resolution."
"The resolution we submitted was intended to vigorously denounce the human rights situation in Zimbabwe and specifically to emphasise the risk to which an unfair trial, exposes Mr Tsvangirai, the man who, under normal circumstances, would have been president of his country if the elections had not been tampered with."
"Nonetheless, I cannot use my remaining seconds to denounce the human rights situation even further, because our Parliament prefers to repeat everything again and to place the emphasis on tightening sanctions again, while all the Member States of the European Union, including Britain, keep on invoking Article 3, paragraph 3 of which states that exceptions should be made for international meetings that have to be accommodated."
"In the way it applies this article and paragraph 3, the European Union has once again decided that Mugabe should come to Paris for the summit next week to speak on the human rights situation that is on the agenda there."
"How in God's name can we get out of this ambiguous situation?"
"This matter is once again dividing us, even though together we want to condemn the sanctions."
"We cannot, however, have a situation where we in the European Parliament systematically want more sanctions than any of the Member States to which we belong, if the whole Council, which is again, incidentally, absent, does not intervene and does not opt for an unambiguous solution."
"My group resolutely argues in favour of maintaining the dialogue, and of promulgating sanctions that can be imposed, but not of invoking sanctions that rule out any dialogue."
"We have just heard how things are in Venezuela, where there is no dialogue."
"They are asking for a dialogue there; in this case a dialogue is actually necessary!"
"There are many paragraphs in our resolution that we would like to see approved."
"It follows, though, that you should not expect heroism from countries whose economies are so strongly intermeshed with that of Zimbabwe, which is bigger than that of our own European Member States, who do not even have the courage to get together to ask a UN representative to investigate the human rights situation in situ in Zimbabwe."
"We will therefore be voting against several of these paragraphs, and we will also not be able to approve the resolution in its entirety, but we will be continuing to fight the same fight in favour of human rights and against this pernicious regime."
"Mr President, there will never be a European foreign policy as long as Member States continue to follow their own agenda."
"Not even a Convention will help bring one about."
"The European Union is not even capable of pursuing a consistent, vigorous, clear policy with regard to Zimbabwe."
"The scandalous human rights situation, political repression, the economic decline and starvation ultimately count for less than French interests in Africa."
"We must not forget that our severe sanctions are the only alternative to punishments that affect the population."
"The people of Zimbabwe are already suffering far too much."
"Yet France is riding roughshod over the agreements by inviting Mugabe, and in doing so is putting the credibility of the European Union on the line."
"It now looks as if the Council is intending to relax the sanctions by introducing exception provisions."
"The opposite is, however, urgently needed."
"Rather than being interrupted, the sanctions against the regime must be extended and intensified, with absolutely no visas at all for Mr Mugabe and his henchmen, and with cricket teams who want to play in Zimbabwe being declared all out before they even start."
"Fortunately our Parliament is consistent, or at least most of the parties are, and we must keep it that way."
"If Europe is not consistent, how can we expect African countries to be?"
"It is most unfortunate that South Africa and Nigeria seem to be standing up for Mugabe and want the Commonwealth's sanctions to be lifted."
"Free, honest elections are needed soon."
"Show trials against opposition leaders must be stopped immediately, and the United Nations must appoint a special human rights rapporteur."
"Only unconditional actions against the regime can release the people from their suffering."
"The starving, terrorised victims of the former resistance hero must be able to count on our support."
"It is time Member States put their own commercial agendas aside and pulled out all the stops for human rights on a European level."
"State terrorism combined with corruption and drought are converging to create a national catastrophe."
"The situation in Zimbabwe once again calls for an urgent debate."
"Some 7.2 million Zimbabweans, more than half the population, are living on the brink of starvation."
"The shocking aspect in all of this is the fact that the government is abusing the distribution of food as a weapon in its fight against its political opponents."
"Fear currently prevails in the country."
"As the economic crisis worsens, government repression is plumbing new depths."
"Increasing numbers of cases of torture are being reported, including such things as the administration of electric shocks, poisoning and rape."
"Being a supporter of the MDC is in itself life-threatening."
"This is true of its leaders even more than of its sympathisers."
"Morgan Tsvangirai, Welshman Ncube and Renson Gasela were recently accused of high treason for spurious reasons."
"Against this sinister background, it is absolutely shocking that France has now invited this dictator to the Franco-African Summit conference in Paris."
"The excuse that the summit starts on 19 February while the sanctions were originally in force until 18 February sounds lame."
"On the basis of paragraph 12, therefore, I vigorously condemn this unilateral element in French policy."
"It is not, at the moment, the only one."
"Finally I would like to endorse the agreement that has at last been reached within the European Union on the extension of the sanctions by 12 months, but not without putting on record my protest against the French approach."
"I call on the Council and Commission to unanimously implement the renewed sanctions in full without tolerating any opt outs."
"Mr President, I might inform you that purely coincidentally the German Parliament is also debating Zimbabwe at this very hour today and I believe that, from a political point of view, it is important for us not only to discuss this issue here in the European Parliament - or perhaps also, for historical reasons, in London - but also in other parliaments in Europe, so as to raise public awareness of the situation."
"Regrettably, it is necessary to extend the sanctions imposed on the Mugabe regime."
"The use of democratic means has, unfortunately, not enabled the people there to rid themselves of a potentate who bears more responsibility than anyone else for the decline of the country in economic, social and political terms and also in respect of human rights."
"I have to take issue with what Mr Sylla said."
"The sanctions that we introduced do not actually affect the general public."
"The only people that are hit by them are those who in any case have the money to travel."
"But when, for example, the 'propaganda minister', Mr Moyo, went to South Africa on a shopping spree over Christmas, it caused a public outcry in that democratic society too that someone so close to the regime should be behaving in this way."
"I very much regret the fact that the discussions about extending the sanctions degenerated into political horse-trading, because France would only agree to the extension if Mr Mugabe was allowed to come to Paris for the Franco-African summit."
"I do not like to criticise a government whose political views are so close to my own, but in this case I would urge the French Government to consider whether it is in the interests of Africans to engage in African politics in this way."
"Unfortunately, in previous decades for many European countries one single criterion has been decisive in determining whether they have got involved in African politics: whether it served their own economic interests."
"The result is clear to see in countries such as Côte d'Ivoire and Congo."
"On the contrary, it is important for Europe to present a united front."
"I therefore welcome the fact that Portugal would rather postpone the EU-Africa summit than allow President Mugabe to travel here."
"Moreover, at the 59th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Europeans must carry out early consultations so as to ensure that any draft resolution on Zimbabwe does not fail to go through, as happened last year, but that it is removed from the agenda beforehand."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time I have spoken about the enduring and unhappy saga of Zimbabwe and its dictator Robert Mugabe."
"Our position has not changed: we strongly condemn Mr Mugabe's regime, the extremely violent, ongoing and shameful breaches of human rights, the way in which he is destroying his own country and condemning his people to poverty."
"This is intolerable and our condemnation is unswerving."
"I would simply say, however, that we must now act intelligently."
"A policy of sanctions has been in place for a year now."
"It is too early to tell whether the outcome of this policy will be positive or negative, but whatever the outcome is, we all know what has been going on."
"We also know that these policies of sanctions always require a process to be in place."
"The question in my mind is this: given the difficulties that have arisen and that we ourselves have felt, with the suspension of the Joint ACP-European Union Assembly, which have also been felt in the Commonwealth, and which are also currently dividing Europe, would it not be better to act somewhat more intelligently?"
"I wish to propose an alternative plan, even though I have seen that a majority in this House has already been achieved!"
"Why do we not adopt a three-month moratorium, at the end of which, if Robert Mugabe's regime has not adopted serious measures to respect human rights, we would then decree a truly unanimous system of sanctions?"
"In the meantime, we could explore opportunities for EU-Africa dialogue, once again pulling the carpet out from under the feet of Mr Mugabe, rather than giving his propaganda sustenance ..."
"Furthermore, we should launch a massive movement of positive solidarity towards Morgan Tsvangirai, who is being unjustly and seriously persecuted in his country."
"We in this House have the ability to do this and to mobilise European public opinion."
"Mr Tsvangirai has, as you know, already been nominated twice for the Sakharov Prize, which Parliament awards each year."
"Launching a massive movement of support for Morgan Tsvangirai to receive the Sakharov Prize at the end of this year would be much more effective than any policy of sanctions."
"The Commission closely follows the human rights situation in Zimbabwe."
"It is aware that the conditions remain volatile and is deeply concerned regarding the increased incidence of politically motivated violence observed recently."
"In view of the gravity of the situation, the Commission proposed to the Council the extension of the measures against Zimbabwe under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, which were adopted in February last year."
"These measures redirect funds to social sectors and to areas which benefit directly the population."
"This is for a renewable period of one year."
"The Commission agrees with the Presidency's proposal for a new common position amending and extending sanctions, such as the visa ban and freeze of assets against Zimbabwe, for the same additional period of one year."
"The Commission is informed that approximately EUR 770 000 have been frozen in accounts in Member States or their dependent territories in accordance with the Council's position."
"Community assistance continues to contribute to projects which directly support the population in the field of democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law; the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights includes Zimbabwe as a focal country."
"The Commission is particularly concerned about the food crisis in Zimbabwe and has been very actively involved in responding to the situation."
"Between April and December 2002, we committed about EUR 80 million in emergency aid and humanitarian aid."
"The Commission believes that all avenues for dialogue should be explored to improve the situation in Zimbabwe."
"We will support any peer pressure that the international community, and the heads of state in Africa in particular, may put on the Zimbabwean Government in the area of respect for the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement: human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"The next item is the vote on the crisis in the steel sector"
". (FR) On behalf of us all, Mrs Laguiller expressed opposition in her speech to the business closures and redundancies planned by Arcelor."
"The only way to prevent finance groups from acting is to prohibit mass redundancies and guarantee workers' salaries by taking funds from profits."
"The compromise text, which is limited to a few protectionist measures and additional regulations which employers will not observe in any case, does not propose any practical measures for the protection of workers."
"It is therefore out of the question for us to sanction this text."
"The only reason we did not vote against it is because it proposes a few additional prerogatives for trade unions and we did not wish to oppose these."
"Redundancies, however, are not more justified simply because the trade unions have been consulted."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned"
"We Swedish Social Democrats chose to vote against quite a number of the amendments in the report concerning monitoring of forests and environmental interactions in the Community (Forest Focus)."
"We are very hesitant about giving Community policy a larger role when it comes to forests."
"We believe that the basic conditions within the EU vary so much that it is questionable what added value such a Community policy would bring."
"On the basis of that approach, we chose to vote against those items concerned with incorporating the prevention of forest fires into the regulation."
"The risk is that, in the interests of monitoring, this would divert a lot of resources from other areas."
"What is more, fire prevention measures are already a part of the EU Regulation on Rural Development."
"In the final vote, we chose, in spite of our hesitations, to vote in favour of the report."
"We did so in view of the fact that Parliament had included important wordings concerning the principle of subsidiarity and the importance of the Member States' participating in the work on developing this regulation."
". Whatever some in this Parliament may say or wish, the European Union has absolutely no legal competence on the subject of abortion."
"Each person has the right to their own views, and I do not deny that different ethical frameworks exist in different Member States."
"This is not the issue."
"The issue is where and how the European Union has a legal right to act."
"In this respect, the report proposes an outrageous abuse of power and competence by the Union."
"To legislate that EU monies could be used for the purposes of providing any type of abortion service would be an attack on the sovereignty of Member States' rights to legislate on the matter."
"As an Irish Member of Parliament, I cannot support such a monstrous violation of the constitutional right of the people I represent to decide policy with regard to abortion."
"This is a right which is enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and one which I will defend vigorously and unequivocally."
"Equally, it is wrong to attempt to impose abortion on countries that do not want it, and it is an error to give the signal that this Parliament would only support countries that facilitate abortion, which is not correct."
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 13 February 2003."
"Mr President, since submitting that request to you I now speak not just on behalf of the 36 Members but on behalf of my group."
"I wish to draw the House's attention to reports which have appeared in the Belgian, German and UK newspapers this weekend which relate to quite serious allegations that the European Parliament and also Members of the Commission may have been misled in relation to elements of the evidence in the Andreasen affair."
"This arises in the context of a report apparently commissioned by Commissioner Kinnock prior to suspending the Commission accountant."
"Both the press and Commission sources have extensively quoted from this report."
"It is essential that the report is published in full forthwith so that the House has the full facts concerning this matter."
"It is important not just in the context of the whole Andreasen affair but also in the context of the budget discharge procedure which is to be undertaken during the next few weeks."
"The Commission cannot choose to engage in selective briefing of extracts from Commission papers and then claim general confidentiality in relation to those same documents in the context of the framework agreement."
"For that reason, I propose to the House that tomorrow at 5 p.m., when the Commission attends, the Commission should explain its position in relation to this document, which is allegedly a report from the head of internal audit making these serious allegations."
"That document should be published and this House should be in a position to form a view in relation to it."
"I therefore ask for the House's agreement to my proposal that the Commission is requested to come to this House at 5 p.m. tomorrow in order to deal with these serious allegations."
"Mr President, I thought the Loch Ness Monster appeared in summer, but it now seems, on this issue, that it appears throughout the year."
"This is the fifth or sixth occasion on which Parliament has not followed its Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Evans has quite rightly said that these issues must be dealt with within the discharge procedure and must be debated in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Therefore, my group believes that, when dealing with these issues, rather than taking advantage of certain leaks which have appeared on one weekend in the press of certain countries, of which I believe the majority of this House have no knowledge, and while I have every respect for the principle of freedom of expression, we must abide by our procedures and adhere to our Rules of Procedure, as well as respecting the Treaties and the specific institution of the Commission."
"Therefore, Mr President, we are opposed to this absolutely untimely proposal and we believe that Parliament should continue its work in accordance with the established procedures."
"Mr President, it is important that we, as a House, are not rushed into precipitate action by the activities of a few journalists."
"As I understand it, this supposed story relates to a memo dated 21 May 2002."
"The reform process has come a long way since then, under the watchful eye of our Committee on Budgetary Control, which Mr Kinnock will no doubt address on this issue."
"It seems to us that, taking into consideration the Casaca report which has dealt with many of these issues and the contributions to it, the matter is in fact being dealt with."
"I understand that the author of the memo referred to, Mr Muis, is due to attend the Committee on Budgetary Control meeting this week and I suggest that members of that committee ask him whether he would write the same kind of memo today as he wrote in May of last year."
"It would seem that the process has come a long way forward and this is probably a storm in a teacup."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we should be extremely careful."
"If the letter we have received today, or the memorandum, call it what you will, is correct, there are some genuine problems, some very serious problems."
"First of all, then, the competent committee will have to discuss these problems, and depending on what it then decides, Parliament will need to submit a proposal for a report, particularly since we are to hold a debate on the discharge procedure at the next Brussels part-session."
"I cannot see why we should debate an issue without first having discussed it within the competent committee and I really have had enough of dancing to the tune of journalists' so-called discoveries."
"Parliament is not at the beck and call of the media and Parliament must have its own rhythm of working, or we will end up putting any old thing on the agenda."
"Mr President, the fact is that it was only at the weekend that a note reached me; it dates back to last year and I am utterly astonished by it."
"The reason for my astonishment is that this note had not previously come to light following the many questions we had put to the Commission, particularly concerning the book-keeping and accounts, and because it is obviously not through the Commission that it has found its way to me."
"I do not know whether other Members have had a copy, and have not, as yet, had the chance to seek further information about this."
"For now, though, that is of secondary importance."
"What is important, though, is the fact - which I note with amazement - that the Director-General of internal audit is due to join us for the meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. today."
"I know nothing about this, though, and he has not even been invited."
"I have tried to reach him by phone in order to get some information about this note, but have not, for the moment, been able to do so, as he was in a meeting."
"Discharge will not, of course, be under discussion at this mini-conference - that will be dealt with in plenary in April - but this is, of course, vitally important right now."
"In eight days' time, the committee will have to vote on what we are going to do about giving discharge, and on what proposals we are going to put to plenary."
"This really does make it a matter of urgency that we should have information about this."
"I really do not know any more when I am meant to do this if we are to be able to deal with this properly in committee."
"Although we will, self-evidently, be discussing it this evening, it is already my view that we should know what is going on when such a thing lands on the table, and that we should discuss it among ourselves."
"Mr President, the situation is, in fact, very simple."
"Either the Security Council votes on Tuesday evening, or it votes on Wednesday, or it votes on Thursday."
"In other words, it either votes before us or after us."
"If it votes after us, I believe it is important for a vote to be held within the European Parliament asking the States represented on the Security Council to vote against the resolution proposed by the United Kingdom, Spain and the United States."
"In other words, I believe it is important for the representatives of public opinion and the European peoples to adopt a motion calling upon the States concerned to use their Security Council vote to reject the idea of war."
"(Speaking to Mr Panella who was trying to interrupt him: Oh, Mr Panella, really!"
"At least, you were alive in 1938 whereas I was not."
"That is the only difference and I shall put this way of thinking down to your age, because, otherwise, what you have just said is not very clever at all."
"Not very clever at all!)"
"If, however, the Security Council votes before we do, I think the European Parliament should adopt a position on this vote."
"In any case, therefore, as an expression of the European peoples, we should adopt a position on Wednesday on what is to be decided or what has been decided."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I always admire the commitment that the esteemed Mr Cohn-Bendit brings to what he has to say here, I have to ask that we stick to logic and bear in mind the way this issue has historically developed in this House."
"After all, Wednesday's debate, which will be a thorough one, will not be the first we have had on the terrible way the Iraq crisis is developing, and our group has always taken a stand in favour of action within the bounds set by the international community. I say this so that this may not be in doubt."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit, though, knows as well as any other Member of this House that we voted on this in December."
"There is now no occasion for us to have a new vote every time we meet here in order to introduce new emphases; on the contrary, Parliament's position is unambiguous, as is that of our Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, and I believe that the other groups - most of them, at any rate - want this House's position, once decided upon, to be binding, and for us not to have to make much ado about exchanging views every time."
"On Wednesday, everyone will have the opportunity to give an opinion, and I recommend that we do so with the gravity and seriousness of purpose that this crisis merits."
"That is why we oppose a new resolution."
"Mr President, we are in a particularly delicate situation because a minute can last forever and events are taking place which allow us to remain hopeful that the resolution approved by a majority of Parliament in January - not December - will remain valid."
"I am not going to speculate about what may happen in the Security Council."
"We have a debate with the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Papandreou, on Wednesday morning and I believe that, in these circumstances, Parliament is perfectly able to reconsider the issue of the resolution at this time."
"We still have time and this seems much more reasonable than adopting a closed position at the moment."
"Mr President, on behalf of the committee, I have asked that the vote on the resolution be postponed until the second part-session of March in Brussels."
"Since this is a complex and delicate issue, we are going to hold a debate in committee this afternoon, in an extraordinary meeting, and on Wednesday we will hold another, as a result of the Commission's statement."
"I believe, since we are dealing with an issue which, as I have said, is delicate and on which we have to act prudently, it is better to transfer the vote on the resolution to this month's part-session in Brussels, with the presentation, of course, of the corresponding amendments by the political groups."
"Mr President, I am sorry to rise to speak against my successor on an issue like this, but it seems to me that, just as we rightly ask the Committee on Budgetary Control to look at the allegations about the reform process that have been raised in some newspapers over the weekend, we should also ask the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs to look urgently at this matter."
"What is at stake here is the possibility of the Americans coming back to us with a request for access to databases on European airline passengers which would ride roughshod over our own data protection legislation and indeed could form a major intrusion into the civil liberties of European citizens."
"It seems to me that, if the House does not take a position this week, then we are impotent."
"We ought to be stressing very strongly our opposition to what the Americans are requesting and our opposition to any potential agreement by the Commission to such a request."
"Thank you, Mr President. In fact I would just like clarification on something."
"I am very pleased that we will be voting on this issue this week, because it is clear that information is already being passed on to the United States."
"We therefore urgently need this week to call a halt to this."
"I am not clear as to who is responsible here, however."
"Is it true that the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is getting down to it this evening?"
"I would welcome that very much, but in that case we would need to draw up a resolution this evening that would have to be put to the vote on Wednesday."
"I would definitely welcome that."
"The most important thing is to arrive at a resolution this week, and the second most important thing is to leave it in the hands of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"If we are unable to do so this evening, I would like to have an urgent additional meeting tomorrow to ensure that the specialist committee retains control of this matter."
"My understanding on the question of substance is that it was the preference of the groups that the committee should prepare the resolution."
"Unless there is an indication to the contrary, that remains so."
"The only issue concerns when it should be voted."
"The clear decision of the House is that it should be voted on Thursday of this week, as foreseen in the draft agenda."
"(The order of business was thus established)"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"Mr President, I should like to convey to you a message I received when I was in New York last week."
"I met a group called 'September 11 Families for Peaceful Tomorrows'."
"They are relatives of some of the victims of the 11 September atrocity and they asked me to convey to you and this House that they do not seek revenge."
"They do not want a war against Iraq in their name."
"They want a peaceful future for their children, the children of Iraq and the children of the world."
"They are looking to Europe for support and in view of that I would ask you to contact President Bush and the leaders of all the Member States that are members of the Security Council, to convey the very clear decision made by this Parliament some weeks ago that there is no basis for a unilateral or pre-emptive war and that the inspectors should be given adequate time to complete the peaceful disarmament of Iraq."
"I am happy to convey the views of the House to the American authorities, as I did to the Council some weeks ago."
"Mr President, I would like, on behalf of my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, to strongly criticise the disgraceful treatment of the dock workers earlier today in front of this building."
"We consider their protest to be legitimate and we support them."
"It should be pointed out that the aim of the proposal for a directive they are criticising is none other than to reduce salaries and, therefore, to authorise the recruitment of staff from outside the docks to do the work instead of them."
"This means the destruction of their status, their trade and their jobs, and we expect them to come to the European institutions bearing flowers!"
"I find this police control unacceptable!"
"We should listen to them, we should hear what they have to say and review the proposal for a directive accordingly."
"Mr President, I too have a complaint about police repression outside the building, but it relates to Members of this House and not to dock workers."
"I arrived from Basle in the bus, with a number of colleagues from various countries, to find the gates barred."
"There was no immediate security problem, there were no demonstrators in sight, but the French police refused us admittance to the building."
"When I sought to exert my right as a parliamentarian to enter the building, I was physically prevented from doing so and a rather unedifying shoving and shouting match took place."
"It is my understanding that for police from a Member State to obstruct parliamentarians in the course of carrying out their duties is contrary to the Treaties."
"It is certainly an affront to the dignity of this House."
"I should be grateful, therefore, if you would contact the appropriate authorities and make sure, firstly, that nothing like this ever happens again and, secondly, that the French police concerned are given appropriate retraining in the rights and responsibilities of parliamentarians."
"You will understand that I am not at all opposed to the liberalisation of port services, but I too would like to lodge my objection to the paranoid way in which the French army insists on protecting our parliament building against possible demonstrators at the moment."
"This is, after all, not a barracks or a military academy, this is a house of representatives, and parliamentarians are being refused access to their own Parliament in a particularly arrogant, insolent way by real machos."
"First they make you get out of the taxi or the car or the bus in the wrong place, and then when the taxi has gone, they tell you that you have to walk another 400 metres. There was not a single demonstrator to be seen anywhere nearby, only soldiers protecting a building and not the Members of Parliament."
"This is the umpteenth time the city of Strasbourg and the French Government have made it impossible to enjoy working here in Strasbourg."
"Either our flights are being cancelled or our cars are being taken away, and now we are even being denied access to our own Parliament."
"I think that you must do something about this."
"Mr President, I would simply like to tell my fellow Members that I am somewhat surprised."
"On the one hand, they complain that there is no security in Brussels and that they are sometimes exposed to abuse."
"Here, where every measure is taken to guarantee your safety, you are not satisfied."
"You could at least be consistent!"
"(Applause from the right)"
"Mr President, I should like to raise once more the case of the plane-spotters in Greece."
"You will remember that they were arrested on 8 November 2001."
"At their trial on 26 April 2002 many of them were sentenced to terms of imprisonment, but at their appeal on 6 November 2002 those present were acquitted of all charges."
"That, eventually, was the good news."
"The bad news is that, over four months after their acquittal, their bail money has still not been returned."
"At GBP 9 000 each, this is a considerable amount of money and I request that you draw this matter to the attention of the Greek presidency and ask it to take urgent action to redress this regrettable state of affairs, which is causing hardship to the plane-spotters and to their families."
"We will follow that up for you."
"As you know, that is a long-standing position of Parliament. I am happy to correspond on that matter since you have raised it again, in the light of your visit."
"I take note of that. I will try to follow it up, as requested."
"Mr President, I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner, Mrs Reding, to ask her a specific question."
"I refer to what must certainly have been a rather embarrassing decision on the part of the Commission to abolish budget heading B3-1026 relating to the field of sport, which supported the programme entitled 'Sport: preparatory measures for a Community policy in the field of sport', on the basis of notice No 33 published in 2002 by the DG for Culture and Sport."
"This programme covered two themes: sport as a tool for educating young people and combating the scourge of doping."
"Without warning, the Commission said that there was no longer enough money because the funds had been absorbed by enlargement, an explanation which is decidedly inappropriate, particularly given that many projects had already been carried out and also in view of the fact that next year - as you are aware, Mr President - will be the Year of Educating Young People through Sport."
"This was to be a programme to prepare for the Year of Sport and it has been abolished. I would like to know why."
"Rather than replying now, perhaps the Commissioner could take note of that and communicate the Commission's view to the Member later."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor to ask for information on the participation of the European Parliament in the ministerial segment of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which is to take place in Vienna on 16 and 17 April 2003, to take stock, after the first five disastrous years, of the progress made in the UN ten-year plan to combat drugs, which, in theory, should have wiped drugs off the face of the earth by 2008 but which is only bringing a resurgence of repression and suppression of individual rights and freedoms in the field."
"I have just returned from a trip to South America, specifically Peru, where the battle to eliminate cultivation of the coca bush is destabilising the region and furthering the ends of terrorism."
"There is therefore another war that needs to be stopped."
"The April meeting is our chance to do so."
"I hope that Parliament will take part according to the proper procedures and that the Members will also make representations to the governments of their countries and call upon them to present formal demands for the revision and evaluation of the international conventions and policies on drugs."
"We have a delegation participating in that."
"Perhaps Mr Cappato could be informed and then make direct contact with the colleagues who will represent us."
"Mr President, I was deeply disappointed that the initiative to launch a parliamentary committee of inquiry into the allegations of misuse of EU funds by the Palestinian Authority was not even discussed at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents last Thursday."
"Over one quarter of the Members of this House signed a petition to this effect and this controversial issue, which generated a lot of press attention and outside interest by our constituents, deserves better than to be swept under the carpet with no democratic debate being allowed."
"Surely the intention of Rule 151 is not to give the political groups the right to decide that the matter should not even be discussed in plenary when across the House so many Members regard this as a very serious matter."
"I would appreciate your ruling on the correct procedures under Rule 151(3), as in my view the very democratic credibility of this House is now at stake."
"The issue was discussed at some length in the Conference of Presidents in Strasbourg, two meetings ago."
"The issue has been handled correctly, in line with the Rules of Procedure."
"If colleagues have problems with the Rules, that is a separate issue."
"I will send you a note outlining the procedure that was followed and the interpretation of the relevant Rules."
"I need to take some advice on this, but under Rule 8(4), incompatibilities, as you have remarked, should ordinarily be notified to the President of the House by the authorities of the Member State in question."
"I can only confirm that so far, neither the services of the House nor I have received any such notification in respect of the individual named."
"Mr President, on the point made by my friend Mr Tannock, concerning the failure to have a proper debate on the proposed resolution on the Palestinian Authority's spending of EU funds, this is not a question of legality."
"I am sure the Rules were complied with."
"I have no quarrel with that."
"What does concern me is the political aspect."
"170 Members of this House simply asked for a debate and a small group of people decided, in a closed session, that there would be no debate."
"If we are democrats and believe this Parliament has meaning, then we should allow debate to flourish."
"That was a mistake and it is a bad signal to send, not just to Members but to the wider public, who now know that, despite the force for that resolution, a small group of people denied them the right to be heard."
"That was an error of judgement, and not of legality."
"I take note of your point."
"I will send a response to you as well as to Mr Tannock."
"The request by 170 Members was for the establishment of a committee of inquiry."
"It was not a request to hold a debate."
"The Rules, as they stand, vest the Conference of Presidents with the authority to decide whether or not a committee of inquiry is set up."
"That procedure was followed in this case."
"I will nevertheless correspond with you concerning the details and interpretations."
"We can return to it if colleagues remain dissatisfied with the matter."
"Mr President, Commissioners, I am particularly glad that you are here."
"The Charter of Fundamental Rights, approved by this Parliament, prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of language or of belonging to a national minority and enshrines the principle of freedom of expression and information without the interference of public authorities."
"Well, Mr President, Commissioner, the Basque people have suffered further abuse and discrimination from the Spanish institutions."
"For preventive reasons - the same argument used by Mr Aznar to justify the war against Iraq - the newspaper Egunkaria has been closed down - and I have a copy in my hand - the only daily entirely published in Basque, the language not just of the Basques, but - according to the most prestigious experts - the primitive language of the Europeans."
"And, in order to try to justify the unjustifiable, the Interior Minister of Mr Aznar's government has issued a joint communication with the judge of the National High Court."
"This unusual fact calls into question the existence in Spain of the democratic principle of separation of public powers."
"This newspaper has been closed for preventive reasons, putting all of its workers out of work, without even complying with the provisions of Article 129 of the Spanish Penal Code, on which their decision is based, since they have not allowed the required prior hearing of the company's legal representatives."
"This means there has been no defence, and furthermore means that this judgment is illegal."
"Not a single piece of incriminating evidence has been produced on the content of the newspaper, since it is a pluralist, objective and democratic publication."
"They have closed it simply because it defends the right of Basques to their own identity and to use their own language."
"Furthermore, the director of the newspaper was imprisoned and later freed."
"But he has accused the Civil Guard of torture, which takes us even further back, if that is possible, to the times ?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"I am sorry to interrupt."
"We are running over the allotted time."
"Your point was well made but I would ask you to respect our time constraints."
"Mr President, the judge of the National High Court issued a cautionary order which explains that the companies Egunkaria Sortzen and Egunkaria, as well as the newspaper which the latter edits, fall within the framework of ETA and, following this cautionary closure, that same judge interviewed the directors of the company and committed five of the ten people arrested to unconditional prison, accused of belonging to a terrorist organisation."
"Mr President, this should not come as a surprise to anybody because in 1992 the former Interior Minister for the Basque Government, and now President of the Basque Parliament, said that Egunkaria was part of ETA and in 1993 the spokesman of the Basque Nationalist Party stated publicly that ETA participated in the appointment of the management of the newspaper."
"We are not talking about an issue of language, but of the manipulation some people wish to carry out in order to achieve radical votes on 25 May and that, Mr President, is simply repugnant."
"I apologise to colleagues who wished to speak but we have overrun our time."
"(Protests from Mrs Laguiller, who maintained that the President had ignored the left of the House)"
"We have rules and I am doing my best to observe them."
"The next item is the Commission statement on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) within the WTO, including cultural diversity."
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing the European Commission's offers on GATS, and these are very important offers, because we must remember that the service sector in the European Union is a key sector for our economy."
"The Commissioner rightly points out that this is the most dynamic sector."
"The European Union is also one of the biggest exporters of services in the world, so it is also an important matter of self-interest."
"We must provide access to the services markets. Not only in our own interest but also in the interest of developing countries."
"After all, the development agenda is what the Doha WTO round is about."
"I think that we must see the practical results in the light of the economies of the developing countries, so I am very pleased that 50% of the requests have come from developing countries."
"Our experience in the EU also tells us that the liberalisation of services, both in the energy and telecom sector and in the financial services sector, should normally deliver a better quality and more efficient services market with a broader range of products and better prices, as long as it goes hand in hand with properly established rules and guarantees for citizens."
"I therefore think that the Commission is setting a great deal of store by the concept of general services, and I would like to call on it to take a closer look at the so-called universal service obligations that can also be delivered by private service providers instead of solely by the public sector."
"My group can support the Commission's offer to exclude the health sector, the social sector and the education sector from an offer, but I would also like clarification on the situation with regard to universities."
"The Commissioner has mentioned the Erasmus project, but does this mean that only individual Member States can make an offer on this point and that nothing is happening at all with regard to universities throughout the whole of the EU?"
"Commissioner Reding provided a very convincing argument for not making a new proposal for the audio-visual sector."
"I do not have to go into that in any more detail."
"I would, however, like to say something about computer-related services."
"On the one hand, we must naturally ensure that we do not cause a massive brain drain towards the West from countries like India."
"We must also provide our own training."
"On the other hand, we must also avoid a situation in which people work under other conditions in the European Union, because this could result in social dumping."
"I therefore think that it is important to create a good balance, and since September 11 we have naturally also had to look at security aspects."
"It is of course a good thing that we are doing more to include the environment in this."
"Sustainability is not just a matter for the West, it is a matter for the whole world."
"I therefore think that it should also benefit developing countries."
"Excluding water treatment and distribution for the time being seems to me to be a wise policy."
"GATS directly affects the interests of many EU citizens, and I appreciate Commissioner Lamy's efforts to broaden communication and provide more information."
"This is still a matter involving ambassadors, closed doors and a lack of transparency, and I am of the opinion that there should be much stronger parliamentary representation in this regard."
"Bearing Cancun in mind, I therefore also hope that the Commissioner will put forward new proposals to make this process even more transparent."
"We cannot turn our backs on current events, however, and Iraq is of course putting us into a situation in which the world community is split right down the middle."
"How can we now prevent the Iraq question from resulting in serious trade conflicts between the European Union and the United States which may obstruct the results of Cancun?"
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what initiatives she has taken in this area and what results they have produced."
"In this context, there are of course two essential problems with the United States that have not yet been resolved."
"On the one hand, the so-called FSC arrangement, the favourable tax legislation for American exporters which must now be reviewed thanks to the WTO statement, and on the other hand, the alarming reports that American draft legislation is being prepared that will limit the tax benefits of subsidiaries of non-US companies."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner what the situation is in this regard."
"Can we expect something like this from the Americans?"
"Then there is the pressure we are under to agree to the American proposals regarding genetically modified food."
"I think that it is very important to set this issue right and to hear what is happening about it."
"In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Commissioner Lamy speaks about the fact that 2003 will be the year in which the WTO must deliver."
"What does he mean by this, and what can we expect in this regard?"
"Commissioner, since your appointment you have adopted a very good habit of consulting and informing the European Parliament, for which we are grateful."
"We are also grateful for your support for the changes to the Treaty necessary to give us the powers we need in the trade area."
"Just as you are responsive to us, we have to be responsive to those who elect us."
"You know as well as we do that there are genuine and widespread worries about GATS."
"You have mentioned some of them: transparency, the feeling that a lot of unsavoury things are being done secretly; threats to EU jobs, which have prompted, I suppose, the dock workers' demonstration we saw today; threats to public services, with particularly acute dangers to developing countries; threats to the ability of Member States to regulate, and particular fears in the culture area, on which others will speak."
"At the same time, the European public is well aware - since 60% of them or more work in service industries - that there are possibilities for EU firms in widespread trade in services."
"So they face the dual interest which you have delineated."
"Developing countries have not rejected GATS completely."
"However, the fears about public services, regulation and extension and the fact that the developing countries do not have the capacity for the administration that an opening-up of service markets will require all mean that the implications of opening up trade in services need to be very fully assessed."
"I would put more emphasis on that than on anything else in our resolution."
"Before we go any further we want to know - not in a perfunctory exercise but in a detailed and comprehensive assessment - what this means."
"Mr President, the curious thing about the EU position on GATS is that it has become a very defensive position."
"It is not defensive to anyone outside Europe, but within an internal debate in which the Commission, and perhaps the EU generally, the position is defensive vis-à-vis campaign groups within the European Union which have decided, for some good reasons but also a lot of bad reasons, to criticise both the GATS agreement and the EU stance."
"My group would like to focus on that point."
"If, in the future, we want to prevent European Union trade policy being shaped - and sometimes arbitrarily shaped - by both the press and specific campaign groups, we must reassert parliamentary prerogatives in this field to open up the debate to proper, accountable public scrutiny."
"That is why we urge colleagues in other groups not only to support greater transparency in the way in which these negotiations are conducted, but also, as Mrs McNally has already said, to give strong support to filling the current vacuum in the Convention and making sure that the European Parliament more generally gains the right of assent over all future GATS and WTO agreements."
"Mr President, I will try not to read any sinister political motivation into that."
"Commissioner Lamy, you say that plenary debates like this are to fully inform Parliament about the progress of GATS negotiations but, in the absence of the document that would tell us precisely what is being demanded of whom, this exchange is almost entirely academic."
"If, in order to find that information, the majority of parliamentarians have to resort to leaks on NGO websites, then really we are a very long way from exercising parliamentary scrutiny."
"So, while I am grateful to you for speaking to us tonight, I would like to make clear that this does not constitute any kind of political scrutiny."
"You have made it clear that you believe that you have gone as far as you can, as Commissioner, to make GATS texts available to us."
"You tell us that you are trying to be open but that you have limited room for manoeuvre."
"Well, as parliamentarians we are doing what we can to increase that room, but can I ask you specifically what you are doing to increase that room for manoeuvre?"
"In your letter last October to the Chair of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, you accused Parliamentarians of making false claims about what you called the alleged intransparency of the EU decision-making process."
"You went on to say, and I quote, 'the current rules of access allow the European Parliament to fully exercise its task of political control'."
"Can I ask you whether you still genuinely believe that the current rules are sufficient?"
"Secondly, the mandate."
"Since the level of public awareness about the implications and complexities of the GATS process has grown enormously over the past few years, can you tell us why you believe it is still appropriate to negotiate within the WTO on the basis of a Council mandate granted back in 1999?"
"Would it not be more appropriate to adopt a new mandate and in it make explicit the rights of public authorities and institutions at all levels to regulate public services in order to maintain social and environmental standards free from challenge under GATS?"
"Finally, development."
"DG Trade's press release announcing the EU-GATS offers says they are all about helping developing countries."
"Let us look at the figures."
"The EU made 109 requests and received just 27 requests back."
"Only half of those were from developing countries and just one was from a least developed country."
"Let us not fool ourselves with the rhetoric that this is favouring the poorest."
"The figures show that it clearly is not."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have heard it said that international trade does not create wealth."
"Two great Europeans, Adam Smith and David Ricardo, have explained to us that the wealth of nations benefits greatly precisely from international trade, and that is how Europe's wealth has increased."
"As Commissioner Lamy has had occasion to point out on a number of occasions, further liberalisation of international trade in services is vital for the European economy, which, it is essential to note, both depends on services and can export them."
"That is why I feel that we should condemn the fact that the European Union, as Mr Clegg said just now, is in a defensive position with its back against the wall, not just as regards agriculture but where international negotiations on services are concerned too."
"In saying that the European Union's objective is to defend and promote the European social model more effectively, the Commission is almost apologising for giving consumers more choice."
"You, Commissioner, said that your aim is to establish negotiations in which the collective preferences and values of our society are respected."
"I believe that the best way to respect the preferences of the European citizens is to open up international trade in the audiovisual sector too."
"The European citizens must be the ones to decide whether cinema or other audiovisual products are better in Europe, whether they want those produced in Europe or those produced elsewhere, not to mention the fact that the large-scale distribution of music and films over the Internet is in danger of raising a question which is already longstanding, the question of protection of alleged cultural diversity in the field of audiovisual services."
"We must let the citizens choose, as in the case of education."
"I will end, Mr President, by saying that, as regards public utilities, as regards water and other services, too little is being done."
"Europe has shown that liberalisation is not incompatible with regulating and guaranteeing the quality of the services provided to the citizens."
"Mr President, Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Lamy, on behalf of my group and, I am sure, of the whole of this House's Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, I welcome the Commission's decision not to make any offer to deregulate educational, cultural and audiovisual services in this GATS round."
"Although we emphatically want borders to be opened up to international trade, there is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between cultural services and others, such as those in telecommunications, transport, or, indeed, finance."
"This makes it necessary to anchor this special role played by cultural and audiovisual services in the social and political cohesion of peoples in the relevant laws on contract."
"Culture must not be made subject to the rules of the market or to commercial law; instead, we need regulation that takes into consideration what is appropriate to each area, and so we have to find a global solution to enable Article 151(4) of our European Treaties to be the means whereby Europe's, and the world's, cultural diversity is secured and supported in the long term and in a sustainable way."
"It is for this reason that we need a two-phase process in the future."
"The Commission is to be thanked for setting out the first phase in today's proposal that GATS should not cover the provision of cultural and audiovisual services."
"The second stage goes beyond that, and I want to say how grateful I am to Commissioner Reding, who, with this in mind, is representing the Commission's and Parliament's views - and, I hope, the Council's - in the international discussions and working parties on the subject."
"There is a need for us to devise our own international convention, an international instrument of our own, if the future of cultural diversity is to be secured."
"Excellent work has already been done in this area by the Council of Europe, Unesco and, especially, the Francophone Conference."
"I am quite sure that, by strengthening cultural diversity across the world in this way, we could effectively allay people's fears of globalisation, whilst at the same time enhancing and advancing worldwide intercultural dialogue - the need for which we are, in these times, more aware than ever."
"The European Union must indeed take the lead in the WTO negotiations about the liberalisation of trade in services and the achievement of a general GATS agreement."
"These negotiations are certainly more than crucial for Europe."
"First of all, the fact is that services are forming an ever more significant part of world trade, 24% of which, as we know, is accounted for by the European Union."
"Furthermore, the European Union is currently the biggest importer and the biggest exporter of services in the world."
"Another reason to take these GATS negotiations in hand is naturally - or unfortunately, I should say - the continuing slowdown of economic growth."
"We must therefore concentrate more than ever before on the trade in services, and this once again applies in particular to the European Union where services represent more than two-thirds of the total gross domestic product."
"We must not, however, negotiate solely on the basis of our own interests but also on the basis of the interests of other countries and other parts of the world."
"Liberalisation means we must also open our borders more to services from third countries and thus contribute to their further development."
"Mr President, we feel that this debate on the opening of WTO negotiations to liberalise trade in services is extremely patchy."
"Not all the cards are on the table and the initial contacts have, for the most part , not been transparent."
"The Commission prides itself on a negotiating mandate dating from 1999, before Seattle, which is now completely obsolete."
"The national parliaments have not debated the matter transparently and the European Parliament is being called upon to endorse everything on the basis of a brief statement from the Commission."
"We are not against all liberalisation in principle, but it must at all times be controlled by the peoples concerned."
"The people must never be in a position where their hands are tied."
"If we follow the Commission in this matter, we will find ourselves caught up in ill-defined negotiations which could have a serious effect on the people's control over their public services and all the rules safeguarding their societies."
"Of course, the Commission assures us that no liberalisation offer will be made by the Union in the fields of health or education or the audiovisual sector and that it will negotiate to preserve cultural diversity, but these declarations are not enough for us."
"Why these fields and not others?"
"We have too much experience not to be familiar with the wheels within wheels and traps hidden in this kind of agreement, which only come to light after the event, when we have already signed on the dotted line."
"Commissioner, on Thursday, in this hemicycle, we are going to debate the closure of major firms due to relocation and the resulting human tragedies."
"If we want to avoid further human tragedies in the future, we must address problems earlier on in the process."
"We must start by refraining now from signing agreements such as the GATS agreement which would tie our hands in the future."
"That is why we call for these negotiations to be postponed until a genuinely public, democratic debate has taken place, until we have clearly assessed all the implications of GATS."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the service sector is far and away the most important sector in the European economy."
"The European Union is the biggest exporter of commercial services in the world, accounting for 26% of worldwide trade in services, as opposed to 22% in the United States and 7% in Japan."
"The trade in services in the European Union therefore accounts for more than two-thirds of our gross foreign product and jobs."
"So trade in services far exceeds trade in goods."
"Further liberalisation also benefits developing countries, because trade in services promotes the infrastructure, such as telecommunications, and also the financial infrastructure for the trade in goods."
"Thus GATS also contributes to the Doha round."
"In my view we must therefore stand four-square behind liberalisation and in particular avoid focusing too much on the exceptions that some of the Member States want to implement."
"The most important sectors are the transport, tourism, financial and telecommunications service sectors."
"Audio-visual services form a relatively small part of the offer."
"It is therefore ridiculous that Member States who do not want this are denying this Parliament any say because they are afraid of changes to the audio-visual sector."
"I therefore support my colleague Mr Nicholas Clegg's plea for change during the Convention."
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, concern is growing in every quarter at the wave of opening up and privatisation of services that the negotiations under the General Agreement on Trade and Services might unleash, however much the Commissioner insists that this will not happen."
"The right of EU and third-country citizens, including those of developing countries, of access to essential goods and services including water, education, health, culture, energy, transport and telecommunications, is in danger of being undermined."
"We are all familiar with disastrous examples of the privatisation of services in many countries, including transport in the United Kingdom, electricity in the United States and in Portugal, and water distribution and healthcare services in many developing countries."
"We are therefore concerned to learn of the Commission's proposals, which overlook the importance of public services in areas such as energy, transport, postal services and telecommunications, in terms of social cohesion, the public's well-being and social inclusion. The proposals also fail to take due account of the way in which social movements have been mobilised on a major scale to protect high-quality public services."
"A moratorium must therefore be declared on the liberalisation of services and the Commission must draw up a detailed report on the foreseeable economic, social and environmental consequences of the policies of liberalisation emanating from the World Trade Organization, both in the European Union and in the developing countries."
"The essential role of public services in every country's development and social cohesion must also be respected, with no proposals put forward that provide for further liberalisations in third countries or for European Union bids in the field of public services. The Commission must also call for cultural diversity not only to be preserved, but also promoted, as has already been stressed here on more than one occasion."
"Furthermore, deepening democracy, exerting greater control over the multinationals and protecting the development of the least developed countries and regions and the citizens' interests requires a democratic debate, requires national parliaments and the European Parliament to be consulted and the rule of unanimity to be upheld in negotiations in all of these areas."
"The role of the World Trade Organization must also be reduced and the United Nations General Assembly must be given a more active role in this field."
"Madam President, Mr van Velzen's statement deals judiciously with issues related to culture and cultural services, especially where they concern the flexibility of the positions to be taken by each Member State."
"It is precisely because this set of problems leads to another - the problem of what is known as 'cultural exception', that it must be made clear that the Commission cannot allow itself to blunder into the issue of cultural exception. This is an extremely controversial issue, primarily due to its own assumptions."
"In an open world in which we are increasingly committed to the free interaction of cultures, cultural diversity must clearly be protected, preserved and valued, but not at the expense of hindering the free movement of values of exactly the same nature."
"It is increasingly senseless, treating some cultural products as if they were industrial products, to establish forms of protection that limit their access to certain locations, such as cinemas."
"With television, video, DVD and other new technologies of the digital, online and Internet age, any spectator, any consumer who wishes to do so, can choose to view whatever they wish without any real barriers being able to hinder this consumption."
"I do not believe - or rather I must at least express my scepticism - that 50 Ministers for Culture can resolve this matter beyond the only point that will then be accepted, which is that every Member State can do whatever it feels is most appropriate to protect its interests and its own specific cultural diversity."
"Having made these observations, Madam President, I shall simply add that items 7, 8 and 9 of the report to which I have referred address the problem in a very sensible way in terms of prudence and balance and they deserve our support."
"Commissioner Reding, Commissioner Lamy, I am of the opinion that the publication of both the European institutions' offer and their questions on market liberalisation via GATSwatch have made it clear that we in the European Parliament have good reason to be worried."
"I would like to make two comments in this regard: firstly, Commissioner Lamy, you say that health, education, media and culture are not being liberalised."
"That is correct, but there are other sectors that fall under services of general interest."
"You do not rule out the liberalisation of energy and water, and the postal, port and pilotage sectors are already ready for liberalisation."
"My group therefore wants clear guarantees that Member States can now regulate their services of general interest in their own way and that these services will not be subject to the GATS."
"Naturally we do not need a WHO list for this; subsidiarity will apply as usual."
"Secondly, Commissioner Lamy, I find it shocking that there is such an imbalance between the questions from the northern and southern Member States regarding market liberalisation."
"In exchange for a limited number of questions, particularly concerning the mobility of labour from southern Member States, Europe wants to liberalise a number of sectors including some that we do not want to liberalise."
"Commissioner Lamy, I am of the opinion that liberalising water is not the right way to achieve the millennium targets and to halve the number of people who have no access to water."
"To do this we need relief funds and development cooperation."
"Anyway, I am convinced that this has nothing to do with genuine concern for the southern Member States but everything to do with the interests of the water industry."
"My group therefore requests that we do not adopt the liberalisation of sectors that we do not want to liberalise."
"Madam President, we should take the position that we do not expect of developing countries what we are not prepared to do ourselves."
"We should ensure that where we are protecting services or markets we do not oblige other countries which are less able to do battle in the open market to start up services that will simply sink or become private monopolies owned outside their own state."
"It seems to me as well that there is an urgent need for this Parliament to be treated as a parliament and for the secrecy in relation to these negotiations to end."
"If we are trying to create a multinational organisation at European level, which will have public support and legitimacy, then we cannot continue to proceed in ways which exclude the democratically elected representatives from important areas of policy."
"Finally, the bottom line in terms of protectionism is that we have to protect the rights of citizens, whether they are inside or outside the European Union."
"I would thank the Commission for these contributions."
"In connection with this debate, I have accepted six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure"
"Madam President, firstly, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament for the work it has done to date with regard to this extremely important directive and I would like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, for the work he has done in relation to this issue, which is extremely important in terms of providing the European Union with a competitive transport system."
"We often complain that Europe could use sea transport as an alternative to road transport and land transport in general."
"However, we are now sometimes being faced with a situation in which those same people who say that we must promote maritime transport create more difficulties when it comes to creating a sea transport system which is more competitive and more suited to the new circumstances."
"We clearly need to improve the efficiency of port services, and that is what this initiative intends to do."
"We need to improve the efficiency of these services, put an end to situations of monopoly, which sometimes mean that the same services cost three or four times more in one European Union port than in another, indicating that something is not working, and - I insist - we must guarantee, by excluding or imposing restrictions and guarantees, so that marine safety aspects are maintained at the highest possible levels."
"We in the Commission believe that the Council's Common Position to a large extent takes account of the amendments approved by this Parliament at first reading which represent a balanced solution for achieving these objectives and I believe it would be a real mistake not to maintain this balance and to change the broad balance established within the Council."
"In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, I will explain to you the Commission's position on the proposed amendments."
"Some of them clearly improve the Council's Common Position and the Commission therefore accepts them in their entirety, in principle or in part."
"In other words, the Commission is once again making an effort to ensure that the codecision system works as well as possible."
"In this field, I would firstly like to refer to the amendments which highlight the provisions of the Commission's directive on transparency with regard to the ports to which the directive we are dealing with apply."
"This achieves the objective we have all shared from the outset and in this regard I regret the fact that the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, believes that what is proposed here is insufficient."
"In any event, I will refer later, in particular, to some of the amendments which deal with these aspects."
"Secondly, we can accept Amendment No 11 - which relates to a lesser frequency for the review of the list of ports of a high seasonal character - and Amendments Nos 5 and 27 - which provide examples of expensive moveable assets which could be considered equivalent to immovable assets when considering repayments or residual costs."
"Furthermore, we can support all those amendments which, without going into detail, we believe make appropriate contributions to the common position or those which provide additional clarification, in one way or another, of the final text."
"I would once again like to congratulate both Mr Jarzembowski and the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism in general for the work they have done."
"Certain amendments, however, appear to attempt to slow down, and even to paralyse, the efforts made to promote this stimulation of European ports, aimed at improving, as I said earlier, the potential of long-distance maritime transport, aiding our exports to other parts of the world, but also short-distance maritime transport, providing an alternative to land transport."
"We therefore clearly cannot support Amendments Nos 36 and 66 which call for the Council's Common Position to be rejected."
"Having said this, I would like to make a few brief comments on other issues which Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned."
"Firstly, the question of competition between ports."
"I know this is an issue of great concern to the rapporteur and other Members and furthermore I believe that progress must be made on it."
"That is why I intend to accept those amendments which propose the inclusion of ports in the Commission's Directive on transparency."
"The Commission understands the current concern here."
"In fact, our recent document on this issue demonstrates our will to resolve the problem while respecting, however, the provisions of the Treaty, Mr Jarzembowski."
"That is to say, State subsidies have a framework, which is the one we have proposed, but they cannot just simply be regulated, since the Treaty itself lays down the regulatory framework."
"We must clarify this in order, as I said, to prevent legal doubts or uncertainties."
"And therefore, Mr Jarzembowski, I must say that Amendment No 15 goes further than such provisions and we cannot accept it."
"We are, however, prepared to try to seek, together with this Parliament, an approach which is acceptable to everybody."
"In this regard, Amendment No 10, duly modified, with certain important alterations in accordance with the solution we may find, could help us to find that compromise formula."
"I would ask you that we may work as hard as possible to find it as soon as possible."
"With regard to Amendment No 16, I must remind you that the Commission, within the context of the so-called 'range of port measures', has already carried out a study such as the one requested and unfortunately there was little cooperation on the part of the ports."
"Secondly: Mr Jarzembowski has talked about the practice of self-handling."
"This practice should be allowed in all modern ports where possible, with regard to both operations on board and those on land."
"The Common Position reflects this desire to send a message of progress and looking forward rather than rigidity."
"A message of progress but with every guarantee."
"In this regard, it is made clear that this type of action must comply with the social, environmental and safety standards required in each port and that this demand is essential in order to be able to carry out this self-handling."
"Those amendments which seriously restrict this approach - since, in various ways, they hinder self-handling operations - restricting them exclusively to seafaring people, cannot be accepted."
"Amongst other things - we are talking about ships from third countries and from European Union countries - because these crews are not subject to the same requirements as the professionals who work in our ports and what we are proposing in the Council's Common Position is that, in order to carry out these actions, they must be carried out within the framework of social and safety standards in accordance with the rules of each port."
"Because the additional limitation relating to ships flying the Union flag will bring the Union into confrontation with its partners in the world and that must also be avoided."
"Finally - briefly - we have always believed that pilotage is a commercial service."
"Therefore, access to such a service should be regulated by the Treaty and by this directive."
"For this reason, we support the consensus reached on the common position that authorisations should be conditional upon compliance with certain particularly strict criteria with regard to public service and maritime safety obligations - and again we return to the reality of each port."
"But this approach can be adapted by means of specific solutions for each port, which allow self-handling, within the field of pilotage, in the form of exemption certificates, under certain conditions."
"In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow's vote will have great repercussions on the legislative process."
"The Commission has always shown itself prepared to seek constructive solutions with the European Parliament."
"I would like to remind you once again that our general objective is to guarantee that the port services industry, which is expanding greatly, is ready to confront the challenges facing us."
"Furthermore, the future European transport system will only succeed with efficient and forward-looking ports."
"I would therefore like once again to ask you to support this Commission proposal and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, and the whole team which has worked on this text, and all the Members of Parliament for your attention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have reached our second reading, a milestone on the long, hard road towards liberalising port services, and I think that we should all start by thanking and congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, on a job well done."
"Having said which, I realise that as soon as I sit down, a number of my honourable friends will no doubt stand up to oppose liberalisation or at least make comments intended to severely restrict the liberalisation of port services."
"What I have to say to all these honourable Members, whose opinion I do of course respect, is that I fail to understand how we can be in favour of liberalising the railways, in favour of liberalising air transport, in favour of liberalising telecommunications, and against liberalising port services."
"We cannot have one sauce for the goose and one for the gander."
"I, for one, find it incomprehensible."
"Secondly, I should like to say to everyone - and to the port workers protesting today - that, in my personal opinion, they stand to benefit from the liberalisation of port services in the medium to long term, because it will create new jobs."
"We have nothing against these people."
"On the contrary, we recognise that their work helps foster economic growth; but they should not hamper further liberalisation and, by extension, further growth in the European economy."
"The European Parliament, at least the majority in committee, has so far stood by a number of firm principles, one of these firm principles being our espousal of the liberalisation of services, not as an end in itself, but as a means to economic growth."
"And because we stand by this principle, Commissioner, we adopted an amendment, which the rapporteur referred to and which is designed to prevent discriminatory treatment by port authorities, so that the ports of the European Union can compete with each other."
"In doing so, we did of course listen very carefully to what the industry and interested parties had to say. That is why we stand by our position on pilotage, where idiosyncrasies, different approaches and safety factors have to be taken into account."
"It is why we take a different view from the Council, a more amicable view if you like, of workers' demands and the question of self-handlers."
"Our focus is on proper staff training, which is why I think that port workers' current demands on the question of self-handling are somewhat exaggerated."
"This being our position, and in the light of the position taken by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism when it voted for the report, I think this is the right approach if we and the Council are to push through legislation which is acceptable to all sides as quickly as possible."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Commissioner, access to port services must be as open as possible, and a port must be able to operate as well as possible."
"This directive is one contribution, but we also need guidelines for government aid and a directive on transparent financial relationships between the port sector and the government."
"We are also rightly making rules that create a framework for the free circulation of services and we are rightly including specific aspects of ports."
"The trade unions are also right to point out to us the risks of ports of convenience, ports where all the social rules go overboard, just as there are flags of convenience, cheap flags, for ships."
"That is why we must impose requirements - social requirements too - on anyone wanting to offer services in a port."
"That is also why we propose introducing compulsory licensing for the provision of services in ports."
"That will enable aspects such as safety and the environment to be taken into account, as well as social rules and employment."
"The Prestige accident, an accident that once more focused our attention on the training and quality of ships' crews, which we are also talking about here, had fortunately not yet happened at the time of the first reading."
"Since then we have also had a proposal from the International Maritime Organisation about safety on ships and in ports - in fact you are currently working on legislation on that."
"We must therefore know who is working in our ports and under what conditions."
"With a good licensing policy the competent authorities should be able to ensure that a port is not a place where you take risks with safety or with the environment, that a port is certainly not a place where you allow social dumping, but that a port is in fact a vital link in an efficient and sustainable European transport policy."
"That is something we urgently need."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when, a while ago in this House we considered the Green Paper on ports and maritime infra-structures, Parliament clearly identified the area in which we feel the Commission should be working."
"Firstly, the list covering the funding and the system of tariffs for ports, clear rules on state aid to ports and, finally, the adoption of measures guaranteeing access to the port services market through legislative instruments established at the Commission's initiative and within its powers."
"The Commission, however, decided, contrary to what was requested of it, to propose a directive on port services and to omit what Parliament had charged it to provide, which were clear rules on state aid."
"This is perhaps one of the reasons why the directive, despite the changes it has already undergone, has been contested so intensely at various levels, including here in Parliament, where a considerable number of amendments have been tabled at second reading."
"In fact, the directive has not produced any measures that will benefit the operability and effectiveness of national ports where Portugal is concerned, and instead generates unnecessary bureaucracy and constitutes a potentially destabilising threat to the social harmony that has marked relations between the social partners in all Portuguese ports."
"We must not forget the fact that, especially in Portugal, some companies have recently taken on obligations arising from legislative requirements, such as having to absorb all workers employed in any capacity in ports and whose interests must now be safeguarded."
"We cannot, therefore, accept the fact that this directive will allow any port user, who may or may not be accredited, to engage in cargo-handling activity, in contravention of national legislation on labour or on the operation of ports, which is binding on all port operators, under conditions other than those laid down, specifically for the use of operators' own equipment and workers, and possibly on docks for which a public service concession has been granted."
"As I stated, the obligation on current port operators to absorb the labour force contracted to ports on salaries around three times higher than the average in sectors with identical operational requirements means that the directive will not be able to allow a port user to engage in cargo-handling activity without having to be accredited, thereby using workers in more favourable conditions than those binding current port operators under the law and under collective bargaining agreements."
"In this regard, we clearly maintain that self-handling must be confined to the work of a ship's own crew, as the term 'self-handling' itself suggests, and used as a complement to and in conjunction with the port operator."
"Self-handling is the most controversial aspect of the directive and the aspect that will have the most implications for economic agents, especially in my country, especially for Portuguese economic agents, in the event that the wording that has just been approved does not safeguard the principles identified previously."
"Mr President, it goes without saying that I am emphatically opposed to the directive in front of us, and particularly the file on self-handling."
"I wish to emphatically express my complete solidarity with the workers who have come to Strasbourg to demonstrate today."
"After all, from practical experience in my own country, Flanders, we know that the pool system with recognised dock workers ensures that we have qualified and motivated people working in our ports who can be regarded as some of the most highly skilled workers in the world."
"It is their dedication and their professional knowledge that make our ports fast, competitive and in particular safe handling organisations."
"I would like to know why something that is in fact perfect has to be changed or dismantled."
"Dismantling this pool system and the dock workers' monopoly will not only result in the umpteenth social graveyard, but it will also undermine the safety of our ports, unsettle the social peace that we have, cripple the strength of our ports and even reinforce anti-European sentiment."
"After all, the man in the street should realise that strong European files or files with a strong European dimension that have to be deblocked in order to secure our prosperity will in fact get us nowhere."
"Take the IJzeren Rijn rail link, for example; there has been no progress there, but Europe appears to regard measures that we know will only result in social breakdown and more unemployment as a priority."
"Europe is giving the impression that it gives greater priority to the interests of certain shipping lines - shipping lines that in many cases are practising a form of modern-day slavery - than to the survival of their own best port workers."
"Only a clear 'no' or 'never' will do in the face of so much blind European arrogance."
"Today we must make it all the more clear to the Flemish port workers: working for your own people first is a guarantee of safety and quality."
"Mr President, it is not for a procedural motion, it is for a personal fact."
"What we have just experienced from Mr Vanhecke is a personal affront, not only a personal affront to me but an affront to all Flemish Members of Parliament who have worked for months in tandem with the port managers and trade unions to make this directive into something good."
"Then Mr Vanhecke comes along here and bangs his drum."
"He has not taken a single initiative himself; in the first reading he even abstained on the matter of self-handling, and he now comes along and tries to score points."
"This is unacceptable; it is unacceptable to all the members who have worked so hard: Mrs Smet, Mr Sterckx, Mrs Maes, Mrs Van Brempt, Mr Dhaene and myself."
"I oppose it."
"Mr President, free access to port services is very important for guaranteeing honest competition in ports."
"Competition between ports is also important, so the Commission must ensure greater transparency in government investments that benefit the ports."
"The present directive got off to a messy start, but we now finally have a good document on the table."
"I would like to say something about two matters."
"Firstly, self-handling."
"Today and last week, there were dock workers demonstrating outside the Parliament buildings."
"They have every right to do so, but if ever there was a directive that took account of all the rights and interests of the dock workers, then it is this directive."
"Their position and social standing is extremely well protected by various articles in the directive, right up to their training and professional qualifications."
"Even if the port employers wanted to, it will not be possible to work with poorly trained, unqualified workers who could be a threat to the safety of the ports."
"What we do want to set straight, however - and everyone is always talking about workers' rights, Mr Bouwman - is that employers have rights too, even if nobody ever stands up for them."
"The employer's right to know whom he will be working with is, I think, the employer's right. I therefore do not support Amendment No 13 in which self-handling is again toned down - in a definition, would you believe."
"In order to guarantee that every Member State has regulations in which everything is guaranteed, I have tabled Amendment No 28, as we had promised in consultation with the FNV."
"The second point of interest is pilotage services."
"I wholeheartedly endorse the Council's viewpoint on this matter."
"In the formulation of the Council, Member States may liberalise their pilotage services if they want to, but they must do so under the directive. In other words, with all the protection and professional qualifications that this entails."
"I am not in favour of removing pilots from the directive."
"Anyway, what else is this directive about?"
"The common position forms a balanced text which we should not tinker with too much."
"Important points such as the provisions on transparency, the duration of licences, new ports and arrangements concerning the compensation that service providers have to pay when buying themselves out of a contract period, are in my opinion plain and clear."
"The compensation arrangement can, in my opinion, best be arranged between the market parties concerned without outside interference."
"The text of the common position does far more justice to the great diversity of situations and regulations on this point than the amendments tabled."
"Mr President, with all the commotion outside, the port directive is perhaps more controversial in the second reading than it was during the first debate."
"We have not finished yet if we are really voting out pilotage services tomorrow."
"Mediation with the Council is therefore on the horizon."
"As a Liberal I am far from happy with the scope."
"I had wanted more leeway, especially on the point of self-handling."
"I have a couple of amendments that make it possible for self-handlers to unload cargo both on the ship and on the quay."
"I think that the unions' fear about social dumping is nonsense."
"Sufficient guarantees can be built in."
"In particular, I find it regrettable that the people at the top are communicating so badly with the rank and file."
"There is no threat, there are just opportunities."
"Opportunities to show that they have the most experience, that they can work smoothly and efficiently and that they can therefore offer a keen price."
"Ultimately, what we are talking about is better quality and more services, but a monopoly must not be allowed to develop."
"Closing ranks and holding back modernisation will ultimately be at the expense of the working conditions of the dock workers themselves."
"Mr President, today it has once again become clear how far decision-making in the European Union is from the reality of the people it concerns."
"In this case, the people are the workers in the ports."
"Once upon a time there were a lot of them; their work was dirty and dangerous and poorly paid then."
"By organising themselves they have been able to improve these things and protect themselves against poorly paid, unskilled labour being hired in from outside by illegal contractors."
"Years ago the European Parliament called for rules governing competition between ports, particularly between ports serving the same hinterland, such as the North Sea."
"A lot of government money has been squandered on excessively low tariffs and excessively generous facilities to please the shipping companies."
"The European Commission has now picked up on this, but not with a view to restricting competition between ports but rather to promote it within the ports."
"This competition is trampling all over the dock workers. That means a return to the old situation."
"The main aim is to cut labour costs even further."
"A lot of the work has already been mechanised, and the cost of port labour forms only a negligible part of the cost of goods these days, but they even want to cut back on this."
"It is true that the amendment limits opportunities for extremely low paid crew from developing countries to take over loading and unloading on quays from registered local dock workers, but this is difficult to monitor."
"We can expect a large number of disputes about rules being flouted and competition being distorted in years to come."
"That was not sufficiently clear to the trade unions at the first reading in November 2001."
"They have since agreed on their complete rejection on a European level, but many of the elements relevant to them have now been declared out of order for the second reading, and demonstrators have been kept far away from this building."
"Strikes against this unreasonableness are the only weapon the people have left."
"In order to avoid this, the entire proposal must be dropped, as was advocated by more than 40% of the Members at the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the International Labour Organisation has found it necessary to behave in a regulatory way in respect of port labour, precisely because port labour has so much to do with safety and because this is an area where social dumping has occurred."
"Many countries have signed these conventions, and you will naturally say: 'We are not opposed to it either, and we also allow these countries to organise themselves further.'"
"My country also wants to be able to retain its 'Major Law', but that is naturally not what it is about."
"What the dock workers are afraid of, and this is an area in which I share their anxiety, is the fact that safety in the ports will go out of the window in favour of cheap prices."
"The Prestige accident has already been mentioned by many people."
"Are we going to see serious accidents like this in the future when goods are loaded and unloaded?"
"The other great risk is that of social dumping on account of self-handling."
"Commissioner, is that really what you are aiming for, competition through social dumping?"
"I do not think that we should go down that route."
"We must ensure that compulsory licensing is introduced."
"I therefore really do not agree with what you are advocating, as I am sure that anyone subject to strict licensing laws will also experience distortion of competition."
"They will be priced out of the market, and cowboy ports will develop, just as we already see ships sailing under a flag of convenience that are the terror of the seas."
"Mr President, today dockworkers have demonstrated against this measure outside this Parliament."
"I had to fight my way through teargas to gain access to the building."
"As a new Member I thought this was possibly normal practice."
"There has already been a protest in Brussels and there will, no doubt, be many more."
"However, this directive offends not only against workers' expectations but also against the dock companies, which have invested heavily in facilities and infrastructure."
"These proposed rules are throwing their businesses into turmoil."
"For this reason we voted against the measure at first reading."
"Now we see a series of amendments, which typifies the approach of this Parliament: seeking to make slightly better something that is inherently flawed."
"If this Parliament truly represented the wishes of the people, it would throw this directive out, but it will not."
"That itself demonstrates what we already know: this Parliament has nothing to do with representing the wishes of the people; it has its own agenda, which has nothing to do with democracy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do not agree with the view that Parliament has betrayed the voters in working on this directive."
"I endorse the proposal for a directive and the balance reached, thanks, not least, to Parliament's work."
"I believe that opening up to the market could be positive, not least as regards access to port services, but only under the conditions specified and introduced by Parliament's amendments: only provided that safety, professional qualifications, contractual and social rules and environmental protection are rigorously safeguarded where all the companies and all the kinds of services connected with aspects of the different port services are concerned."
"The same must apply to self-handling."
"I am not against self-handling in principle, but it must not become an excuse for promoting forms of social dumping and ways of economising on professional qualification or safety."
"This is transparent competition."
"This applies to new ports too, in order to ensure the availability of private investments."
"Direct control over services and providers must be possible - and is highly desirable - but with due regard for those conditions: professional qualification, contractual and social rules, environmental protection and safety."
"Unless these conditions are observed, we will be lumping together things which are so very different that they neither properly serve the interests we represent nor further progress towards the objectives we want to achieve with this directive."
"I hope that the balance achieved by Parliament can be preserved."
"Thank you, Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, this afternoon we have seen that our directives do have some effect on the people of Europe."
"We have, in particular, seen that the dock workers are angry, very angry, and also desperate."
"Why?"
"Most likely because they are heard too infrequently in this Parliament."
"More likely, however, because they are coming up against a cold, liberal Europe that subordinates safety, safety at work and health, social matters and jobs to blind liberalisation dogma."
"They are also angry about the proposal you launched in February 2001, Commissioner, in which you pulled their social charter out from under their feet with one stroke of the pen."
"It will come as no surprise to you that you are not very popular in Belgium, and I still regret that you did not have the courage to have a direct debate with the dock workers in Antwerp, for example."
"That could have been enlightening."
"In Parliament we should have discarded the proposal immediately after the first reading, we should not have amended it."
"Various colleagues have already told me that it is not what we wanted."
"So why did we not vote it out?"
"I will continue to fight against this directive, I will vote against it tomorrow and I will continue to do so."
"Because I still do not understand what its added value is, not even in its amended form, although I do admit that it is much improved."
"I will tell you why the dock workers are striking, Mr Jarzembowski."
"They are, of course, striking because if you permit self-handling in another country, you must also permit self-handling in your own country straight away because of the sacred competition rules, and that is the reason why I continue to oppose it."
"I hope that we will be able to vote the proposal out, but I fear that we will not be able to do so."
"I am therefore hoping for strong amendments: self-handling out and compulsory licensing in."
"I found out today that we are better at defending this Parliament with a police force than we are at maintaining the social system in Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. I also welcome onto the platform some representatives of the dock workers who have got in."
"Today I feel a bit like I am in the Middle Ages, in a fortified castle."
"What can I add in a minute?"
"So much has been said already, but this afternoon I had another meeting with some of the people from the dock workers' unions, and I was impressed by their message."
"This directive brings ports of convenience closer."
"This directive organises social competition between the European ports which will result in social dumping and also, in time, the destruction of the dock workers' charter as we know it in Belgium."
"Nobody is asking for this."
"Europe is apparently the crowbar used to tackle problems in some countries."
"Allowing self-handling without a prior compulsory licence has other negative consequences, as has already been mentioned here: a lack of safety and problems with environmental disasters at sea."
"That is all we need."
"My group and I are therefore voting against self-handling and in favour of the social protection of dock workers, and I hope that some socially aware fellow members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will follow suit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank you for all your points of view and comments, including those which reject the Commission's proposal."
"I believe it is important that we can hold a debate and that you can present your arguments."
"But there are certain issues I would like to clarify because, having heard some things which have been said here, it appears that we are talking about different texts."
"Firstly, the general issue of whether or not we want a competitive maritime transport system which can be incorporated into an intermodal network and which can provide an alternative to road transport."
"Yes or no?"
"Secondly, we have an entirely ideological question."
"Some of you believe that monopoly is the ideal situation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe in principle that the option of healthy competition is much better than a situation of monopoly."
"This is essentially an ideological question."
"Having said all this, the facts appear to point more to one side than the other."
"It is true that there are elements, areas, market segments, which, due to a lack of size, do not allow for several operators."
"But when there is competition things work better."
"There is a higher quality of service, better prices and better costs, and more competitiveness."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our air sector, as was said a moment ago, does not appear to have suffered as a result of introducing competition."
"This Parliament wishes to introduce competition into the rail sector and has voted for that by a majority."
"Here we are talking about also introducing competition into port services in large ports."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you say that this puts an end to safety and you link it to the Prestige."
"What does this have to do with the Prestige?"
"Absolutely nothing, ladies and gentlemen."
"It bears no relation."
"I am sorry, but they are different issues."
"Furthermore, nobody is asking for a reduction in the safety elements."
"This is why in the fields of pilotage and mooring services, in all these fields, specific and special precautions are being put in place, including in loading."
"It is said that the port authorities, which have the best knowledge, can regulate conditions in their own cases - which may consist of a certificate or of proven knowledge."
"We are allowing the port authorities to develop this aspect in accordance with their better knowledge of the situation in each European port."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that this is a proposal in favour of transport in general and also in favour of creating more work in our ports and having more competitive ports, which have more activity and which can cooperate in the economic development of the European Union."
"That is what I am in fact doing in transport, in the ports, in the other sectors of transport and in energy."
"That is quite simply what lies behind the Lisbon spirit."
"In fact, what we are talking about here is a fundamental proposal and what we are proposing is the European model."
"I will now discuss the second point that has been discussed, which is social dumping."
"Nobody wants social dumping, ladies and gentlemen."
"Nobody."
"We want more work for more activity in ports and furthermore with adequate social guarantees and conditions."
"Because, according to the European model, competition is introduced while maintaining social standards and guarantees."
"That is the European model, which is regulated liberalisation and which is not genuine liberalisation."
"Because liberalisation and regulation in principle appear to be contradictory, but, nevertheless, in Europe we are capable of combining the two elements: the advantages of the market with the guarantees of a system of solidarity."
"And that is what we are doing, ladies and gentlemen."
"I would read two things to the honourable Members."
"One, what does self-handling mean?"
"Article 9 states that self-handling is the situation in which port services can be provided for an undertaking or by an undertaking for itself using regular personnel, not temporary personnel or personnel employed for a specific task, but 'regular land-based personnel and/or seafaring crew'."
"The key is that we are talking about regular personnel."
"But, as well as regular personnel, I would point out that Article 13(2) states that the national employment and social rules will be obligatory and that social dumping cannot take place."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please read the way this text has ended up because I believe it is crystal-clear."
"I believe we have to consider what we are doing."
"We do not intend to reduce safety levels, to carry out social dumping, or anything of the kind."
"If we were to abide by your fears in relation to liberalisations, Ryanair or Virgin would not be operating, for example, and we would all be living with State monopolies, and I believe that more than one of you makes use of Ryanair and Virgin."
"So do I. Let us see if we can come to an agreement."
"And we have not as a result reduced safety in European air transport."
"Let us tell the truth, please."
"I understand that there has been a protest outside this Parliament."
"You are politicians, ladies and gentlemen."
"So am I. We must listen to everybody, but let us tell the truth."
"Nobody is proposing social dumping."
"On the contrary, we are talking about guaranteeing social standards and requirements relating to employment, and of regular personnel, not temporary personnel."
"If we restrict it to just seafaring personnel, we would then, on the contrary, be taking the wrong approach."
"I believe we also have to consider land-based regular personnel equally."
"The third element which you have insisted on once again is that of competition between ports."
"Of course we are dealing here with competition between ports."
"What we have to ensure is that that competition is not unfair."
"And in this regard I agree with the honourable Members and the rapporteur, Mr Jarzembowski, in particular."
"With regard to Amendment No 10, let us find a solution which can clarify it further, within the limits and margins laid down in the Treaty, which we clearly cannot change by means of this text."
"Finally, the issue of timeliness, mentioned by Mr Savary."
"He said that we should do everything apart from this."
"Mr Savary, the problems of the maritime sector, maritime safety ... this House has done a lot of work, as have the Commission and the Council, to improve maritime safety and we know, and the honourable Members are perfectly aware, that if the rule we proposed had been in force, we could quite possibly have prevented the last accident."
"Still more can be done and we are going to do it."
"But let us not say that we have begun with the ports because that is not true."
"On the contrary: we are practically ending with the ports."
"We have a very serious transport problem in Europe and we must seek solutions which are alternatives to road and rail transport, in other words, land-based transport."
"In an enlarged Europe, in which distances are increased, the maritime sector has many more possibilities and it makes much more sense to create European cabotage."
"But in order to create European cabotage and for it to genuinely compete with other transport systems, that is land transport, we need efficient port services."
"And that is what we intend, once again: to introduce competition into the large ports - I would insist - in a regulated manner, providing social and safety guarantees."
"That is simply the European model."
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the promotion of the use of biofuels for transport [12695/1/2002 - C5-0585/2002 - 2001/0265(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Ayuso González)."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Ayuso González on the efforts she has made to achieve this successful outcome of a compromise."
"Even if she is not wholly satisfied with it, I think she has done a splendid job."
"It is just as well that we do not have mandatory requirements but I think that, given goodwill on all sides, we will see some progress in the application of biofuels."
"With the European Union already importing 50% of its energy needs and this rising to 70% by 2030, it is important that we exploit all possible indigenous resources of energy as well as promoting greater diversity of energy sources."
"By developing biofuels and other renewable energies we are contributing to increased security of supply."
"In my constituency in Scotland, we have the materials and the know-how to be able to develop this industry and are eager to put these proposals into action."
"We are also hoping to improve our environment with better air quality and a reduction in greenhouse gases."
"In the blending of biofuels into conventional transport fuel we can introduce these changes in a simple way that will not require vehicles or filling stations to be adapted."
"Biofuels also promise to create new jobs in rural communities through crop production and in the construction and operation of processing plants."
"This will provide a well-needed boost to the flagging rural economies."
"But biofuels remain uncompetitive without significant government tax breaks."
"A 50% reduction in tax to match conventional fuel prices will mean subtracting a hefty chunk from Member State exchequers."
"How many of our governments are prepared to lose this revenue?"
"We are also concerned that the proposals as they stand will not necessarily result in any major real environmental benefits: production methods for most biofuels use substantial amounts of energy and create high carbon dioxide emissions."
"We may also see higher inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides."
"Member States must decide to promote biofuels that give an overall cost-effective benefit to the environment."
"Most importantly we must also invest in research to improve the cost effectiveness and environmental benefits of biofuel crops in the future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González, for tabling a really good report and for the excellent cooperation."
"I think that here too, on the issue of biofuels, Parliament is continuing to honour its cross-party commitment to promote renewable energies."
"It is good to know that in our efforts to do so we can usually count on the Commission's support."
"I have serious doubts, however - and that is putting it mildly - as to whether the Council feels the same commitment as does Parliament to our joint target of doubling the proportion of renewable energies in the total energy consumed by 2010."
"At the first reading, Parliament came out in favour of binding targets for increasing the use of biofuels."
"As with the directive on promoting electricity generation from renewable energy sources, this did not stand a chance in the Council."
"We have therefore agreed, as we did for the electricity directive, to indirect targets, with the option of moving to mandatory targets at a later stage if the actual rate of increase falls significantly short of the target set."
"The Council's intention to give the Member States a whole series of opportunities for setting their national targets at levels which diverge from the prescribed 5.75% by 2010 is unacceptable."
"I very much hope that the Commission will scrutinise the reasons for departing from the indicative targets, which the Member States will have to provide, in a really very critical light."
"Despite this critical assessment of the Council position, I can say on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that we will grit our teeth and vote in favour of the compromises contained in the Council position."
"Why?"
"We want a shift towards renewable energies to be promoted in the fuel sector too so as to make a positive contribution to the necessary minimising of CO2 emissions, to reduce our dependence on oil and to give a boost to development in rural areas."
"To achieve this it is not only targets that we need; it is also crucial that the Member States should be able to give tax breaks to biofuels."
"At the moment - and I will be quite open about this - this is our only possible course of action because the Council actually has our backs up against a wall."
"If the promotion directive does not go through the codecision procedure in the form that the Council wishes, then the tax directive - this has been made clear to us - will not be adopted."
"I very much hope that the new European constitution will make such a situation impossible in the future."
"Despite the shortcomings that I have identified, I hope and indeed I am confident that this directive, together with the tax breaks, really will give a further boost to increasing the use of biofuels."
"Mr President, I support the action plan of the European Commission, which seeks to promote the greater use of alternative fuels in Europe between now and 2010."
"Firstly, biofuels help to reduce over-dependence on oil-based fuels, which is a cause for concern as regards both the environment and security of supply."
"Secondly, biofuels are environmentally friendly and they emit between 40 and 80% fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels."
"We all know the target we must reach to comply with the provisions of the Kyoto Accord and reduce the excessive use of greenhouse gases, which only result in a depletion of the ozone layer."
"Biofuels are in many cases manufactured from organic waste."
"This makes it possible to use waste materials, which would normally be thrown away, in order to produce energy."
"Biofuels offer new sources of income for European industries."
"We must take advantage of the job opportunities which could be created in research and technological activity."
"There is clearly a divergence of opinion between the Council and the European Parliament as to whether mandatory targets should be set for the use of biofuels in Europe."
"We must do all in our power to bring about the greater use of biofuels."
"The economic and environment benefits are obvious."
"Biofuels must be introduced, targets met and the work of Member States' governments strictly monitored and evaluated."
"European governments should radically change tax systems to encourage European industries to invest more in the biofuel industry."
"It is not only the present generation which will benefit from these new changes, but also future generations."
"I wish to compliment Mrs Ayuso González on her excellent report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mrs Ayuso González for her hard work as rapporteur for this directive."
"A directive on increasing the use of biofuels is something that I can only welcome, but I do regret the fact that the current situation falls well short of my expectations."
"It is precisely by increasing the use of biomass that we can contribute both to securing farmers' income and creating new jobs in the current and enlarged Europe as well as to enhancing the multifunctional role of the countryside. In addition, such an initiative meets the requirement of sustainability, which is so important from the point of view of protecting the environment."
"In the light of all this, the compromise proposals on the table are rather disappointing and reflect a definite dilution of the original demands, because all that is left of the original obligation to blend - as we might have expected - are reference values."
"It would actually have been very pleasing if the Austrian model, which makes it mandatory for more biomass to be used, could have served as a model for Europe as a whole."
"Finally, I have to note that unfortunately the final paper contains too few incentives for a more efficient use of biofuels."
"Once again the discrepancies between the interests of the fossil fuel industry and farming are clear for all to see."
"Given the finite nature of oil deposits and bearing in mind the Kyoto targets, we can only hope for the future that this is not a closed book, that further efforts will be made to push up the use of biofuels and that this really is just the first step in the right direction, if all of us really do feel a credible and serious responsibility for providing future generations with a secure foundation on which to live."
"Mr President, the directive now before us forms part of a whole area of legislation to promote the use of renewable energy sources in different sectors, and therefore represents some of the several and various measures to implement the Community strategy for sustainable development adopted at the Gothenburg European Council in June 2001."
"The directive is especially important because developments in this very area of transport up till now have been absolutely pitiful."
"My colleague, Mrs Ayuso González, has really done an excellent job."
"Transport accounts for more than 30% of the end use of energy in the Community and that figure is growing all the time."
"This trend will become stronger still and there will therefore be an increase in carbon dioxide emissions."
"This increase will be still greater in the candidate countries, relatively speaking."
"According to the Commission's White Paper, carbon dioxide emissions associated with transport are estimated to increase by 50% over the period 1990-2010, and the main source of emissions is road traffic, which accounts for 84% of carbon dioxide emissions connected with transport."
"This is why the White Paper is calling for less dependence on oil by the transport sector, for ecological reasons."
"This is currently at a rate of 98% and would be reduced by using alternative biofuel-like fuels."
"Promoting the use of biofuels in keeping with sustainable farming and forestry practices will create new opportunities for sustainable rural development."
"This could play a part in the creation of new jobs in rural areas."
"Moreover, it will be possible to obtain by-products, which, owing to their vegetable protein-rich content, could be used as animal feed."
"Growing plants for biofuel production would have to be combined with current programmes for cultivation, adhering to the principle of crop rotation."
"To guarantee the existence of sustainable cultivation practices we should nevertheless draw up a set of clear environmental criteria so that, for example, using the same cultivated area later on for food production does not pose a risk."
"The timetable approved by the Council only contains two targets with binding dates."
"These must not be forgotten."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to echo the numerous words of thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Ayuso González."
"She has negotiated really very energetically and with great skill in this field."
"I should also like to thank the Commissioner once more for tabling an ambitious proposal."
"We all regret the fact that the proposal as tabled by the Commission and with the improvements made by Parliament at first reading was not adopted, but we are already making progress."
"The advantages of extending the use of renewable raw materials to the transport sector have already been mentioned many times."
"They include cutting emissions, reducing our dependence on oil and above all creating more jobs in farming and rural areas."
"I regret the fact - and I must say this quite openly here - that no one from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has taken the floor, because the Greens have after all expressed rather critical views in the debate and I had thought that we might perhaps discuss this again here today."
"I think it is right that we need to take into account the environmental impact of biofuels, but we must not be one-sided."
"I might simply remind you of the tanker disasters that we have had in recent years."
"If these tankers had been carrying biofuels then the damage would, God knows, not have been as devastating, and biofuels do not need to be transported across the oceans either."
"We want to promote innovation in this sector."
"That is why Mr Purvis was right to say that efficient and environmentally friendly fuels must be given particular support."
"I would add that the first step is to start promoting them at all."
"I fully endorse the criticism of the Council, as expressed by Mrs Rothe among others."
"I think it is regrettable that we cannot go further, and I will say quite explicitly something that perhaps Mrs Rothe cannot say in so many words: I am also particularly disappointed by the German Government."
"The Germans were not the only ones who put the brakes on, but they also had every reason to adopt a rather more constructive attitude towards the Commission proposal and our position from the first reading."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the oral question (O-0003/2003 - B5-0084/2003) to the Commission, by Mr Stevenson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the socio-economic crisis in the white fish sector."
"(In the absence of the author of the question, the President gave the floor to the Commission first)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pity that Mr Stevenson is not here."
"As you know, stocks of cod in several areas are in a quite disastrous state."
"Since the year 2000, the situation has dramatically worsened and the stocks are threatened with collapse."
"ISIS, the international scientific body, has advised closing cod, whiting and haddock fisheries for the duration of this year."
"This, it is thought, would be the safest way to rescue our cod stocks."
"However, such a drastic measure does not take account of the massive economic and social consequences that this would have on the entire sector."
"That is why a sustainable plan needs to incorporate all three dimensions of sustainability and that includes above all the economic and social consequences."
"We therefore tabled an improved recovery plan to our technical and scientific committee as an alternative to a moratorium."
"It issued a favourable opinion."
"We then tabled this improved plan to the Council."
"In December 2002, however, the Council was only able to agree on a transitional recovery plan."
"I should like to stress, however, that this transitional plan is very positive because it already contains substantially reduced quotas, low fishing effort and improved monitoring mechanisms."
"At the same time it was agreed that the Commission would make two new proposals for the long-term recovery of cod and hake in the spring."
"We will be tabling these proposals in April, and this week a hearing is taking place with the fishing sector and scientists from all of the Member States."
"I myself opened this hearing just this morning."
"Obviously the long-term plan to rescue cod will be designed in such a way as to also make an appropriate contribution to stock recovery."
"I am aware that this plan will have severe consequences for fishermen in the short term."
"However, we can also intervene here with the help of the fisheries structural fund and cofinance social measures, such as for example compensation payments for the temporary cessation of activity or retraining measures."
"I can only urgently call on the Member States to take their responsibilities seriously and provide more funds in their programmes for measures of this kind."
"So far the following funds have been programmed for such compensation payments under the Structural Funds: Belgium has set aside EUR 800 000, Denmark EUR 1.6 million, the Netherlands EUR 1.3 million and France EUR 3.5 million."
"On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Germany have not programmed any measures of this kind at all."
"As regards the additional EUR 150 million of compensation to alleviate the socio-economic consequences in the regions concerned, I should like to make it quite clear that it is not the Commission that makes this decision, but the budgetary authority."
"Unfortunately, however, the Commission has not yet received any positive signal, either from the Council or Parliament, that the budgetary authority would accept such a proposal."
"Turning now to your demand for the creation of regional advisory fora, I fully agree with this proposal."
"I would explicitly call on the Member States to take the initiative here so that regional bodies of this kind can be set up as soon as possible."
"These fora would moreover provide a place where scientists, fishermen and all of the other stakeholders, including the regional authorities, could do precisely what you call for in your motion, namely hold regular consultations."
"As regards the call for extended powers of codecision, you know what the Commission's position is: the Commission fully supports this request."
". Mr President, last December, as the Commissioner has just outlined, following a five-day meeting of the Council of Ministers, a new transitional cod recovery plan was agreed which has had a devastating impact on much of the EU whitefish sector."
"Under these new regulations, which came into effect on 1 February this year, savage quota cuts have been linked to draconian limits on fishing effort."
"Whitefish vessels can now only fish for 15 days a month, including steaming time to the fishing grounds, and the 15 days will be reduced to 12 days unless a further 20% of the fleet is decommissioned."
"We are literally asking our fishermen to burn their boats."
"Scotland, where there are only 162 dedicated boats left in what used to be Europe's biggest whitefish fleet, will bear the brunt of these cuts."
"If we scrap another 20%, the fleet will fall below the critical mass needed to sustain jobs in our harbours, ports and processing factories."
"The industry will go into free fall."
"In addition, the majority of the remaining vessels will be ones that, because they are under 10 years old, are not eligible for decommissioning subsidy."
"These are the vessels on which the future of our whitefish fleet relies."
"These are the vessels on which we rely to catch cod, haddock, plaice and other whitefish once the stocks have recovered and the total allowable catch limits have been increased."
"Sadly, however, these are also the vessels with the biggest outstanding debts to the banks."
"It would not surprise me if many of them were forced into bankruptcy."
"The skippers and crews, who have often mortgaged their homes to raise the cash to build these boats, will lose not only their jobs and boats but also their homes."
"But Scotland is not the only country affected by these draconian measures."
"Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands and France have all suffered cuts."
"This is why the Committee on Fisheries voted unanimously - at least with only one abstention - to support this emergency resolution, the crux of which calls upon the Commission to adopt less drastic measures for the long-term recovery of cod which would secure the maximum number of jobs in the EU whitefish sector."
"The resolution also calls for the allocation of an additional EUR 150 million to compensate fishers, processors and ancillary workers affected by these conservation measures."
"I would suggest that EUR 48 million should be used for transitional funding to compensate fishermen and ancillary workers affected by the 15-days-at-sea fishing limits."
"I would hope that this aid could be found from the flexibility instrument."
"The balance of EUR 102 million should be reprogrammed out of the FIFG for the 2004 budget and should be targeted towards golden handshakes to induce fishers and ancillary workers to leave the industry, early retirement grants and retraining aid, as mentioned by Commissioner Fischler."
"One day last week in Scotland the entire whitefish fleet agreed to switch off its satellite tracking systems for 24 hours in silent protest at the catastrophe that has engulfed the communities involved."
"In the main fisheries inspection centre there is a large screen on which dozens of tiny lights indicate the position of each fishing boat in the North Sea and around the Scottish coast."
"These lights represent information beamed from the satellite-tracking systems."
"One by one the lights went out, signifying in a dramatic way the fate that awaits Scotland's whitefish vessels."
"I hope the House will agree to provide this urgent and desperately needed support."
"Our fishing communities are crying out for help."
"Please heed their call."
"Mr President, in December 2002 the Fisheries Council agreed a compromise which effectively halved catches for the Scottish and UK whitefish fleets and stopped vessels going to sea for more than 15 days a month."
"These are drastic measures but far short of the all-out moratorium recommended to the Commission by its scientific advisors on fish stocks, ISIS."
"United Kingdom and Scottish ministers have been attacked for agreeing to the hard-fought compromise."
"At the time one of the fishing leaders commented that he doubted that the Archangel Gabriel could have got a better deal in the circumstances."
"Inevitably such actions have a socio-economic impact on the communities that depend on fishing for whitefish - especially cod."
"We must acknowledge this."
"I give my personal support to the resolution before us this evening."
"I also welcome the GBP 50 million compensation package approved by the Scottish Parliament last week and the related compensation packages in England, Wales and Northern Ireland."
"It is significant that we are discussing this issue as vital talks take place today and tomorrow in Brussels."
"Scottish and UK fishermen have joined fellow fishermen and civil servants from other EU countries at the European Commission's Fisheries Advisory Committee."
"Talks will focus on a long-term cod recovery plan."
"I am delighted that the Fisheries Commissioner, Mr Fischler, will bring forward amendments to the current restrictions which have proved to be 'too rigid'."
"However, the negotiations on the long-term recovery plan will be tough."
"We really have to think carefully about the right road to take."
"I want us to examine all possible options on effort control."
"Saying 'sod the cod', allowing fishing to continue and hoping for the best is hardly an option, nor is renationalising the CFP."
"This ducks the difficult issues posed by the need for stock recovery."
"We really need to rationalise the CFP and cod recovery."
"We must work in a cooperative manner with industry, ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution."
"We must also create regional committees, allowing decisions to be taken as close to those affected as possible."
"Doing nothing in the light of declining cod stocks is not an option."
"The difficult task of arriving at a quota figure that is sustainable, yet scientifically credible, remains."
"Mr President, in supporting this motion I speak particularly of the need to give financial assistance, both to cushion the socio-economic effects of the measures that have been taken and to help the industry to survive until the stocks have recovered."
"For colleagues whose constituencies are landlocked I offer the following analogy: supposing for good environmental reasons, such as a drastic cut in CO2 omissions, road haulage operators were told by the EU that they could only use their lorries for two weeks out of every four, and then only on condition that a significant proportion of the vehicles were taken off the road altogether."
"Imagine the fiscal consequences for the businesses concerned, then imagine that these businesses are the mainstay of towns and villages with fragile economies, and think what the outcome would be for local shops, schools and other services."
"Sadly, we who represent fishing communities around the North Sea - certainly those of us from Scotland - do not need to use our imaginations."
"We can already feel the effects."
"Of course assistance with restructuring can be given from within Member States."
"As Mrs Stihler has already said, the Scottish Executive has managed to find GBP 50 million from its already restricted budget. That is a measure of the seriousness of the situation."
"But I believe that the EU too must shoulder some of the financial responsibility."
"This is in part because past shortcomings of the CFP have contributed to the crisis. To a larger extent, it is because any democracy must adhere to the moral principle that where the direct effect of legislation is the destruction of people's honest livelihoods, they are at least compensated accordingly."
"I hope that the EU counts itself as such a democracy and that this principle will be fully expressed in the forthcoming vote."
"Mr President, just this once I shall resist the temptation to lambast the Commission and the Council for their contributions to the crisis facing the whitefish sector in Scotland."
"I can assure fellow Members that there certainly is a major crisis of confidence in the European Union's ability to manage fisheries at all."
"However, I will concentrate my remarks tonight on the main and most important purpose of the resolution which accompanies this question, that is, the social and economic consequences arising from the decisions made at the December Fisheries Council."
"Businesses are already feeling the pain from the interim cod recovery measures: not just the fish-catching sector, but whole communities."
"It is predicted that the long-term recovery plan will continue to inflict real economic and social hardship."
"I hope, therefore, that this House will unite in support of this resolution, calling for up to EUR 150 million of additional EU funding - and 'additional' is the important word here."
"This amount would be in addition to Member States' commitments, constituting a fund to help offset the widest possible range of economic and social consequences that the European Union fisheries management decision will inflict."
"My preference would be to aim for the use of the flexibility instrument for this."
"Not so long ago, as has been pointed out, the political will of this House and the Council, and the loss of fishing rights in Moroccan waters, brought about a similar, highly-concentrated downturn in activity."
"There will have to be detailed discussion of plans and priorities for the use of such a fund, but I certainly hope that this week we will take the first step towards setting it up."
"I call upon the UK Government to abandon its previous resistance to taking part in such a process."
"Mr President, it is very sad that we are having this debate tonight and that we need to give GBP 150 million in funding to help the fishing industry."
"It is because of the failure of the common fisheries policy that we are having to provide this money."
"We should also look at industrial fishing - and I know there are mixed views about this - in which sand eels are extracted from the sea bed."
"Sand eels are part of the food chain of the cod and these things are all linked."
"The process of having quotas for fish and throwing healthy fish overboard over the years has also contributed greatly to the position we are in."
"But we must now face up to the reality that cod stocks are low and that the families and communities involved in the fishing industry who need support should receive it."
"I strongly support the resolution to provide GBP 150 million of additional funding."
"I would urge the UK Government to take this up and use it in a very efficient way."
"One of the problems with funding of this type, as was found when it was used in Spanish waters, is that it is very difficult for the fishing boats, those tied up for the processing industry and others, to claim these funds."
"I would urge Commissioner Fischler to look at the way this money can be spent."
"If we offer people money and they cannot then obtain it, they will only end up more frustrated than they were before."
"I urge everybody to support this."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I am able to say straight away that I support the resolution."
"The resolution deals with those aspects we are discussing in Parliament and, in general, with what gives rise to the problems in the regions when we implement such dramatic decisions concerning certain fish stocks - in this case, cod in particular."
"There can be no doubt that there must be a balance in the marine environment."
"There must be a balance in the stocks."
"Clearly, such dramatic decisions can, however, be damaging to the regions and to those communities that depend upon fisheries and the industry surrounding fisheries. The EU must therefore intervene and raise some of these problems."
"In that connection, I should also like to draw attention to the fact that fisheries-based industry and gutting and canning firms must have raw materials, and it is therefore now time for us to review the tariff barriers that prevent the raw materials from reaching our companies in the EU."
"Price mechanisms and tariff barriers mean that the prices for these raw materials are very much higher than the prices for the same raw materials on the world market."
