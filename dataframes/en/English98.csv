"It needs to be functioning and to be independent."
"People need to feel that they will have a fair trial, that they will see an end to detention without charge, an end to secret prisons and, indeed, a commitment from whatever government comes into being after the elections, to continue the inquiries into the disappearances that have also taken place in that country."
"We also agree that freedom of the press is vital, but we would also ask that some of our Member States cease contemplating extraditions to Pakistan at the moment until we can be sure that there is a fair and independent functioning judiciary."
"(NL) Madam President, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto is a tragedy for Pakistan and shows the immensity of the problems facing the country. We are talking about a country that has 165 million inhabitants, is in possession of nuclear weapons and is engaged in a fight against terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban."
"Naturally, it is of the utmost importance that political stability is achieved in Pakistan as soon as possible and that President Musharraf plays a major role in this at this time."
"Nevertheless, we must not turn a blind eye to the many major shortcomings in Mr Musharraf's policy."
"For example, his government's approach to the problem of terrorism has been much too lax."
"In large parts of the Afghan border region, for example, the Taliban and Al Qaeda have a free rein, and far too little is being done about this."
"By declaring a state of emergency on 3 November, Mr Musharraf also revealed a rather casual attitude to democracy."
"In addition, worryingly, fingers had already been pointed at him after the first attack on Benazir Bhutto on 18 October."
"The same happened after her actual assassination."
"His possible role in this must be clarified as soon as possible, because otherwise public confidence in the government will evaporate, and that can only play into the hands of Islamic extremists."
"Madam President, The Economist stated recently that Pakistan is the world's most dangerous nuclear arms state."
"Regrettably, in my view, President Musharraf's commitment to fully eradicating Islamist terror has always been lukewarm at best, and his control over the ISI or intelligence services, who allegedly are in bed with Islamists, is tenuous as well."
"Add to that the combustible issues of Kashmir, Baluchi separatism, Al Qa'ida and Taliban activity in the North-West Frontier territories and tribal areas causing mischief for NATO in Afghanistan, and you have a country on the point of implosion."
"Just as Benazir Bhutto's return to Pakistan offered the country a glimmer of hope, so her despicable assassination, whose culprits must be identified and punished, has taken the country back to the brink of catastrophe."
"A return to democracy is as difficult as ever."
"The assumption in the EU and the USA is that Musharraf, for all his autocratic tendencies, represents the safer bet in the war on terrorism."
"Pakistan's experience of democracy in the past 60 years has been troubled."
"Perhaps it is time now to abandon the hope that Western-style multiparty democracy can embed itself successfully in Pakistan, which has always been dominated by a tiny élite."
"It is more akin to a feudal hereditary monarchy, a fact underlined by the instant elevation of Benazir Bhutto's 19-year-old son to the leadership of the Pakistani People's Party, who will no doubt do very well at the imminent 18 February elections."
"The apparent choice for the West between Pakistan and India is also a false dichotomy."
"It is a hangover from the Cold War."
"India, as a strategic ally, is the best hope for progress, prosperity, peace and stability in South Asia."
"India's values are the EU's values - secular democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"Let us start supporting those who share our values before we try to persuade those who do not."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament South Asia Delegation warned the Government of Pakistan of weaknesses in Benazir Bhutto's security measures as early as November."
"Sadly our fears of terrorist attack were proved correct."
"Benazir Bhutto will continue to be a hero both for the people of Pakistan and for the international community."
"Her absence among the candidates calls the legitimacy of the forthcoming elections into question."
"The crisis in Pakistan is also an opportunity to guide the country towards the road of democracy."
"The Pakistani people have not elected General Musharraf as President."
"However, he now has the opportunity to choose whether to go down in history as a military dictator or a democratic president."
"As a statesman Mr Musharraf must surely understand that democracy must be the winner in elections, even if he will personally have to lose power."
"And we will want to ask Mr Musharraf this himself next week at a meeting of the international committee in Brussels."
"We in the European Union must persist in our dialogue with Pakistan."
"That is precisely why, as the committee rightly said, we must send our own observers to the elections of 18 February."
"Events in Pakistan must not be a matter solely for the USA."
"A transparent international investigation into the assassination of Mrs Bhutto, the full restoration of freedom of the press and free and fair elections in Pakistan are also an essential issue for the European Union."
"We will not achieve our targets by playing the by-stander."
"We have no alternative but to pursue an active policy in relations with Pakistan."
"Madam President, I echo completely the statements made by colleagues, but I want to say something more about the person rather than the situation."
"There is a saying in Finnish that war is not dependent on one man."
"That might be so, but the war between democracy and extremism might be very dependent on one woman."
"I think of the former, and now murdered, Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mrs Benazir Bhutto."
"I had the pleasure of meeting her and working with her and was deeply impressed by how warm, intelligent and brave she was."
"I am so proud to say that, to me, she was a friend and a political ally."
"So much has now been said and written about her that you might ask what more can be said."
"I think that I can share something that you did not, perhaps, know."
"Her last big project for democracy, human rights and women's rights was the creation of an organisation called Muslim Women for Democracy and Human Rights."
"Together with other brave women like Asma Jehangir from Pakistan and Dr Shrin Ebadi from Iran, she created an organisation to encourage Muslim women around the world to stand up for the rights that the Koran gives women, according to Benazir Bhutto, but that had been denied for centuries."
"She was elected by the world's leading Muslim women democracy activists in May 2007 to be the first chairwoman of this new organisation."
"Benazir Bhutto wanted the organisation to comfort Muslim women, to give them legal advice and practical help and, above all, help them to form a network of Muslim women around the world to build a world of peace, where different religions could live in peace and with respect."
"She said, 'I want to build a Pakistan where a Jew can go to the synagogue, a Christian to the church and a Muslim to the mosque, all without any fear'."
"Her dream was that the new organisation could help this dream come true all over the world, both in the West and in the Muslim world."
"I think that the best way to honour the memory of this brave sister for democracy is to support the organisation that she created as a sign of hope, even after she is gone."
"- (DE) Mr President, Benazir Bhutto is said to have told her son: implementing democracy in Pakistan is our revenge on military rule."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have to ensure that Benazir Bhutto's legacy is not just a mandate to her son, but to us all and to the international community to ensure that the conditions for democracy are established in Pakistan and that we help to establish them."
"The situation there is not good, as many speakers have already said. And the way in which this attack on Benazir Bhutto was dealt with is truly alarming."
"I would also ask that we ensure that there is an international investigation into this assassination."
"Scotland Yard may already be doing some preparatory work on this, but I think it would be good if this investigation were to take place by order of the UN."
"Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, you have said that stability in Pakistan is in our interest."
"Very well, but we are only looking, as ever, at the minority of terrorists."
"When you are in Pakistan, you will hear that the military system creates instability and President Musharraf is making a substantial contribution to the worsening situation."
"Last year he was here in Parliament."
"We outlined all our main criticisms to him. Nothing has improved and a lot has got worse and therefore I really don't understand how it is that he can come here to this Parliament again next week."
"Civil society in Pakistan sees this as covert complicity in that when it comes down to it, the West accepts both the military system and Mr°Musharraf himself."
"I believe we should make this very clear next week."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Pakistan is now truly an extremely dangerous place, the central tangled knot where all the threads of terrorism are interwoven."
"At the same time, however, the country is the West's main ally against terrorism."
"There is no escaping this contradiction, just as no end will be possible to the war in Afghanistan without resolving it."
"Current European policy is not in a position to resolve very much, at least until it acts in support of the United States' policy."
"We can and must ask President Musharraf to restore the constitution and hold proper elections."
"The message of the strange, tragic assassination of Benazir Bhutto is, however, that we are impotent, and this is because terrorism in Pakistan lies behind the structures of the State, and actually stems from the secret services which - let us not forget - built the Taliban and to this day support and assist them."
"Now, however, we should ask President Musharraf to carry out a purge and we should ask the United States, which has very close relations with those secret services, to clarify those relations to us, because if Osama bin Laden is still alive, it would be thanks to those services, unless he has already been killed."
"What is more, I would like to remind you that Benazir Bhutto spoke of this in an interview for Al Jazeera on 2 November 2007, and also named bin Laden's assassin, Omar Sheikh, whom President Musharraf in his latest book claims was a former agent of the British MI6."
"In view of all this, I believe that a request for an international commission of enquiry into the death of Benazir Bhutto would be the right decision on Europe's part."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like to give condolences to the family and friends of Benazir Bhutto."
"Her loss is not just Pakistan's but is a loss to the whole world."
"I am very proud to have known her personally."
"She invited me to join her on her return to Pakistan, and it was very much a heart-wrenching moment for me when I received her New Year's greetings days after she had been murdered."
"I remember Benazir as a very strong charismatic woman, asserting her right to rule as the first elected female leader, at the age of 35, of a Muslim state."
"I believe she will be remembered as one of the great figures of our century - a leader who inspired both women and men beyond South Asia and represented, above all, hope for a better future for Pakistan."
"Benazir's death has caused upheaval in her country, and I believe the only route to stability will be if questions that are being asked about her assassination are answered."
"Many people, not just in Pakistan but also those I represent in the West Midlands, want to know who the real culprits are."
"Therefore, I ask the Council to strongly support the calls for international investigation by the United Nations into the murder and I ask the Council and the Commission to inform this House what their position is on this."
"Benazir Bhutto fought for a democratic Pakistan and a peaceful transition to civilian rule."
"Her fight cost her her life."
"Let her death not be in vain."
"We need to continue this cause, and I welcome the fact that the Commissioner is sending a strong electoral observation mission."
"However, if this observation mission is to have credibility, it needs to indicate now to the Pakistani authorities the benchmarks the election observation mission will be using to judge whether the forthcoming elections are free and fair, and this includes an all-party participation in the review of the electoral rules and procedures and an impartial system of conducting elections and verifying election results that is totally transparent."
"But, above all, I would really like to emphasise the need for all press restrictions to be lifted and freedom to assemble for political rallies and campaigns, which, in the last few weeks, have been opposed."
"Mr President, the tragic death of Benazir Bhutto has left us a legacy, and that is an important legacy: to believe in what she believed in, and this was the power of the Pakistani people to rule by democracy."
"In a recent poll as early as November of last year, 70% of people in Pakistan confirmed that they wanted all the restrictions lifted on political rallies; that they were against the banning of political events and opposed the detention of the Supreme Court Chief Justice."
"This is the silent majority of Pakistanis who want to live in peace and democracy, and if we are looking for stability in such a volatile country, we can only find it through a political process of reconciliation and democracy."
"I welcome the Commission's appeal to send an observer mission to this election but I have two questions for the Commissioner: one is, we have heard various reports of voting lists being destroyed around the country and how can an election take place in this environment?"
"Secondly, President Musharraf has also banned independent exit polls on this election."
"I press on the Commission to make a very strong case before the Pakistani authorities to allow independent confirmation of the results of this election."
"Mr President, the target of the assassins was not simply Benazir Bhutto, but all of those who are committed to the principle of democracy."
"We should be backing the moderate majority in Pakistan who seek to uphold democracy, and Mr Tannock is wrong to say that all in Pakistan reject European values, as 800 000 British people of Pakistani origin could tell him."
"I welcome Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's strengthening of the EU electoral observation mission and recognise our important role in building confidence in the electoral process."
"Through her and through today's debate, I call on Pakistan to lift all restrictions on political campaigning, to release remaining political detainees, to publish in advance the location of all polling stations and to ensure that all results are posted immediately in public."
"We should welcome the lifting of the state of emergency, President Musharraf's retirement as Army Chief of Staff and the invitation to my own country, the United Kingdom, to assist in the investigation of Mrs Bhutto's death."
"Militant extremists are not simply a threat in Pakistan: they are a threat to us all."
"Mr President, on 14 November in this House, I stated that the biggest threat facing Pakistan internally is the terrorist threat."
"The abhorrent assassination of Benazir Bhutto is proof of this, if it was required."
"Extremists hit that day but they must not be allowed to win the day."
"We called for President Musharraf on that day to end the state of emergency, to reinstate the constitution, to reinstate the Supreme Court and move towards free and fair elections."
"He has done all of this, albeit not necessarily perfectly, and he has relinquished his army role as well."
"We must call upon Pakistan's politicians to unite and invest in that process."
"Pakistan is facing turbulent times and we must stand with it."
"Just one further point. I have real concerns regarding the way in which what actually happens in this House is being distorted by some sections of Pakistan's media in their reporting, particularly the news channel GEO."
"This House has always argued for a free and fair media."
"We stand by that and I ask them: please do not abuse the freedoms we hold dear."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I understand very well the concern shared by many, including you and Bernard Kouchner, to send an election mission to Pakistan."
"It is actually one of the only ways left to us of exerting pressure on Mr Musharraf, but we should realise that this observation mission would take place under very special conditions."
"We usually study and make observations before, during and after."
"Regarding what has happened before, we already know how many things have been rigged."
"Benazir Bhutto, with Mr Latif Khosa, had written a 160-page report on the possible rigging of these elections, particularly using computers, a report that she was going to give to two American congressmen the evening of the day she died."
"Do we currently have the ability to check for computerised rigging in election observation missions?"
"If not, we could then decide that even though the 'before' was more than a little dubious, the 'during' has been regular even if there has been fraud."
"Consequently I would ask for a very special observation mission, and I ask that we do not declare these elections to be democratic when we cannot check this."
"(RO) Benazir Bhutto repeats the tragic destiny of her family, started by her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto."
"The assassination of Mrs Bhutto was intended to put an end to the democratisation of Pakistan and to undermine the stability of this country which, as we should not forget, is our main ally in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan."
"Let me remind you that 25 European Member States currently have civilian or military representatives in Afghanistan."
"The Pakistani army is involved in important operations for maintaining a military balance on the Afghan border, particularly in the provinces of Zabol and Helmand, where we are represented mainly by British, Lithuanian, and Romanian troops."
"In this respect, it is very important to discuss responsibility for Mrs Bhutto's assassination, it is very important to discuss the democratisation process and its continuation, but it is equally important to discuss the issue of maintaining a military balance on the Afghan border and who might act as guarantor of this balance, because, Mr President, any failure in Afghanistan owing to instability in Pakistan would be a disgraceful moment for the free, democratic world that we stand for."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to reply to Mr Howitt under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure, because he was incorrect in what he stated."
"I was referring to the Indian State and the Pakistani State and the governments of both countries - not the peoples of the countries or the people of descent of those countries who live within the Member States of the European Union."
"I was referring to the polities, not the people, so I would like Mr Howitt to withdraw his comments."
"I can give you thirty seconds to conclude."
"That is very kind but I think I have already said it all."
"I was just simply stating that in my speech, I was referring to the fact that India is a secular democracy which respects human rights, does not shut down the media, does not actually persecute Christians or Ahmadi Muslims, and allows the people to express their views and practice their religion."
"Regrettably, Pakistan, over the last 50 or so years, has had troubled periods of military dictatorship and repression of religious minorities and ethnic minorities."
"That is to do with the state and the governments, not the peoples of either country."
"Similarly, I do not in any way doubt that people of Pakistani and Indian descent in London, which I represent, would share EU values."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I will be brief."
"There were a few questions regarding the investigation, several calls for an independent or international investigation and a few questions for the Council regarding its opinion."
"I would like to stress that the Council did not discuss this question, so we cannot talk about the Council's position."
"However, I can express the firm belief of the Presidency that the investigation will be carried out in accordance with international standards."
"In this respect, we are pleased that at least one Member State, the United Kingdom, is already cooperating by providing appropriate expertise to the appropriate Pakistani authorities."
"Regarding the elections, I would like to remind you of the statement published by the Presidency on 3 January of this year, where special emphasis was placed on the need to do everything at this time to maintain, strengthen and continue the process of democratisation and the democracy and democratic process in Pakistan."
"In this connection, I would like to welcome again the European Commission's decision to reinforce the election observation mission in Pakistan, and I would like to repeat our appeal to the Pakistani authorities to use the remaining time leading up to the election to improve the situation and the conduct of the elections."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me begin by making some general remarks following this very interesting debate."
"I know that some will always argue that stability and democracy are somehow incompatible in Pakistan."
"Let me say I think that, without a return to democratic governance and the consolidation of fully accountable civilian institutions, there cannot be enduring stability in the country and the extremists will be the main beneficiaries."
"For that reason, it is very important that we are there, that we accompany this country to more progress."
"Even though there was this terrible tragic death of Benazir Bhutto and of many other victims, I continue to believe that Pakistan has a chance to make real progress towards stability and a more inclusive form of democracy by electing a new government which enjoys broader popular legitimacy."
"For this to happen, the elections will have to be democratic and transparent."
"This is a crucial time for Pakistan when President Musharraf should demonstrate to his country and to the world that he is committed to ensuring that these elections will be held democratically and transparently, in accordance with international standards."
"What are the best conditions for carrying out elections?"
"Other than political and security conditions, as I have already outlined in my opening remarks, the following key elements need to be there for a proper election environment."
"Firstly, the election administration to operate in a transparent and consultative manner to promote confidence among voters; secondly, that all polling station results and all levels of result consolidation are publicly displayed; thirdly, the counting and tabulation process needs to be fully open to scrutiny; fourthly, media freedom and, fifthly, an independent framework for a complaints and appeals procedure."
"Concerning the public publishing of polling stations, it is well known that they will be the same polling stations as the last elections. So that is clear."
"Concerning the question that some voting lists have been destroyed, we know that there were some individual cases, but, fortunately, they were all stored on CDs with the Electoral Commission and the destroyed ones will be restored."
"Therefore, they will be available."
"Concerning independent exit polls, this is not an essential element for the elections."
"However, it is increasingly the practice in many countries that this should also be there."
"These are some of the detailed matters:"
"Let me now turn to the investigations."
"As I mentioned in my opening remarks, an investigation is under way in the country, which is being assisted by Scotland Yard."
"We should await the outcome of that investigation and we should also trust that, with its experience, Scotland Yard will be able to help the Pakistani authorities."
"Of course, it will be necessary to give them full access and support in doing that job."
"After the elections, there might be a role then for an international group of eminent persons, but first we have to see what the inquiry will bring."
"I think it is too early to take a decision now."
"There was only a brief discussion in the Council working group, which was not conclusive."
"Having said that, let me also say that it is highly important to help Pakistan in its fight against terrorism, and all the other requests mentioned in the debate, such as the release of all detainees, will be crucial."
"I also stated very clearly that for a country like Pakistan it is important that there is a better focus on education."
"We have been doing that for some time, and it will take time - we are there for the long haul."
"But if we want democracy, this is something where we really have to make a difference and, therefore, I would like to maintain my cooperation projects, particularly in the most difficult areas, i.e. the North-West Frontier Province, Baluchistan, Waziristan and so on."
"I would again like to say that with Mr Gahler, your colleague, the Chief Election Observer, I think we have a person who has already shown in those very difficult days in Pakistan how responsibly he has been taking on these things, with 52 long-term observers and with 11 people of a core team who are looking at all the detailed questions of the election observation mission."
"It will be a very specific one and it will be a good opportunity for you to tell President Musharraf yourself what you think."
"Therefore, it is good that you see him in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"- (CS) Mr President, may I please ask you how a decent woman should draw attention to herself by means of the 'catch-the-eye' method when she is sitting at the far end of the House?"
"I would like to know whether I have been included in the list, or how ladies should go about it here."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I was probably the first person to apply this afternoon under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure."
"I do not know why you denied me the opportunity to speak. Indeed, you gave an extra opportunity to one of my colleagues who had already spoken in the debate."
"You then gave him more time!"
"I had no disagreement with what he said."
"It was just the procedure that you followed, and I think it was quite wrong that you denied me the opportunity to speak."
"I wanted to make the point that we need a stable and reliable government in Pakistan."
"?- Mr Van Orden, I was informed that you had already spoken today under the catch-the-eye procedure and, therefore, having regard to the rules which were drawn up to ensure that Members' speeches covered as broad a spectrum as possible, I took my decision which obviously left you out this time."
"I would, however, remind you that there will be other occasions when you will have the opportunity to speak."
"In any case, you have been placed on the list and that will certainly be respected."
"We must continue, otherwise we shall not have time for questions."
"I am sorry, but we cannot continue this dialogue."
"Therefore, the next item is questions to the Council."
"Mr President, what you have just said is incorrect."
"The previous 'catch-your-eye' opportunity was because there was no one else that wanted to catch the eye, so it seemed to be an opportunity."
"I had specifically asked to speak in this Pakistan debate."
"I put it in writing and I indicated throughout the debate that I wanted to speak."
"There was no excuse, therefore, for denying me that opportunity, and I had important comments that I wanted to make."
"I am afraid that I am very disappointed in the way that you have conducted this particular meeting."
"Your protest is noted, Mr Van Orden."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0001/2008)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Council."
"Subject: Youth Working Party"
"How does the Council intend to implement its priorities in the youth field which were presented at the Council's Youth Working Party in December 2007 and in particular the role of volunteering in this area?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) With your help we will certainly succeed more easily."
"Regarding the answer to the question by Ms Harkin, I would firstly like to draw attention to the Council's latest initiative relating to her question."
"It concerns the resolution on voluntary youth activities adopted by the Council on 16 November 2007."
"The purpose of this latest initiative is to confirm and consolidate the suitability and validity of common aims concerning voluntary youth activities which were defined back in 2004."
"In addition, this initiative stresses the intersectorial and transversal character of voluntary activities and the importance of encouraging companies to support such youth activities."
"In principle, the result confirmed the guidelines for action with which the Member States should comply in invigorating the realisation of common aims in the area of voluntary youth activities."
"The resolution invites the Member States to choose from the above-mentioned guidelines for action, by September of this year, those on which they intend to focus particularly, and to define national strategies and concrete measures for the implementation of those guidelines."
"Consequently, the Presidency is convinced that the issue of voluntary youth activities will remain among the priority political tasks of the Council and the Parliament."
"We are also relying on the Member States to complete the scheduled activities pursuant to this resolution by the given deadline, i.e. by September of this year."
"Mr President, my thanks to the Slovenian Presidency for its answer."
"President-in-Office, I too wish you well at the start of your Presidency."
"I am pleased to see that you are following on from the Portuguese Presidency - and indeed into the French Presidency - with your emphasis on volunteering, and in particular on youth volunteering."
"I hear what you say about Member States responding by September, but in the mean time, throughout the next six months of your Presidency, I believe you are looking at issues like youth inclusion and education to improve the employability of young people through volunteering, and looking at intercultural exchange."
"I just wanted to ask specifically if you have any plans at all to further inter-generational volunteering."
"Older people have a lot more time on their hands - we are living longer - and the whole aspect of inter-generational volunteering offers many positive opportunities."
"Do you have any initiatives on that?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Ms Harkin, at this moment I cannot offer you more concrete or more specific initiatives."
"We have concentrated on implementing the adopted resolution."
"It may be proper to invite the Member States at the appropriate time, i.e. to remind them of the set deadline."
"You are right: a range of activities in other areas will in any case offer an opportunity for additional topics and for the additional incorporation of issues regarding voluntary activities, including in the intergenerational sense."
"One of those activity channels is certainly an intercultural dialogue."
"In any case, we will consider your remark, i.e. we will take it into consideration when planning our activities in the next six months."
"- (LT) I would like to enquire about other measures to protect young people from addiction."
"In Parliament we discussed a European Commission strategy to combat alcohol-related damage."
"This is particularly damaging to young people."
"What measures besides voluntary activity could reduce that damage and protect young people from addiction?"
"Does Slovenia have any experience of this?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Certainly, care for the young will be one of the important topics of the Slovenian Presidency, particularly within the framework of the Lisbon strategy, which is a strategy for increasing growth and creating jobs."
"The Slovenian Presidency will pay particular attention to the issues of youth, especially in the context of education and their qualification for more effective inclusion in the labour market."
"This is all I personally know in detail of the more specific initiatives which the Slovenian Presidency is planning for its term of office."
"On the other hand, there is a whole range of activities in the area of health and the problem of the fight against alcoholism."
"I am convinced that, within this framework, appropriate attention will be paid to protecting the young from alcohol abuse."
"Subject: Multilateralism and bilateral agreements"
"Does the Council believe that the proliferation of bilateral trade agreements being signed by the USA, the EU and other international players is compatible with the multilateral principles which underpin the World Trade Organization?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) The European Union is committed to multilateralism in many forms, including the World Trade Organisation, which in our view is an excellent example of a multilateral organisation."
"Many decades prior to the actual founding of the World Trade Organisation, Europe called for the creation of such an organisation for trade."
"Later, the European Union had a key role in the creation of the World Trade Organisation within the Uruguay round of negotiations."
"Actually, if I may say so, it had a key role in that last round of the negotiations, which is why the support the European Union gives to multilateralism in trade cannot be doubted."
"Similarly, the EU had a key role when the agenda for development was adopted in Doha at the 4th Ministers' Conference of the World Trade Organisation in 2001."
"During the negotiations which followed, the European Union purposely decided to direct all resources and political will to concluding that round of negotiations."
"Prior to that round of negotiations or at the time of the actual negotiations, there were no parallel negotiations concerning bilateral trade agreements."
"In October 2006, the European Commission submitted to the European Parliament and the Council a report entitled ""Global Europe, competing in the world”."
"The report discusses recent changes resulting from the globalisation process."
"It offers suggestions for the European Union's response to that process on the basis of the updated Lisbon strategy, especially in respect of trade policies."
"On the basis of the report, the European Parliament adopted a resolution and the Council made decisions."
"The Council's decisions clearly show that all future bilateral agreements on free trade are going to form the basis of future multilateral negotiations and, what is possibly even more important, they will be complementary to the World Trade Organisation platform."
"Under the terms of the negotiation directives adopted by the Council in the spring of 2007, negotiations on free trade agreements were started with the member states of ASEAN and with India and Korea."
"Those negotiations are ongoing and each individual decision will be finalised in due course."
"(ES) Mr President, I think that the Slovenian Presidency responded correctly to the question I asked, with its typical clarity, and I am grateful for the attentiveness shown."
"I have an additional question relating to the relative failure of the Lisbon Summit with the African countries."
"It appears that some African countries agreed with the European Union's proposals and others did not."
"Based on the disagreements seen in Lisbon, does the Council Presidency think that it will be necessary to continue with this policy of differentiation?"
"In other words, are we going to insist on multilateralism, or do you think that the Lisbon Summit will force us to continue further along the road of bilateral agreements with different countries, for example, in the continent of Africa?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Our commitment to multilateralism continues."
"I would like to stress two points, should any bilateral agreements be concluded."
"Firstly, the agreements in question are complementary to the multilateral platform, and secondly, by the nature of things, the agreements in question have a bridging character until we manage to resolve these issues within a multilateral framework, the World Trade Organisation, this being the European Union's preferred framework for resolving such issues."
"- (DE) Mr President, my question is as follows: how will increased food and energy prices affect the WTO negotiations?"
"We do know that the biggest stumbling block so far has been subsidies and the Farm Bill in the United States and that Europe has of course suffered under increased world market prices."
"Are there new opportunities here for adjusting quotas and duties accordingly?"
"Is the Slovenian Presidency planning an initiative for bringing the WTO negotiations to an end?"
"(ES) Mr President, I agree with the Presidency that we should prioritise or attach greater importance to multilateral agreements than to bilateral agreements but, in the meantime, it is now many years since the Uruguay Round began, and the Doha Round before that, and the World Trade Organization is not reaching any serious conclusions, or at the very least it is putting it off too much."
"In the meantime, the United States, for example, has concluded free trade agreements with various South American countries."
"I would like to ask about this: what is the Council's view regarding the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, which has been so long awaited?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) The ever-increasing cost of energy, especially fuel, and of food is a global problem and therefore also a problem for the European Union."
"It will most certainly affect relations among those participating in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation."
"In that sense it might affect the adaptation, i.e. adjustment, of certain positions."
"At the moment, from the perspective of the Slovenian Presidency, it is difficult to speculate on the nature of those effects, but they are very likely and must be expected to arise."
"The Slovenian Presidency is not planning any initiatives of its own, but we will study and support appropriate initiatives coming from the Commission, which is of course responsible for the operational management of this process."
"As regards the fate of multilateral negotiations so far, the Slovenian Presidency is one of those who regret the fact that there is still no multilateral agreement within the World Trade Organisation."
"We will continue striving to bring it to fruition."
"In this context, we will debate the trade agreement with the Mercosur countries as well, which also present an opportunity for discussion at the fringes of the summit between the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC)."
"We are planning a special meeting between the European Union troika and the Mercosur countries, which will take place in May at the fringes of the summit between the EU and the LAC countries in Lima, Peru."
"Subject: Measures to promote family-friendly policies"
"What measures will the Council take to promote family-friendly policies and how does it intend to support the European Alliance for Families decided on by the Council in March 2007?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) The European Union should take advantage of the decisive contribution offered by the European exchange of good practice, in view of the fact that it is the Member States which are responsible for the shaping of appropriate and sustainable family policies."
"These exchanges may reinforce social cohesion and in that way contribute to the realisation of the Lisbon strategy objectives, among others."
"Therefore, the Presidency is of the opinion that the Alliance for Families is a very useful forum for the exchange of opinions and good practices, as mentioned above."
"The Presidency is also convinced that the Alliance for Families reflects the obligation of the European Union and its Member States to discuss, in the light of demographic changes, the issues relating to family-friendly policies."
"The Alliance enables the Member States to exchange information and experiences and in that way to help each other in the search for appropriate political responses."
"At the same time, the Presidency is of the opinion that there is no need for any new structures at the European level, but we will strive to capitalise on the existing instruments and structures."
"Last May the Council adopted extensive decisions on the practical working of the Alliance for Families."
"The Council prepared these decisions together with the Member States, thereby respecting the important role of the Member States in this area."
"The Council re-emphasised its commitment to the Alliance for Families through the decisions relating to the balanced roles of men and women, recently adopted on 5 December 2007."
"- (EL) Mr President, I would like to thank the Slovenian Presidency for their reply and to ask, in addition, what specific exchanges of technological experience it has discovered so far and who is responsible for the management of these provisions of technical assistance."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) These changes are implemented not by the Presidency but through the Alliance for Families."
"That is why I do not have the details you are asking about."
"However, I may enquire and inform you later."
"Mr President, I would like to wish the Slovenian Presidency the best of luck at the start of their Presidency and their first Question Time."
"Concerning the question raised by my colleague, three things immediately arise with regard to family friendly policies."
"Firstly, children and the rights of children too often are seen as separate from what should be family policy."
"Secondly, the whole issue with regard to how we actually encourage - we all have the idea of balancing work and family life - greater participation within family life."
"Thirdly, most importantly of all, those people that are forced out of their homes because of migration or being refugees and also the issue of family reunifications."
"Are there any proposals coming from the Slovenian Presidency with regard to that?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to reiterate that the Slovenian Presidency is placing particular emphasis on youth employment, especially for young parents."
"This is part of the answer to the question."
"The Presidency will pay special attention to creating new opportunities for the harmonisation of work and family life: shorter working hours, flexible forms of work, exercising of fathers' rights, and so on."
"Another special area is the stimulation of intergenerational solidarity."
"This is a particularly topical idea, especially in those regions where the older generation already represents the majority, which is the case in most of Europe."
"Of course, such an incentive will only be effective if it is supported by policies covering different spheres of activity that will stimulate the positive aspects of social life."
"In short, there is a whole range of measures which are being planned in various fields of EU activities and which are important for stimulating family-friendly policies."
"It would be difficult for me to list all these activities, but they can be found among the many spheres of activity planned by the Slovenian Presidency."
"I have just mentioned some of the fields concerned."
"Thank you for your reply."
"I am really pleased to hear that the Slovenian Presidency is particularly interested in putting forward family-friendly policies."
"You yourself mentioned demographic changes."
"Of course, because of the fact that we are living longer, it will mean an increased need for carers."
"Most carers tend to be family carers."
"You spoke about exchange of best practice."
"We have competence in the area of employment, for example."
"While most carers are unpaid, in that particular area, does the Slovenian Presidency have any initiatives to put forward on the issue of carers and, in that context, family-friendly policies?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) No, I do not think that at this moment we are considering a concrete suggestion aimed at protecting the interests of the category of people you are talking about."
"However, your question gives cause to consider whether that should be one of the fields."
"Naturally, as the Presidency, we are prepared to give it some thought."
"Subject: Initiatives by the Slovene Presidency regarding a new approach to neighbourhood policy and energy"
"A new approach to neighbourhood policy and energy is one of the initiatives adopted by the Slovene Presidency."
"In view of the intrinsic link between these two policy areas in the context of EU strategy regarding energy autonomy and independence from neighbouring countries, can the Council indicate how it intends to structure the actions envisaged?"
"More specifically, how does it view future relations in the wider Balkan area in the field of energy?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) In answering this question I will focus on the energy aspects, because that is how we understood the question."
"In March 2006 the European Council adopted the energy policy for Europe."
"The three principal political objectives of this policy are: firstly to increase the reliability of supply, secondly to secure the competitiveness of the European economies and the availability of energy at affordable prices, and thirdly to encourage environmental sustainability and strive to solve the climate change problem."
"In accordance with these three policy objectives, within the scope of the external energy policy, the Council is cooperating closely with third countries on the implementation and further development of its energy programme."
"The international energy policy is also one of the priority policy areas defined by The European Council in its decisions of March 2007."
"The European Council stressed at that time that full advantage should be taken of the existing instruments to strengthen the bilateral cooperation of the European Union with all suppliers."
"As regards the western Balkans, the main existing instrument in the field of energy cooperation is the Energy Community Treaty."
"The purpose of this treaty is to widen the energy market already existing in the European Community to include the countries of that region, i.e. to the countries of the western Balkans."
"In addition, every Stabilisation and Accession Agreement concluded between the European Union and the countries of the western Balkans foresees close cooperation in the area of energy."
"The Council is also planning to take full advantage of the existing instruments of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"In short, when developing new initiatives in the area of energy, within the framework of relations between the European Union and third countries, we are striving to take full advantage of existing mechanisms in the case of the countries of the western Balkans."
"I have already mentioned the Energy Community Treaty, and we will also use the existing mechanisms within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"- (EL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, please add my own wishes for a successful programming period for the Slovenian Presidency to the many that have already been expressed."
"Today we shall debate the South Caucasus and the Black Sea."
"I should like to ask the Presidency whether it intends to give priority to the institutionalisation of cross-regional cooperation between the European Union and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. I would specifically like to ask if intensive cooperation is planned in the energy sector, which is of vital importance for southern Europe."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you for the supplementary question and for your good wishes."
"Firstly, we fully agree with the assessment that the Black Sea basin is a very important region as regards the energy policy of the European Union, and above all as regards the external dimensions of the policy."
"Secondly, in reply to your question whether it is possible to institutionalise relations with that region in the future, the answer is ""yes, it is possible”."
"Perhaps it could be done in the same way it was done with the countries of the western Balkans, i.e. with the Energy Community Treaty, or maybe in some other way."
"In any case, the Slovenian Presidency considers the Black Sea basin, the Black Sea region and the Black Sea synergy as one of the important priorities within the European Neighbourhood Policy."
"Mr President, may I complement the President-in-Office on the start of the Slovenian Presidency - and of course on the Slovenian Presidency tie, which is actually quite trendy."
"My congratulations on that."
"My question is more broadly on energy and that is, firstly, what is the Slovenian position on increasing nuclear inside the borders of Europe?"
"Secondly, what is the position of the Slovenian Presidency on increasing nuclear power on the neighbourhood side?"
"Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Slovenia on this day and to ask a question about this so-called North Stream gas pipeline."
"As you know, this pipeline will connect Russia with Germany and some other European states; as you know, there are some problems concerning the environment, among others."
"How does the Presidency evaluate this project?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you for those supplementary questions."
"As regards the use of nuclear energy, the Presidency is of the firm opinion that the decision on the introduction, further use and possible increase in the use of nuclear energy is entirely up to the Member States."
"The Presidency will adhere to that position."
"The second part of your question, Mr Stubb, related to Slovenia."
"Slovenia is known to be one of the countries that uses nuclear energy."
"There is a possibility, but no decision on the matter, that the use of nuclear energy will increase, i.e. that Slovenia will resort to it in the future as well."
"As regards the North Stream project, it is not an EU project but a project of the directly participating countries."
"The EU, the Council and the Presidency do not hold any positions regarding this particular case."
"However, the EU holds a general position regarding projects which we, as the EU, would like to see realised."
"In this respect I would like to mention above all the Nabucco gas pipeline."
"This means that we have an opinion about this project because it is an EU project and our opinion is positive."
"It is the opinion that the European Union, wishing to develop its energy policy at the European level, must continue with such projects, and, as the Presidency, we will support them."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) There have been already five conferences in Brussels about the shape of the forces: on 3 November last year, on 1 December last year and, most recently, a few days ago on 11 January this year."
"As in every operation of this kind, the difficulty of shaping forces has again been demonstrated."
"However, I am pleased to inform you that the fifth, i.e. last, conference on the shaping of the forces was successful and the European Union now has all the necessary capabilities at its disposal."
"The decision on the starting date for the mission is expected to be adopted at the session of the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council at the end of this month, 28 January 2008."
"The initial operational capability is expected to be reached by the end of January or at the beginning of February."
"It will include special units with some infantry units and a selection of technical, logistic and medical means to prepare the ground for major deployment."
"General deployment of the peace forces is foreseen for May, before the start of the rainy season."
"In this phase, the EUFOR units in Chad should amount to 4000 troops."
"As regards the recent military conflict between the rebel and Chad governmental forces in western Chad, the Council deeply deplores the attacks by the rebels which led to the present fighting."
"In the decisions of 10 December, the Council expressed its deep concern and called on the Chad government to cooperate with Sudan and Libya in creating the necessary conditions for reaching a lasting political solution based on the Sirta Peace Agreement."
"The Council called on the Chad and Sudanese governments to fulfil the obligations they accepted in the Treaty of Tripoli and, in particular, to stop assisting the armed movements that are causing the instability of this region."
"In view of the fact that the rebel forces are carrying out their actions from Darfur as well, the Council is reminding the Sudanese government of its responsibility to prevent armed groups from crossing the border with Chad."
"The Council is aware of the fact that lasting results may be reached only through political solution, and it is therefore emphasizing the importance of the political agreement on consolidation of the democratic process in Chad, signed on 13 August last year."
"I would just like to wish the Slovenians well in their Presidency over the next six months and to thank them for the reply."
"In relation to the decision which was taken in mid-September by the EU Council to make an EU force available, I am a bit concerned that the timescale has been allowed to lapse."
"I am just wondering whether there is a lesson that we should learn from this: that, before we give a commitment, we have the operation ready to move, because of certain things that have occurred since."
"The second part of my question was in relation to humanitarian aid."
"We gave humanitarian aid to Chad in 2007."
"Are we going to increase that level of aid for 2008 now that we have a direct involvement in it over the next 12 months?"
"Mr President, I would like to wish the Slovenian Presidency every success for its term over the next six months, and also to wish a safe and successful peace-keeping mission to the EU forces that are going to Chad."
"I am very proud to say that this mission is being headed by a fellow Irishman, Lieutenant-General Patrick Nash, and I wish him well also."
"Does the Council agree that the EU peacekeeping missions must continue to cooperate fully with the United Nations and that the deployment of EU peacekeeping forces should take place only when a United Nations resolution supports such a mission?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Firstly, Mr Burke's question."
"Certainly it is one more lesson in the long line of lessons which perhaps teach us mainly one thing: it is easier to adopt a decision in principle than to ensure its implementation."
"Nevertheless, we were successful in that process."
"It took a while, but I think that not only the agreement, but also the agreement regarding the implementation itself, was reached at the right moment."
"As regards the second question, I would like to say that it is one of principle, which should of course be resolved pursuant to international law and the United Nations Charter."
"Naturally, it is proper that peace-keeping and peace-making operations are about cooperation under the patronage of the United Nations."
"This does not mean that the European Union is not also capable of independently adopting decisions regarding its own missions of a different nature."
"- (PL) Mr President, this will be more of an opinion, I think."
"Poland provides 10% of the armed forces in Chad, which means about 400 soldiers, so I would like to appeal to the Slovenian Presidency to do everything it can to ensure that this mission ends successfully."
"It must be a well-prepared mission, one which is very well equipped, and we know that the initiator of this mission was France."
"I would therefore like to ask Slovenia, as holder of the Presidency, to be very exacting with France, the leader of this mission."
"Logistically, this has to be ... or rather, I would once again emphasise that Europe must not compromise itself."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Only to express gratitude to Poland and, of course, other countries that are contributing forces to this important operation."
"Subject: Protection of EU citizens in Muslim countries"
"In November of last year, a British teacher was accused of insulting Islam while teaching in Sudan after allowing her class of seven-year-olds to name a teddy bear Mohammed."
"If convicted she could face 40 lashes, a large fine or a jail sentence."
"What can the EU do to give better protection to innocent EU citizens in Muslim countries who find themselves in terrible situations such as this?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) The case referred to in Mr Mitchell's question is the case of a woman of British citizenship who was in a third country and came under the jurisdiction of the national legislation of that country."
"On the basis of her citizenship, the above-mentioned citizen was guaranteed consular protection by the country in which she is a citizen."
"As we know, the British citizen was released in the meantime and returned to the United Kingdom."
"It follows from this that such cases are resolved through bilateral relations between the Member State in question and the third country."
"Naturally, cases may arise where additional political measures are appropriate and where EU representatives are asked to get involved in matters of this kind and in resolving such bilateral issues."
"In specific cases, this may lead to official statements and initiatives by the European Union."
"I would like to reiterate that, in principle, as in this particular case, it is an issue which is usually resolved at the level of relations between the third country and the EU Member State of which the person is a citizen."
"I thank the President-in-Office for the reply and wish him well in his Presidency."
"The President-in-Office will no doubt be aware that every citizen of an EU Member State is also a citizen of the Union."
"My expectation would be that, if an EU citizen was visiting some state where he or she could have his arm or leg amputated, then the Union would see the horror in such a thing."
"Does the Union not also see the horror in somebody being treated in this way, potentially sentenced to 40 lashes and also perhaps a jail sentence?"
"Will the President-in-Office take steps to try to ensure that EU citizens visiting these regions are aware of the sort of cultural change they are entering into, and will the Presidency also try to ensure that the states we do business with expect us to expect of them better treatment for our citizens and for them not to be treated in this way?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you, Mr Mitchell, for your supplementary question."
"It is a question of consular protection for citizens."
"Such protection is still the domain of the Member States and it is up to the Member States to warn their citizens who are travelling to third countries about the dangers and traps they have to be aware of."
"On the other hand, on the principle of solidarity we already have a guarantee of help from other Member States which have diplomatic, i.e. consular, representation in a third country and which guarantee consular protection for the citizens of other Member States of the European Union which do not have their own consulate in the country in question."
"I think that is one important advantage of our Union."
"I have already said that, if required, it is certainly very probable, most probable, possible that the Union will also be involved in resolving cases such as the one mentioned."
"Luckily, in this case it was not necessary and the case was solved between the two countries, which we are happy about."
"- (DE) President-in-Office of the Council, you have rightly pointed out that bilateral contacts can help in resolving problem cases such as these."
"The Council has, however, signed the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights with the President of this House and the President of the Commission."
"In it we refer to human dignity and the ban on degrading and cruel punishment."
"Would it not therefore also be the Council's duty to assert this claim throughout the world on behalf of the European Union?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I repeat that it is still a duty of the Member States which possess the levers of consular protection."
"However, it is clear that the European Union gives a framework within which the Member States - and I am going to mention the principle of solidarity again - help each other in this area on the basis of the principle of solidarity."
"In any case, the Council, and I am sure other institutions, would not hesitate to do all they could at their level if the need arose."
"In other words, that does not exclude the fact that for the time being this protection is offered by the Member States and does not exclude additional action being taken by an individual institution of the European Union."
"What follows from the case presented in Mr Mitchell's question is only that the case was resolved between the two countries, although that does not mean that it would not have been tackled at a higher, even European level, had the need arisen."
"Subject: Biodiversity and climate change"
"According to the IPCC fourth assessment report, during this century 'the resilience of many ecosystems is likely to be exceeded by an unprecedented combination of change in climate and other global drivers' (e.g. spread of infectious diseases)."
"The IPCC estimates that roughly 60% of evaluated ecosystems are currently utilised unsustainably and show increasing signs of degradation."
"This alone will likely cause widespread biodiversity loss."
"At the EU level, the Commission's Green Paper on Climate Change Adaptation reminds us that: 'approximately 20-30% of plant and animal species in Europe (assessed so far) are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average temperature exceed 1.5-2.5 degrees C'."
"What concrete actions will the Slovenian Presidency take to prioritise the Gothenburg target to halt biodiversity loss by 2010, and to combat widespread biodiversity loss due to climate change and other global drivers?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I am convinced that Ms Doyle is familiar with the intention of the European Union to contribute to the ambitious outcome of the 9th Conference of the Signatories to the Biodiversity Convention."
"It will take place in Bonn in Germany in May 2008, i.e. during the Slovenian Presidency."
"The preservation of biodiversity is high on the list of priorities of our Presidency."
"The Council had already stressed the urgency of continuous and committed efforts at all levels to reach the target of perceptibly slowing down the decrease in biodiversity by the year 2010, and at the same time to reach the target mentioned by Ms Doyle in her question and set by the EU at the session of the European Council in Göteborg."
"In addition, the Member States are introducing concrete measures for implementation of the action plan to reduce the loss of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond."
"The plan makes provision for measures relating to biodiversity and climate change at the level of the European Union as well as at the global level."
"In its efforts to reach the target to slow down the decrease in biodiversity by the year 2010, the Presidency stresses the need for synergy between policies and activities in the areas of climate change and biodiversity, especially in respect of biodiversity in fresh water and marine environments, as well as biodiversity in forests."
"These targets, together with other targets for biodiversity preservation, have been set in the declaration entitled ""Countdown to 2010”."
"Meetings of Council working groups will be organised during the Slovenian Presidency."
"One will be among experts in forestry, climate change and biodiversity, and another among experts in international marine policies, fisheries and biodiversity."
"Equally, at the informal meeting of environment ministers in Slovenia in April, the biodiversity of forests will be presented as a challenge and an opportunity to prepare measures to alleviate climate change and to adjust to it at the European level."
"The Slovenian Presidency will also strive to improve cooperation as well as the implementation of appropriate decisions in various environmental agreements at national and regional levels."
"The European Commission amended its communication ""Halting the Loss of Biodiversity by 2010 - and Beyond” with the commitment to include the private sector in partnerships for the preservation of biodiversity."
"Recently, in November 2007, there was a high-level conference in Lisbon which debated the economy and biodiversity within this framework."
"The outcome of that conference, which included the Lisbon report on the economy and biodiversity, will be debated at the aforementioned 9th Conference of the Signatory Countries, which will take place in Germany during the Slovenian Presidency."
"It will also be discussed at the 5th World Congress of the International Alliance for the Preservation of Nature and Natural Resources, which will take place in Barcelona during the French Presidency."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, and best wishes for a very successful Presidency."
"It is the countdown to 2010 that concerns me."
"There is plenty of talk but no action in this area, and it is one of the great deceptions we have that we are actually going to show any change or any impact on the ground by 2010."
"I mean, I agree with synergies between different policies, but protection of biodiversity can help limit atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations because forests, peat lands and other man-made ecosystems and habitats store carbon."
"Do you think that monitoring change needs the best data available?"
"We need better information on the whole effects that climate change is having on Europe's biodiversity."
"If we make any progress towards 2010 we have to improve the indicators and measurements we use to know exactly how serious the situation is."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Ms Doyle, thank you for your added comment."
"I fully agree that we have to have the best possible indicators to establish the status of biodiversity."
"The Presidency will take into consideration your comment on the need to think about the necessity to improve these indicators and will reflect on it."
"2010 is really close: we have less than two years."
"You are right that in a field such as biodiversity it is difficult to imagine that, especially after a period which seems not to have been used to its best potential, this short time that remains will be enough to reach the set targets, namely the slowdown in the loss of biodiversity."
"However, this is not to say that it is impossible."
"We will do our best."
"Slovenia is one of the countries where biodiversity is of enormous importance because the level of biodiversity in our country is still high; this is well known, if for no other reason because of our bears, which we export to a large part of Europe."
"In brief, you can rely on the Slovenian Presidency to do its utmost to reach the target, regardless of the fact that there is very little time left."
"Could I just ask the Council to comment on the fact that the Commission is now reviewing the targets for biofuels, because what we thought might be good for climate change is now having unintended consequences when it comes to global food security, and indeed biodiversity."
"Is this not one of the difficulties for us human beings in tackling climate change: that we may get it wrong?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) This is proof that, perhaps, certain matters did not receive our due attention in the past."
"It is clear that the totally unsupervised and unrestrained production of biofuels must have possible negative consequences for the environment, biodiversity, food prices, and so on."
"I think it is fitting to devote special attention to that aspect too."
"In other words, we should encourage the production and consumption of biofuels to reduce rather than increase the burden on the environment."
"I think that should be a major guide for the Union in its policies to encourage the use of biofuels."
"Subject: Moving beyond GDP"
"Could the Council indicate how it intends to work with the Commission proposal to move beyond GDP as an indicator of regional cohesion, and could it say whether it has arrived at any definitive measures to be included in the future, to provide a more accurate measure of a region's performance?"
"Mrs McGuinness takes responsibility for this question originally asked by Jim Higgins."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to apologise to Mr Higgins and Ms McGuinness for my answer, which cannot be anything other than very short, because the Council can only discuss these things on the basis of a proposal by the Commission."
"Such a proposal has not been put forward, nor has a proposal for any other changes regarding regional cohesion indicators."
"Therefore, until such a proposal is made, the Council is unable to discuss it and take a position on any other regional cohesion indicators."
"Mr President, can I apologise on behalf of Mr Higgins, who is unwell this evening and cannot be here."
"I thank you for your short answer."
"I presume this will be linked with plans to redefine disadvantaged areas in Member States as well."
"Could I just suggest that, when you do have some information on some of the indicators, you might supply it to Mr Higgins."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I will try, thank you."
"I reiterate that it depends primarily on the Commission and maybe, maybe, but really only just maybe, there will be an opportunity, but not necessarily, to consider the indicators as well as the review of the cohesion policy which is being planned by the Slovenian Presidency at the moment."
"That depends on the Commission and not the Council."
"Of course, we would be interested to know what will be the contribution of the Commission to the debate on the review of the cohesion policy, which is one of the important tasks for our Presidency."
"- (DE) Mr President, even the European Parliament respects the Commission's right of initiative, as the Council has just expressed it."
"However, we shall therefore always let the Commission know what we believe is particularly important."
"Criteria such as unemployment or greater migration would certainly be subjects that could be introduced into the discussion here."
"Because you talked about the Slovenian brown bears in the previous question, as a Styrian I would like to say thank you for this export and I hope that the open Schengen border will lead to even more immigration."
"In terms of more accurate measurements of a region's performance, one must seriously question whether GDP is the right measurement of performance."
"Has any consideration been given, or will you be giving consideration (as you have only been in office for a week), to measuring GDP versus GNP versus GNI?"
"The big difficulty at the moment is that we are not measuring like with like, so it is very hard to measure performance across different regions - and across different countries, it is not just across regions alone - because the bases or indicators are not standardised at the moment."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) It would be very difficult for me to speak in the name of the Commission and I have no ambition to do so, because I would not be equal to the task."
"However, it seems that, at least for the time being, the Commission has not yet found a better indicator than GDP."
"I believe that, had the Commission found a better indicator, it would have proposed it."
"I would like to repeat my previous remark that the cohesion policy review gives an opportunity to consider your question too."
"There are going to be even more opportunities when the complete reform of the European Union budget is discussed, which, as we already know, will be done on the basis of the total analysis to be conducted by the European Commission itself in 2008 and 2009."
"Subject: Investigation into care homes in Bulgaria"
"The BBC recently broadcast a documentary entitled 'Bulgaria's Abandoned Children' which depicted the shocking conditions experienced by the children living in a care home in Mogilino, Bulgaria."
"The producer of the programme has publicly stated that this home is not the worst case in Bulgaria."
"There is a perception that even though a problem evidently exists in relation to institutional care for children and young adults with disabilities, it does not appear to have been effectively addressed."
"Given the EU's adherence to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and the fact that we have just left behind the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, can the Council make a statement on this very sensitive matter?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) The Council has not adopted any position on the particular case cited by Ms McGuinness."
"Nevertheless, I can say with pleasure that on 5 December 2007 the Council adopted a resolution to continue with the European year of equal opportunities for all."
"That was 2007, i.e. last year, which according to this decision, i.e. this resolution, will not be a one-year event but will continue."
"Said resolution calls on the Member States and the European Commission to strengthen their efforts to prevent discrimination due to disability or for any other reason, to strengthen the fight against discrimination of this kind, to include the question of disability in all relevant policies and to continue the process of concluding, signing and ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities."
"With this resolution the Council is also calling on the Member States and the Commission to cooperate in the common challenges and look for a solution within the framework of the implementation of said convention, i.e. the UN convention."
"Allow me to stress here that the Council and the European Parliament recently received a Commission report on the status of the disabled in the European Union, which included the European action plan for 2008 and 2009."
"The Slovenian Presidency is of the opinion that this document should provide valuable guidelines for further endeavours in the enforcement of rights for the disabled, especially disabled children."
"The Council is still studying this proposal by the Commission."
"President-in-Office, thank you for your diplomacy."
"I hope you will understand if I am not diplomatic, because I do not think you realise the extent of anger and upset, particularly in the UK and Ireland, when this documentary was shown."
"I think - and I regret to say this - that if this was an animal welfare issue the Council would have a position on it."
"We are talking about children who have no voice."
"I really believe that it makes the EU look bad in the eyes of Member States and citizens of the European Union that we are slow to act when it comes to cases like this."
"I think it would be wonderful and we would get a great reaction from our citizens if we were more swift to act, because this is an unforgivable story."
"The pictures spoke for themselves."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I cannot and do not wish to go into the content of this affair, on which you, probably quite justifiably, have a strong opinion."
"However, I would like to stress that, in the opinion of the Council, it is important to respect and take into consideration the division of competences between the Union and the Member States."
"In this framework I may express myself only as a representative of the Council - and I am not being diplomatic here, but speaking within the limits of my competences and the competences of the Council, and of course out of respect for the movements within these frameworks."
"President-in-Office, can I join in expressing disappointment at the inadequacy of your reply?"
"When Bulgaria was being considered for accession, the treatment of people in institutions was made a live issue."
"But the mistake that was made was that, when in December 2006 we came to set the benchmarks - looking back upon how Bulgaria had matched its undertakings - mysteriously, this item was omitted from the benchmarks."
"Why was that?"
"And can it now be reinstated?"
"If not, what other steps can you realistically take so that the Council and the Community quite properly can look at the flagrant breaches which are afflicting this sector?"
"The speaker is absolutely right: I thought the answer from the Council was not sufficient."
"Before accession, we called on all Member States who wanted to come into the European Union to abide by European Union rules."
"I know Bulgaria has signed up to the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, but it has not ratified it."
"Can you put pressure on those countries that have not ratified that Convention to do just that?"
"I know the Bulgarian authorities are trying to address this problem, but we need to keep up the pressure."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I strongly reiterate that it is not within the competence of the Council, or even customary for the Council, to adopt a position regarding individual television programmes or their comments."
"In no way does this diminish the enormity of the problem you are talking about."
"However, I personally see the solution in what you said in your question, i.e. in the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities."
"That is precisely why, in my initial answer, I mentioned the resolution adopted by the Council in December 2007, which calls on the Member States to ratify said convention."
"Subject: Negotiating date for Macedonia"
"Does the Council foresee the possibility this year, i.e. during the Slovenian or French Presidency of the Council, of setting a date for launching accession negotiations with Macedonia?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I still do not know; sometimes it switches itself on and sometimes it doesn't."
"I apologise for these gaps."
"Of course, the Council does not and cannot exclude the possibility cited by Mr Posselt in his question."
"As we know, in December 2005 the European Council decided to accord candidate status to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"In accordance with the Council decisions of 12 December 2005, i.e. a few days prior to the session of the European Council, the country had to implement the Stabilisation and Association Agreement fully."
"The Commission has been preparing progress reports on this basis, and the 2006 and 2007 reports do not contain recommendations for the start of accession negotiations, the argument being that appropriate measures have still not been implemented."
"In 2008 the Presidency is expecting the leadership of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, from the entire political spectrum, to join forces in strengthening efforts to reach results in all the various fields where progress is needed, and, in view of the events in the country, especially the progress made over the last month, I would estimate that it should be possible this year to come a step closer to deciding on a date for the start of accession negotiations."
"The Slovenian Presidency is very keen on it, very keen on that progress, but it does depend on the country itself and on its success in exercising the measures, as well as the progress of reforms."
"- (DE) Many thanks for this very good response."
"Allow me as an exception to make a personal preliminary remark."
"In 1991, when Slovenia gained independence, I was at the independence celebrations in Ljubljana - as the only EU citizen, I believe."
"I was also in favour of the Association Agreement during the war in Ljubljana which, thankfully, was brief, and later as rapporteur for Parliament."
"I would simply like to say that today is a historic day for me."
"I am very happy."
"Please forgive the personal preliminary remark."
"Now an even shorter question: do you believe that the naming issue between Macedonia and Greece is a bilateral issue, and can a bilateral issue have an impact on accession negotiations?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to thank Mr Posselt for his support since the days of our independence."
"Actually, Slovenia has journeyed a long way, as was said by the President of the European Council this morning."
"Regarding your question, it is basically a bilateral matter of the name."
"However, we all know that for the resolution of this basically bilateral question, there is a mechanism, under United Nations patronage, involving a special representative, Mr Nimec, who is committed to mediating between both sides to bring about a solution."
"Slovenia, i.e. the Slovenian Presidency, supports these efforts and expects both sides to cooperate in a constructive way in this process until a proper solution is found."
"In the meantime, we are of the opinion that this question should not affect, let alone hinder, the integration of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into international organisations."
"I have a question for the Slovenian Presidency."
"I know it supports the view that we need long-term peace and stability in south-east Europe and the Balkans as a priority, and indeed economic development goes hand-in-hand with it, but in terms of Macedonia reaching the line to open negotiations on accession - the issue of the name apart (important though it is) - how does the Slovenian Presidency consider Macedonia would rate in comparison with other countries in that immediate area in reaching the accession line?"
"We want them all in, but some will be more prepared than others."
"How do you rate Macedonia's chances for priority accession?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you very much, Ms Doyle, for your supplementary question."
"The Slovenian Presidency classifies countries in the western Balkan region according to the stage they have reached."
"In this case, the most advanced country of the region is Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it is the only country which has been given candidate status."
"Croatia is excluded because it should be in a different category anyway, namely in the expansion category, because it is already negotiating for membership."
"I reiterate that, during our Presidency, we wish for every one of the countries, including the one in question, to make progress on its journey towards membership of the European Union, which will not happen soon, i.e. in a year or two, but will need more time and more effort."
"The Slovenian Presidency has placed this issue among its highest priorities."
"However, it is important to maintain the European perspective for those countries as well as their rate of progress towards this goal."
"I repeat that, as the Presidency, we would be very pleased if progress were to continue during our Presidency."
"I would like to repeat that this progress also depends largely on the countries of the region."
"- (EL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council on his very specific reply and, as a Greek MEP, I should like to say that we have a particular interest in all the Western Balkan States becoming members of the European Union as soon as possible."
"The problem, however, needs to be resolved."
"I would also like to say that Greece has made its good intentions clear and continues to do so daily in discussions on a compromise name."
"In this sense, then, I would say that account needs to be taken of the position of a Member State that displays considerable goodwill in this regard."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you for your comment."
"The President of the Council mentioned this morning the important achievement of the Greek Presidency in 2003, when the Thessaloniki Agenda for the Western Balkans was adopted."
"This Thessaloniki Agenda remains the foundation of the efforts of the Slovenian Presidency in its endeavour to integrate the western Balkans."
"This is why we are particularly counting on the support of Greece in these efforts pertaining the countries of the western Balkans."
"Question No 12 has been withdrawn."
"Subject: Reduction in VAT rates for environmentally friendly technologies and products"
"Does the Council agree that Community legislation on value added tax (VAT) should be adjusted so that reduced VAT rates can also be applied to technologies and applications involving renewable sources of energy and energy yield efficiency in addition to existing provisions governing the consumption of electricity and natural gas?"
"Does a time schedule exist for taking the relevant decisions?"
"What moves should we expect from the Council in this matter, and when?"
"President-in-Office. - (SL) As we know, at its session of 4 December 2007 the Council adopted a decision to arrange for a discussion on the economic effect of reduced rates and whether reduced rates of value added tax are a suitable tool for achieving the targets of sectorial policies."
"It was agreed that this question would be debated again at some point during 2008, not necessarily in the first half of the year."
"At the moment, the Slovenian Presidency is searching very hard for the most effective approach to continuing the discussion about value added tax rates, which are not uniform."
"As we know from the Commission report, this discussion started during the Portuguese Presidency."
"In this period of reflection, which I hope will be as short as possible, we are unable to answer Mr Vakalis more precisely."
"However, I would like to stress that this is an important question, which the Presidency is going to tackle with due attention."
"- (EL) Mr President, I consider the reply to be satisfactory, and I would also simply like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency on its successful start. I wish it all the best with the rest of its Presidency."
"Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."

"A European strategy on the Roma (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Commission by Jan Marinus Wiersma, Hannes Swoboda, Katalin Lévai, Adrian Severin and Jan Andersson, on behalf of the PSE Group, on a European Roma strategy (O-0081/2007/rev. 1 - B6-0389/2007)"
"the oral question to the Commission by Viktória Mohácsi, on behalf of the ALDE Group, on a European Roma strategy - B6-0003/2008)"
"the oral question to the Commission by Lívia Járóka, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on a European Community Action Plan on Roma - B6-0004/2008)"
"the oral question to the Commission by Roberta Angelilli, on behalf of the UEN Group, on a European Roma strategy - B6-0005/2008)"
"author. - (HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, President-in-Office, many documents, including the 2005 Decision of the European Parliament on the Roma, the 2004 study by the European Commission, the report on Roma women by the European Parliament Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the EUROSTAT action plan of 2003 were clearly drafted in order to solve the untenable situation of European Roma."
"Nonetheless, neither the Member States nor the European institutions have really moved forward in promoting the inclusion of the Roma, although it is in the interests of both the European labour market and European societies successfully to integrate Europe's most populous and fastest-growing minority."
"The recommendation of the report presented last December by the high-level advisory group set up by Commissioner Špidla was that a Community action plan should be created."
"This action plan must be created, although much stronger and more genuine commitment is needed from the Commission in order to take effective, immediate measures."
"This also applies to the European Parliament and civil society in many areas affecting the Roma."
"The European Commission and Member States must instigate, fund, monitor and implement aid directly from Union sources for the most disadvantaged groups."
"If the financial instruments of the European Union are drawn down, it must show the impact on equal opportunities of the given investment as a material and accountable criterion, that is to say, if development is funded from Union sources, it should be compulsory for bidders to carry out or implement an equal opportunities analysis and measures plan."
"If the measures plan becomes a compulsory element of competitions in different development sectors and certain regions, this would contribute greatly to ensuring and encouraging equal opportunities for disadvantaged social groups and those that are falling behind."
"It is also essential to create a pan-European crisis map, on the basis of which those areas of the European Union can be assessed where abject poverty and social exclusion most seriously afflict the Roma and non-Roma communities, and through which the European Commission, supporting the Member States, can start the work of desegregation, which the governments have been putting off for decades as a result of different political commitments."
"It is important that the Commissioners who are directly or indirectly responsible for the integration and inclusion of minorities coordinate their activities through their education, employment, equal opportunities, regional and development portfolios and, developing into a technical working group, prepare the 2008 action plan for Roma affairs in cooperation with Parliament and civil society, and they must start implementing that plan as soon as possible."
"Apart from the fact that we adopted a resolution in 2005 which we now see has in fact had a negligible impact, I also consider it important that dialogue should start between the parties as soon as possible, with the involvement of the Commission and civil society."
"I also feel in any case that in 2008 we ought to see action and talks relating to the Roma that are organised by all parties."
"I feel it is important and I undertake on behalf of the People's Party to instigate this during 2008."
"Thank you."
"author. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this morning the report on an EU strategy on the rights of the child was adopted."
"One of its priorities is combating poverty and discrimination."
"On this point, we decided to devote a special paragraph to Roma children, who are often excluded from health and social provision and from schooling."
"It is a well-known fact that a very high percentage of Roma children do not go to school, or attend only occasionally."
"Many Roma children are actually forced to attend special schools, if not institutions for the disabled."
"Available data show that in some Member States early school leaving by Roma children exceeds 60%."
"It is clear that children who do not go to school, who are illiterate or in any case have an inadequate level of education or vocational training, are children who have no future, but are forced to beg or to work on the black market."
"In any case, their fate is sealed: in the best-case scenario they will be condemned to poverty and social exclusion, while in the worst-case scenario they will be victims of organised crime."
"It is worth bearing in mind, by the way, that the Roma population is very young, with approximately 45% of individuals aged under 16; for this very reason it would be extremely useful and important for the Commission to lay down specific, concrete actions for Roma children, particularly with reference to combating early school leaving and the promotion of appropriate, high-quality schooling."
"Without a right to education there is no guarantee of equal treatment and, above all, no right to a future."
"author. - (NL) Mr President, we too have put questions to the Commission, and I expect the Commissioner to answer them."
"This evening, we are mainly discussing the efforts of the European Union - the European Commission - to tackle the problems of the Roma, a large group of whom became EU citizens a few years ago, and another last year."
"These citizens are living in conditions that are in most cases unacceptable."
"We are pleased that we are to receive a response from the European Commission in this House today."
"We are also pleased that the European Council devoted attention to the situation of the Roma at the Brussels Summit, and asked the Commission to present more specific proposals for what the European Union itself can do to supplement the policy of Member States with large Roma communities, what we can do in the way of coordination and exchange of best practices, and how the available EU resources can be better deployed in those countries via the funds in order to do something about the situation of the Roma."
"I say this particularly because, upon the accession of a number of countries - last year, and also in 2004 - we said, 'All right, come on in; one of the things we must do together is tackle the problems of the Roma.'"
"I myself was rapporteur for Slovakia, and I remember the Slovak Government making all kinds of promises, but I have some doubts about the effectiveness of the implementation of those promises."
"This remains an important point."
"We would also say that the Roma cannot be regarded as a typical national minority, such as the Hungarians in Slovakia or the Russians in the Baltic States."
"They are a typical European minority, for which a special European policy could be developed, together with the Member States concerned, with a separate responsibility for the European Union - as, indeed, was recognised in the pronouncements of the Brussels European Council."
"We would ask the Commission, in particular, to ensure greater coordination within the Commission itself."
"How can we improve cooperation?"
"How can we give someone, possibly from the ranks of the Commissioners, central responsibility for Roma policy?"
"Maybe we should also look at the possibility of recognising the Roma as a kind of European minority in order to get around, to some extent, the principle of subsidiarity currently applicable to Member States' minority policy."
"To conclude, I believe that everyone's intentions are good, but that better coordination and more action are required."
"author. - (HU) Thank you very much."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that this Parliament drew attention to the lack of integration of the Roma back in 1983."
"It also asked the Commission, the Council and the governments of the Member States in a Resolution of 1994 to do everything in the interests of the social, economic and political integration of the Roma."
"As you will remember, in the Resolution adopted by Parliament in April 2005 we asked the Commission to adopt an action plan containing clear recommendations for the Member States and candidate countries relating to the economic, social and political integration of the Roma."
"Again in November 2007 the matter of the social integration of the Roma was incorporated into the text of the Parliament's Resolution on freedom of movement, upon my recommendation, as a European-level Roma strategy."
"We asked the Commission again to prepare immediately a European strategy for the social inclusion of the Roma, using the integration fund and structural funds."
"In amongst all this, we know for certain that Roma children are still forced to study in segregated classes and in segregated institutions in at least ten Member States of the Union, and we, the Roma, are unjustifiably classed as disabled, put into a determined profession and labelled for all time."
"Unfortunately it is well known in every Member State what slums and what terrible conditions the Roma live in."
"I regret to state that we also know very well that the average life expectancy of Roma in every Member State is 15 years lower than the life expectancy of Union citizens."
"We should repeat that the Roma are over-represented among the unemployed in every single Member State."
"In amongst all this, unfortunately, not a single month goes by when there is not a racist attack against Roma in any Member State."
"We know from the news - or we would not particularly have heard about it - that on the night of 4 January 2008, a slum in the Marconi district of Rome, with approximately 250 Roma living there, was set on fire, and then, three days later, also in Italy, Molotov cocktails were thrown at the local gipsy settlement in Aprilia, directly threatening the lives of several hundred people."
"Racist motives were behind the attack in both cases."
"There is no room for doubt, the calling to account is justified, there must be a proposal for a Resolution, there must be a European-level strategy, and every Member State must prepare an action plan for integrating the Roma."
"Nobody is an exception, nobody can act as if there were no Roma in their own country - whether or not they recognise them - and then what has been said would not be true of any of the Member States of the Union, without exception."
"Thank you."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Járóka, Mrs Angelilli, Mr Wiersma and Mrs Mohácsi for raising these issues, which I am dealing with on behalf of my colleague, Vladimír Špidla, because he is currently in China, and this gives us the opportunity to talk things through on this extremely important subject."
"The past year has really shown that both the bodies of the European Union and the Member States themselves are intensifying their efforts to improve the situation of the Roma in the European Union permanently."
"We have heard that this is necessary and I agree."
"A few important steps have already been taken in this regard."
"These range from the European Parliament's decision in 2005 to introduce the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All to the work of the high-ranking group of experts on the integration of ethnic minorities and the European Economic and Social Committee as well as the conclusions accepted just recently by December's European Council, to which reference has just been made."
"I should say that we cannot really shrug off the difficult issue of discrimination, as members of the Roma experience it, and their exclusion from society and from the labour market."
"We have therefore taken the firm decision to use every instrument available to us, such as legislation, structural funds and information and awareness-raising campaigns, in order to improve this situation."
"It is obvious that employment and social policy programmes and measures are not being adequately used to promote the social integration of the Roma."
"We therefore need to concentrate all our efforts primarily on improving access to these measures with a targeted plan."
"It goes without saying that a plan of this kind must be based on an authoritative and long-term commitment by the Member States and the efficient use of Community instruments and policies."
"Allow me, therefore, to deal briefly and practically with your questions and outline our proposals for 2008."
"The Commission will adopt guidelines this summer on the revised strategy for combating discrimination - follow-up action as it were, to the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All."
"According to the European Council's conclusions of December 2007, these guidelines will for the most part deal with the Roma problem and the recommendations of the high-ranking group of experts on the integration of ethnic minorities."
"These guidelines will be supplemented by a working paper by the Commission's services, which analyses the progress and effectiveness of these measures achieved for the benefit of the Roma, both at political and at legislative level, and also when planning programmes for the structural funds."
"At the same time we are offering to organise a high-level Roma forum, aimed at bringing together representatives of national governments and parliaments, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions as well as leading figures from Roma civil society and other important players."
"We are convinced that the rights of the Roma can be strengthened by high-level open discussion and that much more targeted use of resources can be achieved for their benefit."
"The staff of my colleague Vladimír Špidla will prepare the initiatives referred to and then focus on the Roma problem in the areas of non-discrimination, the European Social Fund, employment and social integration."
"Since the situation of the Roma relates to several of the Commission's areas of activity, such as regional policy, education, public health and justice, the specialist inter-agency group for Roma issues, which came into existence in 2004, will be providing the information exchange."
"Finally, a few weeks ago, the Commission concluded a partnership framework agreement with the European Roma Information Office, the ERIO."
"This partnership will establish permanent, direct contact between the European bodies and Roma civil society."
"As for the rest, it should be remembered that several initiatives are being implemented both at national and at European level as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, which has just begun."
"These aim to highlight, and therefore make people even more aware of, the importance of dialogue between cultures and above all the advantages that cultural diversity brings to our society."
"In the spring of 2008, the Commission will publish a Green Paper on educational issues in conjunction with pupils who have a migrant background or belong to a disadvantaged minority."
"It will also address the major aspects affecting the Roma, such as educational segregation, for instance."
"This Green Paper should trigger wide-ranging debate on the subject and maybe lead to a plan of action at European level."
"I should also add - to respond directly to a question from Mrs Mohácsi - that the Commission intends to submit the proposal in 2008 for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment beyond employment, i.e. a horizontal directive, as we announced in our work programme."
"These are currently the fundamental items we are preparing and I now await the debate with interest, at the end of which I shall perhaps need to add a few comments."
"on behalf of PPE-DE. - (RO) I think that the organisation of this debate in plenary session is extremely important as it is necessary to draw up a balance sheet of the European actions on Roma population and to analyse the methods of enhancing the efficiency thereof."
"Several recent events proved us that there are still important gaps at European policy level in this field and an update and readjustment thereof is necessary for the current challenges."
"Mutual tollerance and multi-ethnical integration are fundamental principles of the European Union and Roma is an important community at European level, having a significant impact on the social and political as well as economic life in several Member States of the European Union.."
"Therefore, it is mandatory to develop a coherent vision at European level regarding Roma, focussed on their integration and ensuring a common basis of rights and responsibilities."
"Although in November I asked the European Commission a question regarding this issue and the answer was that new proposals intending Roma integration would be launched, I hereby ask the Commission to come up with clarifications on these intentions."
"Firstly, I would be interested in the way the Commission would approach this issue from institutional point of view so that to ensure an efficient coordination and monitoring of European action for Roma protection and integration."
"The role of education, and I would say, the education for tollerance, is not less important as it was pointed out by my colleagues."
"From this education all the EU citizens would benefit, it would be an education for tollerance as stimulating factor of Roma integration, interaction and social relation in the European Union."
"Their development would make Roma social integration easier and on the other hand it would limit the stigmatization and discrimination against them."
"Consequently, I ask the Commission to inform us on the existence of such programmes and the implementation thereof, but especially on wether it intends to consider this issue when drawing up further European policies on Roma."
"Thank you and I hope that this debate would result into firm and concrete decisions to improve the European policies on Roma."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, many thanks for your reply, which met us half-way in at least some points."
"You have to understand that we are impatient with regard to these issues because the latest incidents have again shown how pressing the problem is."
"Firstly, with regard to the Roma forum: approval from our side."
"I believe it is a good idea, particularly with the involvement of the Roma themselves."
"It is important, however, to act quickly because I am afraid that, now that the proposal has been made, it will simply be discussed to death and there will be too much dithering."
"I believe the Roma forum should be set up as quickly as possible, within the current year."
"Parliament will certainly provide assistance."
"Secondly, it is also important, of course, to engage the local authorities, because governments are often well-intentioned and make promises, but then the problem ends up with the Mayor or somewhere else in the region and is not actually dealt with."
"Thirdly, many thanks for your undertaking regarding the proposals for equal treatment beyond the workplace."
"This is an important subject generally, which my Group very much supports."
"But for all that, Commissioner, I should like to say on behalf of my Group that these interdisciplinary groups - we are all familiar with them from our own administrations - are all arduous and helpful."
"In our view it would be important for there to be one Commissioner responsible for coordinating the subject area, or for there to be at least one authorised representative among the Commissioners whose task it is to carry it through."
"I still do not know why the Romanian Commissioner has the job that he has."
"If he were at least able to attend to it, this would help."
"I don't know."
"But we would like to see these matters given great priority."
"Things are moving in the right direction."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your report, but a bit more force and a bit more pace would be of great value in the interest of the Roma."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, although this debate has been prompted by oral questions to the Commission, in substance it is the natural continuation of an initiative that Parliament undertook some time ago and which it has recently been emphasising."
"It is clear that we need an action plan to improve the situation of the Roma, given this minority's poor integration into the social and civil framework of the countries of the European Union."
"The transnational nature of the Roma, which is one of their special characteristics, gives rise to a requirement, which I personally support, to prepare a European strategy so that they can escape from the worrying degrading conditions in which they live, in many cases bordering on the inhuman, which without doubt is the effect of social exclusion and the trigger for resulting, varied adverse consequences: from alienation from the host country to degeneration into violence, either as a perpetrator or a victim."
"As well as guidelines that may help local and national authorities to stem the numbers of Member State minorities descending into social hardship, it is necessary to have adequate funds to back up the actions to be taken."
"It is not, however, just a funding problem."
"The true goal is to bring about equal access to work, education, housing, health, social services and the environment needed to exercise civil rights, starting with decision-making processes. All this involves an integrated approach to combining actions to achieve these goals."
"This is why I am personally opposed to giving responsibility for the Roma issue to a single European Commissioner."
"Two years after the launch of the Decade of Roma Inclusion (2005-2015) there are still a great many commitments that the governments who supported them have yet to get started and fulfil."
"What initiatives is the Commission intending to take on this issue?"
"I hope that they will begin as soon as possible, straight after the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, in this European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, the current situation of the Roma forces me to begin with a criticism, which is that the European Commission has been slow and lazy in dealing with Roma issues in Europe."
"Just look at the Council of Europe and the OSCE, which for the past two decades have had offices fully dedicated to Roma issues."
"The Council of Europe has produced many specific recommendations on the Roma, and the OSCE has developed its action plan on improving the situation of the Roma in the OSCE area."
"I wonder how much attention the Commission and EU Member States has devoted to those documents, and whether they took seriously the joint EP resolution on the Roma, or the Decade of Roma Inclusion action plans."
"However, simply criticising is not my political style, and Ms Ferrero-Waldner has given me some cause for optimism."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner to please share the following message with President Barroso and the college when you meet."
"First, a European Roma strategy should be created as soon as possible and should primarily focus on improving the living conditions of the Roma in Europe, creating jobs for the almost 90% of Roma who are jobless, combating anti-gypsyism, supporting the education of Roma, bringing health into Roma houses and promoting Roma political inclusion."
"Second, to facilitate such a strategy, the European Commission needs a permanent Roma unit, hiring Roma staff to serve that body."
"I sincerely hope that the Commission will hire Roma staff on the basis of their skills, rather than their skin, as some Member States have done in the past."
"Third, a special European fund for Roma projects should be a priority for the European Commission."
"The European Parliament should, of course, also make a contribution towards the joint European 'union of works' to improve the situation of the Roma."
"I would like at this juncture to raise again the proposal to have a permanent EP rapporteur on Roma issues, who could give a good overview and make recommendations to this House, other EU institutions and the Member States."
"Furthermore, I would like to hear the voice of the Roma more loudly in this House."
"Their interests should be represented by their MEPs."
"Finally, I would underline that the European Roma strategy should express common political values when it comes to the future enlargement process and the fight against ultra-nationalism and the extreme right in Europe."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for what she has said and for the commitments she has made, which also seem to me to be in line with what the European Parliament has said on many occasions in its resolutions, but these promises to act are not enough in themselves."
"I would like to ask what tools the Commission uses and what it can tell us about the use of the funds which, under various expenditure headings, have to date been made available to Member States for Roma inclusion."
"Secondly, what checks is it making on the concrete implementation at national level of the directives adopted?"
"Thirdly, I join with those asking that there be a single figure within the Commission handling all issues relating to the Roma."
"To turn to my country, I must stress that we face a very strong wave of racism and stigmatisation, chiefly towards the Roma, particularly since Italy has not fully transposed Directive 43/2000/EC against ethnic discrimination."
"What measures does the Commission intend to take with regard to this?"
"Italian law has not transposed the concept of racial harassment, the issue of the sharing of the burden of proof or protection from abuse suffered as a result of racial discrimination."
"Further, I ask the Commission if it knows that in one major Italian municipality - namely Milan - migrant children, who in this case are mainly Roma, whose parents are not in a regular position with the law and do not have a residence permit, cannot attend state schools."
"This seems to me to run completely counter to all the EU's documents, to contradict the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and also the resolution we adopted this morning on the rights of the child."
"Finally, I would like to point out that the Italian Government is discussing the nth decree-law on an issue which is in fact really to do with the Roma, and that is whether it is possible to include a reference to economic ends among the grounds that may be given to justify the removal of a citizen of another Member State from the country, in this case from Italy."
"Behind the general issue of immigration, this decree is in fact directed specifically at the Roma."
"I would like to know your views."
"(BG) Distinguished colleagues, I, too, take the floor so that it can be heard, finally, in this Chamber, how things really stand and so that the hypocritical statements can stop, at least for a while."
"What can we gather from the discussion so far?"
"We gather that you are concerned for the gypsy population in Europe, which includes also my homeland, Bulgaria."
"I can't even venture to imagine that right now you are concerned by the extremely low pensions of retirees in Bulgaria or for the honest, hard-working Bulgarians who become victims of gypsy crime on a daily basis."
"Distinguished MEPs, do show some concern for the fact that the Bulgarian Socialist Party buys gypsy votes on a regular basis during elections in Bulgaria."
"Do care that the coalition partner of Bulgarian Socialists, the Movement for Rights and Liberties, represented here in the ALDE group, buys all the remaining votes."
"Also cast by gypsies."
"Do care that the chairman of the Movement for Rights and Liberties, Ahmed Doghan, calls the buying of votes, of gypsy votes, 'a normal European practice'."
"Do show some concern for the fact that, in Bulgaria, the gypsy population stands at 3-4%, while the crimes committed by them account for 30-40% of all criminal offences. And these are not only crimes of poverty, committed because of poverty."
"These are extremely shameless and brutal crimes. Because the rape and murder of a 79-year old woman is not a crime of poverty."
"You do agree, don't you?"
"The huge amounts of money allocated, it is obvious, do not work."
"This funding does not work because this money disappears in dubious foundations and non-government organisations."
"In our opinion, that of the patriots from Ataka, the solution of this problem is in abiding by the all the laws in each single country."
"Abiding by the law, with no tolerance for a specific minority, will bring success."
"Because in Bulgaria crimes committed by gypsies are not investigated in detail. That is a fact."
"A fact, and you can see it for yourselves."
"The murder of the teenage Belneyski sisters was not investigated."
"It was covered up."
"These issues should cause our concern. Because tolerating a particular minority at the expense of the majority will not bring any success but the opposite of success."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was delighted to listen to the words of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, and I was delighted by the initiatives that can be expected to take place in future."
"I feel that this really will help the situation of the Roma substantially, but I must agree with my Dutch fellow Member, who has expressed her impatience."
"I am impatient too, along with many others, because the situation really is changing very slowly."
"There are 7-9 million Roma living in Europe, most of them in poor social circumstances, and they fight the same problems as they have for years: the problems of exclusion and inclusion, the lack of employment, the question of school segregation and multiple discrimination against Roma women."
"The majority of Member States do not regard the Roma as a minority of their country, they do not want to make substantial changes to their situation, and indeed the experiences of the past few years have shown instead a reinforcement of radicalism and anti-gipsyism in both the new and old Member States."
"I therefore feel that there is no more time to waste, and we need real changes and a harmonised European Roma policy."
"Without a European Roma policy there is no national Roma policy; we have to understand and confront this."
"It would be good if we took steps so that the transnational minority status of the Roma is recognised, since it really is a special status."
"The European Parliament and, within this, the Socialist Group, has already launched the action plan, and in March we will be doing a tour of Europe and arranging conferences, workshops and visits with the involvement of local Roma, NGOs and governments in order to expose cases of discrimination, and we will draw the attention of European public opinion to the unhappy situation of the Roma and try to remedy it."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, Roma are neither the successors of the ancient Roman Empire, nor the contemporary inhabitants of Rome."
"They are neither a nation without a state nor a national minority."
"They are an ethnocultural community, still cherishing its tribal tradition, and a pan-European community which was kept in slavery in pre-modern and early modern Europe, which was sent to extermination camps by the Fascist regimes and enclosed in the states turned into prisons by the Communist dictatorship."
"They became free European citizens after the end of the Cold War and the first post-bipolar European Union enlargement."
"Being marginalised and excluded over the centuries, the Roma community found itself excluded from European wealth and tried to protect itself by challenging the European order."
"Today, now that Europe is reconciled with itself, should it be reconciled with the Roma population as well, or should it declare and treat the Roma as second-class citizens who are again to be concentrated in some Member States transformed into Roma ghettos?"
"To these questions there is a single answer: the Roma issue is a European issue."
"It is not a simple issue but a huge challenge - a common challenge which we must cope with jointly."
"Otherwise we will be unable to integrate the Roma community into European society and bring it into the European order."
"This is a cultural and social matter."
"The European Union should mobilise funds, develop programmes and organise specific institutional structures in order to assist the national authorities of the countries where the Roma choose to settle in order to offer this community a decent material life, a proper education, a fair opportunity to compete with others, free of any discrimination, and a cohesive sense of their existence within European civilisation."
"We expect the European Commission to take the right steps in that direction and to keep the European Parliament fully informed on the progress achieved."
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner, when we discuss the Lisbon Strategy in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we talk about high growth, a high level of employment, good social conditions, good health care, and one of the things we also say is that the education system and development of skills must be a driving force in achieving these goals."
"When we transpose this, all these aims, to the Roma minority in Europe, we find astonishingly high unemployment."
"We find social conditions which are not particularly good, health care which is not particularly good, poor housing conditions, a segregated society for them, and even an education system which is segregated."
"There are special education provisions for Roma people which do not give them the right to an adequate education."
"Yet the Lisbon Strategy is there for everyone."
"You had a number of good proposals."
"We support them, but it is important that the strategy is followed up by a plan of action."
"It is important that we have mainstreaming, but at the same time there must be coordination within the Commission."
"It is important that we review our funds so that they take account of the Roma minority."
"It is important, when we draw up strategies in the fields of employment and education and in other fields, that we always consider the situation of the Roma so that they are integrated in different strategies."
"(HU) Mr President, the European Union does not have a minority policy for Roma, nor for traditional national minorities, nor for migrant minorities."
"I include the Roma among traditional national minorities, but at the same time, because of their specific socially disadvantaged situation, they must still be treated as a separate category."
"I am delighted that, as the living conscience of the European Parliament, the two Hungarian Members of Roma descent, Mrs Járóka and Mrs Mohácsi, amongst others, have raised this question, because we rightly condemned the events in Italy in November."
"It is right that we should continuously return to this question."
"What is the duty of the European Union?"
"I am delighted with what Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner has said."
"The European Union also has a duty, but it must make a distinction between what is the competence of a Member State and what is the competence of the European Union."
"I also agree fully with Mr Swoboda, who is no longer here, not because of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, but because he is right, namely in that it is decided at local level whether or not something will succeed."
"Specifically, the Member State must be given a national action programme."
"I am proud that we prepared Europe's first medium-term Roma programme under my government department."
"Money must be given to the Member State, but everything be decided at local level."
"What can the EU do?"
"It should monitor what the Member States are doing and it should provide a 'best practice' method for the best solution."
"It is not only a matter of money, but also of whether there are any qualified experts from the majority and Roma society who want to take this matter further."
"The future of Europe depends on minorities."
"- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to reject the criticism that Commissioner Špidla is too lazy to attend to this problem."
"I do not think this is the right way to conduct discussions in the House."
"It is important that we concentrate on improving educational provision for young Roma people."
"We are all familiar with the system of compulsory education and I believe that language and literacy, and numeracy skills - quite simply, things that are necessary for a good life - should be made compulsory."
"On the other hand, I do understand that not everyone wants to be integrated, of course."
"Of course we do have to offer initiatives to all those who do not wish to integrate into our society."
"I believe the concept of an open approach to these problems is the main solution for the future."
"Mr President, this debate has highlighted a number of the problems which the subject we are debating raises."
"It seems to me, Commissioner, that rather than us devising a strategy and telling others what to do, it would perhaps be wise to ask representatives of the Roma community."
"We currently have two Roma MEPs."
"I remember, too, a very famous Spanish Socialist Member of this House, elected in 1989, who was particularly engaging and informative on the whole question of Roma culture."
"That culture is part of our culture and part of European civilisation, and reflects what kind of a people we are."
"It would perhaps be wise to look at the history of the Roma people, to speak with representatives of the Roma culture and to ask them how we can best further their prospects, rather than telling them how they can integrate into our society and how we can best accommodate their social needs."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, may I sum up once again: it was an extremely interesting debate and we all very clearly see the need to respond to this."
"I understand, of course, that you all want the fastest possible response."
"I should tell you that there is also a directive, Directive 2000/43/EC, which already guarantees the application of the principle of equal treatment, with no differentiation between race or ethnic origin in the employment, social, and educational sectors and in access to and supply of goods and services, which also applies to the Roma."
"I believe this is also fundamental here."
"This directive also makes positive measures possible in the Member States."
"However, it is true that the Member States are not obliged to incorporate these measures into their national legislative provisions."
"The European regulations do have to be applied, however, and I should say that we at the Commission have made the firm decision to ensure that they are implemented."
"The Commission has in fact initiated infringement procedures in the past year against 22 Member States that have not implemented the European regulations properly, including Italy, Mr Agnoletto."
"As regards the integration of people in the job market, the European Social Fund is also our most important instrument for this."
"A substantial proportion of the measures targeted to improving the employability of the Roma can be co-financed by the European Social Fund."
"Between 2000 and 2006, approximately 275 million euros, for example, were earmarked for projects targeted specifically at integrating the Roma."
"The high-level group of experts on the integration of ethnic minorities has pointed out that certain projects supported by the ESF, such as the Acceder programme in Spain, for instance, are excellent models of active integration of the Roma."
"I should therefore like to renew an urgent appeal to the individual states to make use of this opportunity."
"I agree with Mr Swoboda that it is not just the bodies of the nation states, of course, that play an important role here, but also often local organisations, of course."
"As we all know, the social exclusion of the Roma is a complex phenomenon and a consistent approach covering all the important aspects of their lives is therefore needed to tackle it."
"This includes education, employment, health, housing and infrastructure."
"This approach requires efficient coordination at the level of the European institutions."
"I am convinced that real progress will be made over the next year with the help of these measures."
"I have, of course, heard that many of you - not all - would like a certain Commissioner to take on this subject and I shall, of course, convey this to my colleague, Mr Špidla."
"But there is a wide variety of different subjects involved here and the most important thing, therefore, is effective coordination."
"You can certainly talk to Mr Špidla once again about the other issue."
"I should like very briefly to single out a few items that were raised specifically during the debate."
"These included the question of how dialogue with civil society and also with the Roma themselves is going."
"I believe that dialogue such as this - and specifically on the course of action for the Roma and their children - is very important for guaranteeing the principle of non-discrimination on the one hand, and combating unemployment and promoting the social development of the regions in which the Roma live on the other hand, as well as toppling the barriers found mainly in the heads of the majority so that the Roma are recognised as a genuine part of this European culture."
"I am in agreement here with all those who have raised this issue."
"I myself - and all those who know me know that this is perhaps a kind of hobby of mine outside politics - have always advocated human rights education."
"It is an education in tolerance."
"I can only say that I shall therefore certainly be including the issue of human rights education, which I regard as hugely important, in these guidelines."
"Mrs de Groen-Kouwenhoven, I have to say here that the Commission is perhaps slow, but certainly not lazy."
"When you see that the European Council and in particular the OSCE have set up numerous programmes, mainly with the support of the European Commission, then you become aware that to all intents and purposes there are some very positive approaches to this."
"My final comment applies to the issue of the trans-national minority."
"Here I would simply like to say that consideration should be given to the fact that the European Union does not have the authority to define minorities in the Member States themselves."
"You also know that it should be borne in mind in this context that social policy measures are not geared to ethnic origin, but always to individual needs."
"But as you know, the Member States in particular have a very different idea of what a minority is and how a minority is defined."
"This issue can therefore still not be resolved very quickly."
"In other respects, I am happy to pass on your comments."
"You will certainly be receiving guidelines on this soon."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 31 January 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - It is clear the Roma is a neglected minority in the European Union; we cannot allow this to continue."
"I fully support my colleagues in calling for the Commission to take more action on this issue."
"We have a situation whereby there exists a group that is considered the largest ethnic minority group in the EU, living in less than substandard conditions, that we have difficulty in protecting and aiding."
"Concrete and swift action from the Commission to assist the integration of the Roma community in all aspects of society, be it economic, social or political, is desperately needed."
"The EU needs to take the lead on this problem."
"A more effective EU policy for the South Caucasus - A Black Sea Regional Policy Approach (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"the report by Lydie Polfer, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a more effective EU policy for the South Caucasus: from promises to actions, and"
"the report by Roberta Alma Anastase, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on a Black Sea Regional Policy Approach"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank the members of the Committee on International Trade, and above all my colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who have actively contributed to shaping this report, which we wanted to be balanced, and which in the end was adopted unanimously."
"Yes, there is great interest in the three countries in the Caucasus."
"Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, all three of which came out of the collapse of the USSR, are still suffering from the legacy of those times today, especially through the unresolved conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, which are poisoning the atmosphere between them and their neighbours and have set off a damaging arms race."
"Nevertheless, these three countries chose to adopt European values, in the 1980s, by becoming members of the Council of Europe and, later, by signing partnership and cooperation agreements with the European Union."
"Their geographical proximity and situation as a transit area between Iran, Turkey, Russia, the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea mean that we have an interest in helping these countries to strengthen democracy and the rule of law in this region and to set up a viable framework for regional cooperation and development that permits political stability."
"This is particularly important because these countries, though they have experienced strong growth, still have high levels of poverty and unemployment."
"We have analysed the possibilities for taking action in different sections that I will briefly summarise."
"Firstly, within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, we have insisted upon a differentiated approach based on individual merits, while making regional cooperation a key objective."
"We are asking the Commission to extend these contacts with civil society, and we particularly support the initiative of undertaking a feasibility study on a free-trade agreement with Georgia and Armenia and of supporting Azerbaijan in its process of accession to the WTO."
"Democracy, human rights and the rule of law are obviously a fundamental part of this and we commend the efforts made by Armenia following the constitutional reform, but we encourage it to continue with the establishment of an independent judiciary and civil service."
"Regarding Azerbaijan, although we are concerned by the deterioration of the human rights situation and media freedom, on the other hand we commend the presidential pardon that has enabled several journalists to be released, and we ask for an investigation into allegations of police violence."
"As for Georgia, which has undertaken wide-ranging reforms since 2003 and experienced the turbulence we know about, we are pleased that the presidential elections went off peacefully, but the very tense climate and allegations of human rights abuses lead us to ask the authorities to set up an inquiry into the complaints lodged, without delay."
"We also ask the opposition forces to behave responsibly and respect the election."
"To sum up, we are asking these three countries to guarantee freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of the media as well as fair and honest access to the media for the opposition, and we are asking them to step up the fight against corruption and establish a favourable investment climate."
"As regards the negotiations to come up with procedures for granting visas to Georgia, we can only recommend the Commission and the Council to launch them in view of what is happening in Abkhazia and Ossetia."
"As for the peaceful settlement of the conflicts, this is obviously the condition sine qua non for lasting stability in the region."
"We have dealt with this, I believe, in a balanced way."
"I will not go over it again in detail; I will simply mention - as we pointed out - that the contradiction between the principle of self-determination and territorial integrity has up to now contributed to the perpetuation of the conflicts in the region, and that this problem can be overcome only through negotiations on the basis of the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act."
"Let us hope that the latest proposals from the Minsk Group will help to bridge these rifts."
"This would be the best present for the hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons who are suffering cruelly from this situation."
"Finally, as regards cooperation on energy and transport, although it is clear that the new initiatives increase the possibilities for openness, it is becoming increasingly evident that Armenia's isolation is only worsening."
"In conclusion, I would like to recall that the sole objective of this report is to show our sincere interest in the South Caucasus region, its inhabitants, their history, their goals and their hopes, and that we would like to get to know them better so we can better help them to achieve them."
"Rapporteur. - (RO) A year ago, in January 2007, in this very room, we were celebrating Romania and Bulgaria's accession."
"We were reflecting then on the new opportunities available both to the two new Member States and to the European Union as a whole."
"Active and consistent involvement in the Black Sea region, along with the development of a genuine regional cooperation policy, comparable to those related to the Mediterranean and the Northern Dimension, were necessary and obvious requirements."
"Now, in January 2008, as rapporteur for Black Sea Cooperation, I have the privilege of opening this plenary debate to discuss Parliament's recommendations on developing synergy in the Black Sea area, proposed in April by the European Commission."
"These recommendations are the result of a broad process of reflection and consultation with all interested colleagues as well as independent experts and civil servants."
"The report emphasises the strategic importance of the Black Sea to the European Union while defining with extreme clarity the objective of the cooperation policy in this area: creating a common space of security, democracy and prosperity."
"The report stresses the importance of regional cooperation in mobilizing ten adjoining countries towards dialogue and joint action, bringing together their diversity and their enormous potential, which we cannot ignore."
"Consequently, a primary responsibility for the European Union is to take the lead in promoting active regional cooperation in the Black Sea region."
"The key question that this report attempts to answer is the following: how can we strengthen and effectively implement the European policy of regional cooperation in the Black Sea region in order to achieve the objective of creating a common space of security, democracy and prosperity?"
"First of all, we need firm, coherent, and results-driven action on the part of the European Union."
"In this regard, the report identifies three fundamental issues: mobilizing all the relevant financial instruments, enhanced cooperation with other institutions and bodies in the area, and, not least, monitoring actions to ensure their continuity and effectiveness, and devising an action plan."
"The report also recommends that the European Union should focus on five priority areas."
"The Black Sea region arguably is of strategic importance for the security and diversification of energy supply in the European Union and requires a comprehensive approach with that in mind."
"However, it is imperative that the European Union should not confine itself to economic cooperation, but rather aim to create a region where stability, democracy and good governance prevail."
"The EU's Black Sea policy will only be complete when the European Union commits to resolving existing conflicts, and civil society development, personal contact and good relations between neighbours are essential in this regard."
"Since we are also discussing Mrs Polfer's report on the South Caucasus, and countries in that region are part of the wider Black Sea area, I welcome the drafting of this report."
"It is important that the two reports concur in their main ideas and in stressing the importance of cooperation and dialogue among all States as a premise for development and prosperity, as well as in stressing the need for consistent involvement on the part of the European Union."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank all the contributors to the report on Black Sea synergy."
"I appreciate the cooperation and unanimous support of my colleagues from all groups."
"I hope that the same spirit will guide the European Union and the Black Sea countries in their joint effort to develop regional cooperation in this area."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, may I say that I will be slightly longer, because I am answering on two reports."
"They are two excellent reports that bring to our agenda today, on the one hand, the complex area of the neighbourhood policy and, on the other hand, the question of the Black Sea region."
"Reading the reports has indeed reinforced my conviction that, while bilateral differentiated relations remain the cornerstone of the European neighbourhood policy (ENP), many of the challenges and opportunities before us require, I think, a response at subregional or regional level, as we have already said."
"Now let me speak first on the South Caucasus region."
"We concur with most of the opinions contained in the very good report on the South Caucasus."
"The inclusion of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in our neighbourhood policy will, step by step, bring all three of them closer to the European Union on the basis of shared European values."
"The Commission will publish in spring its progress reports on the implementation of the three ENP action plans, providing an update on the current state of play in our joint undertaking."
"We know that much remains to be done."
"Compliance with democracy, human rights and the rule of law is still fragile and needs improvement."
"Today, for instance, I had an exchange of views about these countries with Mr Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe."
"We remain concerned about human rights and media freedom in Azerbaijan."
"Recent political events in Georgia show that the freedom of expression of political views through the media is essential for stability and, for instance, despite progress in Armenia, further efforts are needed to fight corruption and fully comply with human rights standards."
"Notwithstanding rapid economic growth, poverty is still widespread in the region and we continue to promote economic reforms, steps to improve the business climate but also to strengthen the rule of law."
"And I also agree with the need stressed in Ms Polfer's report for more regional cooperation activities, in particular in the areas of energy, transport and the environment."
"It is our hope that the European Union will be able to take a more courageous and more proactive stance in supporting conflict settlement in the region."
"As mentioned in the recent ENP communication, the European Union could provide even more help by working around the conflict issues by tackling the underlying causes and, indeed, by building trust on both sides of the boundary lines."
"As stressed in the report, concrete steps undertaken by the Commission to spread aid and information can at least serve these purposes."
"Addressing the challenges I have briefly described remains, therefore, a main priority of my Commission for the South Caucasus in the coming months."
"To do this, we will continue to employ the whole range of appropriate EU financial assistance programmes."
"The upgrading of our delegation in Armenia and the opening of a delegation in Azerbaijan in early 2008 will certainly also allow us to increase visibility and operate more efficiently."
"Let me make a special comment on the present presidential elections in Georgia."
"As you know, the international election observation mission, to which the European Parliament has contributed, has confirmed that the elections were, overall, in line with OSCE and Council of Europe standards."
"However, the international election observation mission has identified several irregularities and shortcomings."
"And the most urgent task now is to address these problems: to investigate all electoral complaints and to create the proper conditions for the upcoming legislative elections."
"We stand ready to continue supporting Georgia in carrying out these duties in a speedy and in a thorough way."
"Regarding the Black Sea, I find myself in agreement with much of the report on a Black Sea regional policy approach as well."
"It provides valuable political impetus for our April communication on Black Sea synergy and I think it is significant that, after the Council conclusions last May and the present discussion in the European Parliament, all the key EU institutions will have reaffirmed the need to implement a regional and a comprehensive approach to our policies applied in the Black Sea region."
"The timing of Parliament's report is very appropriate."
"As a result of our initiative, EU foreign ministers will meet in less than one month's time in Kiev with their Black Sea counterparts at a Black Sea synergy meeting."
"I will, of course, personally attend this meeting."
"International and Black Sea regional organisations will also participate and we look forward to discussions that would welcome and endorse increased EU support to Black Sea regional cooperation and determine the priority areas for coordinated action."
"Let me mention just a few of those."
"The Commission promotes a Black Sea dialogue on energy security, making use of the INOGATE structure."
"We continue to encourage legal and regulatory harmonisation through the Baku process."
"Our intention is to carry on working closely with our partners in the construction of new energy infrastructure, developing a trans-Black Sea energy corridor."
"And Black Sea cooperation will improve coordination between TRACECA, the pan-European transport access programme, and the transport programmes of our partners."
"We are also about to initiate a regional dialogue on Black Sea maritime policies and the establishment of regional fisheries coordination."
"The Commission is working on strengthening the Black Sea-Danube connection and we intend to join the Black Sea Commission, which deals with environmental tasks."
"So the Commission has been developing some proposals for regional schemes to combat climate change and we have also begun the implementation of our Black Sea cross-border cooperation programme focusing on civil society and on local authorities."
"There are a number of proposals under discussion with our Black Sea partners in the areas of the fight against organised crime, trade and culture, and we have developed contacts with Black Sea regional organisations, notably with the Organisation of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation."
"Concerning the funding for Black Sea synergy, cofinancing will be the main rule."
"The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument will certainly be at the heart of the EU's financial contribution, but other EU instruments, including thematic ones and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance, in the case of Turkey, will be used as well."
"The Kiev ministerial meeting will provide a forum to discuss and bring forward and coordinate EU initiatives with ideas coming from our partners."
"And it is our expectation that the Black Sea regional context will open up a new space for cooperation based on equal partnership with all eastern ENP countries and important partners like Russia and Turkey."
"Our engagement in the Black Sea region can develop into a long-term endeavour with clear potential to enhance stability, progress and prosperity in the whole region, and Parliament's support is extremely important for that success."
"rapporteur for the opinion of INTA. - (BG) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, the Committee on International Trade congratulates the European Commission and the rapporteur on their timeliness and on their balanced approach to the Black Sea and the region."
"The Black Sea is a border of the European Union, a geostrategic crossroad and a transit region, an area of cooperation trade, fishing, tourism, shipping, a strategic area in the European energy policy."
"The Committee on International Trade calls for a better coordination of cooperation through a separate Black Sea strategy and brings to attention the participation of the Union in infrastructural projects related to the transmission of energy resources."
"It is important to promote investment in environmental protection, risk prevention, disaster recovery and rescue operations in case of accidents such as the Kerch Strait ones and the shipwreck of the Bulgarian vessel Vanessa."
"To ensure open procedures and high standards in the region, the European Parliament needs to list the Bourgas - Alexandroupolis oil pipeline, together with the rest of the gas and oil transmission networks, since it involves European Union Member States."
"Congratulations to the European Union on the responsibility with which it addresses 'the Black Sea challenge' and the responsibility for the people who live in this region."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Polfer, for a very precise analysis of the problems of such a sensitive region as the South Caucasus as well as the proposals and measures presented, which we are considering today."
"Traditionally, EU policies in the South Caucasus region mostly evaluate the energy and transport aspects in economic terms."
"I would like to draw your attention more to the significance of effective EU trade policy in this region, because it enables the economy to be restructured more quickly, business to be developed and the poverty rate to be reduced, whereas countries do not always find energy projects helpful."
"When talking about effective EU policies, which is very important in the South Caucasus region, I would like to emphasise two points."
"Firstly, we still await the Commission's feasibility study evaluating free-trade agreements with both Armenia and Georgia that are as broad as possible and we also encourage the Commission and the Council to implement measures that would help the countries of the South Caucasus to benefit as much as possible from the Generalised System of Preferences."
"Rapporteur for the opinion, Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (RO) Through the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the Union has become a major player in the Black Sea area."
"The region has geostrategic importance for the Union's security and diversification of energy supply, due to its closeness to the Caspian Sea, the Middle East and Central Asia."
"The Union's principles cannot be promoted solely on the basis of political values."
"It is necessary to foster open, transparent markets in the region."
"The ITRE committee stresses the importance of the Nabucco project for the diversification of supply, and calls on the Member States to ensure its implementation, together with their partners."
"We welcome the appointment of a coordinator for this priority project of European interest."
"In order to ensure international trade and the transport of oil and gas in the area, it is essential to develop the infrastructure of community ports on the Black Sea coast and the Danube."
"The ITRE committee deplores the lack of coordination of investment in energy, transport and tourism projects in the area and draws attention to the risk of pollution in the Black Sea."
"While acknowledging the importance of the Black Sea Forum and the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organisation , the ITRE committee recommends that a European dimension be established for the Black Sea, based on the model of the Northern Dimension."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, we cannot discuss the South Caucasus without thinking of our former fellow Member Ursula Schleicher, who cared about this region in a special way and to whom we are grateful for the fact that the colonialist expression 'Transcaucasus' has been replaced by the term 'South Caucasus'."
"The region comprises three very different countries with ancient cultures, which have nevertheless suffered in the recent past under colonialism and neo-colonialism."
"We must therefore approach this region with great sensitivity."
"Armenians in Western Armenia were victims of genocide, which means that even today, Turkey thinks of the Armenia of today - that is, Eastern Armenia - in terms of an unacceptable blockade."
"Georgia was a colony of Russia and the Soviet Union in a particular way, which means that today separatist powers in Georgia are still being used and abused by Moscow in order to destabilise this country."
"Azerbaijan is in a similar situation."
"For all these reasons, we in the European Union must have a strong role in this region, as this was once a region where, for once, it was not us Europeans who were spearheading misguided developments, but others."
"We therefore have a unique opportunity to mediate, democratise and stabilise here and we must reconcile conflicting principles and interests. These naturally include stable borders, but also the peoples' right of self-determination."
"We have to support the rights of minorities to the fullest extent possible, but at the same time prevent destructive separatism."
"We have to preserve commodity interests and geopolitical interests, but at the same time we must see that these are not colonies, but partners, with their own interests and their own dignity and deserve to have their dignity acknowledged at last."
"Therefore, the Polfer report does justice to this difficult challenge in a distinguished manner and I also thank the Commissioner for the enormous effort she is making on behalf of this region."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the South Caucasus is a region of utmost importance, not only for the European Union, but for most of the global players."
"I believe that the European Union should define its interests in the region."
"Basically, those interests consist in having a peaceful and stable place in the South Caucasus, in having a large enough free and integrated market, in having an open area for the safe transit of strategic merchandise, and in having institutions and legislation that are interoperable with European Union ones."
"In order to promote our interest, the European Union should develop appropriate nuanced and specific bilateral relations with the Member States of the region."
"The substance of the bilateral relations should result from our regional strategic approach, and not the other way round."
"Since we cannot offer the South Caucasus countries European Union membership, we must offer them the European Union model and assist them, in a substantial way, to enhance it."
"The European Union should not hesitate to use all its means in order to reach its regional goals in South Caucasus."
"At the same time we must acknowledge that the other international operators have an interest in the region and we have acknowledged the fact that the European Union could not possibly move its priorities without cooperation with the other global actors."
"Some of the unsolved conflicts in the area are, in fact, part of a broader coherent problem which is linked to the post-Soviet status of Russia."
"Therefore, the European Union should courageously address that problem and try to find a negotiated solution concerning the way in which Russia, the European Union and other global players must share responsibilities for guaranteeing the sustainable regional and global stability and security."
"On the other hand, we must admit that principles of territorial integrity and self-determination are clashing in the South Caucasus."
"My opinion is that one could overcome this clash of principles by combining regional integration following the European Union communitarian model with an appropriate use of the internal self-determination, devolution and autonomy."
"This would require good-faith negotiations, political will, a pragmatic spirit and respect for international law provisions."
"It is the right time for the European Union to pass from promises to action in the South Caucasus."
"I hope that this will indeed happen."
"Madam President, I wish to refer to the previous speaker's concluding words."
"What this is about is making transport routes for gas and oil through the Black Sea a reality."
"All of us in the European Union say that these are strategic projects, and the Nabucco project is a strategic project."
"We have been saying this for years, only nothing is ever done about it."
"The question is this: why, if there are such difficulties, can we not make use of some fund or other, as was done with the Galileo project, to turn this project into a reality?"
"If no practical and visible moves are made in this regard, the Russians will soon build their own gas pipelines through the Black Sea, and the result will be that our extensive programme of diversification of transport routes all comes tumbling down."
"This is also about something else."
"That something else is Europe obtaining supplies from the whole Caspian Sea region."
"Azerbaijan alone can supply Europe for five years with one third of the gas that Europe currently takes from Russia, but there is also Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan."
"However, in order to run gas pipelines from those territories that do not pass through Russian territory, we would need to resolve the problem of the status of the Caspian Sea; in other words we would have to make a final decision on whether it should be treated as a lake or as a sea."
"A much more sensible and helpful way forward would appear to be to go for general recognition that the Caspian Sea is a sea, because that would make it very much easier to build gas pipelines or other pipelines through its waters, be it from Turkmenistan or from Kazakhstan."
"In this connection, then, may I urge the European Union authorities to cease the continual reiteration of the statement that the Nabucco problem and the Odessa-Brody-Gdańsk pipeline problem are important problems for the European Union."
"We need to start acting, or else others will get in there before us."
"Madam President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Polfer on drawing up this excellent report."
"Our discussion today is on the subject of a region that is of particular importance to the whole of the European Union, a region that is of unusual significance with respect to EU energy security."
"The title of the report - A more effective EU policy for South Caucasus: from promises to actions - bears clear witness that the European Union has been unusually passive in recent years where this region is concerned."
"However, this is a region that is an arena for competition between the most important international players; not only the European Union, but also Russia, the United States and China."
"It is a region of uncommonly rapid economic growth."
"Suffice it to say that in 2006 economic development in Azerbaijan exceeded 35%."
"This year, however, may be the watershed; 2008 may be a year of crisis."
"Let us not delude ourselves: the example of Kosovo may be used by Georgia's northern neighbour as a pretext for infringing the territorial integrity of that country."
"I hope, therefore, that the European Union will not allow Russia to support separatist strivings in Abkhazia and Ossetia."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, congratulations, first of all, to our two rapporteurs."
"The report by Mrs Polfer comes just at the right time because, with the events in Georgia, we can see firsthand the difficulties of building democracy."
"This report is balanced, and sets out the major geostrategic challenges of the South Caucasus."
"It is important to remember that the neighbourhood policies commit us to supporting and accompanying these countries."
"We have a political and moral responsibility towards them, but they also have one towards us, particularly as regards human rights and freedom of expression, as you pointed out, Commissioner."
"For these three countries our support should also be more concerned with resolving the conflicts."
"Currently, the EU is only managing them."
"Without a political compromise between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, without a peace plan between Georgia on the one hand and South Ossetia and Abkhazia on the other, these countries will not be able to restore relationships of trust or establish lasting stability between themselves and with their larger neighbours."
"As regards supporting democracy, we are doing this every day."
"Unfortunately, the events that shook Georgia pushed it into a political crisis that it has still not found a way out of, with the opposition taking to the streets to challenge the results of the first round of the presidential elections."
"Of course, by responding to the call for the President to resign, Mr Saakashvili caught the opposition unawares, leaving it very little time to organise the elections."
"Of course, this election campaign was not fair because two candidates were able to deploy considerably greater resources than the others."
"Of course, the campaign was marred by allegations and revelations of the orchestration of a post-election coup d'état by an opposition candidate, but nevertheless it should be noted that on election day - and we were there as observers - no major incidents were reported by the observers, and there had never been so many of them in such a small country to observe elections."
"With the international community and national and international NGOs, we were able to witness the freedom of expression of citizens generally, even if many irregularities and much intimidation were noted, though nothing systematic."
"In our conclusion, we stressed the obligation to continue the legal proceedings, to take all the complaints into consideration and not to consider the results definitive until all the disputes had been looked into, and dozens of polling stations were thus cancelled."
"Today, however, the situation has not been settled at all, and we must continue to appeal to Georgia's leaders, on all political sides, to resume and continue the dialogue; we must appeal to the authorities to hear the opposition's claims; and we must appeal to the opposition, which gained credibility during these elections, to assume its share of the responsibility for suggesting compromises, because Georgia really needs to get back to where it was before, the place it occupied after the Rose Revolution, that of a country that has turned the page on violence and instability."
"That is what Georgia's people are demanding, and that is what they are also asking of the European Union today, and we must stick by them."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, I would like to express our great unease about the developments emerging in this region inhabited by millions of workers of dozens of different nationalities."
"These developments greatly endanger them because of the intensification of imperialist clashes between the United States of America, Russia and the European Union in relation to energy sources and control of markets and of transport routes for energy."
"The rest is rhetoric."
"Unfortunately, the expansion of ΝΑΤΟ to include countries in the region - and the impending affiliation of Ukraine and Georgia - are yet more factors contributing to destabilisation in the region."
"Also contributing to instability are foreign bases and armies stationed in sensitive locations of intersection, as if preparing for serious new military conflicts."
"The recent news that 3 000 US soldiers are expected to be based in the region of Burgas in Bulgaria, from where the new Burgas-Alexandroupolis oil pipeline starts, confirms all that we are saying and is a cause for great concern."
"Similarly worrying is the information on preparations for the permanent presence of foreign naval forces in the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea from countries that do not belong to the region, such as the United States."
"Commissioner, the impending independence of Kosovo, supported by the United States and the European Union, will open up a Pandora's box for a whole series of similar issues in the region we are discussing: Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Transdnestria and Nagorno-Karabakh, and other minority issues, whether already existing or heralded by disputes."
"The policy of double standards that you are adopting will wreck the region and will give rise to further bloodshed."
"You are merely pretending to be interested in the territorial integrity of Georgia and Azerbaijan."
"As the European Union is interested only in finding ways to infiltrate the region, it is proposing the organisation of a 'three-plus-three' conference on security and cooperation in the South Caucasus, involving participation by the three-plus-three states: the three of the South Caucasus plus the European Union, the United States and Russia."
"This is really a proposal for the legalisation of the US presence."
"We believe that you have no right to involve the peoples of Europe in opportunistic plans serving the interests of multinationals, which are making a fortune in a bid to pocket greater profits from the pumping of oil."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the importance of the South Caucasus as an energy corridor for the European Union cannot be underestimated."
"What will otherwise become of our objective of energy diversification?"
"Thus, we are entirely in agreement with the line of Mrs Polfer's report."
"The analyst Vladimir Socor expressed this corridor function of the South Caucasus succinctly, saying that the Azerbaijan-Georgia-Turkey railway would break Russia's monopoly on rail transport from Kazakhstan and other Central Asian states in the same way as pipelines through the South Caucasus eliminate Russia's monopoly on the transport of oil and gas from Central Asia."
"We can add to this the Azerbaijani energy supplies necessary to implement the Nabucco project."
"If the European Union wants to draw maximum benefit from the South Caucasus as an energy corridor, it is above all essential for internal political stability to prevail in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"Regrettably, there is no social consensus on this in these countries."
"This presents the EU with a direct task."
"The desirability of political stability also applies at regional level."
"Brussels is entitled and obliged to engage Turkey, a candidate country, on this issue, as an outbreak of military confrontation in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is a very real possibility in the long run, given the quadrupling of Azerbaijani military capacity and the increasing external assistance Baku is currently receiving with this."
"- (PL) Madam President, we are following the situation in the Caucasus with great concern and interest."
"Armenia and Georgia are countries that are very close to Europe, not only geographically, but also in terms of civilisation."
"I wish to express my support for all the democratic forces in these countries and for initiatives aimed at supporting democracy and economic development for the peoples of the Caucasus."
"Stabilisation in this region is in the interests both of all countries in the region, and of their partners and neighbours, including European Union countries."
"It is in our interests to support all the peoples of the region, not least in the spheres of human rights and freedom of the media."
"I hope that the authorities in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia will ensure freedom of speech and freedom of the media in the run-up to the elections that the region is looking forward to in 2008."
"In recent days Georgian citizens have had the opportunity to express their democratic will in Presidential elections."
"Although President Saakashvili has come out on top in this plebiscite, I am disturbed by the large-scale protests from the opposition, which is trying to undermine the election result, and also by recent events in Georgia that ended in the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations, closure of independent media outlets and the introduction of a state of emergency."
"I also wish to express my doubts concerning the deteriorating situation of human rights and freedom of the media in Azerbaijan."
"Let us not forget the small and historic peoples of the Caucasus, the Abkhazians and Ossetians, whose right to self-determination should be taken into account in the framework of multilateral dialogue with the Georgian authorities."
"Mutual understanding and dialogue are also required in the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, where the independent aspirations of the Armenian section of society should be taken into account and reconciled with the expectations of the Azeri populace and nationality."
"All sides should realise that their future and wellbeing depend on the potential to come to an understanding and build mutual relations based on peace and mutual trust."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Madam President."
"We regularly dedicate attention to the situation and development of the South Caucasus region."
"The gradual implementation of the document on interparliamentary cooperation and strengthening the ENP, and of the action plans, will result in positive development."
"I would like to show all my appreciation to Mrs Polfer, who has done a good job of summarising and formulating concisely and resolutely these very complicated problems."
"The report she has produced clearly sets out the objectives: building up the market economy, supporting economic development effectively and creating energy security, in addition to creating democracy, the rule of law, welfare and security."
"Economic growth is faster from one year to the next, but it is true that the effect it should have on the economic and social conditions of the population still cannot be observed."
"There needs to be an effective EU policy for strengthening the fragile democracy and ensuring genuine freedom of assembly, the media and speech."
"The example of Georgia proves how important a role is played by regular dialogue between the authorities and civil society, or with the enemy."
"The fundamental problem is creating political stability in a region bogged down by three conflicts."
"In the meantime, we need to confront a factor that signifies permanent insecurity, namely the subversive endeavours of Russian superpower policy."
"I am convinced that the EU must act more resolutely against Russia in this matter."
"The problem of Nagorno-Karabakh is particularly worrying."
"The Minsk Group is carrying out consistent work, but despite this we have not moved from our standstill."
"The negotiation process must be maintained, and so I consider both fundamental principles to be important: the equal treatment of regional integrity and the right of self-determination."
"However, the first step is inevitably the liberation of the occupied territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, the return of the refugees and the stabilisation of the region."
"Only in this way can the future status of Nagorno-Karabakh be decided upon."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Ms Polfer for her excellent work and excellent cooperation."
"The European Parliament sends out loud and clear messages with this report: the message that the EU should get strongly involved in the South Caucasus, the message that the EU can play a decisive role in the region and the message that the EU should increase financial and technical assistance to help Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan to reform their administration and to develop their democratic institutions, to encourage civil society to interact and to strengthen these nations' commitments to the European values of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law."
"These are the core principles of the EU but, as I have said again and again in this House, we have to accept that the improvements in those areas are a step-by-step process, which will take time."
"My conclusion in that situation is that all three countries are moving in the right direction, slowly and sometimes with setbacks, but I hold on to the fact that the situation is better than it was a couple of years ago."
"On the Georgian elections, I have nothing to add to what my colleagues have already said."
"The situation is, as I have just said, a step forward, but a lot remains to be done."
"Concerning the answer to frozen conflicts, everybody agrees that finding a peaceful solution is the key to achieving political stability."
"Especially with regard to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, I am one of those who support a solution based on the principles of territorial integrity and the right of self-determination."
"I am also one of those who believe that new security arrangements are needed to build trust between the different sides and put an end to the slow but steady and warring process of the demilitarisation of the region."
"As I said before, more intensive engagement is needed from the EU and the international community."
"A 'no war, no peace' situation is a source of instability and, most of all, the EU can and should transfer its experience and achievements in peace-building, economic prosperity and democracy in the region."
"(FI) Madam President, first of all I wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Polfer, for an excellent report, which represents a thorough survey of the situation in South Caucasus and the opportunities afforded by the European Neighbourhood Policy in the region."
"Extending the European Neighbourhood Policy to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia is an important step forward in the Union's engagement with the region."
"Just the name of the report, 'from promises to actions', however, is enough to encourage the Union to be more actively involved in this region."
"At the same time, the ENP will be an opportunity for the countries of South Caucasus for closer cooperation with the Union."
"The region's many challenges, however, call for more effective action on the part of the Union and, furthermore, require the countries of South Caucasus to show more responsibility and commitment to this partnership."
"One of the main aims is a peaceful resolution of the many local conflicts."
"That would bring stability to the region and improve its chances of developing independently."
"I want to stress the importance of supporting civil society and developing people-to-people contacts in building democracy and the rule of law."
"For example, EU-funded cross-border projects are tools for resuming dialogue and increasing confidence between the parties, but that requires the relevant countries to agree not to hamper the programmes and projects designed to bring this about."
"Furthermore, closer relations will only really be achieved by reducing the restrictions on border traffic, with student and pupil exchange programmes, and by facilitating the movement of researchers, investigators, artists, entrepreneurs and journalists."
"Developing the visa regime between the countries of South Caucasus and the EU would also enhance trade and economic cooperation, as the Committee on International Trade has stated."
"- (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, in a situation where, in the South Caucasus, the interests of several influential geopolitical participants are in competition, it is important to distinguish their true influence."
"The report has to a great extent avoided acknowledging Russia's real role in this region."
"Our experience in the Baltic States has shown us that the cause of many problems is Russia's neo-imperialist foreign policy and its wish to regain influence in the territories it has lost."
"I cannot agree with the view expressed in the report that membership of NATO could foster a renewal of conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"We should note that more than 70% of Georgia's inhabitants in fact voted for NATO membership, but in truth Russia has complicated the situation by encouraging changes in the ethnic make-up and altering the make-up of citizens."
"We must not ignore the people's wish to get closer to Western democracy."
"Proof of Georgia's democratic progress is also provided by the presidential elections of 5 January which, by and large, were held in accordance with international standards."
"It is possible that we have been too critical of Azerbaijan, since a desire to respect human rights has been displayed - 119 prisoners were released in December's presidential decree, including journalists."
"The European Union must be more actively involved in the resolution of protracted conflicts, which is a precondition for stability and development."
"The first step could be to encourage an exchange of Russian military forces for international peace-keepers."
"We must speak to Russia in clear language."
"Using the language of fables is not the way to move from promises to action."
"Thank you."
"(CS) Madam President, to start with I would like to say many thanks to the Commissioner for her reply to my question, which concerned the criminal liability of persons in Georgia."
"It is a very sensitive issue, which was also dealt with in the pre-election discussions in Georgia."
"I would like to mention that the previous speaker stated that Russia has imperialistic intentions."
"Yes, that is possible."
"However, I have to say that the Caucasus is neither the Alps nor the Pyrenees."
"The Caucasus is just the Caucasus, and for us it is necessary to understand it in its geographical context."
"I had prepared a longer speech, but I will summarise my mission as an electoral observer in Georgia in seven points."
"Firstly, just like the large majority of the people in the Caucasus region, we in Western, Central and Eastern Europe also want to see stability in this region."
"It is possible that this stability will be achieved with the support of the United States or the European Union."
"Secondly, it is our duty as Members of the European Parliament to question the use of the financial resources that the European Union provided for relevant programmes."
"They should not be used for the election of President Saakashvili."
"Thirdly, it is charming that the old-new President is suggesting a dialogue with Russia; however, a rule applies that, just like at an official ball, if you offer an arm to a lady it does not mean that you will be dancing the way she wishes."
"What I want to say is: if President Saakashvili is suggesting dialogue with Russia, it is necessary for the other party to understand that this is a genuine invitation to dance."
"Fourthly, all countries are interested in the Caucasus, including the United States and the countries of the European Union."
"Unfortunately, the European Union barely registers in the Caucasus."
"Commissioner, I have to admit that the European Union's concern for this region is not obvious, and that includes its concern for the poverty there."
"In this sense our common European policy will have to be better formulated; it should not just be words, but also actions and finances."
"Madam President, I cannot support a Black Sea policy."
"It will consume vast amounts of money."
"My country is the EU's second biggest paymaster, and our Government has just decided to reduce our EU rebate by a UKP 1 billion per annum."
"Initially, one of the thrusts of this policy will be to facilitate the supply of gas and oil to the West."
"Two years ago we saw Russia cut the supply of gas to Ukraine at Christmas time."
"They were just flexing their muscles, and once Russia has an even bigger share of Western energy supplies, who is to say they will not do this again - to all of us?"
"Europe must become more self-sufficient in energy - not by useless wind power, nor by biofuels."
"When there is a world shortage of grain, it is madness to replace a fuel shortage with a food shortage."
"My Government has, almost too late in the day, announced a programme to build a new generation of nuclear power stations, hopefully catching up with France - that is, 70% of electricity by nuclear."
"We should and must do more and use the access power to produce hydrogen and develop the technology to use that in place of oil."
"If the EU really wants to make a difference, it should fund the building of nuclear power stations across the continent, to reduce our dependence on unstable regimes and overlong delivery lines."
"Then, and only then, would we have the money available to help the poorer regions around the Black Sea."
"Pumping money in now will only further delay the promised funding of the 10 new eastern EU members - a promise yet to be kept."
"Promises - in Britain we were promised a referendum on the European Constitution, Lisbon Treaty, call it what you will."
"In this Chamber, I now demand that the EU hold a referendum on the Treaty in all Member States, including the UK."
"Ask the people."
"- (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation is quite a mature regional body involved in constant intensive and extensive cooperation."
"Furthermore, it constitutes a forum for contact between Europe and Asia."
"It is a forum for creative expression, different cultures, different ethnic identities and religions."
"The BSEC is called upon to play an important role in securing peace, stability and prosperity in regions facing considerable challenges, such as the Balkans and the Caucasus, as well as in the creation of a Eurasian economic area."
"The geostrategic and economic importance of the rapidly developing Black Sea region is undeniable."
"Of particular importance is the development of marine links, road transport and corridors as well as cooperation in the energy sphere, together with the promotion of sustainable development."
"Relations between the EU and the Black Sea region have taken on a new dynamic thanks to the Commission's communication on cooperation with the Black Sea region. This communication bears the stamp of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner."
"I think, nevertheless, that a broad, cohesive, strategic approach to the area is required."
"I also support the institutionalisation of interparliamentary cooperation between the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Assembly of the BSEC."
"Finally, allow me to highlight the particularly constructive part being played by my country, Greece, with its dual identity as a Member State of the EU and of the BSEC, in strengthening cooperation both within the BSEC and at cross-regional level within the EU."
"I would like to end by congratulating the two rapporteurs, particularly Mrs Anastase, as well as the Commissioner for her productive contribution in revealing the common priorities of these two structures."
"Commissioner, I still think that we should be even more courageous and should establish institutionalised cross-regional cooperation between the EU and the Black Sea region."
"(DE) Madam President, I would firstly like to thank both rapporteurs for their excellent and highly cooperative work."
"I would also like to thank the Commissioner, because I know that she is rightly very committed to this area and because I believe that she wants to do even more than many Member States have perhaps wanted."
"We offer her our utmost support in this."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Semneby sincerely, as he represents the Council and is also very active in this region."
"I believe that we have to achieve something that at least in its approach corresponds to what I and my colleagues constantly refer to as the EU Black Sea region."
"Mr Sarkozy has used it in another way for the Mediterranean region, namely in terms of a split in the European Union."
"No, the entire European Union and this region surrounding the Black Sea and the South Caucasus must work together in terms of a partnership - as others, too, have already stated - in order to resolve the common problems that exist: the political problems, e.g. in terms of stability, migration, and of course also economic problems, and here I am simply thinking of energy transit."
"For example, anyone who would like to be just a little bit less dependent on Russia must ensure that there are other channels, and these eventually cross this region, in particular Turkey."
"Whatever you think about membership - I know that there are differing opinions on this - Turkey remains an important partner for the European Union in this region and therefore we must, of course, include Turkey in this matter."
"I concede to my colleague Mr°Severin, who has said that we ought to try to resolve these matters together with the Russian mainland."
"This should not mean, however, that we push aside the independence, autonomy and power of spontaneous healing of countries in this region, and say that we can resolve matters only with Russia."
"Russia must also know that we support these countries in their aspiration to independence and also in the resolution of conflicts."
"Europe must be a partner here, clearly standing alongside these countries."
"This means that the Black Sea region is a very important one for the European Union."
"We should not forego the opportunity to develop this field together."
"Only when we face Russia together will we be able to assert our interests together."
"(SV) Madam President, I want to say a big word of thanks to the rapporteur, Lydie Polfer, for a quite excellent report."
"It is time to stop making empty promises and instead act to ensure better integration of the South Caucasus with the European Union."
"As Parliament's rapporteur on the visa code, I would like to direct attention to freedom of movement and strongly urge both the Commission and the Member States to work to make this possible."
"For the EU's neighbour countries and countries in the Caucasus to build up democratic societies subject to the rule of law and functioning market economies, their citizens must be able to adapt smoothly to the EU in order to benefit from our experience in the field."
"That is not the case at present."
"It is generally known that the consular services of the EU Member States are woefully inadequate in many countries of the South Caucasus."
"They are deficient in both subsidiarity and effectiveness."
"I therefore call on the Member States to increase their cooperation."
"I see two possibilities."
"One is mentioned in the report we are now discussing, that is the call to create common application centres for EU visas."
"Unfortunately the road to that is long."
"I therefore also propose an alternative solution, namely that nationals of the countries affected in the South Caucasus should have the right, irrespective of the purpose of their journey, to apply for a visa at the EU or Schengen country consulate located within easiest reach of them."
"- (PL) Madam President, this is an important debate and an important report from Mrs Polfer."
"This voice from the European Parliament is striving to make up for 10 to 20 years of delay."
"During this time the Union has not in practice had any real policy regarding the countries of the South Caucasus."
"Now at last we have come to understand that Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia are not a natural zone for the economic and political influences of Russia."
"I am saying this precisely 11 days after the elections in Georgia, where I was one of six observers from the European Parliament, monitoring elections that were once again won by a representative of the pro-Western option, a proponent of maximum convergence with the Union and entry into NATO."
"I say this also in the context of a political conflict that threatens us all - the whole of Europe - and may even develop into a military conflict between Georgia and Russia over Ossetia and Abkhazia, but Erevan, Baku and Tbilisi are equally of significance for the Union's energy policy and for diversification of energy sources."
"So let us move from words to deeds, as it says in the report's title; let us make the transition from idle words to action."
"Madam President, after more than a century and a half of neglect, the Black Sea area is again at the pinnacle of international economics and politics."
"This area is currently striving to reach a new balance following the entrance of new actors, the EU included, after being considered a closed lake for so many years during the Cold War."
"After the Commission's communication entitled 'Black Sea synergy: a new regional cooperation initiative', the current first report in Parliament is another step in the right direction."
"But unfortunately, both are still not enough."
"The lack of identity of the area itself and the traditional sensitivities of certain EU countries towards Russia, both political (for example Ukraine, Moldova, the Southern Caucasus and the frozen conflicts) and economic (the increased European dependence on Russian gas and the delicate status of the EU-Turkey negotiations), are probably among the reasons why the EU has limited itself to synergy instead of strategy."
"While strategy means clear objectives, concrete means to attain them and, eventually, a detailed calendar, all tailored to the merit of the area itself, synergy suggests simply connecting to neighbouring areas of interest to the EU."
"A strategy could be arrived at through concrete measures on how the EU deals with a multitude of local organisations; on physically linking the area to the rest of the continent in which the River Danube is crucial; and on strengthening the instrument of neighbourhood policy towards the Black Sea area, as suggested through my group's amendments."
"In conclusion, one word on Moldova, the last piece of continental Latinity outside EU borders."
"Although part of the same regrettable experience at the beginning of the Second World War, Moldova could not share the positive destiny of the three Baltic countries after the Cold War."
"I believe Europe has a duty to correct that situation and thus continue to encourage and respond to Moldova's efforts to join the Union."
"My hope is that her case will be finally judged on its own merit and not remain a de facto prisoner of other EU relations, no matter how strategic that relation might be."
"(SV) Madam President, let me thank the rapporteur for an excellent report on a region which merits our attention."
"The South Caucasus occupies an increasingly strategic position from both a political and an economic point of view."
"We all note the increasing interest in the region, not least in this assembly."
"Regrettably there are many potential flashpoints, and Russian interference is considerable."
"Russia wants to increase its influence and signal its interest in dominating and controlling processes such as oil and gas supplies to Europe."
"The EU must see the danger in Russia's conduct and therefore strengthen its ties with the South Caucasus."
"By this means we could also acquire a useful and necessary supplement to Russian oil and gas with distribution routes in northern Europe."
"The EU has everything to gain from greater involvement."
"I am a member of a Swedish organisation - I actually helped to found it - which aims to increase contacts between Sweden and Azerbaijan."
"I therefore say this as a friend."
"The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 1991-1994 put a million people to flight, and the conflict is still unresolved."
"According to Amnesty International, 600 000 internal refugees are living in appalling conditions in Azerbaijan."
"Some years ago I visited a refugee camp in Azerbaijan close to the border with Iran."
"I myself have never witnessed such abject poverty."
"It is wholly unacceptable that, after all these years, hundreds of thousands of people should still be living in such degrading conditions."
"In this respect Azerbaijan's leaders, headed by President Aliyev, deserve serious criticism."
"The EU and the Commission must do more in this area."
"These refugees must not be forgotten people."
"It is also important that we act forcefully to ensure that such a basic right as freedom of expression is upheld."
"Opposition politicians and journalists must not be subjected to threats and intimidation or be imprisoned."
"If Azerbaijan wants to be a nation respected in Europe, it must uphold the fundamental principles of a democratic state subject to the rule of law."
". - (PL) Madam President, the problems we are debating today - as those who have spoken before me have said - are of unusual importance."
"They mark out a vector for Community action that has been and still is greatly neglected."
"If it is not to lose its element of Europeanness, the European Union may naturally enlarge itself and spread its influence only towards the East."
"However, the discussions that stretch out into infinity concerning, for example, the membership prospects for certain countries in this region do not instil optimism."
"There is no need for analysis and immersion in documents to be able to state that this region, compared with Africa, for instance, is treated as a remote province of our continent."
"All cooperation mechanisms, as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy, for example, are important, but this is not the target prospect for this region, as it does not stipulate true partnership in mutual relations."
"For the Union, serious involvement in this region is linked to entry into the sphere of influence of Russia, and this, surely, means the continuing use of half-measures in the region."
"What we must remember, however, is that in the long term this policy will not stabilise the area: it will do the opposite, perhaps generating new tensions, and we already have plenty of those to be going on with."
"Madam President, the rapporteur on the Black Sea regional policy reminds us that the European Union supports new energy infrastructure and viable transport corridors, diversifying both suppliers and routes."
"The prime example of such an undertaking is the Nabucco Gas Pipeline, already recognised as a priority project of European interest."
"It is, therefore, regrettable that this project is being undermined by an alternative Russian-Italian pipeline by the name of South Stream."
"As a Member from Poland, I see many parallels between South Stream and the Nord Stream Baltic Gas Pipeline."
"Both are much more expensive than overland routes."
"Indeed, South Stream may prove to be USD 4 billion more expensive than Nabucco."
"Both may disturb the fragile ecological balance of sensitive marine environments."
"Furthermore, in both cases, the pipelines may be seen as a political weapon in the hands of Russia."
"Nord Stream will isolate Poland, the Baltic States and Ukraine; South Stream will play the same role with respect to Turkey, the South Caucasus and, possibly, Romania, which may now be bypassed in favour of Serbia."
"South Stream goes against the principle of energy security in Europe, based on diverse sources and routes."
"Thus, if South Stream does go ahead, it should not receive EU funding at any stage."
"If Russia is going to push forward economically unviable and environmentally questionable projects, because they serve its foreign policy aims, then it should not be at our expense."
"(NL) Madam President, I welcome the fact that this evening we are discussing in context the situation in the South Caucasus and our ambitions as the European Union and as Parliament with regard to the Black Sea region."
"After all, we are talking about regions with regional problems, where regional solutions have to be found for the sake of the countries forming part of that region."
"We are talking here about security, energy, trade, transport - or, more generally, about stability and the development of the regions bordering on the EU, regions where we have major interests."
"These are interests that, in my opinion, must be reflected in a more active policy on the part of the EU and the European Commission."
"We are obliged to the Commissioner for the initiatives she has developed under the umbrella of 'Black Sea Synergy'."
"As other Members have already said, it is important to emphasise that there is also a role for Russia and Turkey in this kind of cooperation."
"These countries have already assumed this role, and it is particularly important that the EU makes sure that they retain it."
"After all, we have good relations with Turkey - we are conducting negotiations with it about its membership - although Turkey also has a broader role to play in the region, as well as a traditional role."
"Russia is important within the region, but relations with that country are rather more complicated."
"I believe that, if the EU positions itself as a partner rather than a driver within this cooperation, Moscow will come to feel that responsibility for the region is being shared, that we can cooperate as partners without the EU playing the leading role."
"Synergy is a good idea - it is a good summary of the bundling of the EU's - the Commission's - policy activities - but, to provide this with a little more structure, Mr Swoboda and I have suggested giving it a parliamentary dimension, with ministerial consultations at the level of the Black Sea region."
"We would welcome a little more structure."
"Indeed, we have even talked of an EU-Black Sea Community, although, following Mr Sarkozy's initiatives, we have perhaps become more modest when it comes to using that kind of terminology."
"It is important to emphasise that, whilst our suggestions and your vision are no replacement for the EU's bilateral relations with all these countries, they could nevertheless spur our eastern neighbours on to more regional cooperation."
"I believe that this is also of key importance to the EU."
"(ET) Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen."
"The European Union's interest and objective in South Caucasus is to support and encourage the development currently under way in the three countries in the region towards the establishment of peaceful and stable countries."
"The neighbourhood policy is in operation but it is also necessary to draw up a regional policy to operate alongside it."
"At the same time we must not be indifferent to the distinctive features of the three countries, otherwise our policies will not be effective."
"I should stress once again, the countries of South Caucasus - Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, are very different in terms of culture, customs, religion and geopolitics."
"However, they have in common their background - they have all broken loose from the influence of Soviet ideology, an influence which lasted for nearly 100 years."
"They have not yet fully rid themselves of the military presence of the Soviet Union's successor - Russia."
"These countries need, and their people want, democratic reforms; they need the real, targeted assistance of the European Union."
"The expectation and need is for work to start immediately by the Commission Delegations in Yerevan and Baku."
"At the same time the work of the European Union Special Representative for South Caucasus is not enough in its current form."
"There has been no explanation as to why the special representative's reports over the years have not been available to the European Parliament."
"This situation should be changed."
"All of us are working with the same objective in view."
"We must not forget that democracy is not a thing, it is a way of thinking and cannot simply be removed one day or shifted from one country to another."
"Full democracy does not appear overnight."
"We are not at ease with everything that is going on in Armenia or Azerbaijan or Georgia, whether it be in relation to combating corruption or the judiciary or the situation of the media in the region."
"The countries themselves are not happy with these aspects either."
"It is in our power to provide them with active support both for their institutions and in the form of expert and financial assistance."
"The region welcomes all real aid today."
"Therefore I call upon the Commission and the European Parliament to make more use of the know-how of today's European Union Member States who were recently in the same situation as South Caucasus."
"We know what the local conditions and problems are, and our experience of establishing states based on the rule of law and a market economy would be of practical assistance to them."
"- (PL) Madam President, in taking the floor in a debate devoted to the countries of the South Caucasus and regional policy in the Black Sea basin, I wish to draw attention to the following issues."
"To begin with, this is a vast area for the production and transmission of energy, and one that is of exceptional importance from the aspect of diversification and security of energy raw material supplies to the Union."
"However, support is needed for projects involving energy raw material transport from this area, not only to the south of Europe, as has been happening so far, but also to the north - to Ukraine and Poland - and on to the west."
"Secondly, only EU support for political stability and democratisation processes in this region, and also the peaceful resolution of conflicts between neighbours, can provide the opportunity for rapid economic development in these countries and a genuine cut in the enormous unemployment and poverty rates."
"Thirdly, the strong economic growth throughout the region, which in some countries is above 30% of GDP annually, is based solely and exclusively on the production and export of crude oil and natural gas."
"What is needed in this area, therefore, is support for alternative sources of income, especially the development of tourism and the associated infrastructure."
"Madam President, the author of the Commission communication on a Black Sea synergy, Janos Herman, is to be congratulated on an outstanding piece of work."
"Parliament's rapporteur, Ms Anastase, has also produced an extremely important report."
"Madam Commissioner, you said at the outset of this debate that you agreed with much of Ms Anastase's report."
"In your response winding-up this debate, could you refer specifically to paragraphs 29 and 36 of the report?"
"Paragraph 29 calls on you to promote an intercultural dialogue in the Black Sea region, and paragraph 36 to set up an NGO platform for civil society exchanges."
"Could you give Parliament your assurance that you will implement those two recommendations?"
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, please allow me in my short speech to concentrate on just one of the aspects of today's topics, which is regional cooperation."
"If we consider two areas, the Southern Caucasus and the Black Sea area, we can see that the mutual relationships between the countries are usually under-developed, whether they are bilateral or multilateral."
"More significant political dialogue is usually lacking, the level of trade between these countries is very low, and a modern and effective transport or energy infrastructure is lacking nearly everywhere."
"I therefore welcome the invitations of both rapporteurs to strengthen this very aspect: mutual regional cooperation in these regions, in addition to bilateral relations with the European Union."
"It is vital to strengthen regional cooperation in the area of human and citizens' rights, to develop democracy and educational systems; to strengthen regional cooperation in the fields of transport, energy and the environment; to strengthen regional cooperation in the fields of trade, tourism and investment."
"In other words, it is vital to create gradually, step by step, a solid canvas of human, cultural, economic and political relationships between the nations and the states of the Southern Caucasus and the Black Sea area."
"If this succeeds, I am convinced that even in that geographical area the lingering conflicts will be gradually sorted out and finally resolved, and an area of stability, democracy and prosperity will be created."
"(SV) Madam President, with its clear geostrategic position, the Black Sea region is one which is important to both the EU and the countries in the wider area, not simply for security-political reasons but also because of its cultural diversity and cultural wealth."
"However, regions in which many routes intersect and in which there is a variety of political and other interests are often at risk of conflicts of one kind or another."
"I myself was born in the Balkans and I know what protracted and unresolved conflicts can mean, not just for the security situation in a whole region but also for its economic potential and for the normalisation of life for the people who live there."
"I also know that the EU has an important role to play."
"The EU can and must have as its aim, together with people of the Black Sea countries, to develop the region into one which is stable and secure and in which democratic principles and the rule of law prevail."
"Increasing cooperation in the energy field is also an important element in that work."
"By investing in new infrastructure and increasing the spread of suppliers, we shall contribute to economic and commercial development in the region, which in turn will improve the chances of stability and security."
"To strengthen ties between the EU and the Black Sea region is therefore not just good but necessary."
"Hence it is self-evident that the Black Sea region needs a new and clearer regional policy."
"I must emphasise that regional policy should not be used as an alternative to EU membership for those countries which may be eligible."
"It must also not be used as an excuse to delay the process of integrating the region with Europe."
"Finally I want to thank the two rapporteurs for their excellent work and offer a special word of thanks to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for her personal interest and proven personal commitment to matters affecting this region."
"(BG) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, I would like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the two reports, on the Black Sea and on the Southern Caucasus, were prepared and discussed in the Committee on Foreign Affairs in an atmosphere of agreement, and were adopted practically unanimously."
"This is an encouraging sign that we are aware how important it is to build a clearer, more systematic, more structured and unified policy towards the Black Sea region and adjacent countries."
"This is not an easy task."
"The Black Sea region consists of countries with diverse traditions, cultures, political practices, territorial spans and population sizes."
"Also, these countries are at different stages in their cooperation with the European Union, ranging from Member States, candidate countries, to countries from the European Neighbourhood Policy and, of course, Russia, whose constructive approach would be key to the success of this initiative."
"This mix, however, provides a number of opportunities for a combination of the various policies to produce a much larger aggregate effect."
"I would like to make three points."
"Firstly, the region is of extreme strategic importance for the European Union in terms of security, energy supplies, transportation and trade, environment, etc. That is why, while appreciating highly the Commission initiative on Black Sea synergy, we would like to see a more ambitious project based on the achievements within the Nordic dimension or the EU-Mediterranean cooperation."
"At a time of promoting the idea for an EU-Mediterranean Union, there is nothing more natural than to find a more ambitious formula for the Black Sea region."
"Secondly, the whole region has an underdeveloped transport and energy transmission infrastructure."
"That is why I think it appropriate to support all transnational projects planned in that respect because they are mutually complementary, and not alternatives."
"This means more security, facilitation of economic exchanges and linking the countries in the region with the European Union."
"This will diversify not only the sources but also the routes along which oil and natural gas will reach the European Union."
"Thirdly, most countries in the region suffer from serious social problems and we would like to make sure that social issues are not pushed into the background."
"Long-term prospects for countries on the Black Sea and in the Southern Caucasus are linked to human potential development, investment in education, ensuring adequate health services and child care."
"Thank you."
"Madam President, I would inform the Commissioner that, along with several colleagues, I am convinced the EU has to demonstrate increased engagement in the South Caucasus."
"After all, all the states in that region are already members of the Council of Europe and, as such, are part of Europe."
"The extended neighbourhood policies will be a valuable tool for applying such an engagement in real terms."
"Our challenge and chance is to play the role of a reliable stabiliser, but also that of an independent mediator and supporter of the democratic process."
"We therefore need to leave behind hesitations and ambiguity."
"It is high time to profile EU policies more clearly in this area."
"The EU representative, Peter Semneby, has done an outstanding job, and I am glad, Commissioner, that you spoke about increasing and widening our representations in the region."
"Long-term, active EU engagement will certainly contribute to also finding a solution to the frozen conflicts which the Committee on Foreign Affairs has decided to term, more realistically, 'unresolved, post-Soviet conflicts'."
"Therefore, it is significant that the report rejects attempts by any foreign power to create exclusive zones of interest in the region, and urges Russia not to oppose EU engagement in conflict management and peacekeeping operations."
"Equally important, however, will be the EU's role in advancing the culture of democratic dialogue in the region."
"The European Parliament will have an important part to play in this."
"Members of Parliament can mediate and encourage normal political dialogue between opposing parties."
"Finally, it is important that the report encourages the Commission to move towards possible free trade agreements with Armenia and Georgia, and to make preparations for a mobility partnership agreement between the EU and Georgia."
"So, the South Caucasus has become increasingly close and important for us."
"That region deserves our firm commitment."
"Madam President, the EU is able and willing to help strengthen stability and democracy and improve living standards in the Black Sea and South Caucasus region."
"The involvement of large states such as Turkey, Ukraine and Russia is important, although they all have a different status in terms of their relations with the EU."
"Poland brings its potential and experience to this region, despite not being directly connected to it, because of its shared history with the Baltic States."
"However, just when intensified dialogue and cooperation with our neighbours is badly needed, the EU has drawn down another curtain through some aspects of the expanded Schengen area."
"For many Eastern Europeans, 1 January 2008 brought with it a four-fold price rise in visas for travel to neighbouring countries, thus drawing down a financial curtain in Europe."
"I disagree with statements made by officials of the Commission to the effect that our Southern and Eastern neighbours should be treated equally from this point of view."
"Our Eastern neighbours are on the same continent, and not long ago some of us lived in one country with them, with no borders."
"I look to my colleagues for support for the PSE Group's Amendment 10 to the Black Sea strategy report."
"We urge the Council and Commission to decrease visa fees to a more acceptable level for ordinary citizens of countries participating in the EU's neighbourhood policy or having a strategic partnership with the EU."
"(RO) First of all, allow me to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Anastase, as well as my colleagues on the various committees that delivered their opinions, on the report under discussion, which is as momentous as the problems involved in the establishment of a regional Black Sea policy."
"I would also like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Regional Development for their support to the amendments proposed to the opinion of the Committee that I'm a member of."
"I am referring to the inclusion in the final draft of the Black Sea report of my request for strengthening the European assistance mission on the Moldovan and Ukrainian border and the need for improved management of illegal migration and immigration in the area."
"I believe we need the Commission's encouragement in the form of action in the region, at both country and regional levels, for this area to become truly democratic and stable."
"A more active European involvement would mean a real opportunity for this area which has a huge, insufficiently exploited potential, considering the frozen conflicts and tense relations between some countries in the area."
"Institutionally speaking, I am in favour of the idea of Member States in the area assuming leadership (Romania, Bulgaria, Greece), and I think that the Union and the countries in the region should strengthen and coordinate regional cooperation activities and mechanisms."
"It is only in this way that the doubling of funds available via the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the principles governing the Structural Funds, such as partnership, sustainability, effectiveness, non-discrimination and decentralisation, will yield the beneficial effects that we all expect."
"- (PL) Madam President, the rapporteurs cannot hide their satisfaction at having presented the European Parliament with an initiative to strengthen Black Sea synergy, a proposal put forward by the German Presidency and fleshed out by the European Commission."
"This idea has also received support from the countries of the southern and eastern part of the Baltic that have recently been integrated into the European Union."
"Their stance also provides evidence of a conviction that there is a need for the close bundling of Black Sea synergy together with what is known as the EU's Eastern dimension."
"In this way local cooperation acquires a more general significance, and a realisation potential in line with the basic Community message."
"In other words, Black Sea synergy should express itself simply in the identification and synthesis of multilateral undertakings, by identifying them with the best interests of both the Black Sea region and the entire eastern part of an integrated Europe."
"One important factor that enhances the particular role of the Black Sea is the special geographic, historic and politico-economic situation of this body of water."
"European and Asiatic influences have been criss-crossing here for thousands of years."
"European Union involvement in the Black Sea basin must therefore be shorn of superfluous institutionalisation and political influences, and restrictions threatening an attenuation of the conditions for rational cooperation, and even destabilisation in this region, both in the security sphere and in the sphere of functioning of the communications network, protection of the environment, and so on."
"It should also create additional favourable conditions for a stronger engagement by the Black Sea in the process of diversification of energy supply routes, perhaps involving new sources, especially from what is known as the Caspian direction."
"Many EU countries are known to be interested in this."
"(RO) The essence of the European neighbourhood policy is cooperation based on a set of common values and concerns which the Union shares with the countries involved in this policy."
"It is necessary to strengthen a stable neighbourhood area, which would have a positive influence on the Union's internal security and would be a prerequisite for the economic prosperity and development of the countries concerned."
"The countries in South Caucasus have certain features which are necessary to the success of European projects in key areas such as energy and transport."
"The geopolitical significance of these countries is linked to their strategic position in relation to energy resources in Central Asia."
"This is an essential transit area, being one of the few corridors that may enable the Union to diversify its access to energy resources from the Caspian."
"Possible alternative transit routes for gas pipes from the Caspian and pipeline projects across the Black Sea are largely dependent on stability in the South Caucasus."
"The European Union is not the only actor with a strategic interest in the area."
"Two other major players on the international scene have developed strong initiatives as well as long-term strategies in the area."
"The United States have an action plan on energy security involving the initiation and development of alternate routes for the transport of oil and gas."
"Russia is funding projects of its own, and is strengthening its position on the Central Asian market."
"In the current context, given the obvious importance of the energy issue and dependence on Russia, the European Union's low degree of involvement in the area may lead to negative consequences for all the Member States."
"The European Union must develop a single energy security policy as soon as possible, with Member States renouncing individual interests and necessarily involving South Caucasian countries."
"(BG) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, I congratulate the European Commission for initiating, by its communication, this debate on strengthening cooperation with the Black Sea region by complementing existing bilateral policies by a new regional approach."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms. Anastase, for her very well balanced and innovative report."
"I fully share in the understanding that with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, the Black Sea has acquired a new strategic importance - not just for the countries in the region but for all Member States, and for the Union's policies and principles implemented."
"I appeal to the Commission and insist that it call upon the national governments, in cases of implementations of large infrastructure, energy and environmental projects affecting the livelihoods, health and quality of life of the citizens in the settlements and municipalities where these projects are to be implemented, to provide, on an obligatory basis, local communities with information on the technical parameters of such projects in line with the highest world standards adopted for projects of that kind."
"Sharing the report's deep concern for the environmental status of the Black Sea region, and in particular the status of the Black Sea, which is affected by uncontrolled pollution, exacerbated by many environmental disasters, I insist that independent assessments should be made of the impact of developing new oil and gas transmission infrastructure on the environment and the social life of citizens and that national governments should prepare reports on possible damages that could be caused by such projects, and present them for public referendums and debates."
"A case in point is the project for the construction of the Bourgas - Alexandroupolos oil pipeline in Bulgaria."
"In full agreement with the principles of ensuring sustainable development and environmental disaster recovery as stated in the report and in the context of the two recent tragic accidents in the area of Kerch last November and in the first week of the current year, it is necessary to set up a mechanism to take into consideration the interest of local communities in coastal municipalities where there is a threat to the clean waters of the Black Sea, to the livelihoods and quality of life of citizens in these towns and villages."
"Thank you for your attention."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs for their comprehensive and well-structured reports, and I would like to talk briefly about one aspect."
"In Georgia we have had the elections, confirmed as regular by the OSCE but challenged by Russia, in which outgoing President Saakashvili was re-elected."
"Amid countless difficulties he attempted to bring democracy to the country, dismantling the old post-Soviet diplomacy and opening up to the West, NATO and the EU."
"It was this opening up that caused the retaliation by Putin's Russia, which, amongst other things, has always favoured the independence movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"Apart from the geopolitical situation, however, another cause of friction with Russia is, objectively, the oil and gas pipelines in Georgian territory, designed to carry Azerbaijan's oil and gas westwards."
"I believe that in the Caucasus region which, as we should bear in mind, is affected by the insidious war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Chechen issue, the conflict between Turkey and Armenia and many other problems, having a democratic country which is our ally and, above all, offers an alternative energy source to Moscow, is a factor of strategic importance."
"We should therefore take concrete steps to strengthen this synergy."
"(RO) The Member States and the Commission should step up the implementation of priority projects in the field of trans-European transport on axes 7, 18, 22 and 21 and their progressive integration within TRACECA and with the 5 axes defined in Commission Communication 32/2007 on extending the main trans-European transport routes to neighbouring countries."
"The European Black Sea Dimension should be similar to the Northern Dimension and based on equal partnership and adequate infrastructure for priority projects in the fields of nuclear power, research and safety, transport, tourism, and combating climate change."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the economic development of Black Sea countries requires high-speed motorways and railways connecting the central and western parts of the European Union to its Black Sea coast."
"The European Union should promote the single maritime policy in the Black Sea region."
"This will ensure an integrated approach to environmental protection, coastal area development, maritime research, and tourism."
"Madam President, I put two questions to the Commissioner and when she replies regarding the implementation of paragraph 29, on the promotion of intercultural dialogue, and paragraph 36, on the creation of an NGO platform for exchanges between civil society, perhaps she might bear in mind the precedent that we have in the Balkans under an organisation called CLIO."
"It is independent of governments and involves history teachers from all the countries in the Balkans, who meet together to discuss the common historical and cultural background of the past in order to produce books and documents on the history of their region that are devoid of national conflict."
"Perhaps in the Black Sea region there might also be a lesson: for historians and researchers from all the countries around the Black Sea to meet together, independent of government pressure, to promote a common understanding of the Black Sea's history, devoid of national conflict."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I must say that was one of the best debates I have ever had, and at this very late moment of the day."
"It was about the European neighbourhood policy, which is already there."
"Many of you have said the European Union has to do a lot, but the European Union has done a lot, as others have said."
"I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Ms Anastase and Ms Polfer, because I think you have brought about a very interesting debate."
"But what is the new element of this Black Sea synergy?"
"It is the regional element and, as was rightly said by some Members who unfortunately are no longer here; it was under the German Presidency, to which I would like to pay tribute, that there was the idea of having a regional dimension."
"This is now the regional dimension of the bilateral part of the neighbourhood policy to the east."
"That means that, to achieve a synergy, we are trying to bring together not only the neighbourhood policy countries, but also two other very important players: Turkey and Russia."
"Therefore, it is not a strategy but a synergy, because there are, of course, different strategies."
"If you think: we have a neighbourhood policy, we have a particular strategy towards Russia and, of course, we have a candidate country - Turkey."
"But, still, we think that a policy on working together is very important."
"In the framework of the troika, I am going, together with other colleagues, to this region very soon - I think in two weeks' time - and I will certainly take a lot of what has been said here with me."
"I shall now come to a few points, because there is such a lot to be said that I could speak for another half an hour, but I do not want to do that, because I think we have had a very interesting debate, and a lot will have to be said in the future."
"Trade is one of the important parts."
"You have spoken about energy, about transport, about climate change, as I have myself."
"There are other aspects, but trade is a very important one, and there is a feasibility study on trade already on the way."
"There is a Commission initiative."
"What is the aim?"
"The aim is to evaluate the prospect of further trade openings, for instance in the case of Georgia, in the case of Armenia, but of course we have to see how things are going to evolve."
"This is one thing."
"Secondly, my personal idea when I presented the neighbourhood policy in one of my last communications - not in the very last but the one before - was to say that we need an economic neighbourhood area, an economic space, and this is also what some Members have mentioned here."
"So the idea is to have a sort of free trade in the future."
"But of course we have to get there step by step."
"An area of justice, freedom and liberty will also be there in future, but, of course, it is again a step-by-step approach."
"Many have spoken about a visa policy."
"I can tell you that, as a Commission, we have been quite open to that."
"But you know very well that this is the Member States' competence, so if you speak about visa fees, you know there is a possibility for Member States, in principle, to concede visa freedom and there is also a possibility for Member States to say they would like to go ahead with visa facilitation."
"But it is clearly not the competence of the Commission."
"I just wanted to mention that, because the Commission is always addressed on things where it has tried but has not gone further because of the realities."
"I shall now move on to energy."
"Of course, it is a very important region for energy, and we need coordinated decisions by many - by state and by private players - for long-distance pipelines."
"You know that the Commission uses South Caucasus and Black Sea regional cooperation to facilitate decisions and to diversify sources and routes of supply."
"This includes contacts, for instance, regarding the trans-Caspian gas pipeline, Nabucco."
"You know there is now a coordinator, but, again, it is not only the Commission."
"It is a matter of the Commission and the Member States."
"And again, some Member States have already gone for some different ideas, which are not always within our unified approach."
"I think another very important aspect is port development."
"This is high on our agenda in the framework of our Motorways of the Sea programme."
"So this will also be reflected in the next phase of the TRACECA project."
"Let me now answer Mr Beazley."
"Yes, indeed, there is also the role of intercultural dialogue in this respect."
"But, for instance, yesterday I was in Madrid, where the Alliance of Civilisations was launched, which is now a project on a global scale, within the framework of the United Nations."
"Certainly, one of the local and regional aspects will be this aspect, but I think we should put it into this new global framework."
"Then, on the other hand, you mentioned NGO exchanges."
"On this, I can tell you that the Black Sea cross-border cooperation programme already supports contact between NGOs."
"The Commission is planning some NGO events this year concerning economic cooperation and freedom of the press, and we are cooperating closely in this field with the Black Sea Forum, an initiative of Romania."
"Finally, I think what Mr Beazley mentioned about history books is certainly one of those interesting elements."
"By the way, of course, for the many projects that are being mentioned facility funds are necessary."
"Therefore, we have created in the neighbourhood policy the Neighbourhood Investment Fund which, in principle, targets the South and the East."
"But within regional cooperation there is also a possibility for projects to be brought up."
"I think these are the major points that I would like to make at this stage, but I am sure we can come back to this topic again, maybe after the meetings have taken place."
"And you also know that we are trying, at least as a Commission, to facilitate the questions of how we can help to resolve the frozen conflicts."
"This is, of course, a much more difficult area, because every one is very different, but we are at least trying with our projects to help and to get the right environment in order to facilitate settlements."
"We do hope, together with the Member States and the Council, to come to a good solution."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Madam President, very briefly, I would like to thank all my fellow Members who have spoken, and those who worked with me."
"I have noted with great pleasure that there is a widespread convergence of views on the need to deepen our relations with the countries of the South Caucasus, to share our experience with them, and to support them on the path of reform, both political and economic."
"I would especially like to thank the Commissioner for making herself available this evening, but also for being available and communicating with us to share information and keep track of this dossier."
"I can assure her that she has won our interest, attention and friendship."
"Rapporteur. - (RO) I, too, would like to thank all the speakers for their meaningful contributions concerning major aspects of Black Sea cooperation."
"I fully agree that a separate policy, perhaps even a strategy, should be developed for the Black Sea region, and I would like to stress once again its importance."
"I welcome the organisation of an interministerial conference on Black Sea politics and I hope that one of the outcomes of this conference will be concrete, firm measures concerning all the areas of cooperation among Black Sea countries and between these countries and the European Union."
"I won't dwell on any other issues for the moment; of course, the debate has been very interesting, but there is one major idea to reiterate: that this synergy and the cooperation policy in the Black Sea region should not preclude new prospects for accession."
"Dialogue with the institutionalised civil society is very important, because, indeed, institution building can only be achieved if the people involved are willing to bring about real change."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, at 12 p.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) The report discussing Black Sea synergy rightly elucidates those areas where strengthening dialogue could have mutual benefits for the EU and the states of the region."
"Among these, energy policy will play an unavoidable role."
"Deepening cooperation between the Union and the Black Sea countries could lead to valuable steps forward in the field of the security of Community supplies."
"The construction of gas pipelines to ease greatly Europe's dependency on energy is inconceivable without the active cooperation of the states in the region."
"Developing a transparent, non-discriminatory framework programme for transport is crucial, not only for the Member States of the Union but also for the welfare of the many states in the region."
"We cannot emphasise enough the importance of the Nabucco gas pipeline, since it would mean an alternative for Europe, both in respect of resources and partners and in respect of transportation routes."
"On this point it is particularly important that the relevant countries resist the alluring attempts to divide up the short-term benefits."
"Nabucco may be a symbol not only of the common energy policy that is taking shape but also of Black Sea cooperation."
"When discussing this theme, it would be worthwhile for us to draw attention to the increased activity of Russia in the region."
"The European Union must make it clear that it considers unacceptable her monopolistic endeavours on energy resources that can be discerned here."
"As the Committee on Industry states in its opinion on the report, access to resources is a legitimate Community interest."
"The principles of free competition must prevail when the Union prepares its policy on this."
"in writing. - (ET) The report tackles the area on a regional basis, and although this approach has its advantages, it does not allow the differences between the countries of South Caucasus to be highlighted sufficiently."
"I urge the differences between the countries to be brought out more strongly because otherwise we would be doing something to them which we would not like to be done to us."
"Secondly, the wording of the report may give the impression that Georgia is the most problematic country in the region;"
"I have also seen this happen in debates in various Parliamentary Committees and in groups where Ambassadors have said this themselves."
"In view of recent events, however, this is not in fact true and we know full well that that is the case."
"Regrettably the violence of demonstrations in Tbilisi has received much greater world attention than everyday violations of human rights in for example Azerbaijan, which frequently are not brought to our attention because of the country's large energy resources."
"When considering the situation of the economy or human rights, progress of democratic institutions and media freedom, Georgia's performance is that of a country which has very clearly chosen the road of democracy and is moving forward more successfully than the rest."
"And this too merits greater support on our part."
"in writing. - As a Member of the European Parliament from Estonia I am glad to inform you that one fifth of the Members of the Estonian Parliament took part in election observation missions in Georgia."
"According to the international election observation mission, the elections held on January 5 were 'in essence consistent with most international standards for democratic elections, but significant challenges were revealed which need to be addressed urgently'."
"Although some irregularities were discovered and pointed out, it is utterly irresponsible to give way to more friction in Georgia."
"Especially by endangering the legitimacy of the elections in the eyes of the Georgian people by creating a doubt that in principle the elections were not held free and fair."
"It is my belief that the politicians in the neighbouring countries and even in the EU, who have chosen to remain sceptical and extremely vocal as well, have not acted in the best interest of further sustainable development and consolidation of democracy in Georgia, the importance of which this report clearly stresses."

"The role of women in industry (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, on the role of women in industry."
"This report is very important and is likely to receive a great deal of media attention."
"rapporteur. - (PT) I must start by thanking the members and staff of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their support and valuable contributions, particularly through their proposals on this report which enabled its unanimous approval."
"This work took several months and included a public hearing with valuable contributions being made by members of both parliamentary committees and external guests, particularly social organisations."
"This report seeks to highlight the role of women in industry."
"On average, over 14% of women in employment in the European Union work in industry."
"In some countries this percentage exceeds 25%, such as in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic, and in others it is around 20%, such as in Portugal, Greece and Hungary."
"We know that in some industrial sectors women represent the majority of workers, such as in textiles, garments and footwear, areas of the food industry, cork, cabling, and electrical and electronic equipment, whereas their participation in cutting-edge technology sectors is limited."
"This means that we need different approaches, but with one common goal of promoting the women working in these sectors, guaranteeing non-discriminatory practices in access to employment and contracting, wage equality, creation of career opportunities, vocational training, good working conditions and better pay, and respecting maternity and paternity as fundamental social values."
"The need to guarantee employment with rights for women working in industry and to keep facilitating their access to jobs in this important sector of production also requires more attention to be paid to the situation in various industries in the European Union, to the challenges facing them and to the appropriate responses which must be found, including in international trade and in monitoring the situation of imports of sensitive products such as those in the textile sector."
"Particular attention must be paid to the restructuring and relocation of multinationals which significantly affect the employment of women and increase their unemployment, particularly in regions where there is no alternative employment."
"The fight against the wage discrimination which still exists and which affects female workers, in particular indirect discrimination, requires us to look into establishing a methodology for analysing exactly what jobs entail, which will guarantee the right to equal pay for women and men, give proper recognition to individuals and occupations and, at the same time, establish work as a structural factor, with a view to increasing the productivity, competitiveness and quality of undertakings and improving the lives of workers, both women and men."
"We must therefore encourage initiatives that contribute to the development in companies of positive measures and human resources policies promoting gender equality."
"We must also encourage information and training measures making it possible to promote, transfer and incorporate successful practices."
"I would highlight in this respect certain projects developed with the support of the EQUAL programme which I have had the opportunity to experience in Portugal."
"This programme deserves the European Commission's full attention to ensure its continuation and expansion."
"As underlined in the report, negotiations and collective bargaining are vitally important in the fight to abolish discrimination against women, in particular with regard to access to employment, wages, occupational health and safety conditions, career progression, and vocational training."
"However, the Member States and the Commission have a particular responsibility and an important role to play in promoting equality and fighting all kinds of discrimination, in guaranteeing employment with rights and in combating the precariousness of work which particularly affects women."
"We therefore call on them to act, whether by defining high standards for health protection at work that take account of the gender dimension, notably maternity protection, or through working time and organisation that respect family life, or by creating effective inspection mechanisms ensuring respect for employment rights and trade union freedom, or by guaranteeing comprehensive access to good public social security and affordable social services, in particular crèches, nurseries and support for elderly people."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission warmly welcomes the motion for a resolution on the role of women in industry."
"I congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Figueiredo, on addressing this issue of the situation and role of women in industry, which is complex."
"One of the several reasons is that, as shown in the report, the gender equality challenges in industry are even more acute than in other sectors."
"In industry, the problems of working conditions, the pay gap and the reconciliation of work and private life tend to be even more pronounced."
"It is also a complex issue because it goes beyond equality policy to relate to the general situation in industry in Europe and the way Community policies can support industry and workers - both men and women - in the difficult context of globalisation."
"As you know, the adoption of the Roadmap for Gender Equality in 2006 underlined the Union's full commitment to do its utmost to make progress towards a situation of real equality between men and women."
"The six priorities of the roadmap are linked to improving the situation of women on the labour market."
"The first is economic independence for women and men, the second is reconciliation of private and professional life, the third is equal representation in decision-making and the fourth is the elimination of stereotypes."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that Parliament's motion for a resolution highlights precisely these areas."
"Whilst the progress made in the area of gender equality is unquestionable, major challenges remain."
"The Commission shares the rapporteur's view that we must continue our efforts and consolidate what has been achieved."
"As far as women's participation in industry is concerned, two issues should be tackled."
"Firstly, there are still very few women in industry compared to the services sector."
"Secondly, those women who work in industry tend to be in typically female sectors which are very labour-intensive and characterised by poor working conditions and low wages."
"The Commission is conducting various policies to meet these challenges."
"Combating stereotypes in education will, in the long term, lead to there being more highly skilled women in technical and scientific occupations and will also help to meet the needs of certain industrial sectors for manpower or womanpower."
"It is also important to support the careers of female engineers via networking, mentoring and measures to balance work and private life."
"In order to diversify women's employment in industry, it is vital to provide every opportunity for training and retraining."
"The European Social Fund provides essential support in this area."
"It is also vital to improve the current situation of women working in industry."
"For example, there is still an unjustifiably large gap between women and men."
"In industry, this gap is as much as 30%."
"For this reason, in July 2007 the Commission adopted a communication on tackling the pay gap between women and men."
"The communication examined all the resources that must be mobilised to achieve this aim."
"The involvement of enterprises is an important way of making progress in the areas of equality between men and women at work, the gender pay gap, training, work-life balance and career development."
"In addition to the laws on equal treatment, which all enterprises must obey, it is important to encourage them to adopt voluntary measures to promote equality, in particular in the context of corporate social responsibility."
"Finally, the Commission will shortly relaunch an awareness-raising campaign for enterprises about gender stereotypes."
"The report on women in industry underlines the vital role of work-life balance in order to achieve real gender equality and the Commission shares this analysis."
"This point was mentioned during the adoption by Parliament of the Kauppi report in September 2007."
"The Commission will report in 2008 on progress towards the Barcelona objectives in the area of childcare."
"The second phase of the consultation of social partners on work-life balance concluded in July."
"The Commission takes the view that this issue should be tackled using a combination of different instruments, including the amendment of current Community legislation in order to better take account of new challenges."
"As I stressed, the issue of women in industry also reflects the general situation of industry in Europe."
"The Commission will continue to pursue all the necessary policies to face up to globalisation, ensure a future for industry in the Member States and help workers of both sexes when the companies for which they work are restructured."
"European laws on employee information and consultation, social dialogue and the European Social Fund are all instruments designed to achieve this."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, launched in 2007, will provide assistance of up to EUR 500 million per year and its rules provide specifically for gender equality to be taken into account."
"The Commission is, therefore, responding to all the challenges identified by the report on the role of women in industry by taking measures of various kinds: improving equality, working conditions and the role of women in industry, combating stereotypes, creating better conditions for reconciling work and family life and providing general support for companies and workers in industrial sectors in difficulty."
"I should like to make a personal statement: I sincerely support this way of tackling the difficulties in this specific area."
"Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - Mr President, I warmly welcome this report, which I fully support."
"The British Conservatives support it, as does the PPE-DE Group."
"If Europe is to play a leading part in a very competitive, a fiercely competitive, global world, we need all the resources available at the highest possible level."
"Whilst I disagree that there should be quotas saying how many ladies there should be at various levels in companies - and I particularly disagree with any compulsion in that regard - what I do want to see is as many ladies as possible rise to the highest possible levels based on their ability."
"It often depends on what we define as 'industry', and industry is changing; everything is much more flexible nowadays, and I am delighted that ladies are playing their role in industry in their various positions."
"I do not agree that there needs to be any handicap or under-representation in the new technologies, because ladies have the brains, the intelligence and the know-how to more than make their worth felt."
"Firstly, I would endorse the view that we should always go for equal pay wherever possible."
"Regarding this report, I was extremely pleased that the rapporteur embraced the views of people from the various groups and that we reached unanimity."
"I wanted to see better facilities for pensions for ladies - for portability within pensions from one employer to another to make sure they get higher pensions as they get through their working lives, and more flexibility in terms of facilities so that ladies can balance their family lives with their working lives."
"As I say, I fully support this report."
"It is a step forward."
"We need ladies at all levels and I wish them well."
"I welcome in particular our new Commissioner, who is very capable indeed."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SK) I would like to say thank you for the work that has been done on this report by Mrs Figueiredo."
"The report to some extent lists the problems facing women employed in various sectors of industry."
"Some of the problems seem to be perennial problems, such as the gender pay gap, the inadequate representation of women on company boards of directors or the inadequate reconciliation of work and family life."
"The report also brings up issues that are less frequently discussed, such as the insufficient attention given to specific requirements for the protection of women in the work place or the social problems that arise as a result of transfers of production to areas with lower production costs."
"Some of the proposals in the report interfere with the principle of subsidiarity or lay down requirements that encroach on the competence of the social partners and the processes of collective bargaining."
"The PPE-DE Group will not support these proposals."
"Despite the fact that the report is more or less a summary of problems that are reasonably well known, it points at the fact that changes in these areas are slow, as can be seen, for example, in the development of differences between the salaries of men and women."
"The research clearly indicates that the turning point comes when children arrive: from that point the careers of men and women take different directions."
"Most difficult to break are the critical stereotypes, and this is the case even when we do not identify with them verbally any more."
"The report also highlights the issue of the transferability and flexibility of pension rights, which is becoming more and more sensitive with the progressive unification of the labour market, and with the requirement for higher mobility of the workforce."
"This, I think, is an issue that should be given appropriate attention."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I would first also like to thank the rapporteur for her help and cooperation."
"We made the most of our opportunities to work together across political boundaries and I would like to express my warmest thanks for this."
"I would begin by pointing out that we have already presented a large number of reports on this subject."
"The demand for equal pay for equal work goes back more than 30 years and we have still not been able to make it a reality."
"Of course we are taking small steps forward and we are producing paper after paper, but the situation of women in industry still remains a long way behind what we have been working towards all this time."
"In the manufacturing industry, for example, 85% of the employees are women, and in the ICT sector the figure is 15%, and indeed women are very poorly represented in the high-technology industries."
"This does not imply that women are less educated, it only means - and this applies especially to rural areas - that there are simply no opportunities to take up other jobs."
"Women continue to work in the low-wage sector and even here there is differentiation between male and female workers."
"There is still inequality and discrimination, and not just in respect of wage levels but working conditions too."
"We are therefore also appealing to the trade unions to do more to prevent this type of wage discrimination when taking part in pay negotiations."
"Support for professional and vocational training programmes is still lacking or is woefully inadequate."
"Education and training is needed in order to provide female employees with career prospects, even in low-skill sectors."
"We also call on companies to apply family and women-friendly policies in their workforce management plans, which will work to everyone's advantage: when everyone has that feel-good feeling, business runs better and this also benefits the women who work in it."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and levels of cooperation, and, in particular, for highlighting the way men and women are treated differently, despite the fact that we hardly ever get a sympathetic hearing."
"The Member of the Commission is, I am sure, personally committed to the issue, but when I was listening to your official reply in which you said that the Roadmap had been adopted, and that there was commitment to it, afterwards one might naturally have expected to hear an account of what had actually happened."
"Unfortunately, we have to say that hardly anything has happened in matters of equality during this Commission's term."
"That is regrettable."
"It is perhaps not the sort of important issue the Commissioners or others could score points on; nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to encourage us all to do more because we are responsible for the status of women in Europe."
"I will give you one example."
"In Finland women got the right to vote when it was part of a very conservative Russia in 1905."
"That was amazing."
"Looking ahead now, I do not think it will be possible, now we are part of Europe, for women in the different Member States to earn the same pay and receive the same kind of treatment in the EU, even if the EU speaks of human rights and is progressive."
"I think the EU could take a look at the decisions that were taken in tsarist times and make bold decisions on equality of pay and equality in the workplace."
"The tsar had the courage to give women the vote, but the EU does not have the courage to do anything to bring about equality of pay in the Member States of the EU."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I have clear memories of the 1950s in Poland. We used to see many huge billboards with pictures of smiling girls driving tractors."
"These were girls from the so-called Polish Service organisation. We saw them shouldering pickaxes and spades and marching joyfully off to work."
"We now see women working in design offices, on computers, or on the new production lines for electronic equipment, mobile telephones and televisions. We also see the tired faces of women hurrying home after many hours of hard work to undertake other daily tasks."
"Those were the images that came to my mind as I read Mrs Figueiredo's report on the role of women in industry."
"For many years now, efforts have been made to protect women, reduce their workload and treat them in the same way as men are treated."
"Unfortunately, differences persist to this day."
"The list of expectations is very appropriate, though perhaps not complete."
"Differences still persist in the way men and women are treated at work, both regarding pay and career development as well as assessment of their work and qualifications."
"The most unfortunate thing of all is that it has not proved possible to create the conditions for women's hopes and aspirations to be realised, so that they can be sure of job stability and opportunities for career development."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALDE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the role of women in industry is clearly conditioned - this has already been stated, and I wish to remind you of it - as in many other cases, by a number of stereotypes, some of which are clearly pernicious."
"We need to make headway on overcoming such stereotypes and that is precisely why I feel the Figueiredo report is a fundamental and important concept and, similarly, why it enjoys the support of our group."
"There is much evidence to justify this report and the submission of a number of proposals, which we trust will be welcomed not only by the Community institutions, but by business itself, which, after all, has to adopt them and implement them."
"One such piece of evidence is the fact that the European Union average in terms of women employed in industry is a mere 14%."
"It must nevertheless also be borne in mind that, of this percentage, 21% accounts for part-time employees; indeed, women account for 65% of part-time employees in the industrial sector."
"I feel that this is one of the key aspects, and by no means a minor issue in this debate."
"The second piece of evidence is the fact that it is precisely women with precarious employment conditions, women working part-time, carrying out temporary employment in atypical conditions, that are most frequently affected by wage discrimination or, when they wish to take maternity leave, have fewer possibilities in terms of basic, permanent and vocational training."
"Thus the proposals in this report include the proposal for urgent measures to be adopted for full and effective application of Directive 75/117 EEC on the principle of equal pay for men and women as a means of opposing wage discrimination. We have been calling for this for some time now, and hope to see it implemented as soon as possible."
"We want the Member States and the Commission to provide more and better tax breaks for companies in terms of compliance with codes of conduct and corporate social responsibility criteria in their day-to-day business. We want to see better working conditions, with particular emphasis on working hours, and maternity and paternity leave - here responsibility is shared on both sides by the couple or the family - thereby guaranteeing working men and women the opportunity to take up their posts again after such leave."
"Attention must also be paid to reconciling work and family life. Thus, for all this to be transformed into reality, the report calls for these rights to be implemented in legislation across the European Union."
"Finally, I beg to differ with Mr Dover on the subject of quotas."
"For some of us, female and male, these constitute a necessary instrument, and thus we feel the point must be made that the European Union ought to follow the Norwegian example of applying measures to increase the numbers of female board members of public utilities to at least 40%, and use regulations to impose a 40% quota of female representation on boards of private companies."
"It is obvious that this is not the solution, but I must insist that this is a path and a means that is proving useful in other aspects, which we would like to see copied within the European Union."
", on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Mr Chairman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my committee colleague Ilda Figueiredo has, as always, done an excellent job."
"She has documented facts that I myself consider fundamental, in particular the fact that working women account for the dominant share of employment in the processing industry, where the majority of jobs require fewer qualifications, are manual and are badly paid."
"The stereotype that it is a woman's lot to do auxiliary work is well illustrated here."
"I had the opportunity to visit several production plants in the food industry in different countries."
"These plants are very similar, despite their geographical diversity."
"The men hold the managerial jobs and the unskilled work on the production line is done by women."
"They earn little, they work mechanically in a stupefying rhythm, without any motivation for professional growth, and they work under unfavourable conditions."
"This is, of course, wrong."
"A great deal of work is still needed to put an end to gender inequality."
"We must realise that this area is still not sufficiently covered by statistics and that the gender issue is a relatively new statistical phenomenon."
"In the real world, the disadvantages experienced by women in industry, compared with men, are even more noticeable."
"However, it is necessary to focus on the issues that the rapporteur rightly designated as priorities: the disadvantages facing women in terms of pay and the fact that there are few women in technical fields that are, in comparison to the significant processing industry, technologically more demanding and better paid."
"Women need to be able to gain access to higher education; professional qualifications are of relevance here."
"They should also be given the opportunity to return from maternity leave to the labour market, but also to further studies."
"This right, of course, applies to men who look after children too."
"Some regions of the European Union, particularly in the East, are undergoing changes in the structure of their industries."
"These changes are enforcing greater workforce mobility and retraining."
"I know about these trends from my own experience, because I come from the industrial part of the Czech Republic, which has been industrialised, and I am aware of their impact, especially on working women."
"Another related problem is the transfer of factories to countries outside the European Union, where the workforce is cheaper."
"Women's employment is also threatened by the influx of cheap goods from Asia, but also from other countries that produce high volumes of consumer goods for foreign markets, rather than supplying their own market, which does not have the purchasing power."
"All these factors have a noticeable influence on the employment of women in industry and their negative consequences should be gradually mitigated."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the statistics tell us that across the European Union there are more men than women in employment in every age group. This can be due to personal choice or to tradition, but is often the result of discrimination in the workplace."
"In addition, on average women earn less than men in every Member State of the European Union. It is therefore important to use legislative and regulatory means to remind entrepreneurs and employers of their duty to comply fully with the principle of equal treatment, and not just as regards pay."
"The issue of the unequal participation of women in industry should be approached rationally, because the branches of industry defined as 'female' may involve less physical and mental effort. Women could be advised to consider them but that need not imply lower pay."
"It is difficult to imagine more men than women being employed in the embroidery industry or more women than men being employed in the smelting industry."
"Furthermore, the embroidery industry I referred to as an example may be better paid because of the artistic element involved than the food industry, for instance."
"It is important to ensure that men and women receive equal pay across the different areas, and to eliminate exploitation and other unfair practices and conditions from the workplace."
"Opportunities for part-time work should be promoted, especially for women, alongside different types of flexibility facilitating retraining and learning."
"In my speeches and in the amendments I have tabled I have repeatedly proposed not only that a return to one's job be guaranteed after maternity or parental leave, but also that such maternity or parental leave be classed as time at work, and the relevant monetary payment made in due course. This would pre-empt low retirement pensions and also help to reduce unemployment."
"Above all, it would ensure the proper upbringing and development of children, who are the future of every family and every nation and the future of the European Union."
"(FR) Mr President, on reading this report one might be tempted to say 'All quiet on the western front': nothing new, in other words."
"The panorama is always the same: the persistence of stereotypes in the choice of educational and professional guidelines, over-representation of women in certain sectors such as the textile industry, the pay gap, working conditions and career prospects."
"The recommendations never change, however: promoting equality between men and women in professional spheres in terms of pay, their presence on company boards, or developing structures for child care and employment flexibility."
"This is fine, but what then?"
"What exactly is this umpteenth report on women's rights going to change, within or outside the industrial sector?"
"Despite coercive policies based on 'positive action' - a misleading formulation, since what it really means is compulsory quotas - gender mindsets have great difficulty moving forward."
"It is not by imposing structures that may occasionally be unnatural, in the name of the principles of equality and non-discrimination, that women will more naturally take up their role within companies, whatever they may be."
"Women do not have such a severe handicap that they must be systematically imposed to be accepted."
"Incentive measures must not be coercion measures."
"Moreover, when applying the Charter of Fundamental Rights we should not forget that we must also leave all entrepreneurs free to hire whomever they choose, as long as all employees are treated in the same manner, regardless of their sex."
"(SK) A higher concentration of textile and clothing industries on which female employment depends is typical for some European regions, and the Prešov region in north-east Slovakia is among them."
"If we want to preserve work opportunities for women specifically in these disadvantaged regions, where the textile and clothing industries have their own tradition, we must support these industries as a productive industrial sector through suitable measures: creating new programmes focusing, for example, on the presentation and advertising of new products at specialist and international fairs."
"The wider application of the Strategic Research Agenda of the European Technological Platform and the need to introduce innovative technology and new business models are, in my opinion, a contribution to the future of the textile and clothing industries."
"We all know that despite an increase in the number of females studying technical and scientific subjects, the obstacles they encounter in the workplace result in women abandoning scientific careers in industry."
"Given the importance of maintaining a certain standard in education and knowledge, scientific work must be continuous."
"In some scientific institutions no provision is made for women to work for part of their working time at home unless they absolutely have to be in the workplace."
"The mentality surrounding overtime may be one of the specific barriers."
"Those are the reasons why we are registering below average representation of women in high-tech sectors."
"Primary responsibility rests with the Member States."
"We would therefore ask the relevant national institutions to prepare and introduce policies aimed at reconciling work and private life, to facilitate greater flexibility in working time and to improve the general approach to childcare services."
"It is also important to encourage employers - especially of small and medium-sized companies - to make sure that they put these policies and procedures into practice , through effective technical measures and if possible financial support too."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ilda Figueiredo, for her work and our shadow rapporteur, Edit Bauer, through whom we were able to enrich the report by way of our opinions."
"I also value highly the opinion of my colleague Mr Dover from the ITRE Committee."
"Mr Chairman, in conclusion I would like to bring up one technical issue."
"It is very cold in this House during the debates, including today's debate."
"The coldness of this Chamber does not create a good working environment for our work as Members and has serious consequences for our health."
"I would like to ask you to see to it that the conditions are improved."
"(HU) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our policies for industrial development and the manufacturing sectors can help the European economy become a leader in competitiveness, knowledge and sustainability, in line with the Lisbon objectives."
"Lisbon stands for growth in employment rates, significant increase in the employment of women, demand for the provision of proper conditions for the employment of female employees, and wide-ranging support for equal opportunities - over and above the positive role of women in the economy."
"Equal opportunities must be underpinned in every area of industry: in employment, pay, promotion, the provision of vocational education and training, the availability and monitoring of different forms of flexible work, and the reconciliation of work and private life."
"Overall, decent working conditions must be provided for women in industry and proper representation in the organisations whose job it is to safeguard their interests."
"These areas do not constitute an exception from the requirements of ensuring gender equality and the principles and practice of gender mainstreaming must be applied consistently here too."
"It is important that we have the right information about actual work relations in the many, essentially different sectors of industry and the differences between the sectors themselves."
"A wide range of statistical information is required for shaping and drafting strategies and concrete proposals."
"Innumerable international management research projects have shown that the special leadership qualities of women can make a big contribution to business success."
"Europe must not lose this opportunity. Thank you."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteurs and those who have been working on this report on the excellent mapping of the current statistics and the current situation in Europe when it comes to women in industry."
"Still, one cannot avoid being disappointed, because documents like this have been produced since the 1950s and we still have very little change. This applies to women in industry, the health situation and health care for women, and to career opportunities, learning opportunities and opportunities to improve their skills, not to mention the situation of the work and family combination."
"I would like, therefore, to spend half of my speaking time on questions to the Commission."
"Firstly, it is appalling that, after decades, we still have such a bad statistics situation."
"This is something where the Commission can really ask for an improvement when it comes to European statistics."
"I see that responsibility for this lies mainly with the Commission."
"When I was a university teacher 25 years ago, I taught my students about the rules on equal pay deriving from Brussels and from the European Member States at the time."
"The cases from the Court (Danfoss I and II) happened more than 25 years ago."
"Is it not time for a new regulation with more teeth?"
"This is also the responsibility of the Commission."
"I would also like a mid-term health check when it comes to the roadmap for gender equality, which contains a lot of nice words, but no regulation so far on the horizon."
"Fourthly, the Spring Summit will work with the Lisbon resolution."
"These issues should be mentioned in March."
"And fifthly, when the Commission - and Parliament - arrange seminars with high-level groups, we should apply the same rules as Norway for industrial boards, i.e. the 40:60 percentage."
"(PL) Mr President, the role of women in the economy is going to grow if only because of demographic problems."
"It is therefore worth giving careful consideration to this issue."
"As a Pole, a woman, and a physicist by training, I can state that in my country the average level of education of women is higher than that of men."
"Women are also more involved in business in the SME sector."
"I have not observed any gender-based discrimination in the scientific world."
"Nonetheless, women earn between 15% and 20% less than men do and women's involvement at managerial level in companies is significantly lower than that of men."
"In addition, more women than men are in insecure employment."
"The result, therefore, is that although training and different ways of improving one's qualifications are important, they are not enough to reduce discrimination."
"Female poverty is due not only to low pay, but also to the way pension schemes are devised."
"Following the reform of the Polish pension scheme, a provision was introduced whereby pension contributions for persons taking maternity leave and parental leave were financed from the State budget."
"This was a great help to women, as pension systems tend to penalise them heavily for motherhood."
"The report has noted the need to deal with the matter."
"I also attach great importance to considering issues relating to health and safety from a gender-specific point of view, notably as regards burdening women with tasks causing musculoskeletal disorders."
"These issues have also been covered in the report."
"Mr President, in 1996 an underwear company closed its factory in my constituency."
"It left 160 unemployed - almost all women - of middle age, with little or no skills outside the factory."
"Only 100 of these women managed ever to work again."
"The women who found work needed, after 30 years of service in this plant, to begin again at minimum wage, as they had not been given any continuous training and their previous experience went unrecognised."
"This factory moved to a less expensive area of the EU and has since moved to Asia."
"Companies will continue to relocate for cheaper labour forces, and we need to protect women - particularly in areas like textiles - by offering the opportunity to upskill and by giving continuous education."
"I also want to talk briefly about apprenticeships: in Ireland only 5% of women are in apprenticeships."
"It is a double problem."
"Are they encouraged to become plumbers and carpenters?"
"Is there not also the problem that, in most areas, apprenticeships have now disappeared?"
"Apprenticeships themselves were a very good way to pass on information and skills and be recognised for them, and with the loss of apprenticeships we are denying many people - both men and women - the ability to pass on skills and be recognised."
"(SK) I would like to stress three key points in relation to this issue."
"Employers must learn not to put women in unsuitable jobs or jobs where their abilities are not sufficiently valued."
"The European Union institutions must keep an eye on those bodies that are receiving their help to make sure they respect the acquis communautaire."
"Even though different opinions exist, society should respect the fact that men and women are different, but at the same time complement each other."
"It is the basic principle of life and it should also be the basic principle of the policy on equal opportunities for women and men."
"Diversity and compatibility in the job market and in society are fundamental."
"The report by Mrs Figueiredo outlines our responsibility in implementing the Lisbon Strategy, in Europe's 'demographic winter'."
"The report correctly underlines the health risks and various types of occupational diseases that can be different in men and women."
"I fully support the rapporteur in her request for a full analysis of the existing situations and their consequences."
"Such analysis must also include the specific impact on motherhood."
"Nothing can justify, for the sake of future careers, future mothers being exposed to health risks that can have a negative influence on motherhood."
"Equally, it is the responsibility of the industrial sector not to punish women if they want to have children, and the sector should make it possible for them to be able to return to their original position after maternity leave."
"(PT) Mr President, the Beijing Platform for Action asserts that, without the active participation of women and the incorporation of women's perspective at all levels of decision-making, the goals of equality, development and peace cannot be achieved."
"Furthermore, to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, the participation of women in the labour market needs to be increased."
"As women represent 59% of graduates, it is difficult to understand why the majority of new jobs for women are part-time, sometimes insecure and precarious, poorly paid and with few prospects of career progression."
"This report by Mrs Figueiredo, whom I congratulate, contains two proposals that I must highlight: the first is the promotion of female entrepreneurship."
"Given that 61% of women take account of family circumstances when considering setting up a business, compared with only 49% of men, measures are needed to help reconcile professional with family and private life."
"The other proposal concerns long working hours."
"It is essential for the Commission to carry out a study into the negative consequences of long working hours, namely the family, personal and social consequences, such as children being left alone for many hours, which often leads to failure at school and crime."
"The Member States should also be urged to improve the monitoring of undertakings that force their employees to work beyond the statutory working hours and to impose harsher penalties."
"(BG) Madam Commissioner, Mr. President, colleagues, equal participation of women and men on the labour market is a precondition for sustainable economic growth and harmonious social development."
"Over the past decades Europe has made considerable progress in promoting gender equality."
"The report on the role of women in industry summarizes some of these achievements, while insisting for a stricter application of the principle of equality."
"It can regrettably be noted, however, that despite the existing relevant legal framework, a number of EU directives and resolutions remain without proper implementation."
"The role of women in industry ought to be based on the principles of equal pay and equal involvement in decision-making."
"The labour market situation in Member States shows that women are inconsistently represented in the various sectors."
"They account for a large percentage of those employed in the service sectors and are underrepresented in the high-tech area, for example."
"Promoting decent jobs is an integral part of the European Union values and Member States need to take effective measures to ensure that standards are met and decent jobs are guaranteed in the various industry sectors."
"I believe that we are all faced with the serious challenge of applying a set of policies with a focus of combining work, personal and family life."
"European citizens, both women and men, deserve to enjoy equal opportunities and should be equal not just on paper but in real terms. Thank you."
"- (DA) Mr President, I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for a very relevant report, which focuses on the growing gender inequality in the labour market at a time when we are all promising each other to combat wage discrimination and work towards genuine equality."
"Women currently hold the lowest-paid unskilled jobs in industry, and there is a risk that their conditions will deteriorate further if we do not immediately introduce targeted in-service training."
"We need to make it compulsory to compile gender-differentiated statistics on both wage levels and the gender balance in the individual sectors."
"It is totally unacceptable that we still have such a poor level of knowledge in these areas."
"How can we change things if we do not have a clear overview of what the status quo actually is?"
"We also need to develop an industrial policy that takes account of the gender dimension and the specific challenges women face in terms of pay, childbirth, job insecurity and monotonous, repetitive work."
"This should be done in cooperation with the social partners, and the latter must also ensure that women are sufficiently represented in their organisations."
"Mr President, the proposal before us deals with a very important issue, one that continues to spark debate globally."
"The role of women in industry affects all facets of society and has wide-ranging implications for employment and welfare policy, family and child policy, not to mention economic policy."
"Yes, equality legislation ensures women get maternity leave, but all the evidence shows that they expose themselves to promotional and financial discrimination, albeit subtly (to comply with the law) but nonetheless pervasively in an inflexible business culture."
"There was an outcry in Ireland in recent weeks when a media accountant made this very point and he was roundly handbagged."
"There is no point denying the blindly obvious."
"Perhaps this report before us should be subtitled, 'Motherhood and misogyny', as an editorial in the Sunday Tribune at home screamed last week."
"We in the European Parliament must endorse the proposal before us - with which I largely agree - because, on the one hand, industry needs women at all levels and, on the other hand, society needs children."
"We all - including employers and industrialists - must respect maternity and paternity leave as fundamental social values."
"While I still baulk at compulsory quotas for women's participation, albeit in politics or business, my faith in a meritocracy is being sorely tested the older and, hopefully, the wiser I get."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"There might be one or two paragraphs that I have to think about, but I will be supporting her report, and I think it behoves all of us in the House to support a very good report on which an awful lot of work has been done."
"(ES) Mr President, I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur for her work and her open disposition, which has allowed us all to transform the general duty of companies in terms of respect for the principle of equality between working women and men into specific measures."
"Her report includes measures to guarantee equal opportunities in terms of access to employment, training and professional promotion; measures to respect women's and men's employment rights, including - and this must be emphasised - protection against sexual harassment; and measures to enhance the reconciliation of personal and family life and employment relations."
"Perhaps, however, the most novel contributions have been, firstly, power-sharing measures: this could, for example, produce a balanced number of women and men on company boards and in all decision-making posts in line with the new law introduced in my country, Spain."
"Secondly, there is the recommendation that each company implement its own negotiated equality plan."
"This makes it a key report for a strategic sector for the European Union."
"(FR) Mr President, I welcome the fact that Parliament has taken the initiative of producing this report since, if the role of women in industry is utterly crucial, their professional situation overall remains much more precarious than that of men."
"Thus the report points to a considerable number of discriminatory situations involving women that must be tackled immediately, especially their confinement to certain sectors and certain types of jobs with low pay and limited career prospects, their over-representation among atypical employees, particularly those subjected to part-time employment, or the difficulties they encounter in rejoining the labour market after maternity leave."
"I feel that one of the courses of action mentioned to rectify this circumstance, the idea of a reward for companies encouraging reconciliation between professional life and family life, is quite interesting, and indeed the improvement of women's career prospects ought to be encouraged by enhancing life-long learning."
"I must, however, voice certain regrets as to the format of the report."
"I feel that the text is too long and not properly structured, and this impairs its readability and effectiveness."
"(RO) The report may create the impression that we are talking about the absence of women in industry."
"This is indeed one of its topics."
"However, what the report emphasises is the presence of women in industry: women have low-paid jobs in low-paid industry branches, they are in the majority where there are no trade unions, and consequently no guarantees under collective agreements; women work in vulnerable industry branches, and they are the first to be laid off in the event of mass redundancy."
"Women are present at the workplace, but they are nowhere to be seen in management."
"They only get to do the work; they don't get to decide."
"This report talks about what is missing, but it also talks about the things that women have."
"Women have an education, but hold no qualifications; they suffer from occupational diseases which are not recognised as such; they are willing to learn after they've turned forty, but they have no opportunity to do so."
"They are mothers, but there are no nurseries available."
"Men become parents and have no nurseries either, but they have their wives."
"What is to be done?"
"Existing regulations, our reports, the Commission's roadmap on gender mainstreaming, all these show that we know what should be done."
"What we and the Commission should remember, and most importantly what we should remind Member States of, is that citizens, especially women, do not judge our efficiency by the number of decisions we pass, but by our ability and will to enforce them."
"And the latter seem to be lacking."
"(PL) Madam President, only between 14% and 25% of working women in the European Union are employed in industry."
"In addition, their participation in different sectors of industry is uneven, due to the stereotypes affecting educational and professional choices."
"Women are employed mainly in the textile, clothing, footwear, food and food processing sectors, where pay is generally low. Women are significantly under-represented in the more highly-paid advanced technology sectors."
"The Member States should develop programmes aimed at educating women and fostering their entrepreneurial spirit."
"They should also offer financial support for such programmes. In addition, incentives should be provided for women working in industry to improve their qualifications on a regular basis."
"Every Member State has a duty to comply with the principle of equal pay, to provide dignified working conditions and the opportunity to develop a professional career, while at the same time respecting social values such as motherhood and fatherhood."
"Compliance with social standards such as the right to safety, social protection and freedom of association will help to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women in the workplace."
"Finally, I should like to congratulate Mrs Figueiredo on a very well-prepared report."
"(SL) What we are saying about women in industry could equally be said of women in business and health care."
"By nature men and women have different physical abilities and therefore some work is more suited to women and some more suited to men."
"However, in cases where the quality of work and effectiveness are not dependent on physical strength, it is not permissible for women to be paid less than their male colleagues."
"Moreover, it is precisely female occupations that are automatically less well paid as it is, even though they are by no means easy and require a great deal of effort."
"We have heard our fellow Member who said that we adopted similar reports on the inequalities of women 30 years ago."
"Why has nothing changed?"
"Or why is change very slow?"
"Or are businesses guilty of this?"
"I believe that we must clearly identify the guilty parties and make a responsible and more decisive effort to ensure that the situation in this area finally takes a more positive direction for women."
"(RO) When talking about women in industry, we should also be talking about education, research, and entrepreneurship."
"In the Committee on Women's Rights we've had a presentation from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy concerning the role of women in industry."
"15% of people with higher education are women."
"In 2006, women made up 33% of the total number of European researchers and only 18% of researchers operating in the private sector."
"However, it should be emphasised that only 28% of women researchers have children."
"Wages are higher in industry, particularly in the oil and chemicals industries, transport, electricity, and the automotive industry."
"However, throughout Europe there is a gender gap as far as payment is concerned (roughly 20% in corporate management and 19% in engineering/science)."
"34% of women working in industry have children and we should stress that only 20% of industrial entrepreneurs are women."
"Therefore, we should concern ourselves more with women's education and training and in particular with child-care facilities."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I wish to thank Members of for a very interesting discussion, and will take this opportunity to answer some of their questions."
"In reply to Ms Figueiredo, it is true that the Equal programme finishes in 2008, but the European Social Fund Regulation for 2007-2013 incorporates gender equality as a horizontal priority."
"In reply to Ms Bauer, we had the first reading of the important legislation issue you mentioned - the transferability of pension rights - in June 2007, and the EPSCO Council dealt with it in December 2007."
"We hope to make quick progress during 2008."
"In reply to Ms Jäätteenmäki - I realise that she is not in the Chamber, but her question was very important, so I would like to answer it - the Commission adopted, in July 2007, the communication on 'Tackling the pay gap between men and women'."
"In that communication, the Commission announced that in 2008 it would examine the relevance of current legislation from the point of view of the relevance of legal instruments with regard to the causes of the pay gap and, where necessary, propose amendments to the Community legal framework. Following this examination the Commission could propose any necessary changes to the current legal framework."
"In reply to Ms Romeva i Rueda, anti-discrimination and gender equality legislation does not preclude Member States from developing and implementing positive actions."
"The Commission supports there being a higher proportion of women in decision-making."
"We will create a network of women in decision-making posts, probably during 2008."
"In reply to Ms Flasarová, we cannot prevent companies from delocalising, but we have instruments to tackle that issue."
"In 2007, the European Globalisation Fund was quite promptly set up for this purpose."
"In reply to Ms Ek, concerning statistics, the Commission continues to cooperate with Eurostat to develop specific statistics on equality."
"The Dublin Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions takes into account gender equality in its regular reports."
"In 2009, there will be a regular publication on the research statistics on women."
"In reply to Mrs Doyle, concerning maternity leave, the Commission is to prepare an impact evaluation on possible legislative measures introducing new forms of leave - adoption leave, and leave to care for family members other than children."
"rapporteur. - (PT) Madam President, I firstly want to thank my fellow Members and also the Commissioner for their words today and for their contributions which have enabled this debate to assume even greater consequence."
"However, as others have already done, I must also of course call for further practical measures to be taken."
"These proposals that we have made must be felt on the ground, in the lives of undertakings, female workers and families, because it is not acceptable, as various people have said here today, that 30 years after a directive provided for equal pay, we still have this clear disparity of 30% between the average wages of men and women working in industry."
"This figure is double the average wage difference in the European Union."
"We cannot therefore allow this situation to continue for a further 30 years and that is why I call on the Commission, and also the Member States, to take concrete measures."
"These could be legislative or they could involve better monitoring, but they must ensure increased promotion of equal rights and opportunities and increased promotion of this objective which must be put into practice through education and training."
"We must also fight stereotyping, as highlighted here today, and we must ensure that the organisation of working hours, working time and jobs better responds to women's rights, and also to the right to maternity and paternity which are recognised as fundamental social values of the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing - (HU) I welcome this important report and would stress that women in particular suffer from occupational illnesses."
"One new study mentions that in the EU 140 000 people, three and a half percent in this context, die every year as a result of occupational illness, and one of the main causes is chemicals."
"And chemicals are implicated in 86% of cancer-related occupational illnesses."
"An important point here is that women, who generally live longer than men, are, as a group, more sensitive to chemicals and more vulnerable, as chemicals gradually build up in their adipose tissue and can be transferred to their unborn children."
"So we need to have a properly thought out European strategy to minimise the occurrence of occupational illnesses and the number of deaths and give women maximum protection."
"in writing. - (FR) Although the report on the role of women in industry rightly emphasises the many difficulties facing women in the labour market and certain economic sectors, the proposals in the text raise two questions."
"Firstly, the report appears to neglect the boundaries of the legislator's action."
"Europe's legal arsenal is currently one of the world's most lavish in terms of women's rights and gender equality."
"Therefore, it is up to the elected representatives and the citizens to ensure respect for the rights of women in the European Union."
"In consequence, the usefulness of an umpteenth declaration of intent is somewhat limited."
"Secondly, the report contains one proposal that is, to say the least, curious indeed: suggesting that a quota of women on boards of private companies ought to be established by law points to a serious attack on individual liberties and does women little service."
"Treating women in a fashion that is closer to charity than equality tends to exclude them even more from certain sectors of society."
"Our fellow citizens now expect us to support them by matching our words with actions."
"in writing. - The Lisbon targets set in 2000 will certainly not be achieved by 2010 as originally intended."
"The current gender structures and attitudes play an important role in this failure."
"Europe is not adequately using the potential of the half of its population."
"Women do not have equal opportunities for achievement in the high-value-added industry."
"Moreover, women are not adequately represented in social dialogue."
"Neither employers' organisations nor the trade unions and the public sector have enough women in high-level positions."
"It is remarkable and alarming that the future of work and the future of society are decided by the half of the population which does not take equal responsibility for raising the children and maintaining the household."
"Increasingly, antisocial measures such as increasing unreported overtime and uncompensated flexibility of workers are used to increase productivity."
"The price we pay for this illusory increase is too high."
"The Member States should significantly increase the emphasis on gender equality in social dialogue."
"Simultaneously, many Member States should strengthen the role which social dialogue has in setting the policy."
"Women have the highest potential to accelerate the development of our high-tech industry."
"Europe must use it."
"Second Internet Governance Forum, held in Rio de Janeiro from 12 to 15 November 2007 (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by the Commission on the results of the Internet Governance Forum held in Rio de Janeiro last November."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the idea of an Internet Governance Forum (IGF) was born at the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis in November 2005 and defined as a non-binding forum for multi-stakeholder policy discussion."
"The Commission supports the Forum in this form."
"Two meetings have been held so far: in 2006 in Athens and 2007 in Rio."
"The Commission welcomes the forum in each form."
"The Commission also welcomes the participation of Parliament at the forum and is grateful for the excellent cooperation on both meetings."
"As in the previous year, the meeting in Rio provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges which allowed the gathering of a range of views on the relevant issues."
"Therefore, the Commission sees value in upholding the main characteristics of the forum, notably the participation of the various stakeholders and its non-binding nature."
"I would like also to thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say something more concrete on the IGF (we have adopted this abbreviation) which took place in November in Rio de Janeiro."
"Firstly I would like to thank very much Ms Trautmann, Mr Harbour, Mr Badia i Cutchet and Mr Hökmark, who represented Parliament at this meeting, for their active participation and for the continuation of their excellent cooperation."
"This allowed us - this year again - together to highlight a number of European priorities such as freedom of speech, bridging the digital divide, security and child protection on-line."
"It is important for Europe to bring such issues to the forefront of the international agenda on a constant basis."
"The Commission supports the IGF."
"This concept, elaborated during the World Summit on the Information Society, is still very valuable, and all the issues which have been mentioned are very much in favour of what we are trying to step up as actions in this particular field."
"In fact, on a broad range of internet-relevant subjects, the number of participants - around 3 100 - clearly demonstrates that there is indeed interest in having such a place for discussions."
"The fact that there is no negotiated text as an outcome of the Forum should be seen as a strength rather than as a weakness of the process."
"The Forum allows for open exchange, without the pressure of defending a particular outcome in a binding document."
"This can serve as a basis for improving understanding of each other's concerns and can pave the way for finding common solutions."
"Dynamic coalitions stemming from the Forum are, in fact, one example that the IGF can work as a platform where people who share common interests can further cooperate."
"Thus, the Rio Internet Governance Forum meeting again provided an excellent framework for enriching exchanges, which allowed a range of views on relevant issues to be gathered."
"I would also like to thank once again Members and hope we will continue our excellent cooperation, because this is one of the most promising areas for our future work."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, it is important to underline the rapid change that use of the internet and ICT has brought about, not only for individual societies, but also for the world."
"In all sectors of societies, the impact of the internet has changed patterns and opportunities."
"This is important in order to keep a perspective for the future, because the strength of the internet has been its independent nature, its opportunities and its ability to adapt to different opportunities and demands in societies, based on a number of different actors and operators."
"It is important because, when we look to the future, we must ensure that it can be used in order to bridge rifts between countries and people, and help to fight poverty and support development - it is of crucial importance for the Millennium Goals, for example."
"The emergence of new technology should also be used to ensure that it is easier for more people to use the internet, in more societies."
"We in the European Union have three important things to focus on."
"First of all, we should ensure we are committed to, and support, the IGF process and its independent and non-binding character."
"That is of deep importance, because it is a good process which is much more dynamic when it is independent and non-binding."
"Secondly, we should contribute to the preparations for the next IGF in New Delhi, and ensure that we hold discussions with parliamentarians and civil society in order to underline its independence, but also the opportunities."
"Thirdly, we should ensure that the internet is guaranteed freedom and freedom of expression."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Second Internet Governance Forum was held in Rio from 12 to 15 November last year, and was attended by 2 100 people from all five continents representing interested Internet parties from all public and private sectors."
"The forum provides a favourable context in which to seek solutions to future ICT problems."
"Through a common culture and a partnership format, it provides the decisions to be taken at future world summits on the information society, in addition to those to be taken by our own states."
"It also provides the opportunity to hold an open reflection on the complex nature of the Internet and make timely provision for its technical, ethical and legal limitations, since there are major concerns in addition to the issues close to EU hearts: reducing the digital divide, freedom of expression on the web, cultural diversity and child protection."
"I could also RFID, radio frequency identification, in short, the formation of an Internet of things, the risks of network overload by 2010-2012, digitalisation, particularly of cultural goods, the consequences arising in terms of the protection of intellectual property and, above all, improvement of access to ICT for less developed countries."
"Europe is certainly up to speed in terms of the legislative process."
"This is encouraging for us as Europeans, but we must not slacken off."
"Many of these legal or regulatory issues are likewise improved with the review of the Telecom Package."
"In this respect, I would call for a new phase of targeted political and future-oriented work, notably through the creation of a European IGF involving the national parliaments and local authorities: a European forum implemented by 2009 and perhaps a world forum in Europe thanks to Lithuania's application for 2010."
"As delegation head, I wish to thank all Members, colleagues and officials for their work and their availability."
"The resolution we will be voting on constitutes a roadmap."
"I am pleased it enjoys the support of all of the groups in Parliament."
"More parliamentary committees are welcome to lend their weight to this course of action, and I would like to thank the Commission and ask its Members to lend their support to Mrs Reding."
"Finally, I would like to ask the Council to include in its agenda relations with India and preparations for the New Delhi forum, and I would urge all Member States to participate in enhanced cooperation."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, among other items, the public service value of the internet was discussed in Rio de Janeiro on 13 November 2007."
"Nowadays, the most limited asset of European citizens is time, and it is vital for the governments of the Member States to introduce public services on the internet."
"My home country, Estonia, has done much in this field: e-voting, e-tax declarations, e-government and e-registry office are only a few examples of successful 'e'-projects that could be implemented across Europe."
"I know that it is much easier to reform a small country, where approximately 66% of the inhabitants use the internet."
"However, moving public services to the internet is worth the effort."
"One of the prerequisites for the functioning of democracy is participation."
"'E'-solutions provide the possibility of participation with minimal effort: there are no queues or officials exercising the right of discretion."
"The internet gives citizens more independence and ensures impartial administration of their affairs."
"However, it is essential to start such education from an early stage in schools."
"On the other hand, computer literacy has succeeded where Esperanto failed - it has become the most universal language - and efforts should be made not only to bridge the digital gap at regional and global levels, but bearing in mind the different age groups and social strata."
"Last but not least, the European Parliament often seems to occupy itself with producing immense volumes of paper."
"Why not upgrade our tools of democracy and implement paperless administration?"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Internet is rather like a knife."
"A knife may be used to slice our daily bread but it may also be used to kill."
"It is hard to imagine the contemporary world without the Internet, and our working lives without the Internet, but the Internet is also abused, for example by paedophiles."
"The European Union therefore acted wisely in setting child protection on the Internet as a priority for the last Internet Governance Forum held in Brazil two months ago."
"We should strive to combine openness and maximum access to the Internet with safety not only for children but anyone else who might be as risk as a result of Internet abuse."
"India is a country that has become a leader in information science, despite being relatively poor. It services global enterprises thus enabling hundreds of thousands of people to improve their standard of living."
"Two proposals appear worthy of support: the first is for an Internet Governance Forum to be organised in two years' time in one of the new Member States, Poland for example, or perhaps Lithuania; the second is to consider creating an Internet Governance Forum of our own, I mean our own European forum, not a world forum."
"The European Parliament has a vital role to play in this regard."
"Clearly, Internet access in the Member States of the Union varies considerably."
"In my country, Poland, it is not very extensive, largely for financial reasons."
"The European Union should act to ensure that access is comparable, especially in rural areas."
"Madam President, I would like to join with Ms Trautmann - and I think I am speaking for all my other colleagues as well - in expressing my gratitude to the Parliament Presidency for having enabled us to go as an official delegation."
"This was a fact well noted by the many participants. We were the most active of all the political delegations there, and there were more European parliamentarians than any others."
"However, we are now seeing signs that other parliaments are looking at the Internet Governance Forum and realising they need to engage with it, because it addresses crucial public policy matters on which they need to be involved."
"The speeches given by my colleagues have covered a number of the issues."
"I would just like to make some broad observations about how I see the process evolving, particularly because I am the only Member of this Parliament to have attended both the world summits on the information society, and have also been through the process from the very beginning."
"There is a feeling that the forum in Rio is now starting to come up with much more practical ideas, and people are beginning to realise the value of exchanging information and best practice from around the globe."
"That is based on an understanding that it is not actually going to be formal, international, legal structures that are going to deliver many of the benefits we are looking for."
"In fact, we are going to have to deal with many of these matters through intergovernmental cooperation, and in many cases through cooperation between voluntary or non-governmental organisations."
"In the case, for example, of child protection, which the previous speaker referred to, the most successful initiatives have been those carried out by voluntary-based organisations - such as, in my country - the Internet Watch Foundation."
"It was very important to actually talk to people about such organisations."
"I will close by giving you a clear example, at a broader level, of the value of such interchanges."
"I participated in a workshop on consumer protection data breach notification, which is about to be discussed in Parliament as part of European legislation."
"I have a whole dossier on what has been done in other counties, and would say to the Commission that their proposal is currently extremely weak and would benefit greatly from its looking at that information."
"This is the sort of practical benefit we can derive from such forums, and I am sure we in this Parliament will be able to contribute to the development of the agenda for the next forum, to make it even more effective."
"(ES) Madam President, I feel that the Commissioner and all of us who have spoken today agree on the importance and the social and political impact of these forums, which are being attended in increasing numbers."
"For this reason I feel we must congratulate ourselves on the commitment we are making in Europe."
"I also feel, however, that we ought to avail ourselves of the political opportunity at this time, as Mrs Trautmann said, to reflect on the new Telecommunications Package, and in that sense I think that both the Commission and Parliament must make every effort not just to offer the people of Europe access to the best digital services, but also to spearhead the extension of the information society as a social commodity to countries that are in need of European cooperation and leadership."
"In this sense, I feel that what has been said here is extremely important: we must work on common problems such as sensitivity, freedom of expression on the Internet and protection, priority issues in my view."
"At the present time I think it is vital - and I will end here, Madam President - that we make global issues compatible with local issues. I believe that this is a priority, and so the posture set out in the resolution we will be adopting today is relevant: I trust it will be sufficient incentive for the Commission to continue to include these priorities in its political agenda."
"(NL)Madam President, I was not in Rio, but I was at the first conference in Athens, and there I saw the importance of the formula of the forum."
"In this forum stakeholders can explore together the limits that are very important and that will probably be applied in global relations later and also translated into EU regulations."
"There are some quite difficult issues behind this dialogue."
"I am thinking of the domain names, the icon and the American influence on this."
"The idea behind it is that we feel that it is extremely important that the world wide web should continue to have a genuinely global, unambiguous approach."
"That is why it is important to see that signals from this debate reappear again in the new approach to the icon and that the ideas of partners are taken on board."
"Madam President, I would like to throw some light on one particular aspect today."
"I very much support a European forum, a European interpretation of the forum for internet governance for the future, ideally before the 2009 elections."
"What we have to do is to make sure that we also bring our national parliaments on board in the debates."
"From the initiatives in some countries, such as the United Kingdom, you can see that these are live issues; given their importance for the future, for employment and welfare, as well as for freedom of information and participation, it is essential that we bring the national parliaments on board with other stakeholders in a European approach."
"I am appealing to the Commission: I read in the files that it does not have enough instruments or funds to support one thing and another, to choose a different line of approach."
"There is plenty of money."
"Look in i2010, look in the programmes for research, etc. I would really like to a very generous position to be adopted in order to establish the European view of these problems even more clearly before the 2009 elections."
"(SK) Thank you, Madam Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to this interesting debate."
"I strongly support the idea to establish forums on Internet governance with the participation of Members of the European Parliament."
"The Internet is today an unavoidable component of the life of European citizens regardless of their age."
"However, in disadvantaged regions it is almost impossible to get a fast Internet connection."
"With envy I often watch advertisements in our Slovak public and private media for Internet with four times the speed and its advantages."
"Where I live we do not have this advantage and our real options are limited only to local sources with insufficient speed."
"Commissioner Kuneva, what can the Commission do to make sure that the disadvantaged regions and the people who live there will not be forgotten, to make sure that these people have an equal opportunity to participate in the digital world?"
"Madam President, I just wanted to say one thing."
"I would like to thank Ms Trautmann, who led the delegation to Rio and did it in a very good way."
"I did not mention that in my first intervention, but I think it is important to state."
"We all found her to be a very good leader."
"I would just like that to be noted."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, let me start with the next steps, which are more concrete."
"Following the Rio meeting, consultations will be held in Geneva next month to collect views on the outcome of Rio and the preparation for the next meeting in New Delhi."
"The Commission participates in the advisory group which assists the UN Secretary-General in the preparation of the IGF."
"As has been our practice since the World Summit on the Information Society, we will of course inform Members of the outcome of this meeting."
"I would now like to answer some of the specific questions raised by MEPs, starting with Ms Trautmann."
"We welcome the fact that Ms Trautmann addressed, in her speech at the opening session, the issue of the 'Internet of Things' and the possibility of bringing this up at the IGF next year."
"With regard to the second part of Ms Trautmann's speech, regional IGFs have emerged in a number of places, and this appears to be a useful way to focus on questions of internet governance that are of particular importance for a specific region."
"The Commission strongly supports this idea."
"Moving on to Mr Savi, we could not agree more with his statement, and this is why the Commission is committed to the development of the e-application with the broad programmes and legislation."
"To Mr Czarnecki, the Commission is committed to all the initiatives on child protection."
"We promoted the item on the IGF agenda and we are about to propose a renewed programme on child protection on the internet."
"To conclude the debate, I have received one motion for a resolution, signed by six political groups, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.40 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon.)"

"- After the vote on Amendment 62:"
"(DE) Mr President, now that Parliament in its infinite wisdom has adopted compromise Amendment 62, Amendment 61 as proposed by the ALDE Group is now superfluous and is therefore withdrawn."
"3. ("
"- Before the vote on Amendment 3:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I just wanted to ask Mr Tannock if the addition he is proposing is in fact an addition, or whether his aim is to remove the section on violence and ill-treatment in police custody and penitentiary institutions."
"If his amendment is to be an addition, I can of course support it."
"If, however, he wishes part of the existing text to be deleted, I can only recommend that we vote against it."
"(FR) It is an addition."
"Thank you."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 7:"
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, in paragraph 32 we repeat the two conditions, i.e. territorial integrity and self-determination, even though they are already mentioned in paragraph 30."
"However, the author of the amendment has added 'self-determination of the people who live there'."
"I strongly recommend that we delete the words 'of the people who live there' because that would exclude the refugees and persons displaced in their own country."
"Therefore, if the author of the amendment agrees to delete those few words, I will be able to support the amendment; otherwise, I recommend that we reject it."
"Mr President, I have agreed to that change to the oral amendment."
"(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 8/rev:"
"Mr President, as we agreed at the beginning of the session, it will be an addition now."
"In the actual text it says to replace the words 'in the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzurum gas pipeline' with the words 'in the trans-Caspian energy corridor projects'."
"But by negotiation at the beginning of the voting session, I have already agreed this should be an addition rather than a replacement, so can we include the words 'in the trans-Caspian energy corridor projects'."

"- Before the vote:"
"Mr President, since we formulated this resolution, some important changes have taken place in Kenya."
"Yesterday, the newly-elected Parliament - and according to all observers the elections to the Parliament were pretty honest - elected a new speaker."
"The speaker is from the opposition."
"We view that as an encouraging sign, and I would therefore like to propose an oral amendment, in the form of a new paragraph reading as follows: 'Welcomes the fact that the newly-elected Parliament showed its independence by the election of Mr Kenneth Marende as its speaker, and underlines the decisive role to be played by that Parliament in restoring civil liberties in Kenya'."

"It aims to amend the first part as follows: 'Stresses the need to retrain those women who have had to stop their career, to enhance their employability' and then continues 'calls on the Member States to increase life-long learning possibilities'."

"Explanations of vote"
"Mr President, I have to say that on this particular measure, I voted against."
"While Mr Cashman is a very charming gentleman, I must say that whenever I see anything with his name on it, I do look on it with some degree of scepticism."
"The issue here is that we have a European Fundamental Rights Agency as if there were no such protection for human rights in the Member States."
"I question whether there is any need for this institution at European level."
"Is it not just a case of extending bureaucracy and creating new quangos, as we call them in Britain?"
"This is a burden on the taxpayer which, in the view of many others, will not actually contribute to human rights."
"Furthermore, in the absence of the constitution which we were promised, which you are now proposing to drive through without a referendum, there is no basis for it."
"Mr President, I voted against this report because the United Kingdom already respects human rights."
"It is a signatory to many international agreements; it does not need to be told how to behave by an EU that has overridden the results of the French and the Dutch referendums, which were perfectly constitutional."
"They rejected the Constitution."
"It has been replaced by an equivalent Treaty that has now been approved even before it has been seen in full by those who signed it."
"The EU clearly has no respect for democratic rights and cannot therefore be considered a safe or reliable custodian of human rights."
"Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to explain my vote."
"This is the first time I have done such a thing."
"I voted against this proposal because, whilst the committee in question may be called the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, it does not offer liberties to civilians, it does not offer justice, and it interferes in home affairs."
"We in Britain were promised a referendum."
"We are not going to get one."
"What is the European Union going to do about that?"
"Mr President, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity to explain my vote on this important issue."
"You may not be aware of this, but I represent the constituency of London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world."
"What one needs to understand is that London is actually a pretty diverse city."
"Let me explain: we already have 300 languages and 14 religions and, on the whole, we get along very well."
"So, the EU could actually learn a lot from London and how it has ensured human rights and that people's dignity is respected."
"We do not need those issues to be resolved at EU level."
"What could London, the most diverse city in Europe - and perhaps even in the world - learn from this institution?"
"What could it learn about human rights?"
"What could it learn about fundamental rights?"
"Absolutely nothing!"
"Let me add the following. The forthcoming ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, on what legal basis are we constructing this agency?"
"The Fundamental Rights Agency would have been given authority by the European Constitution."
"It would be given authority by the Lisbon Treaty."
"But the only legal base it has at the moment is a flimsy cat's cradle of communiqués, of press releases, of resolutions in Council."
"The European Union does not have a problem with the systematic violation of human rights."
"It does have a problem with the systematic violation of democratic rights."
"The problem we have is that a human rights charter written down on paper is meaningless unless there are also mechanisms to hold leaders to account."
"If you look at the constitutions of the former East Germany and of the Soviet Union, they were full of these wonderful promises of liberty."
"But, as the peoples of those unhappy countries found, it meant nothing without democracy."
"That is why, if you want to impose this human rights charter, you should consult the people first in a referendum."
"Pactio Olisipio censenda est!"
"Mr President, I too voted against this ludicrous proposal of an agency in respect of human rights in the EU."
"We in the United Kingdom, like many other countries, are long-term signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"Such rights as require external supervision are found there, and any court which is required is found in this city under that aegis, not under any aegis required by the EU."
"So this is totally unnecessary, an utter waste of public money."
"Its primary intent is to provide another layer of apparatus of statehood to the EU so that it can parade itself as some sort of a superstate within a Europe that gives rights to its citizens, rights they already have."
"If it wants to give rights, then let it recognise the fundamental right to vote on matters such as this: to say 'yes' or 'no' to a constitution."
"(SK) Mr Chairman, since criminal activity is increasing continuously and the threat of terrorism is growing, Europol needs to become more flexible."
"The three Protocols from 2000 to 2003 that amend and supplement the Europol Convention have still not taken effect."
"Surely an organisation that is promoting law cannot be effective if changes to its basic legislative instrument come into force only several years after a decision has been made to accept them."
"The proposal for a Council decision deals with this situation, which is why I voted for it."
"One important change in relation to the present situation is the plan to finance Europol from the Community budget and give the staff the status of EU official."
"This will increase the European Parliament's involvement in the management of Europol and simplify budget and personnel management."
"In addition, the European Parliament's position will be strengthened as democratic control of Europol improves."
"Moreover, the Community's financial expenditure will be comparable to the current expenditure of the Member States."
"(CS) Mr Chairman, please allow me to explain why I did not take part in the vote on this report."
"Firstly, I think that Europol is functioning well on the basis of bilateral agreements and bilateral cooperation."
"Secondly, the Czech Republic has, together with other countries, joined the Schengen area."
"It is necessary first and foremost to get accustomed to this cooperation, analyse it and subsequently improve it."
"In addition, any further integration aimed at transforming Europol into a European police force will require ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Only then we can talk about possible changes to Europol's legal basis."
"Mr President, I was interested to note that you cut off the microphone of my colleague, Mr Kamall, on the instant of 60 seconds, whereas you are much more generous when people are saying things you find more palatable."
"One of the errors we make in the European Union is to confuse 'cooperation' with 'supranationalism'."
"I am all in favour of police cooperation - any sensible person would be in this day and age."
"However, I am absolutely opposed to the creation of supranational authorities - such as EUROPOL is intended to be - which, as one of my colleagues said of the Fundamental Rights Agency, is one of the attributes of statehood that the European Union is claiming."
"The trouble is that these organisations lack democratic legitimacy, and that is very dangerous."
"Both EUROPOL and the European Union will lack democratic legitimacy until you put the Lisbon Treaty to a referendum."
"Mr President, I could not disagree more with this report."
"I voted against."
"Cooperation between police forces, yes; forced cooperation and obligation, no; especially when this police force will have within its ranks armed police that can be sent anywhere in the European Union."
"We do not have armed police as a rule in the United Kingdom."
"We will not suffer armed police coming in at the behest of EUROPOL."
"We do not believe in it."
"We run our country in a different way!"
"I am particularly disappointed to see that Amendments 56 and 57 were voted down, because, if passed, they would have removed immunity from that police force."
"In the United Kingdom, we are used to a police force which, if it causes damage to property or violates the individual or arrests without good reason, can be charged with offences afterwards."
"But then, I would not be surprised, because, after all, you are prepared to ram through a constitution without asking anybody either."
"Mr President, for the second time I rise to declare my vote opposing this motion."
"In Britain, there is a simple philosophy: no man is above the law; not even the Queen, the monarch of England, is above the law."
"It will take due process."
"We have in this legislation created a situation where there are people outside the law, incapable of being pursued legitimately."
"I have said in this House before: if the European Union is the answer, it must have been a bloody stupid question, and never was this so true as now."
"I give you Kennedy's comments: 'Those who make peaceful protest impossible, make violent protest inevitable'."
"Mr President, it is vital to cooperate across transnational boundaries on international crime, terrorism, drugs and so on. EUROPOL is doing that job right now with other police forces."
"However, creating a European police office which increases central powers will not solve the problems that have arisen in local communities around Britain."
"My country, my party, has voted against this resolution today as loyal Conservatives."
"My party has also requested that we have a referendum on the EU Constitutional Treaty."
"I have no place other than this House to protest at what Mr Brown is doing in reneging on a pledge he gave to hold such a referendum."
"I would therefore ask that we request Mr Brown to give the British people that referendum."
"Mr President, I understand that this proposal for a Council decision, as outlined in the report, provides for the conversion of EUROPOL into an EU agency."
"We must recognise that this will have two consequences."
"First of all, funding will have to be provided from the Community budget, and EUROPOL staff will acquire the status of Community officials."
"The report also contains provisions for coordination, which we all welcome, and organisation and implementation of investigations and operational activities carried out in conjunction with the Member States' relevant authorities or by joint investigation teams."
"The Conservatives favour open cooperation between police forces across the EU and beyond in the fight against crime."
"But we really do not accept that the EU has any role in centralising such cooperation."
"Thus, EUROPOL is an agency which is not necessary since other organisations already exist to fulfil this function at a global level."
"It is for this reason that I would like to add that the coming ratification of the European Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate."
"Mr President, I am glad to have this opportunity to make an explanation of vote."
"I put in for speaking time in the debate on this issue, but one of the consequences of my party's unhappy mésalliance with the European People's Party is that British Conservatives are systematically denied speaking time in important debates."
"What I wanted to say was that this report is based on a conceptual misunderstanding."
"People say that, because we have cross-border crimes, and because crime is international, we need cross-border policing."
"We already have it."
"The police forces of the nation states have for decades been collaborating to great effect."
"We have Interpol, we have the Hague Convention, we have extradition treaties, we recognise the time spent in another country's prison as constituting part of a sentence, and so on."
"The difference is that these things are based on democratic decisions between independent states, whereas what is being proposed with EUROPOL is the federalisation of what ought to be a sensitive national issue - namely the policing of criminal law."
"If we want to do that, we should first ask people in a referendum, which is why we need a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Mr President, some of the reasons propagated for this proposal on EUROPOL are quite bogus."
"It is suggested that we need to change the legal base; that we need to provide it with EU funding; that we need those it employs to be EU officials; that we need to expand its remit; and that we need an agency so that we can fight organised crime and terrorism."
"What utter nonsense!"
"We have been fighting organised crime and terrorism quite effectively, through proper long-standing cooperation between police forces."
"This is all about creating another aspect of the apparatus of EU statehood, so that it has an effective EU police force."
"That is what those officials will be, meddling in the internal affairs of Member States and - as has been pointed out - with immunity for their actions, beyond the reach even of judicial review in nation states."
"It is a preposterous proposal and utterly unnecessary."
"Mr President, regarding the Polfer report, the Conservatives did vote with the rapporteur on the issue of the South Caucasus."
"But it is again rather curious, is it not, that, while we are so anxious to protect the democratic freedoms and the rights of the people of the South Caucasus, and to ensure that they have a legitimacy and that they can express their self-determination, when it comes to the serious issue of the Constitutional Treaty of the European Union, Mr Brown of the Labour Party, who promised to give us a referendum, has now reneged on a referendum."
"My party, the Conservative Party, is incensed that a promise has been reneged on and that is why I am standing here asking the Labour Government to give us a referendum on this important constitutional issue, just as we are concerned about what is happening in the South Caucasus."
"Mr President, I understand that this report welcomes the inclusion of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia into the European neighbourhood policy and the endorsement of bilateral European Neighbourhood Policy action plans."
"I also understand that the rapporteur calls on the EU to develop a regional policy for the South Caucasus to be implemented jointly with the countries of the region."
"Of course, one of the watchwords that will appear in many of these reports is the word 'democracy'."
"I represent London - you may not be aware of this."
"I represent London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world, and we happen to have a very diverse community in London, including many people from Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia."
"One of the things that they welcome about living in London is democracy and the right to have their say on vital issues."
"They ask me all the time, 'Why is it that you are preaching to us about democracy, yet you deny that very right to your citizens in Britain when it comes to a referendum on the Constitution?'."
"So the Constitution, despite its rejection in two referendums, is undemocratic, cowardly and illegitimate."
"Mr President, may I thank you for the patience and good humour you are exhibiting in this session."
"May I also, as yesterday, extend my thanks to the services and the interpreters for humouring us."
"The big issue in the South Caucasus region at the moment is the dispute over election results."
"The West more or less connived at the Saddam-like election victory of the current Georgian Government the first time around with its vote of well over 90%, and now, when it claims re-election, we are arguing about whether that vote was free and fair."
"What kind of example do we in the European Union hold up to these struggling democracies when we show such contempt for our own democratic process here in the European Union?"
"It seems periodically necessary to remind this House that 55% of French voters and 62% of Dutch voters voted 'no' to the European Constitution, and yet we have the document coming back - this time without any referendums - as the Lisbon Treaty."
"I say it again: it is necessary to give the people a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Pactio Olisipio censenda est!"
"Mr Hannan, my good humour is matched only by yours."
"I always wonder how you manage to fit in a reference to a referendum."
"You succeed in doing so every time, no matter what topic we are discussing."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this measure not because it was my considered wish to do so, but because, as a loyal Conservative, I was following the whip."
"Left to myself I would probably have abstained or perhaps voted against."
"I have to say that issues concerning the Black Sea are not the top priority for my electors in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, and I suspect not the second or third priority either."
"Therefore, you could in a sense say that this was not a matter of the very greatest importance."
"However, I do not believe that the European Union should have a common foreign and security policy."
"I believe that nation states should have their own foreign policies, and am perfectly happy for them to work together in cooperation when that is in their interests - be this with states in the European Union or with states outside it."
"In any case, the common foreign and security policy can have no democratic legitimacy if there is to be no referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"Mr President, without doubt this new policy is aimed at facilitating, amongst other things, the supply of oil and gas through that region to Western Europe."
"That would be Russian gas and Russian oil, and you are now allowing yourselves to be possibly taken hostage."
"We all know that Russia cut off the supply of gas to Ukraine two Christmases ago; once they get an even bigger share of Western Europe gas supplies, perhaps they might do it to all of us at some time."
"At least here in France they have got the right idea, generating at least 70% of their electricity by nuclear power, and it is about time the EU formulated a policy to promote that right across the Union."
"But instead, of course, you go dabbling in the south Caucasus, around the Black Sea, with regimes that are not terribly stable; with regimes that may not want us there."
"But of course, you would rather do that than promote a referendum on the new constitution amongst your own people."
"Mr President, I am pleased to say that I am still here, even if you and others may not share my pleasure at being here."
"I would like to thank you all for your patience."
"I understand that this own-initiative report actually welcomes the Commission's communication 'Black Sea Synergy - a New Regional Cooperation Initiative', which aims to enhance cooperation with and within the Black Sea region by supplementing existing bilateral policies with a new regional approach."
"It considers that, in order to adopt such an approach, the communication has to be followed by further consistent steps on the part of the EU to encourage a genuine regional dimension tailored to this era."
"What region are we talking about?"
"Let me just clarify - the Black Sea region comprises the EU Member States Bulgaria, Greece and Romania, as well as Turkey and ENP partners Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine, as well as the Russian Federation."
"The great philosopher Brook Benton - followed and copied by the great philosopher Randy Crawford - once said, 'It's a rainy night in Georgia'."
"Indeed, when the people of Europe are denied their vote and the people of Britain are denied their vote in a referendum on the Constitution, it is a rainy night in the EU for democracy."
"Mr President, I appreciate your courtesy."
"I am glad to be able to speak on this report because it seems to me that the European Union, in its treatment of Turkey, is making a generational, a possibly epical mistake."
"It now seems very clear that we are never going to admit Turkey to full membership."
"It is clear from the majorities in this House; it is clear from the promises of referendums in Austria and France, where there are majorities of 70% and 80% respectively against membership."
"Had we said initially to Ankara that this was the case and we were going to work out some kind of alternative, we might have been able to go ahead in amity and partnership."
"Instead we are stringing the Turks along, imposing tens of thousands of pages of the acquis communautaire on them, making them grovel about Armenia, about Cyprus, about the treatment of their minorities and then, possibly 10 or even 15 years from now, after all of this, we will flick two fingers at them."
"In so doing, we risk creating the very thing we purport to fear: an Islamist state."
"Turkey is more of a democracy than the European Union."
"It changed its government peaceably."
"I wish we would have the courage to consult our own people."
"Pactio Olisipio censenda est!"
"(SK) The Black Sea region, an area of production and transit, has a strategic significance for the diversification and security of energy supplies to the European Union."
"I am convinced that regional cooperation should, in addition to Turkey and Russia, include the EU Member States as equal partners too."
"That is why I have voted in favour of the report."
"I am concerned about the continuing conflicts in this region, which are a threat to the stability and development of the area."
"I would therefore call on the European Union to play a more active role in the efforts to resolve the conflicts in this strategic area, in particular to get involved in the peace operations and to cooperate more closely with the Russian and Ukrainian Governments."
"There are obvious problems as regards the uneven development of the private sector in many countries around the Black Sea."
"It is necessary to improve the investment environment in the region, for local and international companies, through measures to improve the fight against corruption and fraud and promote market economy reforms."
"In accordance with the decision of this House, the explanations of vote will continue after this afternoon's votes."
"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to express my full support for this report, the fruit of a lengthy and excellent job by our colleague Michael Cashman."
"The European Monitoring Centre for Racism and Xenophobia was transformed into an Agency tasked with safeguarding and promoting human rights, the Agency being officially established on 1 March 2007."
"Ever since then, we must acknowledge, it has been wholly non-operational owing to the lack of a director and a multiannual framework."
"In response to this sluggishness and bureaucratic inefficiency, the rapporteur proposes amending the multiannual framework in a minimum number of areas."
"He urges the Commission and Council to speed up the process of selecting candidates for the post of director so as to facilitate a rapid agreement among the EU institutions, thereby reactivating this vital tool to safeguard citizens' human rights."
"I would call upon my fellow Members to support this report, since it represents an initial step towards making the Agency operational."
"Support for EU human rights policies and their development cannot and must not be subject to considerations and delays of a political and economic nature."
"in writing. - (PT) I obviously supported the creation in February 2007 of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights as I believe that this Agency could significantly help to increase the coherence and cohesion of EU policy on fundamental rights."
"The Agency was officially established on 1 March 2007 but is still waiting for the basic elements so that it can become fully operational, in other words the appointment of its director and the approval of a multiannual framework."
"This initiative aims to adopt this multiannual framework, which must guide the Agency's work over the next five years by defining the thematic areas in which it must act."
"I therefore welcome the enormous effort made by the rapporteur, Mr Cashman, to facilitate the negotiations, and I hope, like him, that this encourages the Commission and the Council to conclude both the discussions on this multiannual framework and the process of selecting candidates for the position of director as soon as possible."
"The people of Europe will not understand the reason for further delays preventing this Agency for Fundamental Rights from becoming fully operational."
"in writing. - (PL) I am opposed to the creation of a European Fundamental Rights Agency, and therefore I did not support the Multi-Annual Framework for 2007-2012."
"I believe that the proposed creation of this agency and its functions are not only a waste of money but also a dangerous political initiative, whose long-term effects will be damaging to the Member States of the Union, The basic tasks assigned to this agency amount to a clear intrusion into the sovereignty of Member States."
"The agency's existence cannot be justified. There are already institutions charged with safeguarding democracy and protecting human rights in every European country."
"In my view, this agency's activities will inevitably extend beyond the thematic areas for which it was established."
"For example, in the course of today's vote on Amendment 6 to the recitals, the question of defining a human being and establishing the point at which it acquires human rights arose."
"I consider this type of action to be an outrageous attempt to covertly impose dangerous ideological notions in the framework of the European Union."
"in writing. - I support this report, despite my opposition and disappointment that the former European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, set up following the recommendations of the Council of Ministers' Consultative Committee on Racism and Xenophobia, where I represented the European Parliament, has now been dissolved into a wider European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights."
"The Monitoring Centre in Vienna did extremely valuable work on promoting best practice in combating racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism and preventing their rise, as well as reporting on the current state of play across the Union and in applicant countries."
"The danger is that this will be lost, or at least diluted, in this new Agency."
"I will watch developments with care."
"in writing. - (FR) The PPE-DE Group's French delegation welcomes the adoption of the Cashman report on the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012."
"Among other points, the text defines the precise thematic areas of the Agency's activity to enable it to fulfil its mission and objectives successfully."
"The majority of the French delegation, following the group line, rejected the amendments by the Liberals aimed at extending its missions to homophobia and homophobic violence, and to racism against the Roma."
"They did so not in order to express their opposition to this legitimate and justifiable goal, but because these missions are already covered by the proposal for a decision, which includes in the Agency's thematic areas the issues of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, in addition to discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or against persons belonging to minorities."
"We welcome the adoption of this report, which will allow the Agency to become fully operational, thus enabling it to accomplish its task and safeguard the rights of EU citizens."
"in writing. - (FR) The PPE-DE Group's French delegation welcomes the adoption of the Cashman report on the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012."
"Among other points, the text defines the precise thematic areas of the Agency's activity to enable it to fulfil its mission and objectives successfully."
"The French delegation, following the group line, rejected the amendments by the Liberals aimed at extending its missions to homophobia and homophobic violence, and to racism against the Roma."
"It did so not in order to express their opposition to this legitimate and justifiable goal, but because these missions are already covered by the proposal for a decision, which includes in the Agency's thematic areas the issues of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, in addition to discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or against persons belonging to minorities."
"We welcome the adoption of this report, which will allow the Agency to become fully operational, thus enabling it to accomplish its task and safeguard the rights of EU citizens."
"in writing. - (PT) Leaving aside the aspects criticised, which we have already had the opportunity to highlight, once the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights becomes operational in due course, its actual purpose will be clarified."
"In the debate on the definition of the objectives and priorities for its Multiannual Framework for 2007-2012, its thematic areas were clearly restricted to the following was clear: racism, xenophobia and related intolerance; discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability or sexual orientation or of persons belonging to minorities; compensation of victims, prevention of crime and related aspects relevant to the security of citizens; protection of children, including the rights of the child; immigration and integration of migrants; asylum; visa and border control; participation in the Union's democratic functioning; human rights issues relating to the information society; and access to efficient and independent justice."
"The European Parliament has added extreme poverty and social exclusion."
"However, social rights, including the rights of workers, have not been regarded as a priority, even at a time when fundamental social rights are being called into question by the policies promoted by the EU."
"in writing. - (FR) Like the French delegation in the PPE-DE Group, I welcome the adoption of the Cashman report on the adoption of a Multiannual Framework for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012."
"Among other points, the text defines the precise thematic areas of the Agency's activity to enable it to fulfil its mission and objectives successfully."
"Like the French delegation and the PPE-DE Group, I rejected the amendments by the Liberals aimed at extending its missions to homophobia and homophobic violence, and to racism against the Roma."
"In fact, these missions are already covered by the proposal for a decision, which includes in the Agency's thematic areas the issues of racism, xenophobia and related intolerance, in addition to discrimination based on gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation or against persons belonging to minorities."
"I welcome the adoption of this report, which will allow the Agency to become fully operational, thus enabling it to accomplish its task and safeguard the rights of EU citizens."
"in writing. - I voted in favour of the amended proposal because it contains improvements in data protection."
"However, I do not agree with the increasing move of justice and home affairs issues from the Member States to the EU."
"For this reason, I voted against the legislative resolution."
"in writing. - (FR) I strongly support the report by our excellent colleague Mr Díaz de Mera."
"The transformation of Europol into a Community agency is a request I have always supported."
"It means in fact that from now on Europol will be financed by the Community budget, and that the status of Community official will apply to Europol personnel."
"In both cases, the powers of our Parliament have been considerably enhanced."
"Moreover, the Council decision substantially broadens Europol's scope and capacity for action, which I also support."
"In short, making Europol more operational and subjecting it to genuine democratic control is a decision I support unreservedly."
"in writing. - The Council's wangling has been entirely successfully: transforming the European Police Office, Europol, from its status as an intergovernmental agency financed by the budgets of the Member States into a European Union agency financed by the EU budget, and applying the status of Community official, all on the grounds of technical, not political, requirements."
"Since Europol's missions have in fact been extended significantly to encompass areas other than organised crime, the Council feels that the new objectives will be better dealt with at EU level than at Member State level."
"Thus, in the name of the extremely questionable principle of subsidiarity, the Europeanist logic of systematic elimination of competences of the Member State and deepening of the supranational model is applied."
"This is exactly the philosophy and the approach of the reforms in the Lisbon Treaty, which European and national leaders as a body wish to impose on the peoples and nations against their will."
"Europe is no longer listening to its peoples."
"Worse still, it is disregarding them and lying to them."
"Now that 26 European countries have already announced they will not ratify this Treaty by referendum, let us hope that the nations and peoples of Europe will be saved by a rejection of this ridiculous text by the Irish, the only people who are allowed to decide for themselves."
"in writing. - (PL) The Member States of the European Union created Europol as an institutional response through which to combat organised crime."
"We are today debating broadening Europol's competences and streamlining its operations, 12 years after it was established."
"The rapporteur has made an accurate assessment of Europol's current legal and factual situation."
"He rightly criticises the overly complicated and lengthy procedure envisaged to change Europol's status and include it in the Union's organisational structure."
"The corrective measures proposed in the report are also worthy of consideration and support."
"Earlier attempts to change Europol's competences show how difficult it is for countries to reach agreement when they are bound by the principle of unanimity."
"I therefore believe that only when the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified and comes into force in all 27 Member States will we be able to introduce procedural changes and improve this situation, as the Treaty will also reform the decision-making process within the EU."
"In addition, bestowing the status of an EU agency on Europol, with all the consequences that involves, including financial, will enable the European Union as a whole to combat organised crime more effectively."
"in writing. - (PT) As neither the Treaty proposal nor this proposal to adopt by qualified majority decisions on regulations relating to the structure, operations, field of action and tasks of Europol have been ratified, the EU institutions are already tiring of trying to convert the European Police Office into a European agency."
"In addition to our fundamental criticism of this process, we are concerned that we are facing:"
"the possibility that 'special categories of data concerning racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, party or trade union membership, sexual orientation or health' will not be excluded from processing;"
"the failure to adopt safeguards for the protection of personal data processed in the field of police and judicial cooperation at EU level and in relations with third countries, particularly with the US (e.g. air passenger data);"
"the failure to guarantee access by an individual to his data or even to be aware that his personal data is being processed by Europol;"
"the failure to clarify the control by national parliaments."
"This would be a flagrant breach of citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"in writing. - (ES) I voted for the text agreed by consensus with the contributions of the groups."
"It is an issue that affects essential cooperation against crime."
"I must point out, however, as did my colleagues Mr Fava and Mr Moreno, that the lofty goals of the resolution are at odds with the recalcitrant attitude of the rapporteur, Mr Díaz de Mera, who was Director-General of the Spanish Police on 11 March 2004 and who refused to cooperate with the court that presided over the trial on Europe's largest ever terrorist bombing."
"Moreover, the rapporteur is one of the major propagators or collaborators of the disgraceful theory that it was not Islamist cells, but ETA terrorists, that were responsible for this massacre."
"Mr Díaz de Mera and others who described themselves as 'peones negros' (black pawns) attempted to mislead international public opinion and, even though their standpoint was in the end not treated as a crime (it was subjected only to a sanction and serious admonishment from the Court), this Parliament should be acquainted with all the facts."
"Their personal attacks reveal their lack of arguments."
"Finally, I wish to express my regret that Mr Díaz de Mera did not even have the dignity of his colleague Jaime Mayor, who at least removed his name from the terrorism text."
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to vote in favour of the Díaz de Mera García Consuegra report on the establishment of the European Police Office (Europol)."
"Changing circumstances within the European Union, new forms of criminal activity and new terrorist threats mean that the existing body is in need of reorganisation."
"I nevertheless feel that certain points should be clarified."
"The transformation of Europol into an EU agency must not place an additional financial burden on Member States; above all, it must not consume any of the already insufficient state resources earmarked for national police forces."
"On the contrary, the investigative authorities and those responsible for law and order must be better looked after and reinforced."
"Indeed, Europol's activities must consist of supporting and coordinating the fundamental, irreplaceable work of the various Member States' police forces."
"I am therefore pleased that the proposal contains provisions for the coordination, organisation and conduct of investigations and operational activities in conjunction with the Member States' competent authorities or by joint investigative teams."
"in writing. - (PT) This own-initiative report reveals the true ambitions of the 'European Neighbourhood Policy', specifically for the South Caucasus."
"These are to set out the geostrategic agenda in its political, economic and military aspects, in other words the EU's plan for intervention in this neuralgic area, with increased pressure being put on China and Russia."
"This will result in more interference in, and manipulation of, the conflicts arising from the dismantling of the USSR, with the aim of ensuring that the EU's major powers and financial/economic groups gain control over this region, with the inter-capitalist rivalries also being clearly evident."
"You only have to look at the 'recommendations', such as the incentive to conclude free trade agreements and the pursuit of further liberalisation or the clear appeal for interference through 'support' for the action of 'civil society', ensuring that 'the [Community!] funds are distributed ... without ... state interference'."
"The approach to the energy issue is particularly significant as it highlights the importance of energy brokers who can bypass Russia and the control over energy infrastructures and sources."
"Finally, we note the incoherence between 'its unconditional support for the territorial integrity and inviolability of the internationally recognised borders of Georgia' and the appeal to the principles of the United Nations Charter, when this is not being done for Serbia."
"in writing. - (PT) This is another own-initiative report which assumes the same logic as the report on the Southern Caucasus and the 'European Neighbourhood Policy': in other words, interference and pressure to guarantee access to (and control over) markets (particularly energy markets) and further liberalisation."
"The report argues for the promotion of 'market economy reforms', encouraging 'harmonisation and further liberalisation measures' and supporting 'the creation of a free trade area in accordance with WTO principles'."
"This is a process in which the EU allegedly has 'a leading role to play' in 'encouraging the region to take the necessary steps'."
"At the same time the report 'stresses the crucial importance of establishing and developing good neighbourly relations among the countries of the Black Sea region and with their neighbours, based on mutual respect, territorial integrity, non-interference in each others' internal affairs and the prohibition of the use of force or threats to use force, as fundamental principles for fostering regional cooperation' and yet it argues for the promotion of 'European values', 'irrespective of the degree of willingness shown by partner governments'."
"This is a clear contradiction/incoherence between what is recommended (for others) and what is done."
"The EU is demanding that others respect what it itself does not respect."
"What cynicism."
"in writing. - (DE) Until a short while ago Kenya was a holiday paradise for many people."
"Visitors were well shielded from the massive corruption and terrible poverty in which a large majority of the population have to live."
"Since the events of late December and the fraudulent presidential elections, Kenya and its political problems have suddenly been on everyone's lips."
"While the parliamentary elections were generally regarded as successful by the official observers, doubts were raised as to the accuracy of the results of the presidential election."
"In tabling today's motion for a resolution on Kenya, we are once again condemning the widespread irregularities and the conduct of the incumbent President Kibaki, who in rejecting the offer made by President John Kufuor to help resolve the crisis has seriously undermined the mediation efforts."
"We call on Kenya's political leaders to do everything in their power to prevent further violence in the country and to ensure respect for human rights."
"During the debate on this subject we again discussed and examined the question of the effectiveness of direct budgetary aid."
"This topic, like that of Kenya, is one that will continue to occupy us in the months ahead."
"in writing. - (PT) This explanation of vote is intended to point out that, by recognising the mediation efforts begun by neighbouring countries, by the Southern African Development Community and by the African Union, we believe that the Kenyan people will be able to find and define their own path."
"It is up to the Kenyan people themselves to find the solutions to overcome the current situation in their country."
"As a result, we regard as negative any attempt by the EU to interfere, as indicated and proposed in the resolution, particularly bearing in mind the objectives proclaimed by the EU in its 'Strategy for Africa' and the framework of inter-imperialist cooperation/rivalry concerning this continent that is also clearly evident and that is so deeply felt in this region."
"Finally, I must highlight the omission from the resolution of a reference to the severe and deteriorating socio-economic situation in this country - which is at the root of the expression of popular discontent manifested in the elections - and the deep responsibility for this situation of the neo-liberal policies promoted, in particular, by the international financial institutions, major capitalist powers and their transnational companies."
"in writing. - (CS) I fully support our resolution on the situation in Kenya, which is based on an up-to-date investigation by the EU observer mission in Kenya at the start of the year."
"We must ensure that the authorities in Kenya investigate, without delay, the circumstances surrounding the elections and prevent further violence."
"We must insist on the return of live broadcasting and on the adherence to basic human rights and the rights laid down by the African Charter."
"However, this resolution detract from the responsibility of the European Commission to resolve the issue of the transfer of € 400 million to the Congolese Government."
"I think that we shall be returning to this issue soon."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of paragraph 20 of the report on the role of women in industry because it is essential that the Commission carries out a study into the negative consequences of long working hours on private, family and social life, such as children spending a lot of time alone, left to their own devices, which often leads to failure at school and crime."
"The Member States must improve monitoring of undertakings that force their employees to remain at work beyond the statutory working hours and they must impose harsh penalties on these undertakings."
"in writing. - (PT) The European Parliament today adopted my report on the role of women in industry."
"This is very positive, although I do regret certain minor amendments."
"However, the report recognises the important role of women in industry and it calls on the Commission and Member States to take the necessary measures, including effective monitoring, to combat stereotyping and discrimination, particularly wage discrimination."
"This situation is even more serious when you consider that women's wages are around 30% lower than men's wages in industry, whereas the average for other sectors is 15%, despite the Equal Pay Directive having been around for more than 30 years."
"It stresses the importance of collective bargaining in the fight to abolish discrimination against women, in particular with regard to access to employment, wages, working conditions, careers and professional training."
"It stresses the importance of Community programmes that encourage the creation of trademarks, the protection of products' designation of origin and the external promotion of Community products from industrial sectors where women predominate."
"Finally, it is very important to ensure recognition of the right of female and male workers to take part in restructuring processes affecting industrial undertakings, by guaranteeing their structures, in particular the European Works Councils, full access to information and the possibility of decisive intervention, including the right of veto."
"in writing. - (SV) This report deals with a number of aspects which, in themselves, are important but in respect of which the Member States retain the power to act and the responsibility to develop and improve their legislation."
"The gender ratio on company boards, the development of equality plans in large companies and the proportion of female members of company boards are not questions which are best and most effectively regulated at EU level."
"We have thus voted against the report in question."
"in writing. - (PL) Clearly, European industry is undergoing far-reaching change."
"It is therefore hard not to recognise its strategic importance for the development of all Member States of the European Union and their citizens, regardless of gender."
"The role of women employed in European industry and the opportunities available to them depend not only on a country's level of economic development, but also on traditions regarding acceptance of equal opportunities and respect for human rights regulations."
"There is large-scale participation of women in industry and they make a substantial contribution in almost all sectors. Nonetheless, one has to agree with the rapporteur that the role of women in industries involving cutting-edge technologies, such as the aeronautical industry or the chemical industry, is very inadequate."
"It is entirely appropriate, therefore, that the report highlights this aspect and focuses quite rightly on gender issues."
"The report also emphasises that women's involvement in industry cannot be limited to work in sectors that do not require qualifications, where women are the first to suffer when restructuring takes place."
"The rapporteur calls for support, especially for SMEs, to enable the relatively high level of female employment to be retained, particularly in the case of women who find themselves in an unfortunate professional situation."
"This suggestion is worthy of support, as is the entire report, if only for this reason."
"in writing. - I support paragraph 33 because such proactive measures need to be taken - at least on an interim basis to ensure participation of women in the decision-making process at all levels."
"In addition to this I strongly support paragraph 20 as there is a real need for a full investigation into the impact that long working hours have on health, both physical and mental, as well as on family life."
"If we are to promote a work life balance and family friendly policies then we need such a study."
"in writing - (PL) Human rights are the foundation of democracy."
"These rights include the very important principle of equality between women and men, allowing of course for the circumstances arising out of the biological differences between them."
"One aspect of this issue concerns the employment and role of women in industry."
"It is simply impossible to apply an arithmetical division into equal halves."
"Above all, what we are concerned with is equality of opportunity, which is conditional on access to education and professional training in technical and economic subjects."
"Another very important issue is providing assistance to mothers bringing up children and ensuring they are not discriminated against in the workplace."
"It is essential to introduce flexible provisions regarding pensions for women bringing up children. The period of so-called parental leave must be credited in full and added to the period considered as time in employment under pension rules."
"In many of our countries women are still being paid significantly less than men for work of equal quality and quantity."
"There can be no justification for creating obstacles impeding women from undertaking managerial and supervisory roles on company boards of directors or boards of trustees."
"Action is needed to do away with stereotypes in this regard."
"The report tabled represents a step in that direction, which is why I voted in favour of it."
"in writing. - (FR) In many recitals and paragraphs of this extremely long resolution, we are stating the obvious."
"We are calling for measures that were, fortunately, taken some time ago."
"It is true that certain directives on equal treatment and opportunities between women and men have been poorly applied, but if discrimination still remains in the areas covered by this set of measures, who is at fault?"
"All these directives contain appeal mechanisms."
"Women who have experienced discrimination need only go to court, where they will win their case, as demonstrated in many cases in my country, thankfully."
"Unfortunately, this report contains a number of incongruous claims that bear no relation to the role of women in industry."
"Asking for a 40% quota of female representation on company boards is interference contrary to the principle of subsidiarity in issues reserved for Member States."
"It is not for us to call for the 'monitoring' of company delocalisation."
"It is utopian to demand 'more choice in the workplace'."
"If my company is based in the city of Luxembourg and has no other branches, I cannot put in a request to work in Schifflange where I live."
"I voted for this report in accordance with these observations."
"in writing. - (CS) I agree with many of the ideas in the report on women in industry."
"However, I am not happy that specific attention was not given to the regional unemployment among women who lost their jobs in European textile factories at the time when this was happening."
"I also think that no amount of quotas for the employment of women will solve the situation."
"My second comment concerns the balanced division of time between work and family."
"This affects women as well as men."
"I do not think that the solution lies in resolutions."
"It lies in the implementation of the European concept of flexicurity."
"Holland is one example where an excellent legislative framework has been developed for part-time work."
"The result has been reduced unemployment, as well as giving men and women more time for family life."
"An effective use of shorter working hours also shows that it does not have to lead to a reduction in income."
"in writing. - (SV) As a liberal and a member of the Liberal Party of Sweden, Folkpartiet, I always find reports from Parliament on equality somewhat tricky."
"The Swedish Liberal Party has over the years taken the view that the best way to proceed in these matters is on a voluntary basis but we also realise that this is not always enough."
"Sweden's positive engagement in this field has made us known as one of the world's most equal countries."
"So do we not want to disseminate our successes across the EU?"
"Of course we do!"
"The question is merely by what methods."
"In the report in question I felt obliged to vote against a number of paragraphs whose spirit I support but whose scope and approach seem dubious."
"I think that both equality plans and measurable targets may be important tools for enterprises."
"On the other hand, I do not believe it is something that the EU should concern itself with as a primary issue. The same applies to the establishment of an EU-sponsored 'methodology for analysing exactly what jobs entail' that will 'guarantee' equal pay."
"The Global Adjustment Fund, about which I had severe misgivings from the beginning, also should not take special account of gender - that would be to perpetrate a double injustice."
"One cannot expect every report to be written as though one had drafted it oneself, but there is much to find fault with here."
"Yet the subject is so important that, in the end, I voted in favour of it as a whole."
"in writing. - (PL) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Figueiredo on the role of women in industry."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very good and thorough report."
"The issue of equal rights for men and women is a very important one and we must continue to give it as much attention as possible, since the European Union is based on the principle of non-discrimination."
"We should give priority to tackling all indications of failure to comply with this principle. This is particularly necessary because the nature of industry is changing as we strive to create a knowledge-based society."
"The sectors in which women were traditionally employed are linked to the processing industry, whereas the newest sectors of industry are based on the development of the latest technologies, such as information and communication technologies."
"We should make every effort to ensure that the principle of equal opportunity is complied with in these new sectors."
"in writing. - (IT) The resolution on which we are about to vote cannot fail to receive the support and vote of the UEN Group."
"We hope that there will soon be better regulation of the Internet aimed at protecting children and taking more effective measures against providers that host child pornography websites."
"Immediate action must be taken by all EU Member States to close down illegal sites, by means of better coordination among the police forces responsible."
"In addition, we hope that it will be possible to tackle the sensitive issue of information exchanged by terrorist organisations thanks to the Internet, and that this matter might be the subject of future forums."
"There can be no freedom without rules and, most importantly, the Internet cannot and must not be an area of freedom for those who commit criminal acts and preach hatred and intolerance."
"An emergency must be tackled by means of decisive, urgent measures and not improvised ones."
"The fight against terrorism and hatred between peoples must be a rule and a goal of the European Union and all free, democratic countries."

"Arrest of Chinese dissident Hu Jia (debate)"
"- The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on the arrest of the Chinese dissident Hu Jia."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, our Group has nominated Hu Jia and his wife, Zeng Jinyan, for the Sakharov Prize."
"Because the couple are under house arrest they used a webcam link to take part in a hearing of the European Parliament on the human rights situation in China."
"The renewed arrest of Hu Jia has only served to demonstrate something that he himself warned of."
"Does China by its action wish to show its contempt for the opinion of the European Parliament?"
"Human rights must be firmly enshrined as an issue that cuts across all the relations that exist between the EU and China."
"We too must act in a coherent and consistent way and should not simply sacrifice our values on the altar of good economic relations."
"We are therefore calling on the Council and the Commission not just to take up a position for Hu Jia but also to use the next EU-China summit to call for a commitment to human rights."
"China has to put a stop to the systematic intimidation of human rights activists."
"If China does not change its conduct we will again need to raise the issue of our participation in the Olympic Games."
"Moreover, Russia is set to host the next Winter Olympics and that country also has a poor record when it comes to human rights."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, the problem of human rights in China keeps coming up in these urgent debates, always with good reason."
"China's economic growth and increased international standing have still not resulted in any real difference in the approach to civil liberties, abuse of power by the authorities, room for opposition and independence of the judiciary."
"Harsh penalties are still being imposed, including frequent use of the death penalty."
"China is not the only country that sentences people to death and executes them, but it is the champion in this."
"The only progress that we have seen is that more care is now taken to be certain of the perpetrator's guilt before the death penalty is carried out, so fewer people are being put to death who later turn out to be innocent."
"Meanwhile, the international focus on the three great dramas in China has to a large extent disappeared."
"The bloodbath in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the persecution of the supporters of the Falun Gong movement and the changing of the composition of the populations of Tibet and East Turkestan are being given less and less attention."
"All the attention is now going to economic growth, export opportunities to China, opportunities for cheap imports from China, the growing role of China in Africa and the coming Olympic Games in China."
"Under these circumstances the pressure to improve the human rights situation in China is dwindling."
"The Olympic Games have become an argument for pulling down residential areas and driving the residents away."
"Chinese ambassadors say that their national honour is violated when this is criticised from abroad."
"The coming Olympic Games could have been an occasion for improvement."
"As things look at the moment, they will be good for tourism and good for the completion of major public works, but not good for improving human rights."
"In the Netherlands, meanwhile, a debate has started about the possibility of boycotting these Olympic Games."
"A resolution about a single arrested human rights activist, Hu Jia, is necessary but it is not enough."
"The most important factor in the relations between Europe and China should not be economic self-interest but our concern about human rights in China."
"author. - (PL) I agree with Mr Meyer who said just now that we should boycott the Olympic Games because of the persecution to which the Chinese people are subject in China."
"Indeed, it is not only the Chinese who are constantly being persecuted in that country. The persecution of the Tibetan people and other national minorities has often been raised in this House."
"We are today referring to the illegal detention and persecution of an activist in the cause of freedom, a person who is fighting for freedom in China, namely the politician Hu Jia. His wife and family have shared his fate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can remember when the Olympic Games hosted by the Soviet Union were boycotted several decades ago. That action contributed to the fall of the Communist regime."
"Congratulations are due to China on the latter, but we must not turn a blind eye to the persecution of so many people and the violation of their fundamental rights. As I mentioned earlier, it is not only the Chinese who are affected, but also other residents of what is known as China."
"After all, Tibet, whose cause has repeatedly been raised in this House, is not China. I appeal for a boycott of the Olympic Games."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, seven months before the start of the Olympic Games, China is demonstrating how little account it takes of human rights."
"The hope that the IOC decision would help improve things in the Middle Kingdom has been an illusion."
"In October and November 2007 the State Security Services abducted and maltreated the attorneys Gao Zhisheng and Li Heping."
"At the end of December they imprisoned the human rights activist and cyber dissident Hu Jia on the charge that he had used the Internet to incite subversion of State power."
"On 10 October Hu Jia took part in a press conference on human rights, which was held at the European Parliament in Brussels."
"He was linked to us live from China by telephone."
"We must thank him for this courageous act."
"Last year he and his wife Zeng Jinyan were nominated by the European Parliament for the Sakharov Prize."
"In his Internet blog he reports on political prisoners and on the victims of land confiscations for the forthcoming Olympics."
"In a letter he thanked Chancellor Angela Merkel for having received the Dalai Lama."
"This clearly was too much for official China."
"In an open letter some 57 Chinese intellectuals called for the release of Hu Jia."
"Our President, Hans-Gert Pöttering, endorsed this."
"It is a slap in the face when human rights activists are arrested, especially because of their contact with the European Parliament."
"We have to use all diplomatic means at our disposal to ensure that he is released from prison immediately."
"China is promising the world the best Olympic Games ever seen."
"The price for this should not be censorship or contempt for the rule of law."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, back in 2001 when it was decided that Beijing would host the Olympic Games, many of us believed that despite the controversy surrounding it, this decision would help to bring about political change in Communist China. We felt that the host country would be moved to put an end to widespread violations of human rights and increase the scope of fundamental freedoms on its territory."
"I agree with Mr Mann that with 7 months to go before the Games open, all those hopes have proved in vain."
"The opposite is actually the case: the rule of terror in China has intensified."
"Human rights defenders like Hu Jia and his wife are imprisoned and held illegally without trial in unknown locations, harassed, terrorised and denied the right of defence."
"The Chinese authorities are sending out a different signal to the world, indicating that there is no democracy or openness in their country."
"At the same time, the Chinese Olympic Committee has determined that the Games' main slogan will be 'One world, one dream'. They maintain that this dream consists of a common aspiration to flourish and live in peace."
"One is left wondering what kind of peace the Chinese have in mind and whether they really understand what the Olympic Games are all about."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, the Chinese activist Mr Hu Jia was arrested two days after Christmas during the afternoon at his home."
"It is very sad news, particularly because China, a great country, a great global player in the contemporary world, is the organiser of the Olympic Games this year."
"The European Parliament and all the European Union must stress that China must challenge six issues relating to human rights: China's failure to fully implement new regulations allowing greater press freedom;"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, Hu Jia and Zeng Jinyan have come to symbolise for us the fight for freedom of expression and human rights in China."
"Both husband and wife have been nominated by this House for the Sakharov Prize in recognition of their activities, whilst they are repressed in their own country because of those same activities."
"Hu Jia was arrested on 2 January."
"In the 1980s, during the period of martial law in Poland, transparency served to protect against the most drastic forms of repression."
"The press and radio stations on the other side of the Iron Curtain named those imprisoned, which allowed us to hope we would be safe."
"I myself experienced what it meant to be helped in this way by people abroad who were not indifferent to our plight."
"That is why it is now so very important for me to ensure that our voice, the voice of the European Parliament, the voice of hundreds of Members from different European countries should be heard in China. The Chinese authorities must hear our appeal and stop repressing Hu Jia and the many other victims of persecution."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the Olympic Games ought to be perceived by both the Chinese authorities and the rest of the world as a chance for China to change its international image, which has been particularly affected by continuous breaches of human rights, affecting very different groups, for very different reasons."
"The arrest of Hu Jia, and many others, show that China is not taking up this opportunity as it should."
"It also serves once again as a reminder to those who saw China as a country that was prepared and sufficiently open-minded to organise an international event supposedly focusing on solidarity such as the Olympic Games."
"China still has time to change that image, but to do this it must take issues such as freedom of expression and freedom of association more seriously, and put an end to its obsession with arresting, punishing and convicting Chinese men and women accused of an offence as difficult to justify as incitement to subvert state power."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - Madam President, every Olympics draws our attention to the preservation of human dignity as stated in the Olympic Charter."
"The 2008 Beijing Olympics will specifically draw our attention to that preservation - or otherwise - in China."
"Hopefully, this will bring pressure on the Chinese Government to rethink actions like the arrest of Hu Jia."
"It is an opportunity for the country to improve its poor record in this area."
"Instead, the Chinese Government seems determined to sweep human rights abuses under the rug, by arresting activists and protestors."
"Of concern is the purchase of Western high-tech security equipment by the Chinese authorities, obviously intended to step up security during the games."
"My concern is twofold."
"I fear that such security equipment will be used against the Chinese people this summer, and that it will remain in misuse after the summer."
"We must either use the Olympics to promote human rights in China, or boycott them, and one thing we cannot do is have a big celebration of China if human rights continue to be so flagrantly disregarded."
"(BG) Colleagues, during the 20th century millions of people all over the world fell victims to communism."
"Regrettably, this extremely pernicious, misanthropic and mostly anti-Christian ideology continues to take its victims to this day and to have its representatives. Even here in this Chamber."
"I will give you an example to illustrate and make things somewhat clearer."
"Currently Hu Jia is under house arrest in China because there are a sufficient number of people there who believe that he is a proponent of their ideas."
"This is what makes his dangerous for the Chinese regime."
"Here, at the European Parliament, thank God, there is a sufficient number of Members elected by millions of citizens to represent their views, yet the powers that be in this European Union, which many compare to a 'pyramid', have their own priorities and a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty is not among those priorities."
"This makes us, those Members, just as dangerous as Hu Jia is for the Chinese regime."
"We are not placed under house arrest but Mr. Pöttering, if he is honest and open enough, would admit that he might go that far."
"However, I assure him that an honourable representation of our voters counts more than that prospect. Thank you."
"Madam President, the case of Mr Hu Jia and his wife, unfortunately, is not an isolated one."
"In order to have the privilege to host this year's Olympic Games in Beijing, the Chinese Government undertook additional commitments to meet internationally recognised human rights standards."
"Contrary to these expectations, Beijing sees the Olympic Games as a justification for increasing repression against human rights activists."
"So, by systematically violating its own commitments, the Chinese Government has demonstrated that it does not intend to respect the core values of the Olympic tradition."
"In fact, it is about to lose its credibility."
"Therefore, the democratic states cannot limit their reaction to mere complaints."
"If the Chinese authorities do not make credible changes to the situation, then the democratic participants in the Games risk their own credibility with regard to the values they advocate."
"(PL) Madam President, in 2001 the Vice-President of the Beijing Organising Committee for the Games of the XXIX Olympiad, Liu Jingmin, stated that awarding the Olympic Games to Beijing would help to promote the development of human rights."
"In recent months, however, the Chinese authorities have been allowing themselves to violate freedom of expression more frequently than usual. They have also repressed journalists and activists."
"The arrest of Hu Jia, a leading human rights activist who was nominated for the Sakharov Prize in 2007 sent shock waves through society."
"Hu Jia was arrested on the pretext that he had been inciting others to overthrow the national government. He is still being denied the right to a lawyer and to medical care."
"China must be forced to comply with international standards in human rights and to respect those rights. It must also put an end to exploitation of the Games as an excuse for the illegal detention of journalists and dissidents."
"We should remind the Chinese authorities of the idea inspiring the Olympic movement, namely linking sport with a vision of a peaceful society and the preservation of human dignity."
"At the same time we should call for the immediate release of Hu Jia and of all the other activists detained without trial, so that they can return to their families and access essential medical care."
"(PL) Madam President, I simply wished to establish whether the 'catch-the-eye' strategy also works here."
"If so, I wished to state briefly that when in China one cannot detect any obvious signs of how the control system operates, but it does. The citizens feel strongly bound up in the oppressive regime imposed by the system."
"We believe we are called to make the rest of the world aware of the situation, as other Members have already stated."
"That is the only weapon at our disposal."
"We can respect the economic development achieved in China, but hardly anywhere else in the world have people become so permeated by fear and self-censorship."
"I am therefore full of admiration for those courageous individuals in China who are brave enough to risk their careers, their freedom and their very lives to draw attention to the situation. It is our moral duty to stand shoulder to shoulder with them."
"There is no other solution, no other way forward."
"(PL) Madam President, further to the comments of my fellow Member from Poland, I should like to pose the following question to Commissioner Kuneva, taking advantage of her presence in the House."
"Against the background of the last few years, can we really say that genuine respect for human rights is on the increase in the People's Republic of China?"
"Have the Games due to take place this July in Beijing really meant that Chinese dissidents can now feel more secure, and that relations with Taiwan are on a more civilised footing?"
"Has free access to the Internet increased over the last two or three years?"
"I would be grateful for the Commissioner's reply."
"After all, the Bible tells us: 'Ask and ye shall receive'."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, only a month ago my colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, expressed in this Chamber the Commission's deep concern at the continuous and systematic repression of human rights' defenders in China."
"The Commission was, therefore, all the more concerned to learn about Mr Hu Jia's arbitrary detention and recalls that he has been subjected to repeated acts of harassment in the past due to human rights activities."
"We also express our concern for Mr Hu Jia's health."
"He suffers from hepatitis B and must take daily medication."
"It is not clear whether daily access to the medical treatment he needs is guaranteed and whether he can count on doctors' assistance during his detention in the Beijing Municipal Detention Centre in Dougezhuang."
"In the Commission's view, the detention of Mr Hu Jia places an obligation on the EU to act in a firm manner because of the clear inference that he was arrested as a consequence of speaking freely and honestly about the repression of human rights defenders via a telephone link to a meeting of the European Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights in November 2007."
"As such, it has echoes of the case of Cao Dong, a Falun Gong petitioner, who was arrested and is still in prison after meeting the Vice-President of the European Parliament in Beijing in May 2006."
"The detention of Mr Hu Jia also calls for a reaction from the EU as an international actor for the protection of human rights defenders."
"Yesterday the EU troika carried out a firm démarche to the Chinese authorities asking for his immediate release."
"We sincerely hope that the Chinese authorities will understand that the issue of human rights defenders has an important impact on China's standing with the European public and will act accordingly."
"I would like to reassure this Chamber that the EU will monitor very closely the evolution of Mr Hu Jia's case."
"The Commission would like to use this opportunity to urge again the Chinese Government to permit expressions of all forms of opinion."
"This is an important factor in how the international public views China, especially this year, when the eyes of the world will be on China in the build-up to the Olympic Games."
"We are convinced that a far more stable society can be achieved by allowing freedom of expression."
"Let me close by saying that the Commission will intensify its efforts to seek an improvement of the overall human rights situation in China."
"In this respect, we will continue to play an instrumental role within the troika in preparing the EU-China human rights dialogue and seminar so that discussions continue to become more target-focussed."
"Despite the slow progress in the human rights situation in China, we firmly believe that the EU-China human rights dialogue remains one of the most effective ways of engaging China in frank and detailed discussions with a view to achieving human rights reforms on the ground."
"- The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"2."
"Situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and rape as a war crime (debate)"
"- The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and rape as a war crime."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, sexual violence and rape in particular as a weapon of war is not, regrettably, a new issue."
"It is no minor issue that Articles 7 and 8 of the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provide that rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation or any other form of sexual violence are to be treated as crimes against humanity and war crimes, and will equal, in terms of treatment and persecution, torture or serious war crimes, whether or not they are committed during an armed conflict."
"The war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo shows to what extent this issue merits much more attention than has been paid to date."
"There have been tens of thousands of reports of rape or sexual assault annually in the region."
"Many of these incidents, moreover, take place at camps for displaced persons or refugees, and are frequently perpetrated by government troops, rebel groups or other forces."
"I thus consider it extremely important that this Parliament not only condemn these practices, but that it urge the authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to put an immediate stop to these practices, investigate, bring them to trial and secure convictions, and guarantee protection for the victims, witnesses and family members."
"We must also remind our own institutions that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 emphasises the responsibility of Member States to put an end to impunity, and pursue those responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes, including crimes relating to sexual violence or other kinds of specific violence against women."
"Madam President, European states brought tribes together in colonies in Africa that did not have good relations with each other, and divided other tribes by drawing boundaries right through the middle of their lands."
"The Democratic Republic of Congo, an enormous territory with a multitude of racial groups, was not given the opportunity to grow into independence by gradually building up self-rule during the Belgian colonisation before 1960."
"There was no preparation for decolonisation: it suddenly became inevitable after England and France had granted independence to their smaller neighbouring colonies at the end of the 1950s, partly as a consequence of the wars of liberation in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Kenya."
"Since then the Congo has been a permanent war zone."
"The early years were dominated by the conflict between Kasavubu from the west, Lumumba from the north-east and Tshombe in the south-east."
"They each represented different ideologies and interests but, more importantly, they were popular with limited sections of the Congolese population."
"The harsh military dictatorship of the profiteer Mobutu kept the country united for years in apparent peace, but the differences were never bridged."
"The most recent elections also failed to produce unity or good cooperation."
"The country remains a conflict zone with flexible borders, where, just as in the 1960s, it is about the demarcation of ethnic territories and control of mining areas."
"Foreign companies have benefited from this."
"The conflict now seems to be about which group among this multitude of tribal groups will dominate the others."
"As things are now, the future of the Congo seems to be without prospects."
"The atrocities to which the resolution refers, including the general lawlessness and frequent rape of women are all connected with this chaos."
"The 2006 law against sexual violence will not solve that problem, as long as the conflict continues and there are so many people without a permanent place to live."
"The resolution rightly makes reference to the role of government representatives, peace forces, aid organisations; their people should do everything they can to prevent such atrocities without becoming drawn into them themselves."
"Recognition of rape, forced pregnancy, sexual exploitation and other forms of sexual violence as war crimes by the European Union and the United Nations is a prerequisite, but removing the breeding ground for this violence will have to happen on the ground."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, I was in the Democratic Republic of Congo only three weeks ago, so my knowledge of the situation has not been gained exclusively from documents although the latter are very important."
"It used to be called Congo, then it became Zaire and now it is known as the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has experienced mass movements of its population far more frequently than name changes, however."
"The documents before us state that last year alone 400 000 of its inhabitants were forced to leave their homes. The total number of people forced to do in recent years is four times greater, amounting to 1.5 million."
"I should also refer to the use of rape as a weapon used deliberately for political purposes both by the partisans on the rebel side and by the police and the army on the government side."
"This is something unprecedented and the African Union is totally powerless to deal with it."
"Madam President, it is my strong impression that the words 'Democratic Republic' that form part of the official name of Congo ring rather hollow nowadays, because it is precisely in that country that one the worst humanitarian crises of recent years is unfolding before our very eyes."
"Over 650 000 people are constantly moving around the country. In just one province, Kivu, 80% of families have been displaced during the last five years, about 1 000 women a month are the victims of rape, and tens of thousands of children have become soldiers."
"In the Democratic Republic of Congo the passage of the armies is accompanied by all possible kinds of crime against the civilian population, such as rape, murder and pillage."
"Sexual violence is used to terrorise and punish the inhabitants of the Democratic Republic of Congo who supported the wrong side in the conflict."
"It is so widespread that, according to Médecins sans Frontières, 75% of all rapes in the world take place in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Rape is accompanied by barbaric torture such as beating with clubs and mutilation with knives."
"Many young women have been forced into sexual slavery."
"We should recall that the largest UN peacekeeping force in the world, consisting of over 17 000 soldiers, is currently deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"What is the main method of preventing sexual violence?"
"It is slogans on walls stating that rape is inhuman."
"The most alarming fact is that the UN soldiers themselves have become involved in this scandal."
"On more than one occasion, UN investigators have discovered that UN soldiers themselves have forced Congolese girls into prostitution."
"It has proved simply impossible to punish the soldiers concerned, however, because their unit leaders did all they could to impede the prosecution."
"The soldiers have perpetrated violence instead of protecting against it on more than one occasion, and these occasions are becoming more numerous."
"This can only be defined as a scandal."
"I would like to appeal to the international community to support immediate determined action aimed at identifying and punishing those responsible for crimes of a sexual nature."
"I should also like to emphasise that the countries sending military units into the field under the auspices of the UN are responsible for carrying out a proper investigation of any allegations of criminal behaviour by personnel involved in peacekeeping missions."
"I realise that the European Union's options regarding the resolution of conflicts of this type are limited."
"Nonetheless, I call for funds to be made available for the organisation of a peace conference in Kivu."
"European Union aid should also be channelled towards the provision of medical, legal and social assistance to all victims of sexual crimes."
"I trust the European Union and the UN will formally recognise that all types of crime of a sexual nature are crimes against humanity."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, the description of sexual violence in Kivu, Congo, produces an unavoidable feeling of revulsion."
"Our fellow Members have described what is going on there, and I do not intend to repeat it."
"We must not merely agree to condemn it, since this could make us a voice crying in the wilderness: we have to do something to stop it, and what we can do is put pressure on the Congolese Government, because it is not just the rebels, but also its armed forces, who are carrying out these kinds of atrocities, aimed at humiliating women and undermining the moral foundations of the society in which they live."
"We must make the United Nations and the European Union declare sexual violence a crime against humanity."
"We must ask the Commission to allocate development assistance funds to the Congo, fundamentally and as a priority as assistance for the victims: legal assistance, social assistance and medical assistance."
"We must make United Nations personnel on the ground consider defence of the victims and the search for those responsible priority tasks, and to do so we must extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to constitute a more direct link to the prevention of such occurrences."
"Finally, we must call on those attending the Kivu Conference to produce a set of specific results demanding justice and acceptance of responsibility, because if, after all that has happened, rapists finally enjoy impunity wearing the uniforms of the official army of the Republic of the Congo, the victims will be humiliated twice - first during the rape itself, and again when they see it was carried out with impunity."
"That is what we can and must do."
"I trust the Commission will take due note of this, and rechannel development assistance funds for the Congo, as I have requested, to assist victims and prevent the continuation of this savage butchery of the dignity of women."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, the text of the resolution before us contains alarming data."
"We should keep in mind, however, that behind these statistics lie the tragedies of individual women."
"I would like to tell the House the story of Lumo."
"She was the victim of a mass rape in 1994."
"The attack was so brutal that this young woman sustained permanent internal injures."
"After years of treatment and four operations she has still not regained her health and will probably never fully recover."
"She has been rejected by her fiancé, by most of her family and by society."
"Her mother and the African charitable organisation HEAL Africa have been her only support."
"HEAL Africa runs a hospital in Goma, which is the rape capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"The hospital specialises in treating the victims of brutal cases of sexual violence."
"The surgeons have been very successful, and so-called mothers provide psychological support for the victims."
"The House should commend these people on their work, but commendation alone is not enough."
"We need to consider how we can provide them with practical assistance."
"We owe it to Lumo and to the thousands of her Congolese sisters to help."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, with today's motion on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and on rape and violation as a war crime, we are calling on the European Union and United Nations formally to recognise rape, forced impregnation, sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence as a crime against humanity and as a form of torture."
"We are also calling for pressure to be put on the Congolese Government to bring an end to the situation in which these crimes are being committed with impunity."
"These measures are needed to improve the appalling situation in which hundreds of thousands of women find themselves."
"The violence being suffered by women in the Democratic Republic of Congo is unimaginable."
"In the province of Kivu more than one third of all women have been subjected to rape, and many have been violated repeatedly over long periods."
"This has been going on for many years."
"Most of the perpetrators are soldiers from both sides, members of the Congolese security forces and the police."
"The UN special rapporteur on violence against women submitted her report last September."
"The atrocities being committed by armed troops are of unimaginable brutality and are designed to ensure the complete physical and psychological destruction of women."
"The trauma of rape is aggravated by the fact that many of the victims then suffer social discrimination and ostracism by their families and communities."
"This is one of the reasons why only a fraction of the rapes actually committed are being reported."
"Echoing what my colleague Mr Fontelles has just said, we therefore want to see the UN mandate extended to include the protection of civilians against sexual violence."
"Reports of sexual misconduct by members of the UN peacekeeping mission must be looked into in greater depth and those responsible must be brought before a court."
"The Goma Conference on peace, security and development opened a few days ago."
"We urgently call on all the participants to tackle the problem of sexual violence against women and girls, to undertake to bring those responsible before a court and to end the current situation in which these acts can be committed with impunity."
"on behalf of the UEN group. - (PL) Madam President, we are today discussing rape as a war crime in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"It is ironic that this country should be named the Democratic Republic of Congo. Nowadays it seems that the more democracy is referred to in names and in speeches, the less human rights are enjoyed by ordinary people."
"I shall say once again that the only way to rein in African warlords who have been elevated to presidential office is on the one hand through economic sanctions, and on the other through armed intervention."
"Until the European Union creates a police force that would not, of course, intervene in every civil war but could at least supervise the camps, the so-called refugee camps where the very worst crimes are being committed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, all we will be able to do is continue debating the matter. People will continue to suffer and die whilst we debate endlessly."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the appalling mass rapes taking place in the Congo are being systematically organised and this means they are also being used as a military strategy, and that is not just war but sexual terror against women."
"The brutal rapes are now being used by each of the warring factions in eastern Congo, whether they are local tribal militia or national army soldiers, as a symbol or power and as a means of intimidation."
"It is precisely the weakest in society, namely women, children and even babies, who are being barbarously abused, deliberately injured, mutilated, infected with HIV and other infectious diseases and even killed."
"We know, and have heard, that the level of brutality exceeds the powers of human imagination and we now urgently need to see rape being condemned at long last as a crime against humanity, as a war crime and as a form of torture."
"Moreover, when the rape victims return traumatised and alone to their villages after painful operations - with many of the women losing all their genital organs - they find little or no shelter there."
"I can therefore only support the remarks made by Mr Borrell and Mrs Scheele: we must also use European money to set up women's dormitories that can serve as a kind of refuge for those returning from their stay in hospital, and where they can then try to build a new life."
"Indeed, in addition to the physical violence endured, the psychological violence that the victims have suffered is terrible beyond measure."
"We know that most of these attacks have been carried out by rebels, but almost one fifth of the recorded incidents can be attributed to government troops and police, and it is indeed shameful that not a single culprit has yet been arrested or even charged."
"The time for empty talk is therefore past."
"We need political action from the UN and the European Union, for if we ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, when I took the floor recently in a debate on sexual slavery in Japan during the Second World War, I also expressed my opposition to the brutal violence against women currently being perpetrated in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"According to Médecins sans Frontières, 75% of all rapes committed in the world take place in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This is all the more alarming because the violence is accompanied by particular cruelty."
"Armed groups use rape as a tactical method to break down resistance and punish ethnic groups. This is true not only of armed rebels but also of the Congolese army."
"Along with food shortages and disease, sexual violence and aggression on an unprecedented scale have contributed to turning that area into a hell on earth."
"We should remember that the inter-tribal rivalry stems from colonial times, when one tribe was favoured over the other."
"(PL) Madam President, the Democratic Republic of Congo is the largest country in Africa."
"It is rich in natural resources, such as water, tropical forests and agricultural land, but civilisation has long been in a state of collapse there."
"Over four million people have lost their lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo as a result of two civil wars, tribal conflicts, and the activities of armed groups and partisans."
"To compound the tragic situation of the people, there have also been mass deportations of citizens from their previous areas of residence, corrupt and inefficient governments, the AIDS epidemic and most recently the onslaught of the Ebola virus."
"How can these people be helped?"
"In addition to humanitarian aid and technical support, it is essential to deal with the leaders and organisers responsible for these horrific acts."
"They have been, and remain, unpunished and should now be excluded from Congolese society."
"Criminals responsible for genocide should be pursued by international special forces, so they can be tried before a court of law."
"(PL) Madam President, I do not wish to repeat what has already been said so I will simply state that as far as we are concerned there can be no question that aid must be provided. Hopefully the aid will be as substantial and widespread as possible."
"I would also like to say that when I was in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the elections, I was shocked to discover that boys as young as 13 and sometimes even younger are taught two things: how to fight and how to rape girls even younger than themselves."
"That is no exception, however. The situation is similar in all factions."
"I therefore support Mr Borrell's statement that the funds and resources we have available should be directed to re-educating these young people, amongst other purposes. If these youngsters become set in their present ways, the only future they can look forward to is a life in gangs, committing rape and murder."
"Something has to be done with them."
"It seems we are being challenged to find a way to help these people change their attitude to life and to the opposite sex."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission remains extremely worried about the deteriorating human rights situation - especially about the widespread sexual violence - in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and strongly condemns all acts of violence against women."
"In the prevailing climate of violence and insecurity all the armed groups present in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, including elements of the national armed forces, are to some extent involved in the dramatic rise of these types of acts."
"In this context, it is important to promote the fight against impunity, but also to address the root causes of the problem."
"It ought to be noted that sexual violence in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo is embedded within the context of persistent conflict and violence in the region."
"Peace is needed for sustained security and stability, the two key elements linked to the prevalence of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"This is why the Commission, together with the EU Member States, has been continuously promoting a political solution for the crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo."
"The ongoing conference on peace, security and development in the Kivus, coupled with the recent agreement reached between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda in Nairobi in November 2007, could indeed represent a significant step forward in the process, while acknowledging that there are still many challenges ahead before a sustainable peace in the Kivus can be reached."
"However, these efforts are not enough and have to be complemented with active support to strengthen the capacity of the state in providing protection to its people."
"In this regard, the Commission works together with the Member States in strengthening the rule of law and the fight against impunity by supporting the security sector reform comprising the army, the police and the justice sector."
"I would like to reflect on some of the questions from Members and try to answer them."
"The Commission addresses, in particular, the problem of sexual violence and criminality through a multi-donor justice and rehabilitation project in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, focusing inter alia on building the capacity of judicial actors and reinforcing the provision of legal assistance to the victims of sexual violence."
"In addition, the Commission provides significant humanitarian assistance - roughly EUR 40 million per year - to the Democratic Republic of Congo, especially to Uturi and the Kivus."
"Our humanitarian and health programmes take into consideration the gender violence they mentioned, both from a creative and awareness-raising perspective."
"- The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"3."
"Egypt (debate)"
"- The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Egypt."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, I wish to begin by saying that this Parliament would be making a most serious mistake if it succumbed to pressure from those who prefer us not to discuss issues that could cause discomfort in certain countries, particularly when they denounce breaches of human rights."
"We have privileged relations with certain countries, such as those covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, with whom we must have a particularly clear dialogue and remind them that business cannot and must not ever be disassociated from respect for human rights, either here or there."
"The situation in Egypt merited some reflection, and the relations between Egypt and the European Union also obliged such reflection."
"Thus it is more than legitimate to denounce, as we are doing in this resolution, the persecution of a number of non-governmental organisations, particularly human rights organisations, that is currently taking place in Egypt, and to lend support to the campaign for freedom of association led by a number of social movements in the country."
"author. - (PT) Madam President, I too must point out that there are of course no borders or sacred places where human rights are not a fundamental concern."
"However, we must take into account the fact that we had the opportunity to observe the willingness of Egypt's Foreign Minister who came on purpose to the European Parliament, to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and who was ready to answer all the questions on human rights' infringements that were put to him."
"I was there and I put these questions to him and obtained some answers from the Minister."
"In addition to certain negative factors, this motion for a resolution also highlights certain positive factors that I feel are important to stress, such as the undertaking to lift the state of emergency this year, in fact within the next few months, and the cooperation in the fight to end the arms smuggling in Gaza."
"However, in my opinion, the fundamental point is that we should take advantage of the willingness of the Egyptian authorities and encourage them to rectify certain serious infringements."
"I must highlight in this respect the continued imprisonment of the former candidate for the Presidency of the Republic of Egypt."
"I would repeat the call for this situation to be brought to an end as this would be coherent with the basic principles of a country that defends human rights, as Egypt has repeatedly advocated and to which it is committed."
"Madam President, Egypt has no tradition of democracy."
"The young military men Nasser and Naguib, who overthrew the poorly performing regime of King Farouk over 50 years ago, brought hope for change and progress."
"Nasser gave his people pride and inspiration for the future; he was to put an end to their status as a backward and humiliated country."
"His successor, Sadat, gave them hope of permanent peace with their neighbour Israel, after a series of terrible wars."
"The current president, Mr Mubarak, does not offer any hope at all."
"He has become the symbol of the stagnation."
"His only service has been to organise stability with a hard hand, so that he can be seen in the outside world as an ally against terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism."
"However, he has no progress and no democratisation to offer."
"Oppositions are permitted selectively, but they do not have the normal latitude that is customary in a parliamentary democracy."
"Consequently, he is cultivating a breeding ground for internal conflict from both fundamentalists and democrats."
"Intolerance of religious minorities, including the large Coptic Christian minority who have been present in Egypt for centuries, is also on the increase."
"Long-term stability cannot be built on these foundations, where problems are not solved but covered up with violence."
"There is every reason for this critical resolution therefore."
"Sabotage of non-governmental organisations, intimidation of opponents, discrimination against minorities, arrests and torture and all the other failings on record lead us to fear the worst for what will follow the Mubarak regime."
"Egypt seems in many respects to have stepped back into the backwardness of the reign of King Farouk, 60 years ago."
"European relations with Egypt ought to contribute to bringing this situation to an end as far as possible."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, the progressive deterioration of the situation regarding respect for human rights in Egypt is causing increasing concern."
"Changes to the constitution have facilitated violations of human rights."
"On the pretext of the need to provide protection against terrorist attacks and in connection with the alleged problem involving the smuggling of weapons into the Gaza Strip, additional powers have been vested in the Secret Service."
"It is now easier for the latter to evade responsibility for the use of torture. Repression on the grounds of religious belief, arrests and prolonged detention without proper trial are being resorted to ever more frequently."
"Organisations like Amnesty International, which monitor respect for human rights, have drawn attention to the international community's indifference towards the situation."
"I call on the European Commission to consider effective methods of bringing pressure to bear on the Egyptian authorities in order to halt this process."
"author. - (CS) Madam Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Egypt is without doubt the most notable of the Arab countries."
"It is the cradle of ancient civilisation and it is the most important Arab state."
"Nobody in the European Union or in this Parliament doubts that Egypt is not only a key partner of the European Union, but also a dynamic partner, prepared and strong."
"These are the reasons why we consider a dialogue with this country very important and significant."
"New negotiations are starting next week on an action plan between the European Union and the Arab Republic of Egypt."
"It is good that our Parliament is unanimously and clearly expressing its support of these negotiations and that it is thus a player in international politics."
"We are stating clearly that a country that allows severe interference in the independence of an old democratic institution, i.e. the courts, that permits torture in prison and the killing of immigrants, that violates freedom of speech, blocks the Internet and sends members of parliament, such as the nephew of President Sadat, to a court martial, cannot be a partner of the European Union."
"Egypt is a key ally in the fight against terrorism, and it must remain a key ally notably in our struggle against the causes of terrorism and Islamic radicalisation."
"For that very reason, Egypt cannot act the way it did when it prohibited the registration of non-governmental organisations, it must not destroy freedom of speech and it must in particular defend the long-standing rule of law that has always existed in Egypt."
"We believe that Egypt can succeed in doing this and we believe, in particular, that our resolution will help the European Commission to establish a high-quality action plan with Egypt."
"Thank you for your support."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I am one of the few people here in this Chamber who was present when President Sadat gave his famous speech in the European Parliament."
"This speech could be taken as a policy document for the Year of Intercultural Dialogue that has just begun."
"It was one of the greatest speeches ever made here in this House."
"Down through the years President Mubarak too has been an important and reliable partner for the European Union, and this is of course in spite of the many failings and mistakes that we have seen in Egypt."
"I therefore simply cannot understand the speech that the President of the Egyptian Parliament made in reaction to this motion."
"We are simply saying in a reasonable and restrained way that we consider Egypt to be one of the most important partners in the Mediterranean area, but we are criticising by way of a number of specific points and using categorical facts that some things still have to change as Egypt moves forward towards democracy and the rule of law."
"This is our commitment towards our own citizens and towards the people of Egypt."
"I certainly believe that breaking off relations, which is now being threatened, would be completely the wrong move. We need to keep talking to one another and for this reason I support this motion for a resolution, which has been drafted in reasonable language, and call on the Egyptians not to see this as a breakdown in the dialogue but as a clear signal for a more intensive dialogue to start: that is what we are trying to achieve with Egypt by way of this motion."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to refer to two issues in the course of today's debate on Egypt, and I am sure one of them will have been raised already in the House."
"Whilst I believe that our relations with Egypt should be maintained and developed, and that Egypt should indeed become our main partner in that part of the world, I would like to begin by pointing out that Coptic Christians are second-class citizens in that country."
"This is true both of those who follow the Orthodox rite and those who follow the Catholic one, and should be borne in mind when making contact with Egypt."
"In addition, as I have already said on repeated occasions, we should study the situation of the religious minorities in that part of the world and prepare a report on the subject."
"Secondly, there can be no talk of lasting peace, democracy and respect for human rights in the area in question until a solution is found to the conflict between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East."
"Therein lies the source of all that force, violence, terrorism and fanaticism that is also threatening Europe."
"(PL) Madam President, I should like to express a degree of satisfaction, in that as we debate the case of Egypt today, we do not have to refer to regular crimes."
"In general, during the debates on human rights on Thursday afternoons, when I usually take the floor, we find ourselves discussing extremely serious and dangerous cases indeed. They tend to be cases of violation of human rights, murder and rape."
"Today, however, we can feel a certain satisfaction because in comparison to so many other cases, we are intervening in Egypt at a stage when crimes have not yet taken place, although fundamental freedoms are being infringed. There is a chance that this timely intervention will therefore be more effective and will pre-empt more serious consequences."
"The usual pattern is for the first stage to be restrictions on the media - in this case we are referring to the arrest of journalists - and restrictions on the right of association. We also have in mind the trade unions and persecution of religious minorities."
"The next stage is the criminal one. Fortunately that stage has not yet been reached in this instance."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is paying close attention to the democratic and human rights situation in Egypt, which is one of our partners in the European neighbourhood policy."
"It is following developments very closely through our delegation in Cairo, and in partnership with the Member States."
"It is also in regular contact with local and international NGOs dealing with human rights and democracy."
"The Commission shares your concern at the apparent deterioration of the human rights situation in Egypt, and at the number of reported cases of human rights violations, particularly in relation to freedom of expression, torture and ill treatment, as well as respect for religious minorities."
"It has called for greater political reform, and respect for human rights is an intrinsic part of the EU partnership with Egypt."
"The Commission is, therefore, using all the means at its disposal to encourage the Egyptian authorities to progress in this area."
"As a member of the UN Human Rights Council, Egypt has committed itself to upholding 'the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights'."
"The EU consistently raises the importance of respecting human rights - notably on the basis of Article 2 of the Association Agreement - in its bilateral contacts with Egypt, including those at the highest level."
"With the adoption of the joint EU-Egypt action plan, under the European neighbourhood policy, in March 2007, we now have another political tool to foster respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Egypt, based on what we understand to be shared values."
"The action plan provides for the establishment of a formal and regular dialogue on human rights and democracy in the context of the Subcommittee on Political Matters: Human Rights and Democracy, International and Regional Issues."
"That subcommittee aims to facilitate dialogue within a context of mutual understanding, and respect for the positions of both parties, on all aspects of human rights and democracy, international and regional issues, in a comprehensive and non-exclusive way."
"It will convene for the first time next week - 23 and 24 January 2007 - in Cairo, and will be a constructive way for Egypt to demonstrate commitment to shared values."
"The Commission firmly believes that the dialogue with Egypt within the framework of the political arrangements set out in the Association Agreement and in the ENP action plan is the most effective way to impress upon the Egyptian Government the EU's concerns regarding respect for human rights and international law."
"The Commission remains committed to contributing to Egypt's reform process through financial and technical assistance, and support for political reform, human rights and democracy remains a priority in the national indicative programme 2007-2010, and under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights."
"I am sure the European Parliament will be a strong ally in support of these efforts."

"(DE) Madam President, I would like to thank you especially for having read out the names of those who this morning alleged that there was no democracy in this House because they have not had a chance to speak."
"If you look across to the benches of those who have been loudly demonstrating and complaining that there is no democracy you will see that they have not even taken the time to stay until the end of the sitting."
"They themselves are hardly a role model for Europe."
"I would ask that this be specifically recorded in the Minutes."

"Proposals on energy and climate change (debate)"
"The next item is the statement by José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, on the proposals on energy and climate change."
"President of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I apologise for the slight delay."
"As you know, we have just concluded our Commission meeting, and the first thing we did immediately after it was to come here to present what we believe is an historic package for the European Union."
"That is the reason why I, together with the Commissioner for the Environment, Mr Dimas, and the Commissioner for Energy, Mr Piebalgs, have only just arrived."
"The final drafting of the document is being completed."
"We will have it immediately, but this is a very important occasion to present to you first-hand the conclusions of our meeting today."
"I should like to start by saying that we are very happy with the result."
"The result was obtained by consensus in the College, with strong backing from all the Members of the Commission for a very ambitious proposal, because we have agreed what is now the most comprehensive package in terms of climate action and renewable energy that exists in any part of the world."
"We believe we have reason to be proud of it."
"This package on climate action and renewable energy meets the challenges of the future."
"We believe it is good for our planet; it is good for the European economy; it is good for our citizens."
"The work of the European Union is sometimes seen as rather technical: interesting to specialists, but not relevant to people's daily lives."
"The action we are discussing today proves this theory wrong: the struggle against climate change and the quest for secure, sustainable and competitive energy touches every European every day."
"We are all affected by this, and this is one of the most - if not the most - important challenge of the 21st century."
"Europeans ask for a vision and a plan of action."
"That is what we are doing now."
"This vision was set out last year with leadership from the European political community."
"It was agreed in the European Council, following a Commission proposal, to bring about the '20/20/20 by 2020' goals: a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases, or 30% if other developed economies agree, 20% of energy use through renewables and a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020."
"This was agreed by the European Council."
"We can be proud that Europe is leading that effort."
"We then brought it to the Heiligendamm Summit, to the High-Level Event at the United Nations in New York and finally to the Bali Conference."
"Without strong European leadership, we could not have achieved the promising results of the Bali Conference, setting a road map for the global agreement we are seeking and that we expect to reach in Copenhagen in 2009."
"The clear commitment of this Parliament to this cause has been essential, and I want to thank you, once again, for all your support."
"Your work over the past year has been critical in building the political momentum in favour of action."
"I believe that today's proposals match the goals that you have set out, as well as meeting the mandate given by the European Council last March."
"Today's package adds up to a detailed road map to bring about the political vision agreed last year."
"We have agreed on the vision and now we have to deliver on the concrete plans, the concrete instruments to achieve that vision."
"We believe that the main priority is to bring about a 20% cut in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and be ready, if necessary, to step up to 30% with an international agreement. Let us never forget that."
"This is about global warming; it is about global climate change and not just about climate change in Europe."
"We have to put our proposals in such a way that we bring others along with us. It is also important to lead by example and that is why, for instance, we are now proposing how to achieve the 20% of energy use through renewables by 2020."
"The package we have just approved in the Commission includes the following: an updated Emissions Trading System (ETS) to create a borderless ETS to drive cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from big industrial emitters; specific, binding national targets, so that Member States know exactly what they have to do outside the ETS, in sectors like transport, buildings, agriculture and waste; a new approach to actively promote renewable targets, again including binding national targets; new rules to stimulate carbon capture and storage, tomorrow's technology to cut emissions; and new state aid rules that take into consideration the specificity of the action needed in this environmental field."
"Part of our mandate was the 10% target for biofuels so that transport plays a part in emissions cuts."
"As you know, this 10% target was unanimously agreed by the European Council."
"I want to be clear that, in putting forward proposals on biofuels, we have also fully respected the other side of the mandate: the need for environmental sustainability."
"The proposal creates the most comprehensive and sustainable system anywhere in the world for the certification of biofuels and for domestic and imported biofuels alike."
"We will also continue to promote the rapid development of second-generation biofuels."
"It is important to understand that what we are promoting is sustainable biofuels and we are making a contribution to a global regime, because what we have today is a situation where, in many cases, biofuels are not sustainable and do not respond to our criteria - criteria we want to be implemented not only in Europe but throughout the world."
"The package of measures proposed today contains the most far-reaching legislative proposals to be made by the European Commission for many years."
"How did we set about shaping this complex package?"
"We spent a lot of time exploring options in great detail, but we always held firm to five key principles."
"First, respecting the targets."
"Without this, we will not look serious to investors, to our negotiating partners and, most importantly, to our own citizens."
"Second, fairness: recognising Member States' different capacities to invest and their different starting points."
"Third, competitiveness: designing a system able to minimise the costs to the European economy and, in some areas, improving the competitive possibilities of Europe by giving European industry and the European economy a first-mover advantage."
"Fourth, the proposals had to be designed to promote a comprehensive international agreement to cut greenhouse emissions, including stepping up our own effort to 30% emission cuts should other developed countries do the same."
"Last but not least, we must also start work now to halve global emissions by 2050."
"This means working today to bring tomorrow's technology rapidly on stream."
"This package should also be seen in articulation with some of our earlier proposals, namely the internal market for energy and the Energy Technology Plan."
"This is part of a very comprehensive set of proposals that is creating, for the first time, a real European energy policy, but we want this energy to be secure and also sustainable."
"Of course, there will be those who say that change comes at too high a cost and that we have no choice but to bury our heads in the sand and hope for the best."
"I think they have got this wrong."
"There is a cost, but the cost is manageable."
"We have worked very hard on coming up with the right design to meet Europe's ambitions in the right way."
"So the additional effort needed to realise the proposals would be less than 0.5% of GDP by 2020."
"This amounts, on average, to about EUR 3 a week for each European citizen."
"This is much less than the up to EUR 60 per week that is the cost of inaction."
"Going on even the most optimistic assumptions of the Stern Report, the cost of inaction is more than 10 times what we are now proposing."
"It is true there are some costs, but we have to compare the cost of this package with the cost of inaction and, since the cost of inaction is much higher, we can say that there is a relative gain in having this package."
"In fact, every day the price of oil and gas goes up, the real cost of the package falls."
"Instead of costs, we really should be talking about gains for the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"The package is hard-wired to reach our goals in an efficient way, using the market to drive change where it is most cost-effective and ensuring a level playing field while leaving as much as possible to Member States"
"We have paid particular attention to fairness."
"We have, therefore, designed the proposals to ensure that the demands on the poorer Member States are realistic: all will contribute, but in line with their capacity to invest."
"At the level of business, we all know that there are sectors where the cost of cutting emissions could have a real impact on competitiveness with companies in countries that do nothing - or do very little - in the fight against climate change."
"There is no point in Europe being tough if it just means production shifting to countries allowing a free-for-all on emissions."
"An international agreement is the best way to tackle this, but we also need to give legal certainty to companies that we will take the action needed."
"Energy-intensive industries will have ETS allowances free of charge if there is no global or sectoral agreement."
"If our expectations for an international agreement are not met, we will look at other options, such as requiring importers to obtain allowances alongside European competitors, as long as such a system is compatible with WTO requirements."
"I am making this point specifically, because it is very important that this package and the measures that the European Union will adopt are not in favour of the environment and against the economy."
"No, they are not only for the environment and our planet but also for our economy and for the competitiveness of the European economy."
"We want industry to remain in Europe."
"We do not want to export our jobs to other parts of the world."
"(Applause)"
"Fairness is also important at the level of the citizen."
"We are encouraging Member States to act in a sensitive way, such as using a share of the billions of euros to be gained in auctioning revenues to help the less well off to invest in energy-efficient homes."
"But we must not forget the huge economic opportunity represented by Europe's transition to a low-emissions economy."
"Europe's leadership also means showing that the technology is there, that we will need an effective and competitive industrial sector up to the challenge."
"There are real opportunities there."
"The renewables sector alone will bring one million jobs by 2020 at least, according to our estimates."
"I am sure that, once again, European industry will show its ability to innovate and adapt."
"Europe can be the first economy for the low-carbon age."
"We must seize this chance."
"This package represents an opportunity for Europe to show itself at its best: tackling an issue of fundamental long-term importance; using the European Union's continental scale to best effect; turning political consensus into practical action."
"If some people in Europe have doubts about the need for a European Union, then these are exactly the kinds of policy that show why we need a strong European Union more than ever."
"(Applause)"
"This is precisely where we can demonstrate to the most sceptical that, alone, our Member States - even the biggest Member States - do not have the scale or the leverage to push the agenda forward."
"But Europe, if it is determined to lead, can do it."
"So, apart from the environmental aspects, apart from the economic aspects and apart from the very important geopolitical and security aspects - because let us not forget that we are speaking about security of supply, and we do not want to be dependent on regimes that are not our friends - it is also a great argument for European unity."
"It is also a great argument to show not only that we need a strong European Union, but also that the world needs a strong European Union to lead the global efforts to face the global challenges of the 21st century."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, today is an historic day."
"It is a day that will influence our way of living and thinking, what we do and what we do not do."
"Without wishing to denigrate its other merits, this Commission will undoubtedly be remembered in the future as the Commission that enhanced European integration with a new dimension, as the Commission that established the package on climate and energy."
"It is a plan whose foundations were laid during the German Presidency under the impetus of Chancellor Merkel and that we in the PPE-DE Group have always supported."
"Europe is making it clear today that we are not afraid to take responsibility in the area of energy and climate and that we can act as a global pioneer."
"It now falls to us to reconcile ambition and feasibility."
"Let us not deceive ourselves, ladies and gentlemen: accomplishment of the 20/20/20 goals will in the short and medium term demand difficult decisions of us all, and will require great efforts from everyone concerned and to have even agreed on them is a significant step forward."
"Mr President of the Commission, the action plan you have just outlined is a well-considered one."
"The PPE-DE Group supports your five key principles, but as the responsible Group we naturally need the flexibility to examine whether each proposal put forward by the Commission is fair and feasible for every Member State and for the sectors that will be most affected."
"In order to succeed, a comprehensive approach is indeed required, allowing our ambitious energy and climate targets to be reconciled with our objectives in the areas of economic growth and employment."
"At the same time Europe must secure our energy supply and become self-sufficient."
"The PPE-DE Group supports the differentiated approach."
"We know that we will now be bombarded with questions suggesting that it be toned down."
"It is also our responsibility to listen carefully to the comments from the national and regional authorities and from a cross-section of society."
"Nevertheless, our starting principle is that it is not the one who shouts the loudest who goes the farthest."
"We must strive for a differentiated approach based on transparency, objectivity and fair criteria, and do so on the understanding that it costs more not to act than it does to act wisely."
"In addition to our mutual solidarity, the geographical and economical capacity of the Member States must be the primary consideration when dividing up the cost."
"The measures already taken and industrial capacity for future innovation must also be taken into account."
"Under no circumstances can renounce these principles."
"The PPE-DE Group's final assessment must deliver a win-win situation."
"On the one hand, we must fulfil our climate objectives, and on the other hand, we must maintain a successful economy in order to create jobs."
"If the balance sways to one side we risk losing both, for instance if the economic sector were to move to areas where there are not even CO2 limits."
"Finally, the PPE-DE Group understands that it is vital for Europe, but also for the rest of the world, to succeed in breaking their energy addiction."
"The time has come to learn how to consume on a large scale in a low-carbon manner."
"All of us - employers and citizens - must turn things around."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, may I express my warm thanks to the President of the Commission and to the Commission for the work they have done."
"Reference has already been made to the fact that the right environmental and economic objectives have been set and are being pursued."
"In implementing the package, as the previous speaker said, we must take a careful look at specific points."
"You know, Mr Barroso, that we are very sceptical about biofuels as far as the current state of the art is concerned."
"We need to invest far more in research and development - and this applies to the next few budgets too - if the second generation is to become a reality in the shortest possible time and tip the balance decisively in favour of a cleaner environment."
"It is absolutely crucial that the use of biofuels should demonstrably constitute a net gain for the environment."
"As far as emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases are concerned, many will say - and I agree with them - that a 20% reduction is not enough to guarantee the achievement of the goals to which we aspire in the struggle against climate change."
"On the other hand, I wholeheartedly subscribe to your argument that there is no point in Europe going it alone and taking all the risks while others stay on the sidelines, unwilling to join in, for we have no wish to export dirty technology and jobs."
"We want to develop clean technology in Europe and to export it too, so that we can maintain a clean global environment together."
"That must be our aim."
"(Applause)"
"That, Mr Barroso, is why we need transparent and coherent international agreements and why we need them as quickly as possible."
"Should that goal prove unattainable, we are in favour of giving some thought of our own to the matter."
"This, I believe, is an area in which the Commission has been too hesitant."
"I certainly agree that the decisions need not be made until later, but I do believe that now is the time to think about what we do if international agreements do not materialise."
"Will there then be import levies?"
"These, of course, would have to be WTO-compliant."
"Would we perhaps think about introducing a CO2 tax after all?"
"That idea has already received some consideration in the Council and the Commission."
"Whatever else we do, we must exert heavy pressure to ensure that both the environmental and economic dimensions are taken into account."
"While I do not take every chorus of protest from industry at face value, consideration must be given to the legitimate interests of industry and labour."
"You said that will happen."
"We shall have to keep an eye on that in the legislative process."
"What we really must achieve, Mr President and ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, is what we managed in the case of REACH, namely an alliance not only of environmentalists but also of industry and labour that is designed to reconcile their respective interests."
"REACH offers a good example of such an alliance."
"Mr Sacconi and many others played their part in ensuring that this Parliament and this Commission brought the REACH framework to fruition."
"The environmental goals must guide us, but at the same time we must give due consideration to economic issues with a view to safeguarding clean industry and a clean economy in Europe."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Liberals and Democrats welcome this package."
"We believe it to be the most important act of Mr Barroso's Commission thus far."
"Climate change is the greatest challenge facing life on our planet, the biggest problem facing our governments, and a gnawing worry for our citizens."
"I am grateful to Mr Davies and Ms Ek for the work they have done within my group to make sure we have a firm and early response."
"It is important for the Commission to take action."
"National democracies are too often run by crisis management. Problems are not tackled until they have to be tackled, and sometimes action comes too late."
"California's scientists warned us 30 years ago about climate change."
"We can no longer prevent it, but we can hope and strive to control it."
"Your proposals, President Barroso, recognise the overwhelming urgency of action."
"They will be hotly contested."
"Some will argue that they will hit profits; others will argue that they will hit jobs, and we have heard hints of both."
"No doubt you have had heated discussions in the Commission."
"My group argues they can add to profits and to jobs and give our economy a new competitive edge."
"They are, in any case, essential to responsible stewardship of our planet and we will work with you to secure agreement on them as early as possible."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, we have been waiting for some time to see the benefits of this legislative package."
"Maybe the dream is coming true now."
"Maybe targets will be laid down for a reduction in CO2 and an increase in renewable energy."
"Member States will undoubtedly face a challenge. But that, in fact, is what they are already facing."
"This legislation will stabilise the market, especially the business and science market, provide certainty for investors, and promote wind energy, solar energy, hydroelectric power, and biofuels."
"Overall it will help to protect the environment from climate change."
"As regards biofuels, Parliament maintains that they will not worsen the problem of CO2."
"The target is perhaps 10% too high."
"We shall have to ensure that the legislation enables food supplies and shortages to be kept under review."
"Member States will need to take a flexible attitude to the disparities existing from one country to the next."
"The legislation must, however, be viable."
"I welcome the Commission proposals on second-generation bio-energy, but we should start to focus on the third generation now."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner Dimas, do you still remember Bali?"
"I am sure Mr Dimas does."
"That is where the European Union virtually epitomised the international approach to combating climate change, where it stood for international solidarity and sustainability."
"It was a wonderful feeling."
"I was often proud of you, Mr Dimas."
"I was even proud of the German Environment Minister."
"It reminded me that the European Union is capable of regaining the support of its citizens by leading a truly efficient campaign against global climate change."
"Public approval, however, is very easily squandered, Mr Barroso, especially when there is an ostensible gulf between words and deeds."
"I have been reading a lot about the debates in the Commission."
"Unless you persevere with a hard line in your proposals on emissions trading, I believe you will destroy a very important instrument."
"If clean coal remains dominant and a covert campaign is waged for nuclear power, if the main focus is on biofuels rather than a different transport policy, if energy efficiency - the priority of priorities, Mr Piebalgs - is increasingly neglected, we shall remain helpless in the face of climate change."
"(Applause)"
"The onslaughts mounted by European industry against the proposals are intolerable."
"After all, it is the free market that has caused this climate problem."
"It was not China and India that managed their resources wastefully and emitted far too much CO2 - it was us."
"The free market will not solve the problem."
"The free market must be regulated for the sake of protecting the climate."
"It goes without saying, given the associated burdens, that we shall have to talk about external protection."
"We are prepared to do that."
"We believe it would take ambitious proposals at the European level for us to make any headway in international negotiations on any issue, including external protection."
"We cannot go to Poznań with weak instruments."
"In Poznań and Copenhagen we shall have to take the lead again."
"I look forward to cooperating closely with you, Mr Dimas."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's decision to come and present its proposals to this House is significant."
"It is a positive sign that Europe takes the issue seriously and aims for the kind of fair response that we have helped to flesh out."
"However, for this very reason I wish to say, with all sincerity, that I have my doubts about some aspects of these proposals and cannot endorse them."
"I refer to the excessive share of biofuels, despite growing misgivings in many quarters."
"I refer to the risk that some people will be able to equate nuclear with a clean and renewable source of energy, which it is not."
"I refer to the over-reliance on carbon capture technology rather than other, better practices."
"Finally, I refer to the waivers on emission limits for polluting countries or sectors such as iron and steel."
"In this way we risk sapping Europe's credibility, rather than reinforcing it in a crucial phase like the one initiated by the Bali Conference."
"The ground rules were laid down in Bali for signing a post-Kyoto agreement."
"In order to achieve this - and we must - there will be a need for considerable political will and the capacity to construct a complex scheme, but also consistency."
"Political will means regarding climate issues as an acid test for Europe and for a different type of globalisation."
"Consistency means moving towards the 20/20/20: reduction of emissions, energy efficiency and use of renewable energy."
"We therefore need to identify a package of priority measures to be approved over the coming year, before Parliament is dissolved and new elections are held."
"Over and above the 20/20/20, the package must include measures on vehicles and aircraft that make the general reduction pledges credible, partly by means of vertical policies."
"To this extent, waivers in sectors such as iron and steel would be a big mistake."
"We also need to build in the complexity needed for a strong agreement, one calling for a new globalisation scenario based no longer on competition but on cooperation and technology transfer."
"In addition, it is crucial to explore novel ideas, such as Mrs Merkel's proposal on calculating per capita emissions, and to think about adjustments affecting in particular continents like Africa, which pollute less and are much harder hit by climate change."
"It is by this yardstick, the plight of Africa, that Europe's contribution and dedication will be judged."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, this is an important day for environmental and energy policy."
"I would like to thank the European Commission for this energy package that has been presented."
"This legislative package that we now have has built on the decisions taken last year to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"A characteristic of the proposals presented is that the various interests have not been registered, not even within the European Commission."
"In recent days we have all heard criticisms of the suggestions, particularly from energy-intensive industry."
"The amendments to the Emissions Trading Directive will certainly hurt various sectors."
"Nevertheless, I think that we must take steps now, even though it may be difficult."
"I also note with interest the proposed directive on carbon capture and storage."
"It would be wonderful if more renewable energy sources were found: up to 20% of energy by 2020, as we have been told."
"We must view take a critical look at the 10% target for biofuels."
"The sustainability criteria must have a clearly defined place in this directive."
"The Committee on the Environment will be the committee responsible for most of these proposals."
"This means that it has to be effective, but we are optimistic about the final outcome."
"In the coming months we will be hearing some strong criticism from the lobbies, but there will also be widespread support."
"We must stand firm and ensure that the legislative frameworks ensure responsibility and justice in everything and for everyone, but particularly with regard to the environment."
"(SK) Thank you, Madam President, Mr Barroso, and Commissioners Dimas and Piebalgs for the proposal you have presented."
"I see it as being of paramount importance for all of us and for the future of Europe."
"The Bali Conference in December last year laid the foundations for an international agreement on tackling climate change issues."
"The Bali Action Plan, the Bali Roadmap and the Adaptation Fund are challenges where the European Union must take the lead."
"After all, we need to admit that we have a certain degree of responsibility for the current state of climate change."
"It is logical that the developed and developing countries' targets will differ."
"China and India should receive a specifically set compensation for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"I am afraid, however, that unless the US starts taking this issue seriously our efforts will be in vain."
"The Bali Conference is not a successor to the Kyoto Protocol."
"Let us hope, however, that it will act as a stimulus for solving this issue."
"In particular, Mr Barroso, I welcome the second principle: fairness and recognising Member States' different starting points and different capacities to invest."
"Thank you again."
"(DE) Madam President, Mr Barroso, you will be aware that I am very attached to the economy, the environment and our common policy."
"You went a little further today in developing the vision outlined by Angela Merkel and the Heads of State or Government."
"The vision they set out last spring was perfectly apt. It came at the right time."
"Now, however, it has to be fleshed out, and in that respect you have not let the whole cat out of the bag."
"I have not heard too many figures today."
"I should like to hear some of those, because we want to solve this problem together with the interested parties, not in spite of them."
"The programmes you have presented over the past fortnight, along with today's programme, will drastically alter Europe's economic and industrial policies."
"It is for that very reason that I believe we need far more shoulders and must not rely solely on the main pillars."
"I must confess to a degree of disappointment, Mr Dimas, that waste-management policy, and particularly waste-disposal policy, does not play much of a part in this programme."
"In Europe we could reduce CO2 emissions by millions of tons for the benefit of our major export industries if only we were courageous enough."
"Have we not all learned in the last two years that we are facing far more than a climate problem?"
"In future we shall have a resource problem."
"Our children will ask us awkward questions, Commissioner, Mr President, if we do not adopt a bolder approach."
"We must, of course, play fair by companies and environmental organisations, and I strongly endorse the five priorities you have set."
"We cannot put our exporting companies into a straitjacket yet expect them to outperform their competitors."
"That is not possible."
"We have to get on with what needs to be done - to get butter on the fish, as we say in my dialect."
"As far as the emissions-trading system is concerned, it is, when all is said and done, the best-known and the time-tested system."
"We must learn from our mistakes, but we must keep it tight."
"We shall be doing no one any favours if we concede too much."
"It must be tight, and it must be fair."
"Then I shall be right behind you."
"The European Union should not be so terribly afraid of the subject of climate change."
"We should take it as an opportunity, an opportunity for our environment, for our industry and, in particular, for future generations."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would emphasise the significance of the fact that you, Mr President, decided to come and inform us in real time about the adoption of the package that has been so painstakingly put together; one might even say made to measure."
"Let us not forget that this package goes hand-in-hand with another decision that you adopted in December: I mean the proposal for a regulation on vehicles, which in a sense forms part of this package."
"I shall not comment on the content of the package itself, since I have the bad habit of judging texts once I am familiar with them and have examined and assessed all their details."
"We shall attempt to find out whether you have struck the right balance, or whether there is a need for any further fine-tuning or improvement."
"On the whole, it seems to me that the set of proposals corresponds to the principles and objectives suggested by both Parliament and the Council in recent months."
"I would however raise one political point - already alluded to by Mr Musacchio - which affects all of us."
"I agree with his verdict on Bali."
"The glass is neither half full nor half empty, but it was a major political success."
"Just three months earlier, no one would have bet even a cent on it."
"The EU confirmed its world leadership role on that occasion, yet its responsibilities have thereby been heightened."
"Our responsibilities have increased: we cannot go to Poznan and then Copenhagen with empty hands."
"We must go with facts."
"You have played your part by drawing up this package, but now it is up to the legislators - Parliament and the Council - to adopt it and translate it into binding standards."
"That will be no easy matter in the short time available to us."
"This legislative period has entered its final phase, rather as CO2 emissions should do in 2015, when they ought to peak before starting to fall, that is."
"We have already reached that ceiling."
"As a result, there needs to be some kind of informal agreement, a special working procedure, to ensure that most of this package is wrapped up before the end of the parliamentary term; otherwise we will be empty-handed when it comes to negotiating the Bali follow-up phases."
"This therefore affects Parliament, which must play its part by avoiding wherever possible conflicts of competence which waste months."
"It also affects the Council, which - as has happened in other cases - could embark on informal cooperation with us at a very early stage."
"However, it also affects you: you came along a little late today because you evidently had matters to discuss."
"If other dossiers that I have been involved in are anything to go by, it would be a good thing if the Commission could present a united front towards the outside world."
"Madam President, finally, we move from targets to tools!"
"I agree that this can be wisely managed - a win-win situation, where we can create a better environment, better opportunities for our children and more jobs in Europe."
"But it needs coherence in our management of different political areas - research policy, development aid, the common agricultural policy, energy policy and so on - and the first test of this will be at the spring summit with the Lisbon Agenda."
"Will the Lisbon Agenda at the Council in March reflect the energy and climate package?"
"That will be the first great test."
"There is also another test."
"We have only 13 months to bring along the decisions on this very important - maybe the most important - proposal: this mandate for the European Parliament, and the Commission, and the Council."
"Thirteen months to be able to deliver a European standpoint before the European elections and before the extremely important meeting in Copenhagen in December 2009."
"We all know that it is really important, we all know that it is imperative that we get there, and it is up to all of us individually to make it possible - and not impossible - to get a decision in April so that, unlike in the old Danish fairy tale, the Emperor does not stand naked when he goes to Copenhagen!"
"We also have to address energy poverty - it is not there enough - technology neutrality and the forestry issues, which have to be improved."
"This will be delivered, I think, in the parliamentary procedure in a very transparent and open way, as it is in Parliament."
"Finally, from tools to targets: it is our responsibility, and the ALDE Group will stand by you when it comes to a decision and deliver value for voters - finally!"
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has changed tack on two counts as concerns the energy and climate package, which unfortunately we know little about: keeping to the Kyoto pledges, and improving Europe's energy mix and supply."
"We particularly welcome the commitments to promoting the spread of renewable energies, greater flexibility in the authorisation of State aid for environmental actions, and the development of clean sources and technologies to curb emissions."
"However, the package contains some sensitive issues relating to the competitiveness of our firms."
"Mr Barroso himself has estimated the cost at some €60 billion."
"We will have to look at the impact of this burden."
"The plan for a system of auctioning quotas, estimated to cost around €39 per tonne of CO2, and for its extension to the transport and building sectors, is causing industry quite some concern and will probably affect final consumers."
"Given these gloomy forecasts, the Commission and especially the Member States will have to do their utmost to reduce the economic and social impact of the measures."
"I would stress that Europe's role as world leader in the struggle against climate change is unquestioned and unquestionable."
"We must bear in mind, however, that our international competitors in many cutting-edge sectors of the economy take the opposite view."
"To conclude, I agree with what President Barroso has said."
"We certainly must work hard to determine commitments and outcomes and give greater weight to the package presented to us."
"The package must not remain virtual but must be fair."
"Madam President, this Parliament has a vision of 21 different renewable energy technologies for the 21st century."
"With what the Commission is proposing today, we are taking a first step - 20% in 2020 - towards a Europe which will be run almost entirely and exclusively by renewables at the end of this century."
"This is millions of jobs for Europe; this is technology leadership; this is CO2 reduction, less dependency on gas and oil imports, more competition in an energy market which is dominated by the happy few and, therefore, I thank Mr Piebalgs for not having given in to the electricity lobby by killing the guaranteed price systems, because it is only guaranteed price systems that will allow small and medium-sized enterprises to invest in this market."
"Biofuels at 10% is a target which was imposed on policy by car makers and the sugar industry."
"You did not have the courage to drop it."
"We will have the courage."
"Lastly, I have a precise question for the Commission."
"We, as Greens, are in favour of protecting European industry against environmental dumping, but, Mr Barroso, there is a contradiction in what you have announced."
"If the European energy-intensive industry gets the allowances completely for free, how can you justify the fact that the Chinese steel company will have to pay for imports?"
"If our industry is completely off the hook, the WTO will never accept a scheme whereby those who import to our markets have to pay, so there is a fundamental contradiction in what you have announced, or at least you have to clarify this because, otherwise, you are cheating people."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioners, I agree with those speakers who have thanked the Commission for their good intentions."
"Nevertheless, we will come to learn that the devil is in the detail."
"With emissions trading, the price of emission rights in the EU's wholesale electricity markets will shift towards the price of nuclear and hydroelectric power, the production of which does not require emission rights."
"The auctioning of emission rights will not bite into these windfall profits, and in fact in the longer term it will increase the additional, excessively large profits of these electricity companies."
"Emissions trading favours the extension of nuclear power."
"Hopefully, the Commission has stuck to the view presented by Mr Piebalgs, that nuclear power is not a renewable form of energy."
"For the time being, it is impossible to say whether the package that has been presented is well-balanced among the Member States."
"The requirement to increase the proportion of renewable energy in the EU to an average of 20% may put the small countries, in which this percentage is already exceeded, and large countries, where it is currently 2-6%, in unequal positions."
"Madam President, nowadays, when the subject of climate change crops up, it is usually described as 'global warming'."
"Is this deliberate?"
"The only solution being put forward is to cut greenhouse gas emissions - that is, carbon dioxide - dramatically, because it is claimed that a 30% reduction will reduce the average temperature of the earth by 2° by 2020."
"Such an assertion is quite amazing when no reference to the effect the sun will have had over that period is taken into account, but, for the sake of this exercise, let us suppose that the so-called 'taxpayer-funded experts' are right."
"Climate change is precisely that: climate changes all the time."
"So, what if earth's climate decides to cool down instead of warm up?"
"Will it then be suggested that we must produce much more carbon dioxide to try and offset the cooling?"
"Of course not."
"They are so committed to their present 'global warming' prediction, that that would not be an option, but, sadly, it looks as if that is what is happening."
"For the last nine years since 1998, global temperature on earth has remained the same."
"For the past decade the world has not warmed."
"Global warming has stopped."
"That is not a viewpoint or a sceptic's inaccuracy, it is an observational fact."
"It is also a scientific fact that far more people die from being too cold than from being too warm."
"So, to sum up, if global warming has been just a temporary blip, and we are now heading relentlessly for the next ice age, any reductions in CO2 emissions will have precisely the opposite asserted effect to that which is intended."
"In the billions of years of earth's existence, a very brief pause to check the facts is surely not too much to ask."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I am concerned that the target to reduce the European production of CO2 emissions by one fifth in the next 12 years is an unattainable dream."
"Since 1990 we have not even succeeded in cutting it down by the 5% quota agreed in Kyoto."
"Let us take off the populist glasses and instead focus on the reality as described by scientists and experienced by citizens."
"Biofuels do not resolve the energy situation."
"On the contrary, biofuels cause food price increases, are responsible for water reserve problems and, due to deforestation, are themselves responsible for increasing concentration of the much detested CO2."
"They are simply a step in the wrong direction."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that we should concentrate on nuclear energy and rid ourselves of the fear of chain reactors."
"Reasonable governments such as the Finnish or British Governments have already begun to do so."
"Scientific findings show that nuclear energy does not produce CO2 and minimises further climate change."
"At the same time it is cheap, reliable, secure and it lowers countries' dependence on fossil fuels supplied by unstable territories."
"If we want to act in the interests of the citizens of the European Union, we should invest precisely in the field of atomic research, development and education."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the Commission and its President on the presentation and the proposal here and to welcome it."
"I come from a country where we have proved those goals are achievable - although we do not have very much sun anyway - but it is possible to achieve those goals."
"And now we are, as has been said today, making the overall goals into concrete actions and measures - that is good."
"I have three points."
"First, competitiveness needs sustainability - but sustainability needs competitiveness."
"If we are to be a competitive economy in the future, we need to have competitive energy sources, and that also goes for the renewables."
"We need to have competition between different renewables, not a regulated economy with subsidies for different renewables."
"We need to have fair and open competition, because then we will see the second and third generation of renewables emerge, and we will have good use of them."
"The second point is that high charges for some countries must not lead to less responsibility for other countries."
"I must say on that point I feel a little bit uncomfortable because, maybe, some countries are getting away a little bit too easily."
"We need to underline this because everyone needs to make those efforts."
"Thirdly, this is about renewables, but I would still like to underline the importance of nuclear power, not because I look upon nuclear power as one of the renewables, but it is my belief that, if we are to take full advantage and make full use of renewables, we must not get into a situation where the phasing-out of nuclear power consumes the achievements we can make in the fight against carbon dioxide emissions."
"We need both of them, and they will support each other."
"Those are my three points today."
"I welcome the proposal and presentation, and wish us all good luck."
"(FI) Madam President, Mr Barroso, renewable energy sources are not only a cost but also a process that creates jobs, innovation and competitive ability."
"This is a fact."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has not taken sufficient account of employment, and this is a central problem."
"What benefit is there if energy-intensive industry and the cleanest industry move to countries where there are no emission limits?"
"We must get more industrialised countries on board, and it is your duty to take care of this."
"As with the telecommunications sector, so with emissions trading has it been the case that those who have achieved the target level are being punished, just as Mr Hökmark said."
"At the same time, we are looking through our fingers at those who cannot be bothered to achieve the objectives in time or to make any joint decisions."
"No continuous progress can be made in this way."
"The Commission has not taken account of the starting level, the energy intensity and efficiency of the economy, the role of zero emissions, and so on. These are important factors."
"But, to close, I would say that cost-effectiveness is achieved through innovation, and it does not appear in the budgets of the Member States or of the Commission."
"It really ought to appear as a means of getting out of this situation."
"Madam President, no one ever said that meeting the challenge of global warming would be easy, but I am glad that the European Union here is taking the lead in trying to turn aspirations into practical policies."
"Numbers have been thrown about in an almost casual fashion - a lot of 20s by 2020 - and conjuring up these figures is easy, but the hard part is reaching the targets which are now being set."
"In my country, the United Kingdom, for instance, I am very conscious that it is going to take quite a dramatic change of direction and a very rough gear change to meet these targets."
"I think this new policy direction is long overdue, but I am conscious of the difficulties and the realities before us."
"I have two principal fears."
"The first is that governments will sign the pledge but fail to deliver, so I want to know how we are going to build in some sort of interim targets, some penalty structure, to ensure that the promises are delivered at the end of the day."
"My second fear is that, in trying to do good, we will do some harm."
"My biggest concern here is over biofuels."
"I hear the comments of the Energy Commissioner, but the idea that we could risk tropical forest destruction and force up world food prices in order to featherbed our car manufacturers is, frankly, sickening, and we must be very cautious indeed about the sustainability criteria."
"I do have concerns about the direction of our own budget."
"We promote schemes that stimulate CO2 emissions and it seems to me that we have to run faster just to catch up with ourselves."
"There are fine judgments to be made on many of these issues, but I know we are all working together towards a common purpose."
"This package of measures will promote innovation, stimulate investment and create millions of jobs."
"It must be seen not as a threat but as an opportunity for us all."
"(LV) Thank you, Madam President."
"I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for having initiated a debate on this important issue."
"Even though including emissions reductions and increased renewable resources in one document is logical in formal terms, I believe that it artificially increases political pressure on each task and robs the debates of clarity."
"I will therefore speak only about the issue of renewable resources."
"In the European Union there is currently a significant number of countries with positive results in this field."
"The relevant national governments must decide between the challenges of security of supply, economic competitiveness and climate protection."
"At the moment security of energy supply has taken on a particular importance, since oil and gas prices and security of oil and gas supplies are making the latter particularly fragile."
"There is no reason to believe that the EU Member States are unaware of this."
"While the establishment of common EU targets for an increased proportion of renewable resources is welcome, I do not believe that setting these at Member State level is something that we should embark on at present."
"It should be done following an evaluation of the specific circumstances of the Member States and local governments, taking into account not only economic factors but also social and cultural factors."
"It is particularly ironic that states who have already achieved a great deal in this area are being given additional ambitious tasks."
"I do not wish to underestimate the role of the European institutions, as they can add considerable value, such as in the area of liberalising gas and electricity, but renewable energy production should remain a national issue, since it is in the Member States that the majority of these issues have for a long time now been understood."
"(DE) Madam President, as long as energy-hungry emerging economies and energy-wasting industrialised nations do not turn more of their attention to the environment, all the efforts of the EU will not even suffice to make good the damage those countries have done."
"I also question the success of certificate trading with its covert development aid, which certainly will not reduce the total volume of emissions but might redistribute it at best."
"Austria has been the only certificate purchaser to date, spending EUR 280 million on certificates, compared with the mere EUR 20 million it invests annually in renewables."
"I therefore believe that, instead of using energy concerns as a pretext for accelerating Turkey's accession to the EU, it would make more sense to rethink the Union's relations with Russia in the light of the energy situation."
"The EU has numerous tasks on its energy agenda, not least the long-overdue application of fully developed forms of environment-friendly propulsion and energy technology, the elimination of water wastage, the abolition of support for transcontinental transport operations and increased pressure on the main agents of climate change."
"Madam President, I welcome this package in principle, but we must recognise that renewables and efficiency gains are a domestic EU asset, which yields benefits for us, both as a sustainable low-carbon economy and for security of supply."
"We must also recognise that renewables are not the free lunch that some people think: they do have costs attached, which include financial, environmental and inflexibility factors."
"I share President Barroso's determination that we achieve our targets without loss of global competitiveness and without exporting jobs and businesses."
"Whilst we are on the subject of targets, we must break with the past performance, where the EU has a dismal record in failing to meet targets."
"We can only agree to binding targets if they are achievable."
"I welcome the approach of market mechanisms, like the Emissions Trading System, but I hope we can improve the methodology and make it work better to achieve our aims."
"Finally, let me make the suggestion that we should resist the temptation to be technology-specific, we should resist being obsessive about renewables as the solution, when it is the objective of drastic emissions reduction that matters most and, therefore, we must use the full range of means available and not rule out any option."
"(DA) Madam President, Commission President, I am extremely pleased that we now have a legislation package in front of us, as this is of course the basis that will enable us to work towards achieving our targets and to demonstrate that the EU can do more than just talk about this."
"In fact we can actually deliver!"
"As rapporteur for the package in Parliament, I have placed an emphasis on the central role of national action plans."
"These action plans should be accompanied by interim targets, and I am pleased to see that the Commission has now included this in its proposal."
"This is central to ensuring that we get started now and do not suddenly find ourselves with unfulfilled targets in 2020."
"Parliament has also stressed the necessity of having an initiative in all three sectors - electricity, heating and transport - and I am also pleased to see that the Commission will require the Member States to set sectoral targets."
"However, I would rather have seen the social dimension given a more prominent role in relation to energy prices, food prices and local involvement, but these are just some of the areas that we will be working on further in Parliament."
"I would like to congratulate the Commission on the good result achieved today."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the presentation of this energy and climate change package."
"I fully agree with its priorities."
"In the Directive on the promotion of renewable energy sources, however, I think there is insufficient emphasis on the urgent need to promote technologies for converting biomass directly into gas."
"Such technologies have many applications, particularly owing to their overall efficiency as compared with conventional combustion."
"Another point I feel I must make concerns the directive on carbon dioxide storage."
"Financial aid seems to be directed first and foremost towards the coal and oil sectors."
"I cannot agree with this decision, given that there are other options for carbon dioxide capture in energy production processes, for example the use of microalgae in water."
"One last remark: if we really must use coal, then let us at least promote the technology for cleaner and more efficient conversion of coal into gas."
"Naturally I reserve the right to examine the final documents."
"(PL) Madam President, my remarks are addressed directly to Commissioner Dimas, whom I wish to accuse, at the very least, of incompetence."
"I am in possession of an open letter sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and signed by 100 distinguished scientists from across the world."
"I would like the Commissioner to study the final paragraph of this letter carefully, and will now quote from it: 'Attempts to prevent global climate change from occurring are ultimately futile, and constitute a tragic misallocation of resources that would better be spent on humanity's real and pressing problems'."
"Ladies and gentlemen, there are no scientific grounds for us to believe we are in a position to affect the cycle of climate change that is governed by changes in the sun's activity."
"On the basis of a study of ice samples, scientists have established that this cycle has continued over tens of thousands of years."
"Allocating hundreds of billions of euro to combating climate change amounts to an attack on human civilisation and common sense."
"I hereby accuse you of incompetence and..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Madam President, Members of the Commission, thank you."
"I welcome the Commission's efforts as regards both international cooperation and internal legislation."
"The Commission can always count on the support of Parliament in this regard."
"It is a good feeling to see that Europe is taking a leading role in the third industrial revolution."
"I am convinced that the resulting technological innovation will help to enable developing countries to realise their legitimate demands and mitigate the pollution load caused by our own growth."
"The greatest danger within the European Union, however, is the lukewarm and reluctant attitude of some Member States, which is jeopardising implementation of these ambitious plans."
"However, the Commission is also guilty of this, as it routinely turns a blind eye to lack of compliance on the part of Member States."
"Let me give you a personal example: while Hungary was a candidate for accession to the EU, the Commission obliged us to comply with every last provision of the legislation, but now that we are a Member State, anything goes."
"This is not fairness; this is opportunism."
"You spoke of energy-efficient homes: two years have elapsed and Hungary has not introduced the Directive on the energy certification of buildings."
"The Commission, it seems, does not require this."
"Hungary spends a mere fraction of the money it receives from the EU on energy efficiency and energy-saving measures."
"The Commission does not oblige it to do so."
"I ask you, how will it be possible to achieve the goals set by the Commission if the Commission itself [...]"
"(FI) Madam President, Members of the Commission, despite the speeches of a few sceptics, we do have time to put our decision of March into practice."
"In debating the proposals that have been tabled today, both in the Council of Ministers and in the European Parliament, we must bear in mind our own commitments, of which the most important is that we take care, that our objective is achieved when we decide all the details, in other words that the global temperature does not rise by two degrees in comparison with the pre-industrial era."
"This must be the conclusion when we debate these individual legislative proposals, because it is the only way in which we can achieve change."
"This change, which is important for environment policy, also means change in our industrial production."
"It is clear that some sectors will suffer, but there are many sectors that will win."
"I think we have to invest in the sectors that will win."
"Europe will thus be able to take this leadership forward and create jobs on its own territory and, at the same time, create a win-win situation with global solutions."
"I do hope that we will also be able to demonstrate a strong commitment so that our solutions for biofuels give a strong signal and incentive for us to develop truly durable products to replace the current fuels."
"(IT) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I fully endorse the thrust of what Mr Barroso has told us today about the Commission's proposal."
"This is a major challenge for Europe that can be postponed no longer."
"The proposed targets, and in particular the 20% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2020, are achievable in spite of the many difficulties to be overcome."
"However, a joint commitment by all countries will be required for an energy policy capable of tackling the emergency that is climate change and freeing Europe at long last from its dependency on imports and, consequently, from continuous rises in energy prices."
"Issues relating to security of supply and renewable energy sources should also be highlighted."
"All of this necessitates a programme on the diversification of energy resources."
"Greenhouse gas emissions can be cut through the use of nuclear energy, clean coal and low carbon-emitting renewable energies."
"Efforts should in particular be focused on research into nuclear ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Madam President, I join with the majority of speakers in acknowledging the importance of this energy and environment package."
"I also believe that it will be a new major step in increasing the role of Europe in the fight against climate change."
"I would like to mention two of the five principles mentioned by the President of the Commission: fairness and competitiveness."
"I should like to express my satisfaction with the fact that the Commission has taken into account the position of countries like mine, Bulgaria, especially as far as trade outside the Emissions Trading Scheme is concerned and with regard to specifying targets for renewables."
"As far as competitiveness is concerned, however, a lot has to be done in order to make the Commission's proposals more precise and, in the absence of a possible future agreement, we should be very careful regarding countries like Bulgaria and the energy mix, so that the possibilities for further developing energy and industry are preserved on the basis of achievable targets and at an achievable price."
"(DE) Madam President, may I express my thanks to the President of the Commission for making it crystal-clear in his introductory words that the cost of inactivity or insufficient activity on the part of the EU and its Member States would be at least five times that of the package presented here today."
"I should like to associate myself with the speakers who have emphasised the importance of renewable energy sources, and I am pleased to see that the Commission does not regard nuclear generation as a renewable - not that there was ever any question of that."
"Let me also underline the importance of energy efficiency and of the measures that remain to be taken in pursuit of that goal, because all studies have shown that energy efficiency is the most economical way to fight CO2 emissions."
"I must stress that I am extremely sceptical about CO2 storage and that I am opposed to a binding 10% quota for biofuels."
"As one who works in the field of development policy, I should also like to say that I keenly await the Commission's proposals as to how more projects in the framework of the Clean Development Mechanism can be taken to the poorest countries of our planet, for we all know that the poorest countries suffer most from the effects of climate change."
"(FR) Madam President, President Barroso has set us an ambitious target for the production of renewable energy, with a view to reducing greenhouse gas emissions without hindering our prospects of growth."
"However, this is where I have a difficulty with the Commission: it wants to use the GDP of each state for its calculations, and I do not believe that that is adequate."
"I believe that the overall emission reduction effort of each Member State by 2020 should be determined on the basis of the starting level of emissions per inhabitant, without prejudice, of course to the solidarity mechanisms between states."
"In other words, we need to take into account the overall proportion of non-carbon energy used by each state."
"In short, we must not confuse the end with the means."
"The guiding idea is naturally to reduce greenhouse gases and facilitate the 'decarbonisation' of the economy, as underlined in the Council conclusions of March 2007."
"(NL) Madam President, today we are seeing the outcome of Europe's climate ambitions."
"I feel that the proposals sit well together, but sadly the targets are too low."
"In Bali it was decided that a reduction of 25-40% by 2020 is necessary to save the climate."
"Suddenly the European Union's commitment looks a little on the weak side."
"That is a poor signal to send to the rest of the world, and so Bulgaria and Romania, among others, still feel that they can raise their emissions quite considerably."
"As far as I am concerned, this is not a good idea."
"It gives China and India little reason to reduce their emissions."
"It would be better if all the richer countries in the European Union helped countries like Bulgaria and Romania to lower their emissions."
"That is a better way to achieve global credibility."
"Sadly, the modification of the Emissions Trading Scheme has been somewhat watered down under pressure from the industrial lobby."
"It is a pity that the Commission developed weak knees and reduced the rights of the energy-intensive industry to sell shares at auction."
"Certain countries do indeed work this way at an international level, but it would be much better to put a fair system in place and establish border levies."
"Madam President, I welcome the announcement of this most important package and look forward to the legislative debate that will follow."
"I think it is timely to remind those, especially in my own country, who are rightly exercised about global warming, climate change and greenhouse gas emission increases and who have concerns, on the other hand, about ratifying the Lisbon Treaty - or the Reform Treaty, as we underline - that the environment and climate change are specifically included in the Lisbon Treaty as distinct from the past Constitutional Treaty: a most important point to underline."
"Following Bali, it is clear that Europe, as a Union of 27 Member States, has the capacity and the ability to lead the world on this most critical of issues - climate change - with this package at its centre."
"Bali produced a road map for global agreement by 2009, recognising the urgency for clear and transparent international agreements - I have borrowed President Barroso's words - to ensure at least a 50% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020."
"And while remaining competitive is ever pressing, we cannot solve our numbers and targets by exporting jobs through relocation to regions which have no legislation to reduce greenhouse gases ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) Madam President, the programme the Commission is proposing to us, in terms of meeting the targets in order to ensure our credibility, calls on each of us to do what we can, to rise to this challenge and turn it into an opportunity to become more competitive, proposing it in such a way that ensure that by cooperating we might all achieve this on a global level without wasting any time."
"It is, of course, a very encouraging programme full of fascinating challenges."
"One of those mentioned - and which I support - is the challenge of proposing energy sources that offer an alternative to nuclear energy."
"As far as the transport sector is concerned, I believe that it is a sector that presents a major challenge and I would therefore call on the Commission to make use of the instruments that are currently on the table, namely the Logistics Action Plan."
"Logistics, which are now becoming a factor of competition, should be one of the instruments used to apply intelligence to mobility and to enable us to find appropriate solutions to help reduce emissions."
"As regards the Galileo project, on which there has little progress since we did not see all of its potential, the applications in terms of achieving a reduction in emissions should present another challenge."
"Finally, I believe that the urban transport plan is now a real possibility."
"(DE) Madam President, I should like to refer once again to the role of transport as one of the main causes of climate problems and stress the need to make it the focal point of our action."
"As far as reducing transport emissions is concerned, the European Union has not exactly covered itself in glory."
"Now, however, we have a second chance."
"For example, we have the opportunity to make the social cost of transport operations fully reckonable by charging heavy goods vehicles for infrastructure use under the Eurovignette scheme and thereby shifting a greater volume of freight from road to rail, where emission levels are far lower."
"If we do not tackle the transport issue, we shall never have any prospect of achieving our climate targets."
"This applies especially to the countries at the heart of Europe."
"To make these Member States take action at long last to help reduce the volume of road traffic, we also need sanctions for those that cause further increases and are unwilling to reduce their traffic volumes."
"President of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Members for the general line of strong support for our proposals."
"I understood correctly that this House is very committed to this very important matter and sees it as one of the most important challenges, if not the most important, for our generation."
"I would like to thank you for that."
"We were asked to come here immediately after our meeting, so we cannot yet have an in-depth discussion, but let me tell you that the Commission would be happy to participate actively in such a debate - myself, Commissioner Dimas, Commissioner Piebalgs and the other relevant Commissioners."
"We will be ready to discuss with you all details of this very important set of proposals."
"Let me start by saying that some of your comments were based on earlier work and not on the proposals that we are putting forward today."
"It is important to understand that the proposals are the ones adopted today by the College."
"The work was done over months - it is a very complex issue."
"You have had access, as has the press, to some staff work, very important work, but the decision was taken only half an hour precisely before coming to this House."
"I believe it is a very balanced decision - ambitious, but, at the same time, balanced and fair, and we are very proud."
"I think we have gained time."
"I think the fact that we have one more month to build a strong consensus in the Commission helps us gain time for the adoption, hopefully in this Parliament, of the whole package."
"I understood the point made by Mr Sacconi and by Ms Ek about the need to do it, but let us put it like that. Let us not see the time until June 2009 as the home straight for this Parliament;"
"Let us finish the work of this Parliament with a bang, with a climax, by adopting these very important proposals!"
"Let me say that, from my contacts with the governments of our Member States, namely with the current Slovene Presidency and the upcoming French Presidency, I thought that there was a strong determination to do it fast, to go ahead with it, to make it a real priority."
"And, if we do it as well here in the Parliament, I really believe it will be possible to get this package approved - after the necessary negotiations, of course, and we are ready."
"We do not pretend our proposal is perfect."
"I think it is possible that this Parliament, during this term, will achieve a very strong consensus around a very ambitious set of proposals."
"We have highlighted the difficult and political points."
"Let me just make a final comment about this."
"One is the question of balance between ecological commitment and the need to reduce our greenhouse gases and, at the same time, the need to address fears that exist in some parts of our industry regarding some effects on international competition."
"Let us make it clear: we are not making an exception for any sector of our industry."
"All of them are going to be involved in this."
"What we are considering is just in case there is no global agreement, but the global agreement remains our goal and our priority."
"Yes, there will be some measures to cushion the impact of this factor in some of our industries, because we want, of course, to protect the economy of Europe and we want to protect our jobs in Europe."
"This is the important thing, and we believe we have reached a very balanced solution."
"Regarding the point made about burden-sharing among Member States, we have decided to do it broadly as follows."
"We are going to see the concrete proposals regarding renewables."
"As you know, the target set was 20% of energy use through renewables."
"We are, today, at 8.5%, so we have to go for 11.5% more."
"We have decided, broadly speaking, to make half of that subject to a flat rate - everybody has to make the same effort."
"The other part of it, we have decided, will be according to GDP per capita."
"It seems to us the fairest method, because it is a way of giving more possibilities to those that have more resources to invest than the poorest Member States."
"I think it is fair."
"We have adjusted this with the criteria of flexibility for those countries that have made an effort already, so as to give some kind of prize or bonus to the early starters."
"All the methodology will be transparent."
"We are going to present it."
"We believe it is a good and fair proposal in terms of burden-sharing among Member States."
"I am quite hopeful that it will be well received by most of our Member States."
"Anyway, the scenarios will be transparent, the methodology will be presented, and if the Council and Parliament can find a better solution, please do."
"We think, in the end, that this will be the solution, because it was technically sound and also very fair."
"Regarding the problem of biofuels, we agree with most of what you said."
"The question is that today there are no sustainability criteria for the biofuels that are already being produced in the world and are already circulating."
"What we are doing now is establishing, for the first time ever, high-level criteria of sustainability for biofuels - domestic and imported biofuels - once again keeping in mind that what we want is a global agreement."
"Today there is no global agreement: in Latin America they do it one way, in the United States they do it another way and in Africa another way."
"Therefore, we need an international regime for the sustainability of biofuels, and this is what we are doing: promoting a new generation of biofuels."
"Therefore, while accepting all the criticisms of those who said that there are some risks with biofuels - and we agree there are - let us compare the alternative."
"We are proposing an alternative that is much better than the current situation."
"Some of you were concerned about the need for more investment in technology."
"I agree with that."
"Let us keep this in mind when we discuss the next financial perspective."
"I think we have to do more."
"I agree, because for carbon capture and storage, which is a very important and promising technology, we need capital."
"By the way, regarding the auction revenues of the Member States, we are proposing that the Member States assign a part of them to the fight against climate change."
"Let us hope they will accept that."
"Let me tell you from my contacts with the Member States during all these processes one thing that I have already made public."
"Sometimes, when discussing climate change, I remember what John Stuart Mill said about his father."
"He said that his father loved mankind in general, but hated every individual in particular."
"Let us hope our Member States and some of our national politicians are not like that."
"If they want to fight climate change, they cannot just love the agenda politically and afterwards not commit to precise targets and methods."
"This is an important issue."
"What the Commission has done today is to translate those goals and intentions into concrete measures and into instruments that are transparent."
"Are they perfect?"
"Let us discuss it."
"We believe they are reliable, fair and effective."
"We believe it is important, as Mr Hökmark said, that we also rely on the market."
"We will not enter into the energy mix of the Member States - that could be a discussion without end."
"We are not claiming that this or that is the best option."
"We are saying that now a goal has been unanimously agreed by the Member States of 20% use through renewables - for obvious reasons we have had to put the emphasis on renewables, because we have to give some clear incentives to the market - it is the market that will decide on the best technology and source of energy."
"We are not giving more precise instructions, because that is not what we have to do."
"But, please, think about the difficulty involved."
"We are applying general rules and principles and instruments to 27 very different situations, in terms not only of economic development but also of energy mix, the history of those countries and the culture of awareness of some of these problems."
"It is unavoidable that, in the end, there will be some differences."
"The important thing is to have a coherent approach."
"I believe that we have come here today with a coherent approach."
"I am looking forward very much to the necessary discussions at legislative level and I really believe that, with the spirit of partnership we have seen on other important pieces of legislation, we, together with the European Parliament and the Council, will reach a very ambitious and, at the same time, realistic proposal."
"(Applause)"
"The debate is closed."
"The minutes of today's sitting will be submitted for Parliament's approval at the next part-session."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) I welcome the energy and climate package presented to us by the Commission."
"It is important that the European Union should continue to play a leading role in combating climate change, and for this reason we must make a serious commitment to achieving the goal of '20/20/20 by 2020' (a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 20% energy savings and 20% of renewable energies)."
"I would, however, remind the Commission that, as things stand, the only technology at an advanced design stage that is capable of ensuring real energy efficiency and a sustained reduction in CO2 emissions is nuclear."
"Some European states are well ahead in this field, others are gearing themselves up, while others still - and this is the case for Italy - are going nowhere."
"Obviously, what has been lacking in the past is a common regulatory framework and, more generally, a comprehensive EU strategy on this topic."
"Only now is the European Commission taking the initiative, without any ifs and buts, because the international scenario calls for decisions, bold ones where necessary."
"The future of our economy is at stake here; so too, indirectly, is our opportunity to make our voice heard on respect for rights in every corner of the world, without fear of being held to ransom."
"in writing. - (RO) While appreciating the Commission's environmental concerns, we are preoccupied with the limited relevance of the indicators used in the algorithm applied for computing the distribution of emission certificates."
"New correction coefficients are needed to reflect the differences in the investment potential of countries with a similar GDP but with dissimilar social and economic prospects."
"The level of investment required clearly differs significantly according to the development stage of a particular European area."
"Thus, the national budgetary effort required to keep emissions within allotted limits will be charged to the budget for technological investment, so creating an obstacle to meeting European environmental standards in economically disadvantaged areas."
"The principle of European solidarity can only be respected in spirit if those countries and regions which are below the European average in terms of development are treated with due consideration of their particular stage of development."
"In line with the same principle, I hope that those of my German colleagues who have criticised Nokia's decision to relocate to Romania will eventually learn - and tell it plainly to the German workers in Bochum who were made redundant - that Romanian workers' wages are ten times lower than theirs, while the price of a litre of milk or petrol is the same as in Germany."
"in writing. - Today's debate creates a new favourable environment to encourage a wider social debate on the role nuclear energy will play in Europe in the future."
"Nuclear generation is a proven and efficient way of producing electrical energy free of greenhouse gas emissions."
"I suspect that the average European citizen is probably totally unaware of this fact."
"The public debate focuses almost exclusively on renewables and limiting the impact of burning fossil fuels."
"We should be honest and admit that there is a limit to how much energy we can generate from renewable sources and still maintain competitive energy prices."
"Renewables are important, but we cannot mislead citizens by saying that renewables alone will solve the problem."
"While CCS schemes will reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, the technologies are still to be implemented on an industrial scale."
"Furthermore, they will have a substantial price tag."
"A responsible approach to tackling the challenge of climate change requires a balance - a mix of economically viable renewable technologies, CCS systems and modern nuclear technologies."
"It is our responsibility to ensure that all options are explored, none to the exclusion of others."
"in writing. - Renewable energies can, in principle, offer a solution to global climate change and Europe's energy crisis."
"However, biofuels and other forms of bioenergy are contradictory tools for combating climate change."
"Up to a certain level they positively replace fossil energy, but on a larger scale they endanger the rainforests and the food supply of Third World countries."
"There are already worrying signs of deforestation in Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and other countries."
"Food prices have risen as well due to the growing consumption of biofuels."
"The EU should limit its bioenergy consumption to the surplus agricultural capacity of the Union itself, discouraging deforestation."
"in writing. - (RO) We fully support the Commission in its effort of proposing to the Member States and citizens a viable plan for achieving energy and environmental objectives."
"However, we should take into consideration the financial and economic aspects entailed by these proposals."
"There is a need to review the rules for approving the grant of state aid to environmental projects."
"Given the current high degree of pollution of some industries and the fact that adjustment to green technologies is not cost-effective, State aid amounting to 60-100% can be a viable solution."
"Mining is such an industry, and it is in dire need of CO2 capture and storage technologies."
"Concerning the Commission's project of launching 12 new coal and gas power plants equipped with CO2 capture and storage technology, I would like to reiterate Romania's willingness to host such a power plant."
"The Jiu Valley basin has the advantage of being both rich in mineral resources and close to working power plants."
"in writing. - (PL) The problem of climate change and combating the degradation of the natural environment rose to the top of the European Union's agenda in 2007."
"The European Commission's proposals are a concrete expression of the ambitious aims outlined in March of last year."
"They reflect the leading role assumed by our Community of 27 nations as regards limiting greenhouse gas emissions."
"I do not wish to query the aims or ambitions, but it must be recognised that the European Community is composed of two groups of countries that were until recently divided by the so-called Iron Curtain."
"For many decades now, the Western democracies have been sensitive to the need to protect the natural environment."
"This resulted in environmental standards worthy of imitation on other continents."
"In contrast, the countries of the former Comecon underwent rapid industrialisation."
"In particular, this involved developing the potential of the iron and steel industry, the heavy chemicals industry and other types of industry with detrimental effects on the environment."
"The process of adjustment to the Union's standards was exceptionally costly and it is not surprising that so many transitional periods were negotiated by these countries in their Accession Treaties."
"In a very short period of time the countries of Central and Eastern Europe underwent a dramatic transformation in this regard."
"Pursuant to the European Commission's proposals, these countries are now facing new challenges that may be more than they can cope with and could affect their opportunities for development."
"Finding the correct balance between environmental requirements, the right conditions for competitiveness and job protection is something that concerns the European Union as a whole."
"It is, however, particularly important for the countries that are struggling to catch up."
"in writing. - (EL) The presentation of the Council's measures to combat climate change by Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, has the following aim and vision:"
"to strengthen European monopolies in the intensified endo-imperialist competition in the field of energy."
"There is an attempt to exploit the essential goal of restricting emissions of pollutants in order to divide the markets and limit the growth of the emerging new powers (China and Brazil), which are claiming greater shares of the market."
"It provides an outlet for the over-accumulation of capital through the commercialisation of environmental protection."
"Following the liberalisation of strategically important sectors (energy, telecommunications), today's economy is one of the great new investment outlets for monopolistic capital."
"For this reason Mr Barroso spoke about investment in innovative energy technologies, technological modernisation and the use of private groups to meet the requirements of the new environmental legislation."
"In addition, the Kyoto Protocol created a new capitalist market in emissions trading."
"The right to pollute is exchanged for a price on the carbon dioxide 'stock market'."
"It nurtures a climate of class-based cooperation, attempting to exploit the worldwide raising of awareness, concealing the fact that dangerous changes in climate and global warming are the result of industrial development based on capitalist profit, the commercialisation of earth, air, energy, water, etc."
"These measures are detrimental to people's needs and the development of the profitability of capital in the field of the environment."
"in writing. - (RO) EU Member States are facing the challenges posed by climate change, increased dependence on energy imports, and the high price of energy."
"Therefore, the European Union's commitment to decreasing greenhouse emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020, particularly through measures in the energy sector, is a major step in combating global warming."
"Stepping up the transition to low-carbon energy by switching to biofuels and renewable energy sources will foster innovation and increase industrial competitiveness."
"Member States with developing economies, in particular Romania and Bulgaria, will be allowed a 20% increase in emissions compared to 2005 for industries outside the ETS system, and this increase is to be computed on the basis of GDP."
"This is proof of solidarity on the part of the European Union, ensuring that poorer countries will have the opportunity to catch up with the more developed economies."
"in writing. - Last week President Putin and First Deputy Prime Minister Medvedev of the Russian Federation signed a treaty in Sofia on constructing a gas pipeline called 'South Stream' across the Black Sea."
"Right now, when the Lisbon Treaty is about to be ratified, it seems rather odd that Bulgaria did not consult its European partners."
"Union policy on energy aims, in a spirit of solidarity between Member States, to ensure security of energy supply in the Union."
"Experts have perceived a threat in South Stream to the Nabucco project, which is included in the EU Trans-European Energy Network."
"In my opinion, Bulgaria has acted in a very disappointing way by signing a bilateral agreement on energy with the Russian Federation."
"Although Nabucco was named after an opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the current state of play resembles more an operetta or farce."
"in writing. - (RO) We welcome the President's initiative of coming to the European Parliament to present proposals concerning energy and climate change."
"We take this opportunity to ask the European Commission to pay particular attention to and to take all necessary measures for speeding up the NABUCCO project, which is of major importance in guaranteeing the security of gas supplies to the EU."
"in writing. - (RO) I believe that the fight against climate change can be won only if we manage to ensure global solidarity."
"The European Union should include the issue of climate change in all of its agreements, be they bilateral or multilateral."
"It is also important for adjustment to climate change to take into account and allow for the sustainable economic development of the Union."
"Biofuel crops should not be promoted to the detriment of crops for human consumption."
"The sustainable development of transport can help to abate climate change."
"Member States should opt for the energy mix that causes the least pollution possible."
"I call on the Commission to review the 2007-2013 financial perspective and the 2008 budget, Community programs and policies, as well as the main laws, so as to take climate change into account."
"The Commission should recognize the importance of national, local and regional authorities in the development and enforcement of climate change adjustment measures, as well as the need to vest authority in them and provide them with the support they need."
"I believe it is necessary to have a European framework programme aimed at reducing the risk of desertification and water shortage."

"Ladies and gentlemen, following Hungary's ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Slovenia and Malta ratified the Treaty yesterday."
"(Applause)"
"The Slovenian Parliament voted by a large majority for ratification. The Maltese Parliament, for its part, unanimously approved the Treaty."
"This is an important political signal whereby Member States have shown clearly that they want the ratification process to proceed rapidly so that the Treaty can enter into force as planned on 1 January 2009."
"I congratulate Slovenia and Malta on this landmark decision."
"(Applause)"
"For domestic reasons, as you know, the Slovakian Parliament decided yesterday to postpone its vote until a later date."
"I appeal to all political leaders in Slovakia to fulfil their great political responsibility."
"Approval of the minutes"
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)"
"Mr President, the minutes of the last part-session mention your speech in which you talked about incidents that took place in Strasbourg in December."
"Since that time, under Rule 147 of our revered Rules of Procedure, you have called before you 13 Members of this Parliament to face disciplinary action."
"It seems to me that this has been done on a pretty arbitrary basis."
"I doubt whether one of those that you have called - Ms Sinnott from our group - has ever shouted at anybody in her life."
"Another of the Members that you called to appear in the headmaster's study - an Austrian Member - was actually in Frankfurt on the day, so he must have one hell of a voice, must he not?"
"Why only 13?"
"There were about 80 of us involved in these so-called disturbances."
"In fact, at the Conference of Presidents' meeting, you yourself named me as being one of the causes of the trouble, so why am I not being punished?"
"I am Spartacus!"
"(Cries of 'I am Spartacus!' from members of the IND/DEM Group)"
"I had asked for comments concerning the Minutes. I would have expected the chair of the IND/DEM Group to understand what the President was saying and to focus his remarks on the Minutes."
"He patently failed to do that, and so we can now move on."

"Interpretation of the Rules of Procedure: see Minutes"
"Order of business"
"The final version of the draft agenda for this part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 17 January 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Brussels part-session:"
"At the request of the GUE/NGL Group and with the consent of all groups, I propose that statements on the situation in Gaza by Mr Javier Solana, High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, who is already with us and to whom I bid a very warm welcome, and by the Commission be added to today's agenda as item 2, following the statements on the situation in Iran."
"(Parliament approved the request.)"
"There is also a request that we conclude the debate with the tabling of motions for resolutions and vote on these during the February part-session."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, my group has proposed a debate on this for the same reasons as we have proposed that there should be a resolution in February."
"It is in order to have an opportunity to listen to Mr Solana and for Parliament then to explain its own position, for three reasons."
"The first is, of course, the issue of the Gaza blockade, which seems to us a collective punishment that is totally unacceptable from the humanitarian point of view, counter-productive politically and ineffective as far as the security of Israel is concerned."
"The second reason is the new situation since the people of Gaza have opened up the border."
"Thirdly, and above all, the European response to the question of what we can do to ensure that this opening up continues in a controlled and stable way and to make this step forward part of the peace process as a whole."
"I think it would be useful now to hear what Mr Solana has to say and to debate the issue and wind up the debate with a resolution in February."
"(Parliament adopted the motion.)"
"(The amended order of business was adopted.)"
"Mr President, on a point of order, under Rules 173, 19(1), 161 and 171, the decision by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs which you cited a moment ago represents, I am sorry to say, the moment at which this Parliament departs from any pretence of legality or the rule of law."
"Last week, you asked for, and were granted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, discretionary powers arbitrarily to disapply the Rules of Procedure of this House according to your own view."
"The Rules allow no such latitude."
"You cited Rule 19(1)."
"Let me read what it says: 'The President shall direct all the activities of Parliament and its bodies under the conditions laid down in these rules.'"
"They do not allow you discretionary power to set them aside simply because you do not like the opinions of the people making amendments or requests that, in your letter, you accepted 'were formally based on and fulfilled the requirements of ... the Rules of Procedure'."
"What has driven you to this, Mr President?"
"What action has driven you to this extremity of tearing up your own rule book rather than following the letter of the law?"
"Was it some filibuster that was preventing any business getting through?"
"Hardly!"
"Those of us who are asking for a referendum perhaps represent 40 or 50 out of 785."
"We are a small minority."
"The worst we could do was slightly to delay your lunch by making speeches of one minute, but even this is intolerable to you!"
"Could it be that the reason you have acted in this arbitrary fashion, tearing up the rule of law, is because you are taking out on us the surrogate contempt you feel for the national electorates who keep voting 'no' on the Lisbon Treaty whenever they are given the opportunity?"
"If I am wrong, prove me wrong by holding the referendums that you used to support when you thought you could win them."
"Put the Treaty of Lisbon to the people."
"Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est!"
"Mr Hannan, when you quote provisions, it would enhance your credibility if you quoted them in full."
"As a matter of fact, Rule 19 goes on to state that 'He' - meaning the President - 'shall enjoy all the powers necessary to preside over the proceedings of Parliament and to ensure that they are properly conducted'."
"In order to ascertain the legal position and ensure that I did not take any unilateral uninformed decisions, I took the democratic route and consulted those who know best about matters concerning the Rules of Procedure, namely the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The committee provided me, the President, and my deputies with the interpretation on which we are able to proceed."
"I cannot begin to grasp how this can be termed undemocratic, for it is a fair and democratic parliamentary procedure that is being followed here."
"(Applause)"
"Situation in Iran (debate)"
"The next item is the delivery of statements on the situation in Iran by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission."
"I warmly welcome the High Representative, Javier Solana."
"Mr Solana, the floor is yours."
"High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, I do not want to interfere in the debate which is taking place, but I take the floor at your invitation."
"Let me start by thanking you for the invitation today."
"It is the first time that I have spoken before Parliament in the year 2008."
"We are all sure that 2008 is going to be very exciting, to say the least."
"I want to continue with a deeper cooperation with Parliament, with yourself and with the distinguished Members of this Chamber."
"Today we have a very important debate - a debate on an issue that is one of the most important issues on the agenda of the international community."
"I would like to make a short statement about it and spend the time necessary to see whether we can together understand - and not only understand but make some progress on the solution of - this very complicated issue that is at the top of the international agenda today."
"Let me start by making a few remarks."
"Iran is a key country in the Middle East."
"It is important in strategic terms, and is also important as a regional actor."
"We would like, therefore, to have a constructive relationship with Iran; but, as you know, there are many difficulties with this."
"Iran is a very vibrant society, full of talented people."
"It has an exceptionally high proportion of women graduates."
"Persian is one of the major languages on the internet, especially for blogs, as young people seek a means of self-expression."
"The political scene in Iran - as you well know - is of great interest these days."
"There are elements of democracy there which are not present in other countries of the Middle East, though the election process still leaves much to be desired."
"For the Majles elections in March, to give you an example, 30% of candidates were disqualified, with those having reformist tendencies suffering the most."
"Some will have the opportunity to appeal but others will not."
"Nevertheless, an imperfect democracy is better than none, and it is right that we should engage with Iranian parliamentarians."
"I am very grateful to the European Parliament for sending a delegation there to meet with their colleagues in the Iranian Parliament."
"Members of this Parliament are also right to be concerned about the rule of law and human rights in Iran."
"Iran is almost at the bottom of the world press freedom index."
"It has increased the number of executions."
"There are, unfortunately, numerous reports of torture."
"Such things are unacceptable and only damage Iran's image as a civilised country."
"All those who campaign for human rights in Iran, for example in the one-million-signature campaign for women's rights, deserve our support and admiration."
"This morning I had the happy opportunity to comment on that with Mrs Souhayr Belhassen, who is, as you know, one of the most important figures in the International Federation of Human Rights."
"With greater freedom, greater accountability and more even-handed justice, Iran could be one of the most creative and most dynamic societies in the Middle East."
"The European Union had, in the past, a human rights dialogue with Iran, but since 2004 the Iranians have been unwilling to participate."
"However, we have many areas of common interest with Iran that are not yet fully exploited, the most obvious of these in the energy sector - but there is also more that we could do together on drug trafficking and against terrorism."
"It would be good if we were able to work better with Iran in the region."
"But for the moment, as you know, this is difficult because it is difficult to see Iran as a constructive partner."
"In almost every area we seem to find ourselves pursuing different, sometimes contradictory, policies."
"We want a two-state solution in Palestine."
"We want the Annapolis Conference to succeed."
"Iran is still the only country in the Middle East that does not accept the idea of a two-state solution."
"It is a key supplier of arms to Hamas."
"President Ahmadinejad's remarks concerning Israel and his support for Holocaust denial are entirely unacceptable for all of us."
"Iran, as you know, is a destabilising factor in Lebanon."
"It is the most important supplier of weapons to Hezbollah."
"It has also worked with groups pursuing violence in Iraq."
"All these activities make Iran, from our point of view, a troublesome and difficult actor in the Middle East."
"But it remains one that we need to understand and engage with better."
"There have been periods of cooperation with Iran, for example in Afghanistan, that have been fruitful, and I believe we should continue to seek such opportunities."
"But, as you know, one of the most important subjects of concern is the Iranian nuclear programme."
"Were Iran to develop a weapon, this could be a cause of radical instability and danger in the Middle East."
"It would also be very damaging to the whole non-proliferation system."
"Even the suspicion that Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon can destabilise the Middle East."
"Our objective is to remove those suspicions."
"In the end this can be done only through a negotiated solution."
"We welcome the fact that Iran is working with the International Atomic Energy Agency to deal with some of the so-called 'Outstanding Issues'."
"In the current phase with Dr ElBaradei, as you know, Iran has to answer questions about important issues like weaponisation, and especially other issues related to contamination, which are very important."
"But even if these questions about the past are answered, this does not provide the transparency we are asking for concerning Iran's present activities or its future intentions."
"Present transparency requires Iran to ratify and implement, as we have said many times, the Additional Protocol."
"Confidence about Iran's future intentions is more difficult."
"Supposing Iran had a weaponisation programme in the past, how can we be sure today that the present enrichment activity is exclusively civil?"
"It is especially difficult when we see no signs, at this moment, of Iran signing a contract to build a nuclear power plant apart from what they have done with the Russians in Bushehr, for which the Russians have supplied the fuel."
"All we hear about is enrichment."
"When I ask - and you asked the other day - representatives of the Iranian Government what they plan to do with enriched uranium, I never get an answer."
"You had the proof of that a few days ago."
"The fact is that Iran can develop a civil programme only with the assistance of the countries belonging to the group of six countries which are negotiating with them - or trying to negotiate with them - with the exception of Japan."
"No other country in the world can supply a country that wants to deploy or to develop a civil nuclear programme without the cooperation of countries, or companies that belong to those countries, that are in the group of six countries plus Japan."
"None of us have a problem with an Iranian civil programme; indeed, we are offering to help."
"But none of us will do so unless we are certain that Iran's intentions are exclusively peaceful."
"This is why we are trying continually to achieve a negotiated solution."
"So far, unfortunately - as you know - we have not been successful."
"Also, unfortunately, it is impossible to do nothing while Iran continues to ignore the Agency resolutions or Security Council resolutions."
"Work is, therefore, going on in New York on a further resolution."
"The objective of these resolutions is not to punish Iran but to persuade it to come to the negotiating table: as far as I am concerned, the sooner the better."
"The European Union and the permanent members of the Security Council are fully united in this."
"We had an important meeting last Thursday."
"Perhaps I could add one further comment that goes beyond Iran itself on this matter."
"In a world where there is an increasing interest in nuclear power, we need to find ways of assuring countries that they can obtain nuclear fuel without having to do their own enrichment - which is expensive for them and gives rise to proliferation concerns."
"I myself strongly support the idea of the creation of international fuel supply assurances, perhaps in the form of a fuel bank."
"This idea has been played around with by many of our partners and many important figures in the international community. There are many good ideas in this area."
"I believe the time has come to turn these ideas into action, into reality."
"As I said at the beginning, Iran is a key country."
"I have been engaged for years now in normalising relations between us."
"We will all gain from this - Iranians and Europeans."
"I believe in this, and I will continue relentlessly to work towards this objective, which I think will benefit the people of Iran and the European Union."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, in the current climate I think it is inevitable that discussions about Iran focus on the nuclear programme."
"The international community is united in the search for a satisfactory solution."
"That means working through the appropriate channels with the IAEA and the United Nations Security Council."
"It also means supporting the persistent efforts by High Representative Javier Solana on behalf of the three plus three, with the full backing of the European Union, because international unity remains central, and it was shown at the last meeting in Berlin."
"When I received Dr Saeed Jalili, the Iranian chief negotiator, last week, I reminded him of our principled position."
"Nobody has ever denied Iran's right to the use of peaceful nuclear energy, but there was a serious need to rebuild trust and show genuine political will to find a solution."
"Unfortunately, whereas the European Union was making its best efforts, I could not see such political will yet on the Iranian side."
"Until we see such political will, there will unfortunately be no possibility of our enhancing our relationship, including launching or relaunching the trade and cooperation agreement talks and talks on energy."
"This is what I explicitly told Dr Jalili at our meeting."
"I am confident that Parliament shares the same views and that it continues to firmly back High Representative Solana and the three plus three to achieve a sustainable solution - and a diplomatic solution which, whilst preserving Iran's inalienable right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, also provides objective guarantees on these activities being exclusively peaceful in nature."
"Although the development of the EU's relationship with Iran is conditioned to a large degree by progress on that issue, in the Commission's view more than one track should be pursued with Iran."
"In this respect, I wish to express my appreciation for the work undertaken by the Delegation for Relations with Iran under the dynamic chairwomanship of Ms Angelika Beer."
"Ms Beer, I particularly wish to commend the mission which you led last month to Tehran."
"EP contacts, for instance with the Iranian Majlis, are an important channel of communication between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"Your meetings with high-level officials such as the Foreign Minister, Mr Mottaki, as well as with a wide spectrum of Iranian society, are and were very precious."
"Meetings with women activists, families of imprisoned students, trade unionists and minority groups constitute an important testimony to the importance the European Union attaches to a fully free, democratic and pluralistic Iran in accordance with the international conventions to which the Islamic Republic of Iran has freely adhered."
"People-to-people contacts constitute an excellent means to overcome prejudice and negative stereotypes and to foster mutual understanding."
"It is, for instance, very important to support the further development of academic, cultural and artistic exchanges between Europe and Iran: two ancient beacons of civilisation which have a lot to offer each other."
"This is why I am particularly glad to report the successful launch this academic year of an Erasmus Mundus external cooperation window, linking up Europeans with students and professors from Iraq, Yemen and Iran."
"From Teheran to Shiraz, to Mashhad to Alzahra, the web of Iranian universities participating in this consortium looks particularly promising."
"The first academic batch has already allowed over 50 Iranian students and professors to study in Europe."
"I strongly hope that this set-up will work both ways and European students and professors will also go to Iran."
"Beyond that, we are pursuing our cooperation with Iran in a series of sectors such as the support to Afghan refugees or the fight against narcotics."
"In this respect I would like to draw your attention to a recently launched call for proposals for grants to non-state actors and local authorities in Iran."
"The programme - by the way a first with Iran - aims at promoting and strengthening an inclusive and empowered society."
"It includes educational activities and development activities with a focus on actions against poverty."
"Finally, the programme supports cooperation between civil society and local authorities and activities to strengthen their capacity."
"This call is now open and runs until 11 February."
"On another note, I welcome the decision taken by Parliament in plenary on 13 December last year to allocate a EUR 3 million envelope for a television news service in Farsi."
"Promoting the production and broadcasting of information with a strong European angle can play an important role in fostering better mutual understanding with the Iranian public."
"I wish to conclude on an important note: the issue of democracy and human rights."
"In front of this Parliament last week, Dr Jalili insisted on the importance of human dignity."
"I, of course, can only concur with him, but unfortunately when I met him myself, I could only tell him about my deep concern about the deterioration of human rights and the human rights situation in Iran."
"Last year Iran carried out at least 297 executions, according to an AFP account compiled from press reports."
"The total was a sharp increase from 2006 when 177 executions were carried out, according to Amnesty International."
"I do not speak of other very cruel methods of killing people."
"So I had to express my hope that the EU-Iran dialogue on human rights could resume."
"I also expressed the hope that there would be a wider spectrum of candidates than in the past for the forthcoming parliamentary elections."
"The European Union remains strongly mobilised on this front."
"The latest statement on the death sentences in Iran issued on 25 January is just another case in point."
"We are fully in line with Parliament in saying that, without a systematic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran, our relations with Iran cannot develop properly."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, our resolution deals with the human-rights situation in Iran and the dispute over the Iranian nuclear programme."
"On the subject of human rights, this House has clearly expressed its views time and again over the years."
"The High Representative spoke once more today of executions and torture."
"In the light of recent events, I should like to mention the names of political activists belonging to the Ahwazi Arab community who have been condemned to death, and to call on the Iranian Government not to execute them."
"Their names are Zamal Bawi, Faleh al-Mansouri, Said Saki and Rasoul Mazrea; the same applies to two Kurdish journalists, Abdolwahed 'Hiwa' Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour."
"May this publicising of their plight in Europe afford them protection!"
"As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, Saeed Jalili, the chief Iranian negotiator, did not provide the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week with a clear indication of Iran's real intentions."
"Questions from 24 committee members were dealt with en bloc in a cursory manner."
"This is no way to dispel the deep distrust that prevails between the international community and Iran."
"Solidarity on the part of the international community is the best response to such evasiveness, which is why, in our resolution, we welcome the agreement reached in Berlin on 22 January on the drafting of a new UN Security Council resolution."
"This will bring Russia and China on board, which will send a strong signal to Iran."
"The resolution provides for additional measures as part of a concerted approach on the part of the international community."
"I believe it is right that we should seek dialogue wherever possible but that we should also spell out time and again where our interests lie, namely on the one hand in human rights but on the other also in cooperation, though only if and when Iran recovers its trust in this community of ours."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Dr Solana, Commissioner, there are three issues involved here: human rights, nuclear weapons, and free democratic elections in Iran."
"What is not an issue here today is the question of whether Mujaheddin should be blacklisted or not; we shall deal with that separately."
"In the realm of human rights, the numerous and often brutal executions in Iran are a running sore as far as we are concerned. I agree with what Mr Gahler said on this point and hope that public opinion in our countries can have a significant impact."
"The second issue is that of the nuclear programme. We stand four-square behind the views expressed by the High Representative."
"We do not want nuclear weapons in Iran; we want no nuclear weapons anywhere in the region."
"It was scandalous enough that many countries - including, I am sorry to say, the United States of America - stood by and watched as the bomb was developed in Pakistan and as bomb-building technology was transferred from there to Iran, because Pakistan was seen from the sole perspective of the common struggle against the Soviet Union and hence against Afghanistan too."
"What we need is supervision - and I would ask you, Mr Solana, to make particular efforts in this direction - to ensure that nuclear industries, and especially their enrichment and waste-disposal operations, are more fully incorporated into multilateral frameworks and are more strictly supervised."
"We must do more in this respect, because this concerns not only Iran but other countries too."
"Another thing we need - and for this the Americans must be prepared to make further concessions - is the recognition of legitimate security interests, not of any government but of the Iranian nation."
"That security must be guaranteed, and then we could surely make progress in our dialogue with Iran."
"I likewise endorse the UN resolution, because it is a significant advance."
"With regard to the elections too, Mr Solana, I can only echo your sentiments."
"Elections and democracy begin to serve a purpose when elections are truly free, and if President Ahmadinejad believes he has such broad support in Iran, I can only urge him to ensure that genuine free elections can take place without external intervention, and then we shall see whether he enjoys such widespread support."
"Free elections in Iran are one of the keys to the democratisation of the entire region."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, it is still a paradox that, as Mr Solana said, a country with such a rich history, such a varied culture and such a dynamic population as Iran should commit the most terrible human rights offences."
"The number of death sentences last year - which the Commissioner also referred to - is a tragic illustration of this."
"I therefore feel - together with my Group - that Iran is actually betraying its own history when the current regime treats its people as it has unfortunately been doing for a number of years now."
"I nevertheless think that the solution lies in continued dialogue, with the population and civil society, undoubtedly, but also with the political authorities, however difficult that may be."
"In this respect last week's debate with Mr Jalili was not exactly much fun, but it was extremely important, because he will now realise that not one single person from any Group in this House would endorse or even contemplate Iran starting to use its nuclear research for military purposes again without any response from us."
"On behalf of my Group I particularly welcome Mr Solana's suggestion to set about creating a sort of multilateral, multinational nuclear fuel bank, because this is probably a good way to link our concern about non-proliferation with allowing countries to continue developing their civilian nuclear activities."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Solana, the most important and urgent matter in relations with Iran is to obtain a guarantee that it will not acquire nuclear weapons."
"Notwithstanding information from various sources, including the National Intelligence Estimate report, we cannot today be certain that Iran will not develop such weapons."
"It is naïve to believe that, since 2003, uranium enrichment in Iran has been directed towards exclusively civil applications."
"Since that time the reformist president Khatami has been replaced by the representative of a much harder political line."
"We must also remember that every nuclear programme was hidden under the cloak of civil projects in the initial stages: such was the case in Russia, India, China and Israel."
"It is highly likely that today's civil programme is merely a step on the road to the eventual enrichment of uranium for military purposes."
"The European Union must therefore exert maximum pressure on Iran, not excluding a military solution."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, may I begin by thanking both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner for making such thorough preparations for the visit and for engaging in consultation and dialogue with us both beforehand and afterwards."
"I would like to point out - and let there be no mistake about this - that this debate will be heard in Iran."
"It is an enlightened and pluralist society that tries to obtain the information it needs, and we are supporting that quest by means of the Farsi television news service."
"We know that the leaders of the Ahmadinejad regime will be following this debate, which is why it is right and proper to say clearly to President Ahmadinejad and his supporters that the host of candidates for the 296 parliamentary seats - there are more than 7 000, of whom 2 000 are apparently being excluded - is a sure sign to us that he has his back to the wall in domestic politics."
"Our solidarity belongs to civil society, to women, to trade unions and to all those who are under threat and whose names were read out to us a few moments ago."
"(Applause)"
"There is also a second reason why we wanted today's debate, for which I am truly grateful."
"Iran is at an impasse."
"It has run into a brick wall and no longer knows how to progress; it is in no position to make offers."
"At the same time, however, I wonder whether we Europeans have really played all our cards yet."
"The finding of our cross-party visit to Iran is that we must find our own way of negotiating, and that can only be done without prior conditions, without holding a knife to anyone's throat."
"One thing I understood very clearly from all the people whom we were able to meet and who are in need of our support is that sanctions weaken civil society and strengthen President Ahmadinejad."
"For this reason, carrying on as before is not a political option and will not resolve the deadlock."
"Let me therefore conclude by saying that we do not want nuclear weapons in any country whatsoever."
"For my part, I want no nuclear energy at all, but if it is President Sarkozy's policy to conclude nuclear-energy contracts right, left and centre without any safeguards such as non-proliferation agreements, Europe's foreign policy will become a proliferation factor instead of helping to stem the tide."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mrs Beer, and I wish you a speedy recovery from what looks very much like a broken arm."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, according to the US intelligence report, the situation has changed."
"What is needed now is a moratorium on the nuclear issue."
"The case must be diverted away from the UN Security Council and back to the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"Iran has a very vibrant civil society, in spite of all the repressive measures against groups such as the trade unions."
"There are intolerable occurrences, such as the rejection of candidates for election to the Majlis, but I am strongly opposed to tighter sanctions."
"They would be counterproductive, particularly for the democratic opposition."
"We are still hearing threats of war against Iran, especially from the United States."
"My group is very firmly against any threat of war and the preparation of any war plans."
"Mr Solana, in the British Guardian newspaper, Robert Cooper, a member of your staff, is quoted as saying the following in connection with the recently mooted manifesto for a new NATO: 'Maybe we are going to use nuclear weapons before anyone else, but I'd be wary of saying it out loud'."
"Does this statement relate to the situation in Iran, Mr Solana, and when are you going to dissociate yourself from it?"
"Let me repeat: negotiation with Iran, not escalation and war."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, there is good news and bad news from the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"The good news came last month, in the middle of December, from the Iranian opposition in Tehran, which took a very clear stand against President Ahmadinejad's denial of the holocaust by declaring that the holocaust was an historical event that could not be called into doubt."
"Duly noted."
"The bad news is the public threat which the Foreign Minister, Mr Mottaki, recently made to the United Nations Security Council, when he said that if it adopted a new resolution on sanctions against Iran before the next IAEA report on the country's nuclear programme in March, there would be an appropriate and serious response from Tehran."
"Mr Solana, I would like to know what you make of this public threat."
"And what do you think about the idea of strengthening the IAEA's position by setting up an independent committee of technical experts on the Iranian nuclear programme?"
"After all, there have been precedents for this in UNSCOM and UNMOVIC."
"The committee's report would then serve as a guide for consideration by the Security Council."
"(NL) Mr President, the regime in Iran continues to pose a threat to stability throughout the Middle East and far beyond."
"Iran provides support for Islamist and terrorist groups in Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places. The European Union's strategy must be to isolate Iran as much as possible in the region."
"It is also important to encourage Russia to wind down its nuclear cooperation with Iran."
"Iran's nuclear plans are a threat to world peace."
"America's National Intelligence Estimate surprised the whole world a few months ago by claiming that Iran had ceased its attempts to produce nuclear weapons in 2003."
"There are now calls in the USA for the NIE's findings to be investigated further."
"However, it would be wrong to suddenly now assume that the Iranian regime's nuclear threat no longer exists."
"Why, for instance, is Iran still making things so difficult for the International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors?"
"We all know what the regime in Tehran is capable of."
"There is its human rights record, and in the past there has been clear proof of Iran's involvement in international Islamist terrorism."
"When President Ahmadinejad publicly states that he wants to wipe Israel off the map, we have to take this seriously."
"In the present circumstances, therefore, it would be wrong to relax the pressure on President Ahmadinejad."
"There has to be dialogue, but the European Union must be steadfast in its attempts and desire to do more to promote freedom and stability."
"Welcome"
"I welcome to our official gallery a delegation from the European Affairs Committee of the Polish Parliament, headed by Mr Andrzej Grzyb, Chairman of the Committee."
"The delegation is on a three-day fact-finding visit to the European Parliament, and I had the pleasure of meeting its members yesterday."
"I bid you all a warm welcome."
"(Applause)"
"Situation in Iran (continuation of debate)"
"We now return to the statements on the situation in Iran by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission."
"High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, I have listened with great attention to the representatives from the political groups of the European Parliament."
"I agree with most of what has been said today."
"Therefore, I have not much to say about that."
"However, let me make some comments on the three main issues that I think we have to discuss today in relation to Iran."
"I should like to say once again that it is not a contradiction to say that Iran is a very important country that has a vibrant society - potentially - and that we have to seek relations with it."
"The fact is that it is very difficult to do that at the moment."
"We have to keep trying to improve relations with such an important country as Iran."
"Again, we must insist that it is not doing enough to improve relations with us."
"On the three main issues I have spoken about - human rights, regional issues and the nuclear issue - it is very difficult to make progress in the negotiations."
"In one area it is impossible to make progress because in 2006 it dropped completely out of the negotiations."
"The human rights dialogue was stopped - it was not stopped by us but by Iran."
"Let me say a word on that."
"I agree, as I said before, with most of the remarks that have been made today on the human rights issue, which is linked, as many Members have said, to the elections that will take place very soon in March."
"It will be very important to see how the public - the citizens of Iran - behave in this election."
"But it is very important that the candidates who have been put forward are allowed to stand in the election."
"As you know, more than 30% of those candidates have not even been allowed to stand."
"Many of them, I would say, are the 'modern forces', if I can use that term, in Iran."
"The second big issue is regional."
"There have not been many comments made here about that, but it is very important that Iran becomes a constructive player and not a 'nuisance' in the lives of the people of the Middle East and in the establishment of peace in the Middle East, as we understand the development of the peace process in the Middle East."
"There are two main points on the agenda."
"Firstly, the Middle East peace process, on which we fundamentally differ."
"We believe in a two-state solution, and they do not."
"We have to see how we can bring Iran to agree to that process, which has been agreed by all the Arab countries in the region, and, as has been proven not long ago, not by Iran."
"The second point is Lebanon."
"We do not have Lebanon on the agenda today, but Lebanon is always on the agenda - even if not formally."
"The problems in Lebanon are in our minds and hearts."
"We know that is a problem on which Iran should be much more constructive."
"The third issue I should like to mention, and which we have discussed on other occasions, is the nuclear issue."
"Firstly, I should like to thank Ms Beer, because I talked to her before the committee went to Iran and we had a very good exchange of views, which was very well coordinated."
"Cooperation with the Agency is fundamental."
"We have been pushing for that all along and we would very much like to see that cooperation producing fruit."
"However, that is not enough."
"We should be resolving the 'outstanding issues'."
"These issues, as you know, belong to the past."
"Why are they outstanding?"
"Because they have never been explained, and that is the difference with some of the other countries that have been mentioned."
"Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty; it has obligations and it has not complied with those obligations."
"At the moment there is a discussion with Dr El Baradei and the people in charge of the nuclear dossier to see whether these 'outstanding issues' can be resolved."
"We are now in the year 2008, and some of those issues go back to 2003, 2004 and 2005."
"That was the first thing I wanted to say, and the second thing, which is very important, is that we are continuing to support the dual-track approach."
"We want negotiations and we also want to follow the route to New York - together, in parallel."
"We would like to see how this can progress."
"We do not want to punish the people of Iran."
"We want them to come back to the negotiating table with a moral purpose."
"To give you an example: as you know, last Tuesday we met in Berlin."
"On Wednesday I was here in Brussels having dinner with Dr Jalili, the day after we had been talking about New York and how to move the process forward in New York, I did not want to give the impression that we were doing something that we would not communicate directly."
"To prove that we would continue with the dialogue, I met him, had dinner with him and explained that to him."
"Therefore, in that sense, rest assured that we are making every effort to keep the dialogue channel open and not only open but productively open."
"I do not have to tell you that sometimes you do not get the answer to the question."
"You hold debates here and you know that sometimes, perhaps because of a problem with translation, you do not get the answer to the question - you get answers to other things but not the question."
"You know that - you have had that experience - but we have to keep on trying, keep on trying and keep on trying - and we will!"
"On the intelligence report that has been mentioned: that is not our responsibility but the responsibility of the United Nations."
"Now weaponisation has three elements."
"First, and most important, it is necessary to have enriched uranium - if you do not have enriched uranium you will never have the possibility of a military nuclear programme."
"Second, you need a missile to launch, and, third, you need the actual detonator of the bomb."
"The second stage is where they have stopped and that is what happened in 2003."
"That is one part."
"The second part is the missile and you know that the technology on missiles is moving rapidly."
"We are concerned."
"This is not one of the key issues but it is an issue."
"Now we have a range of 1 300 km, which is no little matter."
"The third thing is enriched material, which is in breach and is continuing to be produced."
"That is the core of the problem: we have to see how we can get an agreement on this."
"Let me repeat: a nuclear-powered plant to produce energy - you may like it or not, but that is not the issue being debated today - requires, as you know, at least seven or eight years from the moment the contract is signed to the moment the power plant is operational."
"There is no contract whatsoever between Iran and anybody who can produce a nuclear-powered plant to produce energy - kilowatts - none except for the Russian one."
"As you know the Russian contract has a clause that states, firstly, enriched uranium will be provided by Russia and, secondly, that the burned material - that means enriched plutonium or whatever is at the end of process - will be taken to Russia, so they will not need to have enriched uranium because it is provided."
"Secondly, if they continue enriching, the question is why? - because they do not have anywhere to put it, no other power plant."
"So this is a question that it is fair to ask and it is difficult to get an answer."
"This is the only response to this question that I can give you, because it is something that is under your control and that of the leaders and citizens of the European Union."
"I have tried to give you an honest account of our interpretation of the situation, the problems and the three main issues that we have to be concerned about as Europeans."
"I say again that we have great respect for the country - we have a profound respect for Iran - and we would like very much to engage with it and also see them move in that direction."
"(ES) Mr President, tomorrow the European Parliament will adopt a resolution on Iran which will be supported by our political Group."
"It is no coincidence that the first part of that resolution concerns the human rights situation."
"Last week our Foreign Affairs Committee held an entirely unsatisfactory meeting with Mr Jalili, who failed to reply to any of the questions put to him on human rights, torture, public executions, the purchase of North Korean missiles and Soviet torpedoes capable of being fitted with nuclear warheads."
"Mr Solana, we have heard very clearly that you are awaiting replies to the questions you put to Mr Jalili;"
"Commissioner Ferrero has informed us of this, and we too are still waiting for replies to the questions we put to him."
"Therefore it is not sufficient for us to express regret that they have not suspended their nuclear programme, disregarding the calls of the international community and three United Nations resolutions."
"As Mr Solana has just said, the international community is convinced that they are enriching uranium for a programme whose purposes are not peaceful."
"In view of this, it is simply not enough, Mr President, for us to say in the motion for a resolution that we are not going to go down the path of a cooperation or association agreement with Iran until such time as substantial progress has been made in human rights and there are objective safeguards such as to provide us with clear guarantees that no headway is being made in uranium-enrichment for peaceful purposes."
"Therefore, Mr Solana, the question I would ask is whether you believe that the fourth resolution which the United Nations Security Council is going to make, on the basis of the Vienna meeting of the permanemt members of the Security Council plus Germany, will be sufficient for Iran to listen to the international community's calls?"
"What, Mr Solana, should the content of the United Nations Resolution be if it is to take up this challenge and mitigate the threat to peace and international security posed by Iran's unranium-enrichment programme?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, President Ahmadinejad said today in Busher, in the south of the country, that Israel is a filthy Zionist entity that will fall sooner or later."
"This is a statement that is of course unacceptable and obviously meant as propaganda."
"Political elections will take place in Iran on 14 March, in which the promises he has failed to keep will count more than those he has made."
"In addition, the election campaign in the USA is in full swing and, for this reason, we must consider the facts."
"Today, Iran is emerging as the leading power in the Gulf and Washington is trying to negotiate an agreement with that country."
"In December the American secret service decided that Iran does not represent an immediate threat."
"On 12 January the director of the IAEA, Mr El Baradei, obtained assurances from the Iranians on all the outstanding questions."
"Pressure on Iran will be maintained, but it would be helpful to reach an agreement that would be workable for everyone and for regional stability, and to avoid any radical and often ineffective measures."
"We should remember Iraq and how ineffective sanctions were against that country."
"Iran's role in the new balance of power must be recognised and Iran must be offered guarantees of security in a highly turbulent regional context."
"The direct involvement of the USA is essential for the success of discussions that, at this point, should not rule anything out, which is, in fact, what the European Union is doing."
"On the other hand it is absolutely clear that Iran should accept certain obligations: it should abandon its nuclear and military ambitions, with stringent controls, take on a constructive role in solving existing conflicts, show respect for human rights and for women's rights, and, looking to wider issues, for democracy as well."
"Not long ago Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, sent me an e-mail in which she denounced the serious and ever more frequent violations of human rights."
"She wrote that today, in Iran, this is far more serious than the nuclear issue."
"We should listen to her."
"Mr President, I thank Mr Solana and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for the immensely hard work on the issue of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is causing so many headaches and worries to so many people internationally and on the Security Council of the UN."
"It was my pleasure to represent my group on the recent delegation to the Islamic Republic of Iran just before Christmas, when we had a very exceptionally good sequence of meetings, to which Mr Solana has already referred, as has Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"Of course, our call for dialogue in the Islamic Republic of Iran does fall on very welcome ears, because, as you well know, the former President of Iran put forward to the United Nations in 2000 the idea of the intercultural year of dialogue, which you yourself have picked up this very year here in the European Union."
"I believe there are huge possibilities for dialogue, but not just on human rights and not just on the all-important nuclear issue."
"I believe we should be having dialogue on cultural issues - music, art, archaeology, painting, calligraphy - in which we share so much historical reference and so much potential for future gain."
"I also believe that one critical item we should discuss is this so-called barrier between Islam and democracy."
"Perhaps it has not been noticed that the Islamic Republic of Iran believes that she has cracked that particular difficulty, and that her form of democracy is fully comprehensible with the Islamic Republic of Iran's version of Islam, the all-important Shariah law and the Shiite Islamic tradition."
"I think this, again, is something that we should welcome and should discuss this very year, perhaps with former President Khatami or with other members of the Iranian religious influence and tradition."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my opinion, also in the light of what I have heard during this debate, is still that the only path to follow is definitely that of discussion and dialogue, even if it is difficult to understand on what basis this dialogue can develop."
"How, indeed, is it possible to have a dialogue with a country that does not respect the rights of the child and extends the death penalty to minors?"
"With a country, or rather it would be better and more correct to say with a regime, that has public hangings, a regime that threatens to want to wipe out the state of Israel?"
"And, on the nuclear issue, should we just put it off and not even doubt that nuclear power is for peaceful use?"
"How far should we believe the military plans for national defence?"
"In addition, can we consider a regime that finances guerrilla warfare in neighbouring countries to be trustworthy?"
"With regard then to the CIA report, I would suggest that we should not have too many illusions about its reliability."
"It would not be the first time for such a report later to be publicly repudiated."
"It is certainly the case that we cannot refuse anyone the possibility of experimenting with nuclear power for civilian, and not military, purposes, but not only does President Ahmadinejad not provide guarantees, he does not give a single guarantee, in fact he makes us fear the worst."
"In ruling out the option of military intervention - this I believe to be the view of all the representatives and Members of the European Parliament: avoiding military intervention is absolutely fundamental - I believe that the option of sanctions would be a disaster for everyone, it would penalise the economy and it would penalise a defenceless, uninformed and innocent people."
"I would suggest again that diplomacy should be used, because, and I repeat, nothing good has ever come out of sanctions, they serve only to increase hatred of the West and of the United States of America in particular."
"Mr President, deceit is a weapon of war approved of in the Koran under the doctrine of taqiyya."
"Iran professes no plans to develop nuclear weapons."
"Evidence to the contrary is overwhelming."
"They had 3 000 uranium centrifuges already."
"Not one can be used to generate nuclear energy for peaceful purposes."
"Together they will produce one bomb's worth of weapons-grade uranium a year."
"Now Iran plans to build 5 000 more centrifuges."
"Meanwhile, illegal secret imports of raw uranium arrive from the Congo, a country the EU supports with humanitarian aid."
"Britain still allows Iranian students to study nuclear physics at our universities."
"In addition to this, Iran, Syria and North Korea are working together to assemble missiles and chemical warheads."
"Last year, technicians from all three countries were killed when something went wrong in Syria."
"Traces of Sarin gas were later detected in the atmosphere."
"Whether or not these countries successfully develop nuclear warheads, chemical warheads would certainly be deployable in the near future."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the EU's negotiating attempts as regards confirming the right to self-determination and I support the synergy of the IAEA's Iran plan of action."
"It is praiseworthy and helps to put our worries to rest, and also to defuse political and strategic speculation based on a theoretical threat to peace."
"Moreover, in item 5 of the resolution there is an admission that we should give up on speculative political rhetoric as regards Iran."
"The entire first part of the resolution and the proposal to create a new multilateral framework for the use of nuclear energy are part of the same approach."
"However, the second part seems to be demagoguery."
"Violations of human rights in so many other regions of the world have not attracted this level of diligent condemnation."
"Examples of this are the recent resolutions on Pakistan and China, which were not nearly as strong in tone, nor was there such evident support for the internal opposition."
"This forces me to declare my opposition to the resolution, because human rights and freedoms are absolute values that cannot be applied differently in different situations, and do not lend themselves to inequality between requests and condemnation."
"Mr President, the Iranian nuclear programme remains the source of our greatest concern."
"We hope that the process of negotiating a solution will be continued."
"The European Union should stand united on this very difficult issue, and we should support the efforts of the High Representative and of the Commission, Member States and the international community, including the recently proposed UN Security Council resolution."
"Efforts should be aimed at encouraging Iran to return to talks concerning long-term arrangements resolving the nuclear issue."
"We in the Committee on Foreign Affairs of this House decided to invite Mr Jalili to talk and to have a dialogue."
"Our committee was dissatisfied with the answers given, and we know how difficult dialogue is."
"However, the meeting with the Committee on Foreign Affairs has shown our unanimous stand on the Iranian question, and it has also sent a strong political signal to the Iranian Government."
"If we want to continue any meaningful dialogue, we have to restore credibility to our relations."
"Our Iranian partners must introduce absolute transparency to their nuclear programme by cooperating fully with the IAEA."
"They must fully implement the provisions of the Comprehensive Safeguard Agreement, and we should maintain pressure on the Iranian Government to comply with its commitments and to make them understand that this is the only way to gain international recognition, as well as to pursue successfully economic development to the benefit of its citizens."
"The human rights situation in Iran has seriously deteriorated recently, and we should keep condemning the systematic violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially those carried out on juvenile offenders and women."
"As a community based on values, having at the core of our values human rights and democracy, and looking at stability and security as our highest concern, we should not and cannot disregard the worsening human rights situation there, and we should do our utmost to convince our partners that it pays to respect the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, in my contribution to the debate today allow me to concentrate on two aspects of relations with Iran."
"A civil society is the first aspect."
"As I experienced myself during my recent visit to Tehran, a very strong and active civil society exists in Iran."
"Women, journalists, national and religious minorities all strive for their rights."
"The student scene is fairly lively."
"Bus drivers, bakers and many other professions organise their own independent trade unions."
"Economists and entrepreneurs are pushing for privatisation and liberalisation of the Iranian economy."
"All these groups and elements that form Iranian society are turning to Europe, to the European Union, seeking dialogue and help."
"That is why I would like to call on the Commission and on High Representative Javier Solana to put the new tool for democracy and human rights that is at our disposal to efficient use as a part of this dialogue."
"It is also my opinion that the European Union should have diplomatic representation in Iran."
"Not only would this boost discussion and dialogue with the civil society; it would also boost cooperation with local institutions and authorities in areas of common interest."
"Indeed we share many common interests with Iran, in spite of our differences of opinion on the nuclear program or on human rights."
"I will mention only one country neighbouring Iran, and that is Afghanistan."
"I am convinced that it benefits neither us nor Iran if, for example, tonnes of Afghan illegal drugs flood Europe."
"We have similar common interests when it comes to the issue of Afghan refugees and when it comes to the issue of an overall peaceful solution to the situation in Afghanistan."
"That is just one of the many reasons why the European Union needs to have its own diplomatic representation in Tehran."
"Mr President, both Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner have stressed repeatedly in their presentations today the need for dialogue, negotiation and persuasion."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner highlighted the need for people-to-people contact."
"She told us of the success of our Erasmus Mundus and poverty alleviation programmes."
"So, are we training their nuclear physicists in our universities?"
"Are we, at our taxpayers' expense, paying for poverty relief in one of the richest oil-producing nations in the world because they have chosen to spend billions on a nuclear weapons programme?"
"What has our policy of appeasement achieved?"
"According to Mr Solana, so far, no success."
"He said that the Iranian regime continues to ignore us."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner said that we have more executions than ever before."
"Well, let me tell you, Mr President, 23 people were executed in the first two weeks of this year, including several women."
"Five people had their hands or feet amputated."
"Men and women continue to be stoned to death by this jihadist, misogynous, homophobic, genocidal, brutal regime which is a world sponsor of terror."
"If we wish really to support Iranian students, we should support the brave students of Teheran University, who have been demonstrating for the past five days, demanding regime change."
"Instead of backing appeasement, we should back the legitimate Iranian Opposition."
"Instead of keeping the PMOI on our terror list, we should put the revolutionary guards of Iran on the EU terror list."
"(DE) Mr President, as we have just heard, even here in our European Parliament there are representatives whose priority is not to modify the behaviour of the Iranian regime but to destroy that regime."
"I believe there is one thing that has to be spelled out very clearly, namely the logical imperative that those who seek the destruction of a regime and focus their policies on that goal will do nothing to modify the regime's behaviour."
"Yet such modification must be our aim whenever we discuss the nuclear issue."
"The diplomatic offensive would be greatly reinforced if the United States were directly involved in the talks, because it can offer something the European Union cannot provide to the same extent, namely security guarantees."
"As Mr Solana pointed out, the findings of the US intelligence services do not warrant the conclusion that the Iranian programme is not a potential threat."
"That is indeed a problem, and it cannot be solved by removing the pressure."
"The issue cannot be taken out of the UN Security Council, because that is liable to result in the Iranian regime eventually saying, 'Thanks, that's it now - we have enough highly enriched uranium; it's time for us to renounce the Non-Proliferation Treaty and start producing our nuclear weapons'."
"Should that scenario materialise, we would have no alternative but to revert to the strategy of nuclear deterrence we know from the sixties and seventies."
"One thing we should exclude from this debate at all costs - and let there be no doubt about this - is the so-called military option."
"Whatever is understood by the term 'the West', whether it be North America alone or whether it include Europe, exercising the so-called military option would be a political disaster which would rebound on the West for decades to come in its relations not only with the Muslim world but also with countries such as India that have helped to put this issue on the agenda of the UN Security Council."
"(SK) Let me say how deeply worried I am about the deterioration of the human rights situation in Iran: use of the death penalty, torture, inhumane treatment of prisoners and repression of political opponents."
"We should categorically condemn such obvious breaches of the human rights and fundamental freedoms that form the basis of our democratic societies."
"Personally, as a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly I am rather worried about the security issue and about the fact that Iran, in spite of protests from the European Union and the international community, is continuing to develop its nuclear programme."
"In spite of assurances that it is doing so entirely for peaceful purposes, it is very difficult not to be alarmed about the direction in which this situation is going."
"In conclusion, I would like to refer to the fact that Russia recently supplied nuclear material to Iran."
"There are further indications telling us that Iran is an untrustworthy partner and we should act accordingly."
"Mr President, have all EU Member States been consistent in the political message delivered to Iran to back the efforts of the EU three and Mr Solana on the nuclear file by living up to the imposition of the economic sanctions?"
"And have EU Member States and you, Mr Solana, been pressing the Bush Administration to talk to Iran directly, not just about Iraq, but about the nuclear file in particular?"
"Or are you of the view that there is no point, that it will wait for the next US Administration?"
"(PL) Mr President, I want to return to a point made by Mr Solana, that is, the correct interpretation of the CIA report on Iran's nuclear programme."
"Let me repeat what Mr Solana said: only one element has been halted, and it is extremely doubtful whether it has been halted definitively."
"The Iranian opposition claims the programme has simply been dispersed over other sites but is still continuing."
"I think we should believe this, since it was the Iranian opposition that first drew attention to the military aspects of the nuclear programme in Iran, and its claims proved to be absolutely true."
"Which brings me to the next point, namely, that it is high time to remove the People's Mujaheddin from the list of terrorist organisations."
"The courts, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the Italian Parliament have already spoken out on this matter."
"It is time we did so too."
"(FR) Mr President, like Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, I do not see any difference between civil and military nuclear power."
"Mr Solana has explained to us that uranium is all that is needed to make a bomb."
"I think one would have to be a little naïve to believe that a country as rich in natural resources as Iran needs nuclear energy for its development."
"On the other hand, we know very well that it needs nuclear energy to make the bomb."
"Mr Solana has also said that nuclear energy is a cause of instability and we do not have any influence over Iran."
"He is quite right."
"We entirely agree with his proposal that enrichment should be banned."
"I shall even go further than that: I think nuclear energy should simply be banned."
"Only 4% of energy worldwide is nuclear at the moment."
"The question I should like to ask Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner is this: do they not think that France, and its President Mr Sarkozy, are playing with fire and creating instability in the world by signing nuclear agreements with countries like Libya, China and Georgia?"
"Could we not use the unhappy experience of Iran as an opportunity to put a stop to nuclear proliferation in the world?"
"(NL) Mr President, the debate on Iran is about more than nuclear energy, threats of war and human rights violations."
"In his introduction Mr Solana has already described why Iran, despite having certain elements of democracy and a high level of education, is not a nice place to live for so many people."
"Many of those who are being persecuted by the Iranian government or cannot live freely under the current regime have fled to Europe."
"The European Union and its Member States must not stand in these people's way, and must allow the peaceful opposition in exile the greatest possible freedom."
"This is why it is important that the European Court of Justice has ruled that it was wrong to put this organisation on the list of terrorist organisations."
"It is important that Parliament should point out to the Council that it is unjust and unacceptable to do so."
"This list is one area where there can be no compromise with the Iranian regime."
"Mr President, I would like to know if anybody can give me an answer."
"During the parliamentarians' visit to Teheran, did they attend any public executions?"
"Especially those in which cranes of European production were used."
"(CS) I would like to mention that the Iranian nuclear program paradoxically started off during the time when Iran was a United States ally."
"Americans advised the Shah to build twenty nuclear power stations."
"It looks like times have changed: ally has become enemy and Iran's image is full of contradictions."
"Although I know about the suffering of our friends in the Tudeh Party, I must also point out that no other Arab country enjoys such a degree of plurality and as developed a civil society as Iran."
"The trade union scene mentioned by Mr Rouček definitely merits attention, as does the women's movement."
"In my opinion, Mr Rouček's proposals to establish a European Union representation in Tehran should be examined and supported."
"It is essential to develop these relations."
"Iran is a large nation and a great culture that has more similarities with us than we can imagine."
"Mr President, Iran remains a danger to the stability of the world and the Middle East."
"Iranian jihadis are fighting alongside terrorists in Iraq, killing British soldiers."
"Iran's judges routinely pass death sentences on homosexuals and teenagers."
"Why is Iran pressing ahead with uranium enrichment when it has no operational nuclear power stations or even plans to build them in the future?"
"Why is Iran developing Shahab III missiles with the potential to carry nuclear warheads and drop them on European cities?"
"Our message must be clear and uncompromising."
"Iran will not be allowed by the international community to arm itself with nuclear weapons."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this was, of course, a very important discussion."
"Why?"
"Because there is a huge civil society in Iran that certainly would like to have a different way of life, but there is still a very difficult regime."
"I think we all know that the nuclear issue is the huge stumbling block at this moment."
"It spoils all the possibilities for development and also for a bilateral relationship, which would have very great potential."
"This is what I said repeatedly to Mr Jalili: 'Why do you not take this?"
"Why is there no possibility of entering into a dialogue with you?"
"Why do you not show some political will on this?'"
"I think this is what we have to do - try to appeal to the population as well, to see if there is perhaps a chance to change things at the next elections - knowing that it will be very difficult."
"But I think it is interesting to see that the Opposition is, at least, coming together again."
"It has been split."
"It has been in a resigned mood."
"Now there is, at least, a new will to go for elections and perhaps change the situation, at least of the Government."
"But of course, as I said before, the screening of the candidates by the Council of Guardians is now under way and is crucial."
"As Ms Beer said, if 7 000 candidates can run for 290 seats, too many candidates have already been rejected."
"Two thousand of them will have been rejected."
"Therefore I strongly hope that an appeals procedure will indeed redress the situation."
"The Iranian electorate deserves to be able to choose its representatives from amongst a wide spectrum of parties and opinions."
"Of course it is clear that we are not supporting any specific party, but it is important that there is the establishment of a genuine pluralism."
"Having said this, I completely agree with all those - and I did not go into all the details - who said that we have to do a lot on the human rights front, even if we cannot go forward with regard to the nuclear issue."
"We have, of course, supported all the UN resolutions;"
"Canada has introduced such a resolution."
"This has been adopted, clearly showing where Iran - unfortunately - stands today."
"I would like to say, to some of the Members of Parliament who have mentioned that we should use the EIDHR instrument, that we are already using it via implementation through the UN, UNICEF and UNODC: for instance in the areas of juvenile justice and young people addicted to drugs, and on the question of justice."
"But it becomes more and more complicated in this very rigid atmosphere."
"I have been trying to have one diplomat in one Embassy in Tehran, to ensure a smoother coordination of joint projects."
"This is, of course, only a small step, but hopefully a meaningful one, which could pave the way, at least a little, for the development of our cooperation."
"Unfortunately, however, Iran remains evasive."
"Last week, when I personally mentioned this, I did not receive an answer."
"High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, very briefly as I had the opportunity to answer earlier."
"There are not many new questions and, as I have already said, we basically share the views expressed."
"Concerning a question put by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, a debate is now taking place in the Security Council, so I do not think I should be elaborating on that."
"You asked me what I would like to see."
"I would like to see a resolution which is not needed because the dialogue that we are asking for is a reality."
"You know which elements have to be put in place in order to have a meaningful dialogue."
"Concerning other reflections about enlarging cooperation, there are many other fields in which we can and should cooperate."
"Afghanistan and drugs have been mentioned."
"This is an important issue on which we would very much like to cooperate."
"Other questions have been put about the group of six in the United Nations."
"I cannot speak on behalf of anybody."
"I can speak only on behalf of the six with which I am negotiating. I have received support from everybody, from all the members of the group, including the European Union - there is no doubt about that - but also the other members of the Security Council who are not members of the European Union."
"(FR) In answer to the question from Mrs Béguin on nuclear energy, I do not want to enter into the debate on nuclear energy in general today."
"We shall have time to do that when we are talking about energy, but I shall explain to you the clear distinction between nuclear power for electricity generation and nuclear power for other uses, which you have indeed separated."
"The fundamental difference is that, in order to generate electricity, nuclear power needs to be enriched by X and the enrichment needed to manufacture weapons of mass destruction is far greater than that."
"The second question concerns waste."
"It is very important to know what is being done with this."
"You know that it contains plutonium and other materials that are usable."
"It is also the responsibility of the firms providing the technology to take all the waste."
"The situation is therefore quite different from the situation we have in mind when we talk about Iran and the autonomous enrichment process."
"In my first speech, I described the Iran that I should like to see. I think that that Iran is both possible and desirable and that Iran is a country we should engage with."
"It is a vibrant country that has many intellectual, cultural and other depths, and we should like to see it commit itself to working with us in several areas, including energy, human rights, the Middle East and nuclear energy."
"To do that, we need to start a really serious dialogue on all those issues."
"Thank you for your attention to this important debate. I shall be happy to come and talk to you about Iran or any other matters whenever I am invited."
"Thank you very much, Mr Solana."
"I have received six motions for resolutions, tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 31 January."
"Situation in Gaza (debate)"
"As the next item we have the statements on the situation in Gaza by the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and by the Commission."
"EU High Representative for CFSP. - (ES) Thank you, Mr President, for giving me the floor in this important debate which we are about to begin."
"Mr President, we are opening a debate on tragic events which have unfolded over recent weeks and days: the issue of Gaza, the issue of the borders between Gaza and Egypt and the border crossing points between Gaza and Israel."
"The outcome witnessed by us in recent days is tragic: there has been a very sharp deterioration in the humanitarian situation and even the security situation has worsened considerably."
"I believe that today's debate should be a debate on how we can contribute to resolving problems."
"We have had many debates in this Chamber on the problems of the past, and I believe that today we should see if we in the European Union are able to contribute to resolving this major issue (because it will also have an impact on the Annapolis Conference and the peace process)."
"I would like to point out once again that we, the European Union, have been consistent in calling for the border crossings to be opened and for there to be free movement of people and goods, subject to security guarantees, not only goods for humanitarian aid purposes, but goods which may assist in the economic development of the region, more specifically, the West Bank and Gaza."
"If those three basic elements - political development, economic development and changes in the situation on the ground - are lacking, it will be very difficult for us to move forward."
"Progress in these three fields must be made and that progress must be made in all three at the same time."
"What can we Europeans do?"
"Since the emergence of this new situation we have been in constant contact with the key players."
"As you know, on Sunday there was an important meeting of the Arab League where all the issues were raised and efforts were made to draw up a formula for a solution: a formula which is not too far removed from the one Minister Fayad put to the European Council a number of weeks ago and which he reiterated on Sunday at the Arab League Summit or the Ministerial meeting of the Arab League: a method must be sought of recovering control of the borders so that the Palestinian Authority can have responsibility for them."
"If this were to happen then in my opinion the European Union should raise the issue of Rafah again exactly as we did in 2005."
"As you know, we do not now have a physical presence there; we are available for deployment as soon as we are called upon but currently have no presence there; we have not been present on the border since Gaza came under the control of Hamas, because we were not given permission to be."
"I believe that what we would have to do would be to operate in accordance with the debate in the European Council on Monday and with the Council Resolutions, as I believe that Monday's resolutions are very good and have provided a sense of direction which has been welcomed by all parties: Egypt, the Palestinians and Israel."
"Therefore I believe we are on the right road."
"What we must do is work out how to ensure that the road we are setting out on in accordance with the Council resolutions can become a reality quickly."
"The human suffering being experienced is terrible: so is the human suffering in southern Israel which also comes under fire from rockets launched from northern Gaza, towards their own people, a factor which in point of fact make stability impossible."
"If we were to draw up a package covering all these matters, including the liberation of Al-Haram ash-Sharif, which must be included if our aim is to stabilise the situation, we could perhaps work together, and this is something I would very much like to do again, to resolve the situation."
"As I said, I am in constant contact with the most important players."
"I shall travel to Egypt as soon as the working sessions under way between the Palestinians and Egyptians, which started today, have finished."
"Tomorrow or the day after I shall be there so that I can take part too and outline the contribution which we in the European Union would be able to make."
"I honestly believe that the best solution would be to return to a more all-round situation in which the Palestinian Authority had control of borders and there was free movement of goods and people; not only for humanitarian aid but also for economic development and trade, which are necessary in order for genuine progress to be made."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are facing a very difficult situation because, as I said at the beginning, everything in the Middle East is bound up with everything else."
"If we cannot make progress towards resolving the Gaza issue then the peace process will also be in difficulties."
"Therefore there is a great responsibility on our shoulders; please be aware of what is ahead of us, and aware that we, the Commissioner and I, are going to do everything possible to dedicate the time left to us in these few weeks to see if we can help find a solution on behalf of the European Union."
"Mr President, I do not have anything much further to add except to express my wish to help achieve that end and to have the support of the Members of this House in achieving it."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I think that, when we were in Annapolis, there was a moment of hope."
"I always spoke of cautious optimism, knowing how difficult it would be to launch the bilateral negotiations between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas, and then we had what I would call a very successful pledging conference in Paris, where we saw so much support that we thought there was now real new momentum."
"But at the same time we always knew that this new momentum could derail at any moment."
"I think the situation in the Gaza and the large amount of violence that we have seen in January is one of those very difficult situations, among many other things - including the rocket and mortar attacks that have injured the Israeli civilian population - that could make the whole process derail."
"Of course, we understand the obligation of the State of Israel to defend its citizens."
"The Israeli military reaction has caused many deaths and injuries amongst the Gaza Palestinians."
"We have always said that civilian enclosure measures will not be feasible and have always spoken out for freedom of access and movement."
"These have taken a heavy toll on the Gaza civilian population."
"So it is no wonder that things went excessively far when people broke through the various fences and walls between Egypt and Gaza."
"The question now - and I completely support Javier Solana in this - is: what can we do in order to really make a difference again?"
"We had the EU BAM for Rafah there for a long time, but unfortunately in recent months they have not been able to do anything, so perhaps there is a chance for us Europeans to take this up again and to try to reach some sort of solution."
"I think it is good that Javier Solana is going to Egypt to start asking what we can do and perhaps to bring all the different parties together, which is very complicated."
"But I think it is also good to see that Salem Fayed has for some time been prepared to bring in the Palestinian Authority in order to control the borders, because this is also important."
"In the end, it is their own responsibility."
"In order to make that possible, I think that the European Union might again be a facilitating factor."
"Maybe we will not even be mediators there but facilitators."
"We had the first follow-up meeting in Paris very recently where Bernard Kouchner, the Norwegian Foreign Minister and also Tony Blair met."
"I am also one of the co-chairs of this Conference."
"We tried to see what could be done on the ground in order to make the situation move forward, not to have only negative experiences."
"We all decided to go for the so-called quick start projects - on security infrastructure, on the one hand, and on the other hand, on schools in particular, because this is an area where everybody can see, feel and maybe even smell that there is hope, that we want to instil hope, and that freedom of access and movement is indeed one of the necessary conditions, because otherwise economic development will not be able to take off."
"Therefore, we are in full support of this and are now trying to follow up this strategy."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, if I had to describe in a single word what we have seen over the last few days on the southern border of the Gaza Strip I would use the word 'despair'."
"Two years ago elections were held in Palestine."
"Several fellow Members of this Parliament - Mrs De Keyser, Mr McMillan-Scott and others - were present during that electoral process and today, two years later, the Palestine cause is in pieces and the situation is one of desolation, despondency and despair, which proves that consolidating a democracy does not mean only exercising the right to vote but that there must be representative institutions, a legitimate distribution of powers and respect for human rights, beginning with the right to life."
"The international community implored Hamas to renounce violence."
"They would not do so and for that reason remain on the European Union list of terrorist organisations."
"It is obvious that matters have not been conducted well on the other side either: Israel has welcomed the division in the Palestinian cause, has pursued its settlements policy, exercised indiscriminate repression and has also implemented a savage blockade which has achieved nothing apart from bolstering the Hamas organisation."
"What can we do?"
"I believe that Mr Solana has described things perfectly: support the High Representative's efforts, support the approach taken by the Naples Conference through the Quartet and the moderate Arab countries, and above all support a policy in respect of which I believe we should express our appreciation to the Commission and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, namely a policy which places human beings at the heart of European Union action, human beings who have been suffering, in pain, distressed and dying and, in my opinion, have unfortunately been doing so needlessly for a long time in the Middle East."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, all walls eventually collapse: the walls of Jericho, the wall of the Warsaw Ghetto, the Berlin Wall, the Atlantic Wall, the wall of indifference."
"The Rafah Wall, with its symbolic significance, is part of this blind urge man has to be free."
"What did the people of Gaza do, though, with their newfound freedom?"
"Did they escape to Egypt?"
"Did they arm themselves with Kalashnikovs?"
"No, because unfortunately weapons always reach their destination, without or without a wall."
"They went to stock up with emergency goods."
"They went to shop, to buy medicines and milk for the babies, which is not available in Gaza."
"Mopeds, goats and cattle were hoisted into Rafah by cranes, to the cheers of the crowd."
"It was a surreal sight."
"After that, everyone went home."
"These images say it all: what was previously impossible was suddenly within their grasp, and then they returned to their everyday lives."
"We now have a historic responsibility."
"The question is no longer who is going to open up the gates of an outdoor prison, but who is going to shut them again, to return the people of Gaza to their slow suffocation."
"Since the start of Annapolis, the European Union has lost its touch. Because of the road map, it handed over control of the peace process to the United States."
"Securing the joint presidency of the Conference of Donors in Paris was a real achievement."
"Well done!"
"Europeans have, however, had a mandate for access to Gaza since 2005."
"Are we, together with the Egyptians, the Palestinian Authority, Hamas and Israel, going to be able to reopen the dialogue and manage access to the outside world for the Palestinians, or are we on the other hand going to look on as observers of the repression that will inevitably come?"
"That is the whole issue."
"Apart from the task of the EU BAM, this involves the future of Palestinian unity and the peace process, respect for international law and the reputation of the European Union."
"On behalf of my group, I want to give Mr Solana a very clear message: for goodness' sake, press ahead!"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, as a member of Parliament's delegation to the Palestinian Legislative Council, I have been trying to work out why, when we call for an end to settlement building, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing."
"Why, when we call for the removal of the checkpoints, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing."
"Why, when we call to an end to the collective punishment of people in Gaza, the Israelis ignore us and we do nothing."
"So I am really grateful to Marc Otte, the EU Special Representative to the Middle East, who came to a meeting of the delegation yesterday and said that our policy - Europe's policy - is to follow the leadership given by America."
"Now, just a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister of Israel said of President Bush, 'He is not doing a single thing that I do not agree to."
"He does not support anything that I oppose."
"He does not say a thing that he thinks will make life harder for Israel.'"
"So, American policy is Israeli policy, and we Europeans play follow the leader."
"So, no wonder our condemnation of Israeli actions sounds so hollow to Palestinians."
"And no wonder it is so lacking in success."
"This European approach led to us sponsoring the elections in Palestine two years go, but then refusing to pay heed to the result - undermining our support for democracy across the Middle East."
"This approach has led to us calling for the formation of a Palestinian Unity Government - and when a unity government was formed, we refused to talk to the Prime Minister and half the cabinet, and the government collapsed."
"This approach has meant that we refuse to talk to representatives of Hamas in Gaza, even though they are the real power in that area."
"What lessons from our history have we learnt?"
"Is it not time that Europe cut the strings that blind us and tie us to this one-sided policy of America and Israel?"
"Is it not time we spoke with independence and acted with vision?"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, taking a whole people hostage has been a failure."
"It is a lesson from another era that could not work, but the worst part of it is that the situation has become worse, politically and in human terms."
"We do therefore have to ask ourselves questions."
"The policy of isolating Hamas and thereby isolating Gaza has failed."
"Hamas is now more popular than ever."
"It is very strange: Mr Solana and the Commissioner said that the Palestinians have to regain control on the borders, but how can the Palestinian Authority regain power in Gaza?"
"The West Bank is not the borders."
"That is one problem."
"The other problem is the borders of Gaza."
"Besides that, there is an agreement between Egypt and Israel, under which the Egyptians in Sinai are not allowed to be armed."
"That is the agreement dating from 20 years ago, from the peace treaty."
"Even if the Egyptians wanted to stop terrorists in Sinai, they are therefore not allowed to."
"The situation is thus totally crazy and it is true that in this crazy situation we have to assume our responsibilities."
"The first responsibility is for the people of Gaza to be able to live and for that we have to negotiate with those holding the administrative power in Gaza."
"We cannot say, 'We want to give them food and drink, we want to give them medicines, but we do not want to talk to those who can have the medicines taken to them'."
"Secondly, it has to be said that the Palestinians will believe in peace when peace gives them something."
"On the West Bank at the moment, there has been no improvement with the borders, or with freedom of movement."
"Peace is concrete, not abstract."
"The rockets are not going to stop in the current situation, and if Israel is to be secure we therefore have to say to it, 'The blockade is making life impossible for the Palestinians and that is endangering the security of Israel'."
"That is the truth."
"We also have to say to Mr Bush: 'In any case you will not be there in a few months' time."
"So keep quiet and leave the politics to other people who have a better understanding of the situation'."
"Whether Israeli policy follows American policy or vice versa, they are a failure and we cannot support them."
"It is therefore not enough for the European Union to say 'Press ahead' it needs to say, 'Press ahead in the right direction, talk to those who are in charge, and talk to the Israeli leaders'."
"It needs to say that our solidarity with Israel does not mean that we shall go on supporting it in a totally suicidal policy."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, the heroes of Gaza have once again proven that no fortified wall can imprison the free spirit of humanity and no form of violence can subdue life."
"I am quoting from the speech made at the gates of Gaza last Saturday by the Israeli peace campaigner and Sakharov prizewinner Nurit Peled, who was there with other Palestinian and Israeli demonstrators."
"It is impossible not to sympathise with the emotion felt by this Mother Courage at the sight of these people, oppressed and humiliated to an intolerable degree, forcing their way through the blockade imposed by Israel and finally breathing fresh air, with time to find milk for the children, food for the family and a little happiness to bolster their morale."
"What happens now?"
"We can all see the dual threat that is looming from the Israeli leaders."
"Firstly, the intention to use force to close off this small free space, or have it closed off again."
"The second, more general, threat is to get rid of the responsibility of the occupying power for Gaza and hand it over to Egypt."
"If the true words of the Council statement of 28 January are to have any real import, the European Union must agree to put more pressure on the Israeli authorities than the usual tortuous circumlocutions, directly and in the Quartet, to accept the principle of the transit points being opened up permanently, under the responsibility of the Palestinian authority and with the support of the European Union and the Arab League."
"If the Palestinian Authority continues to be deprived of any possibility of offering its people the slightest hope for the future and working towards the national Palestinian reconciliation that is needed, that would be to accept the worst possible scenario."
"I am afraid we are headed that way fast at the moment."
"We all know that an impetus is needed from the international community on Gaza and on the West Bank, including East Jerusalem."
"That impetus will not come from a worn-out and discredited American president."
"It is up to Europe to act."
"Mr President, Gaza remains a human tragedy, and none of us in this House can blame its long-suffering Palestinian citizens from rushing through the Rafah border-crossing breech in the wall to buy goods in Egypt."
"Nevertheless, EU-banned terrorist organisation Hamas remains in brutal control of the territory and of the citizens of Gaza, and Hamas has continued the indiscriminate war crime, in my view, of launching Qassam rockets on Israeli civilians, including recently their longer-range version on Ashkelon."
"This means that you cannot blame Israel for maintaining an economic blockade, allowing in only essential humanitarian aid."
"I am sorry, Mr Davies; I am sorry, Mr Cohn-Bendit: if Hamas stops the rockets, Israel will lift the blockade - it is as simple as that."
"Mr President, the separation in fact of Gaza from the West Bank on the one hand complicates even further an already complex picture."
"But, on the other hand, it simplifies it."
"Let me explain myself regarding the latter."
"First, it facilitated dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian authority from the West Bank."
"Second, it contained an Islamic radical militancy allowing a clear approach to it because, on the one hand, we have the Hamas radical leaders and the rest of the population, and, in that respect, it is no secret whom we have to support."
"Third, arising from that, instead of two factors in the equation (one very clear - Israel - the other, the Palestinians, a bit blurred), now we have three clearly defined factors - Gaza included - in an equation with a multiplication sign between its factors, meaning that if any one is zero, the product is zero."
"(ES) Mr President, just a few very specific questions: how can we go back to the EU BAM to the Rafah crossing point, given the insecurity of the previous situation?"
"This is an unarmed European corps!"
"If a single shot is fired, if a situation arises where there is the tiniest chink in security, will all the police officers return to their hotel in Ashkelon?"
"How can we negotiate an agreement with the Palestinians, Egypt and Israel to change this situation?"
"If we are unable to do so there will be little point in going back to the previous situation, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has said."
"We must have a situation which is insecurity-proof."
"Next, how can we move towards peace without dealing with the situation in Gaza?"
"The Naples process glossed over the Gaza situation, and I believe that this attitude is impossible to maintain: it is impossible for any Palestinian authority to exist which can put up with the insecurity in Gaza while there is no peace."
"Finally, I would like to ask about medium-term solutions for supplying water and energy in Gaza."
"Would it not be possible to propose solutions in the frontier zone between Gaza and Egypt on similar lines to the proposal on installing desalination and energy generation plants?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday a child died in the Shifa hospital in Gaza, and 80 are dead in the Gaza hospital because they were unable to go to Israel for treatment."
"Today the Israeli court of justice ruled in favour of the government, i.e. Barak, as regards blocking and reducing fuel supplies."
"This is the current situation."
"Mr Solana asked: what can we Europeans do?"
"The Commissioner said that we should make a difference."
"Truth can make the difference."
"The difference is the courage not just to say: I know that you have an enormous task, that you are always working, that you are suffering with us for the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis, but there is also, for pity's sake, a need to do something!"
"We must tell the Israeli government in no uncertain terms that, if it wants to help Salam Fayyad and Mahmoud Abbas, it should not only stop the blockade of Gaza, but it should stop killing young boys as it did yesterday in Bethlehem and it should stop shutting Palestinians in the ghetto in the West Bank."
"It is not just Gaza."
"Gaza has become the dominant picture, but the occupation continues every day."
"Peace is essential for everyone, it is essential both for the Palestinians and for the Israelis."
"We must block ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, it is good that we are able to conduct this debate so soon after the horrific events in the Gaza Strip."
"It is also good that Parliament has this opportunity to outline its position to Mr Solana and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"At the same time, it is important that we take this opportunity to inform ourselves more fully."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit said that it was not enough to provide food but that we had to talk too."
"We now have new mechanisms like the Pegasus programme that can foster more fruitful dialogue and cooperation."
"Perhaps the Commissioner can give us more information about these."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I wholeheartedly agree with fellow Members who have said that the time is past for merely expressing concern about the dramatic events and the humanitarian situation in Gaza, and that simply providing money is not enough."
"On the contrary, I think that the situation in Gaza and the blockade have to be seen in the context of the overall conflict between Israel and Palestine."
"The Palestinians have clearly placed all their hope in the EU to come up with results at last."
"A lot of promises have been made in the past, but we can see that in actual fact the EU, in the follow-up to implementation of the Annapolis Conference negotiations, and in the UN, is failing to step up to the mark as an active mediator."
"I think this is unacceptable, and the EU can no longer allow itself to be sidelined by the United States, but must adopt an independent stance."
"(GA) Mr President, I have listened carefully to Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner , but I do not think that it is good enough to speak of facilitation or encouragement when the Israeli Government is pursuing the kind of policy that we have seen on the border between Gaza and Egypt."
"The European institutions have to act; they have to take a stand against the Israeli Government and say loud and clear that they are opposed to the inhuman blockade that is choking the life out of the Gaza Strip."
"This policy is utterly cruel and inimical to the entire population under Israeli occupation."
"Action of this sort cannot be justified in the 21st century."
"And it is preposterous for Israel to claim to be merely defending itself when ordinary Palestinians are seeking a life free of the suffering being inflicted on them."
"We have to act instead of spending days, weeks, and months on end doing nothing but talking."
"(EL) Mr President, the events in Gaza are tragic and all my fellow Members have expressed their shock."
"These events are also regrettable for the European Union."
"Not only are we suffering from political weakness, but I also do not know how we can honour our commitments in contributing effective financial assistance and humanitarian aid where we are committed."
"TIM is developing into PEGASE, and we are investing in human resources, mechanisms and Community resources."
"The question is, how can we be successful at this point."
"Have you any news, Commissioner?"
"Is humanitarian aid reaching Gaza?"
"Is cooperation taking place with Israel, even if only on this issue?"
"Can the Palestinian Authority contribute in any way to smoothing the path and facilitating humanitarian aid?"
"PEGASE ought, logically, to be implemented tomorrow."
"Your services have invested in the detail, in planning and in human resources."
"How can we live up to this vision and these resources, Commissioner?"
"(EL) Mr President, the situation in Gaza demands the immediate lifting of the Israeli blockade."
"Assistance has to be provided to the people of Gaza in order to tackle their immediate needs."
"The Arab League, the European Union and even Israel must facilitate contact between Fatah and Hamas in order to achieve unity among the Palestinian people, as was the case when the government of national unity was in power."
"For this to happen, all Palestinian elected representatives who are members of Hamas must be released from Israeli jails."
"The right conditions must be created to hold general elections. Both the European Union and the United States must be clearly committed to abiding fully by the election result, whatever it might be."
"Member of the Commission. - (DE) Allow me to restate briefly my position on this truly thorny issue, which we discussed at length once again in the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday."
"I must tell you, though it goes without saying, that we do not confine ourselves to discussion: together with the United States, the Palestinians and the Israelis and, of course, with the United Nations and Russia too in the Quartet framework, the European Union has played its part in the adoption of a joint strategy."
"I previously referred, albeit very briefly in connection with Annapolis, to one aspect of this strategy, namely the bilateral negotiating process between President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert."
"The other aspect, which has more to do with me in the Commission, is the effort to generate a new development that will bring progress for the people, and I am fully aware of the enormity of that task."
"I have always been acutely aware of the difficulties, but we naturally wanted to make every effort to help, and that remains our position."
"For this reason, the thrust of our policy is to support Mr Abbas in his efforts to bring about peace through his talks with a view to using that peace to foster a process of conciliation with Hamas."
"That was the underlying idea of the strategy."
"We still intend to support further meetings too."
"In the last few days there has been a meeting between Mr Olmert and Mr Abbas."
"We know that it did not achieve much in terms of substance, but this is understandable, since all meetings at the present time are overshadowed by what is a very fraught situation."
"We must nevertheless keep pursuing this approach."
"We still have the means to open a few doors in time for the next meeting in Moscow if we assist both parties."
"That is one side of the coin."
"The other side is the humanitarian and economic perspective."
"On this point, I should like to say the following to those that might not have read my statement: on 21 January, I delivered a very clear position statement on the situation in Gaza, because I, too, realised that things had simply gone too far."
"Together with other statements from foreign ministers and international organisations, it has helped to improve the situation."
"The blockade, of course, has not been fully lifted, but the situation has improved considerably."
"Accordingly, on the humanitarian side - and this also answers your question, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou - many deliveries are now actually arriving in Gaza."
"We are none the less aware that this is not enough. And I myself am aware, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that we face an extremely daunting task."
"You are entirely correct in saying that it is an extremely difficult situation; the High Representative is fully aware of that, and he will perhaps comment on it too."
"Nevertheless, for the time being we shall continue to pursue the common strategy which we have jointly defined and intend to implement jointly, and we have no option but to press for the opening of the border, which Salam Fayyad himself, as you know, regards as a crucial step."
"Let me just say a brief word on the mechanism we devised, which will actually become operational in two days' time, on the first of February."
"It is a permanent mechanism, unlike the previous TIM, the Temporary International Mechanism, which we had to keep extending."
"For good reasons, the new mechanism has also been created in partnership with the Palestinian Authority."
"We worked very closely with Mr Fayyad on the project so that the result would match his requirement for a development and progress plan for Palestine's economy and, of course, for its infrastructure."
"This should be a common European effort, by which I mean that the mechanism - a financial mechanism - can be used not only by ourselves but also by Member States."
"The idea, indeed, is that some international organisations and non-European countries should also be able, in principle, to avail themselves of this mechanism."
"Like TIM, it offers full supervision and monitoring, because we naturally want to meet all the transparency criteria, and it is designed either to provide direct budgetary aid, to channel aid through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and other organisations or to fund our projects."
"I am aware, however, that this question currently takes a back seat behind the major political question, namely what we can do to resolve the current situation."
"I am, of course, fully conscious of the problem, but at the present juncture this is the only answer I can give you."
"High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. - Mr President, I have been listening with great attention to what has been said."
"I could say the same and say it with the same emotion and with the same sentiment, because our sentiments are shared."
"But you are saying we have to act and not to talk."
"Do you think that action will change our policy 180 degrees today?"
"I do not really know if that is a sensible approach, to tell you the truth."
"What has happened in the last few days, apart from the humanitarian drama?"
"We can talk for hours and really express our sentiments, because we have the same sentiments as you - at least I have - and I am sure the Commissioner has the same."
"Earlier in the week, only a few hours after the tension erupted, the Arab League met."
"They took a decision, a decision that was supported by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday, a decision that we are going to try to implement in the coming hours after a meeting taking place this morning between the Palestinian Authority and Egypt - which is continuing as we are speaking now and which will continue during the night and probably tomorrow or the day after tomorrow - when they have reached the point where we can really be of effect."
"But I think that a month after the Paris Conference, a month and a half since the Annapolis Conference, when all the Arab countries are engaged, when other countries are playing for the first time a constructive role, I think we have to adapt in that direction."
"Now it would not be serious on our part to play a role alone."
"We have to play a role along with all the partners that are there."
"We are supporting - and the Council's conclusions are very clear on that - the resolution of the Arab League of Sunday as far as the borders are concerned, and that was proved on Monday."
"We are following the discussions on Wednesday and Thursday."
"I think this is action, but I do not know what I can do."
"It is a different story if you ask me to"
"(FR) 'press ahead in the right direction'. That means we are going in the wrong direction at the moment."
"(Interruption by Mr Cohn-Bendit: '... unknown direction ...')"
"Mr President, I think that if Mr Cohn-Bendit,"
"a distinguished Member of the Parliament, says that the strategy of the European Union today is 'inconnue', je ne comprends rien."
"You can say whatever you want."
"You can say that the strategy of the European Union today after Annapolis, after having chaired the Paris Conference, after having supported the Arab League is 'inconnue', you can say other things, but I do not think that 'inconnue' can be sustained."
"You may not like it -"
"(Objection)"
"You may not be in agreement, but it is very difficult to say that it is not known."
"I share many of the sentiments you have expressed very eloquently."
"And I could say that you have, we have, responsibilities in the coming days and hours that we are going to tackle."
"Are we able to resolve the situation?"
"I do not know."
"You do not know."
"But you can be sure that we are going to try, and we are going to try to support Mr Fayyad, because he has been our interlocutor all this period of time."
"He is a man of goodwill, which is why we cannot let him down."
"I am not going to let him down."
"Therefore we have to continue working in this direction."
"There will be frustrations."
"It will be frustrating."
"Are we going to solve all the problems?"
"I do not know."
"But we are going to try with all our energy and our best will."
"I share all the sentiments that have been expressed."
"I would not say more deeply but at least at the same depth as you, all our friends here, because we are on the same side, we have been engaged in this battle for a long time together."
"Therefore there is no difference in sentiment, and we have to continue what we have been doing."
"I think we have to move in that direction."
"I promise you that I will go there."
"I will try to meet with the Egyptians, the Saudis and everybody - the Americans, the Russians, everybody - to see if we can come up with something that cannot be the same."
"It has to be something collectively different."
"Otherwise I think we will not be able to produce any results."
"You may say that you have not seen results in several years."
"Since 1967 we have not produced a result, collectively, as an international community."
"That is true."
"That is our responsibility."
"But I do not think we can resolve the problem tomorrow by taking a decision now which is different to the one we took in the Council on Monday."
"We now have a structure from the European Council on Monday and we must try to implement it."
"I would be happy to return and talk to you and express very frankly, as we doing here, the consequences of our acts."
"But please do not think that we do not have the same sentiments."
"We do."
"We have experience of the situation there and we cannot say more."
"Concerning action, be sure that we are going to do as much as we can."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the February part-session."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) Thank you, Mr President."
"This House has, in long debates, discussed the Israeli-Palestinian issue too many times."
"We should, however, recognise that, objectively speaking, the role that the European Union has managed to play to date as regards this situation has been altogether marginal: so many proclamations, declarations of intent, motions and documents but, in truth, very little consistency as far as actions are concerned."
"I recently visited Palestine and I found an atmosphere of distress, disillusionment and resignation among the people, who are tired of years of broken promises: the situation is becoming worse and there is a serious risk of driving the Palestinian territories into the arms of Hamas extremists."
"The air that you breathe there is heavy, and recourse to violence seems almost unavoidable."
"Just now, time is really running out: either Europe will have the strength and the capability to turn this situation around or we shall, all of us, bear the responsibility of not having done enough to avert the worst."
"in writing. - As my colleague Michael Gahler has said, the current resolution is following the line of six powers to keep up pressure on Iran."
"As I see it, the practical problem is how this resolution will be perceived by the Iranian regime."
"In a situation where the big players in international politics are not willing or able to agree on applying serious sanctions to Iran, there is hardly any chance that this resolution will make a difference."
"However, there is still one way - as yet untried - to make an impact."
"This is to give a chance to the Iranian opposition movement by ending its political suppression by EU governments."
"The European Court of First Instance in December 2006, and the British courts last November, ruled that there are absolutely no grounds to isolate the Iranian opposition like this."
"Freeing the hands of Iranian opposition for peaceful activities will provide the EU not only with efficient leverage to influence the regime of mullahs but will open a third and more realistic option between wishful diplomacy, on the one hand, and USA-type military intervention on the other."
"If our sincere intention is to bring about a positive change in Iran, let us give this third option a chance."
"US anti-missile defence system (debate)"
"The next item concerns the declaration of the Council and the Commission on the US anti-missile defence system."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) The Council did not discuss the installation of the US anti-missile defence system on the territory of the European Union."
"Therefore, I am sorry that I am unable to give the Council's opinion on this matter, but I would like to remind you that the decision on any installation of any armed forces or military equipment rests within the national competence of each Member State."
"For that reason the Member States make decisions on such matters independently."
"Allow me to clarify: there have not been any discussions so far between the European Union and the United States of America on the installation of the anti-missile system."
"Also, neither party has planned for a possible cooperation in this area."
"The Council of the European Union did not therefore plan for talks to discuss this matter, either with the United States of America or with the NATO Alliance."
"As we know, anti-missile defence is a subject of cooperation within NATO as well as within NATO-Russian Federation Council."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will be very brief today, because the Commission has very little competence in this matter."
"But let me say that interaction between the United States of America, Russia and the EU Member States in the areas of security and defence has wider implications for these important partnerships."
"That is clear."
"Therefore, although, as I said, we really do not have competence or responsibility in this question, we hope that a balanced solution can be found that is, in the end, satisfactory for all."
"We have welcomed, from the very beginning, the high-level talks that started in Moscow last October, followed by expert meetings."
"And we see in the recent direct dialogue between Moscow and Warsaw an opportunity to clarify respective positions in respect of national sovereignty."
"In conclusion, in whatever forum these issues are discussed, be it NATO or be it the OSCE, I think it would be important that decisions on the future of the European security architecture should also involve the European Union."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we in Europe talk of anti-missile defence, the discussion normally revolves around the United States' planned installations in Poland and the Czech Republic."
"Many people are unaware that these are merely extensions to an existing system designed to protect the United States of America."
"We in the European Parliament, however, must focus first and foremost on its implications for the security of the continent of Europe."
"As we know, the United States has already spent more than 100 billion dollars on its anti-missile defence system and is investing a further ten billion a year in the continuing development of the system."
"Yet the United States is much further away from potential sources of danger than we are in Europe."
"The present situation is rather like Luxembourg spending money to build dykes but the Netherlands seeing no need to do likewise."
"We must ask ourselves whether a threat actually exists and, if so, whether we need to respond to it."
"The debate we have just heard with Mr Solana shows that the situation in Iran remains a source of concern."
"We are also aware of the threat that could emanate from the unstable situation in Pakistan."
"We in the Subcommittee on Security and Defence have engaged in intensive dialogue with representatives of the United States, including Lieutenant General Henry Obering, Director of the Missile Defense Agency."
"It emerged clearly from these talks that the US system would be able, in theory, to protect part of Europe but not the whole continent."
"In particular, it could not protect Cyprus, Malta, parts of Greece, Romania, Bulgaria or southern Italy."
"From a European point of view, however, we cannot tolerate a division of our continent into areas with differing degrees of security. Accordingly, we must jointly define our common European security interests in this context."
"The present appraisal reminds us that there is currently no forum in which this matter is being discussed and in which these common European security interests are being defined."
"This is clearly another area where very close coordination with Russia is needed."
"We expect NATO's Bucharest summit in April to present proposals for a joint system, and we expect these proposals to take due account of our specific European security interests."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, this is not the first time that we have discussed this issue; it is also not the first time that we have had the same answers from the Council, which says that it has no competence here, as does the Commission, although - and I must congratulate the Commissioner for this - she did say at the end that things need to be organised differently in the European Union."
"If something happens that affects the security of all Europeans, and that comes under the security strategy that Mr Solana described to us, we need to be able to talk to each other about it."
"Parliament fortunately is able to talk about it."
"This is an issue that concerns both the citizens and the Member States of the European Union, so we feel it is entirely proper that it should be on the agenda."
"I do not intend to go back over all the objections that our Group has already voiced against this plan that the Americans have come up with."
"What we think is wrong is that bilateral negotiations are going on with two NATO Member States which - coincidentally or otherwise - are also Member States of the European Union, and this affects relations with Russia, including the European Union's relations with it."
"It is also wrong that the system is being developed unilaterally, albeit within NATO, and that it has not been clearly explained exactly why the system is necessary, whether it will work and whether it is becoming too costly."
"There is an interesting debate going on in Poland at the moment, where the new government has said that it may be prepared to cooperate on the system, but that this is because it is what the Americans want and because it is America's security at stake rather than Poland's. After all, the system is actually more of a threat than an improvement to Poland's security."
"This is why the Poles are also asking for more help with developing air defences for the Polish army, for example, creating a sort of arms race."
"So it is interesting that the debate has restarted in Poland on whether the system is useful or necessary, and that the new Polish prime minister or at least the Polish foreign minister has had the guts to talk to Russia about it."
"We wholeheartedly support this."
"The situation is rather different in the Czech Republic, where we have the impression that the system and the Czech contribution to it are being pushed through against the will of the people, since I believe that 70% of Czechs are against the development of the system."
"I therefore fear that there are moves afoot to push through decisions this year, to conclude agreements with Poland and the Czech Republic, before a new administration - hopefully - takes over in the United States."
"We know that the democrats are fairly sceptical about developing the Air Missile System."
"In any event, we hope that there will be a discussion in the Council, and we urge that this issue be taken very seriously."
"If it goes through, it is bound to have an impact on our already difficult relationship with Russia."
"The public are anxious."
"What we have is a new arms race, and there are a number of other things that we think the European Parliament simply has to speak out about."
"We have done so in the past, and we should carry on doing it."
"I think that our main role is to see whether this is necessary, whether it is the start of a new arms race, whether it really will improve security and whether it really will help us to combat the 'rogue states'."
"I am still not convinced that the Iranians will have the capacity to fire missiles as quickly as the Americans claim."
"This is something else we have had contradictory information about."
"So I hope that we can take the discussion forward on this issue here in Parliament, and also monitor what is happening in the Czech Republic and Poland."
"My Group remains opposed to the system."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FI) Mr President, the biggest threat to humanity is not the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries."
"The real problem is the existence of nuclear weapons generally."
"The only ethical and permanent option in our approach to anti-missile defence systems and other nuclear weapons systems is to abandon their use."
"The EU too should commit to new agreements controlling armament and be proactive in its attempt to initiate the disarmament process."
"America's anti-missile defence system would increase the risk of nuclear war."
"The nuclear shield planned for Poland and the Czech Republic is based on the assumption that a nuclear war can be won."
"The type of anti-missile defence practised by the United States is radically different from its earlier deterrent policy, because the aim of that was to prevent one country from taking its revenge on another."
"The former deterrent effect of nuclear armament is thus out of the picture."
"The balance of fear therefore disappears."
"That is why an US anti-missile system in Poland or the Czech Republic is a crucial matter of concern for the whole of Europe and all its Member States."
"That being so, it is important that the EU should debate the matter and make known the concerns of its citizens."
"We should really also be considering here whether this will improve security in Europe and Europe's defence, or whether it will go the other way, with the new system actually weakening security in Europe."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Ladies and gentlemen, at times President Putin's rhetoric reminds us of the possibility of Russia aiming its missiles at Europe."
"This proves that there is a certain strategic balance between the United States and Russia."
"There is, however, no such balance between Europe and Russia."
"Nor can this be ensured by France's and Great Britain's 'nuclear umbrellas'."
"I therefore believe it is right to ask how Europe's rather than the United States' joint missile defence can be ensured."
"Are we discussing these issues only because the United States takes care of its own defence?"
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, members of the Commission and the European Union are not even concerned about this form of defence."
"Do you not think that it is only natural for the United States, NATO and also certain Member States to decide on this together?"
"I believe that the European Union must formulate an unequivocal position that should then be executed together with NATO and the United States."
"Otherwise, we should not waste our time here because everything will be decided by NATO."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I admit that that is undoubtedly the new European policy."
"It reminds me of my son when he was four years old."
"When you asked him, 'Where are you?' he would put his hands over his eyes and say, 'I'm not here'."
"That is what the Commission is saying to us: 'We are not here."
"It has nothing to do with us or with Europe'."
"(DE) I am sorry, but that is absolute nonsense."
"We have to decide now whether we want a common European foreign and security policy."
"We even have a new treaty that gives us our own foreign minister with responsibility for a common foreign and security policy, and when we have a common foreign minister we shall surely have to discuss matters at the European level, not as individual governments discussing their countries' security with other individual governments, or like Mr von Wogau, who maintains that Europe is threatened by Iran or goodness knows what other countries."
"I do not share that view, and at the very least we must discuss things at the European level."
"We cannot simply say that the Americans have hit on some hare-brained scheme, that George Bush will no longer be in office six months from now, so they might drop their hare-brained scheme, but we Europeans have nothing to do with all of this."
"We are highly sceptical about this whole anti-missile defence strategy, but we firmly believe it is something that we Europeans are duty-bound to discuss."
"It is not a decision for the Polish or Czech Members or for Members of any particular nationality - Romanians and Bulgarians tomorrow, Sicilians the next day or whatever."
"No, we have a common interest in taking decisions about our security."
"That is essentially laid down in the Treaty that you have ratified and that we intend to ratify, in the provisions on a common foreign and security policy."
"Accordingly, this issue must be a matter for the European Union."
"The decision must not be taken bilaterally between Poland and the United States or between the Czech Republic and the United States."
"It is a European decision. It is a European problem, and we must find a European solution."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased that the issue of installing American anti-missile defence tools in the Czech Republic and Poland, i.e. on European Union territory, is being dealt with by the European Parliament, which is the most democratic institution given that it is directly elected by the citizens of the Union, whom this issue affects."
"In this context I would like to stress that I am supported by my colleagues in the GUE/NGL Group and I also draw on my own experience as a military expert; but most importantly I am supported by the majority of citizens in my country, where 70% of the population are against the installation of the American radar system."
"The American anti-missile defence is presented to us as a defence shield, so why was the Czech Republic, for example, not allowed to sell the Tamara passive radar detection system without active military components to China?"
"The reason given was that China would gain an inadequate advantage in its relations with other countries."
"Is this not a manipulation of words?"
"Is not the real issue of stationing the radar in the Czech Republic also about gaining advantage?"
"Even a layman can understand what warriors had known long before Hannibal: a shield in a soldier's hand is a means for a better and more efficient use of his sword."
"The talk is about increased security but is the issue not really about increasing security risks?"
"It is only logical that we will immediately become target number one for potential adversaries."
"We are told that we should oblige the US in order to prove that we are good allies."
"Canada has not obliged either: does that make it a bad US ally?"
"Is it not the case that Canada has perhaps learned a lesson from the purpose-built justification for military action in Iraq?"
"We are surprised at Russia's reaction."
"However, given that the US unilaterally withdrew from the ABM Treaty and acts in its own interest, this reaction is not illogical."
"Was the United States happy years ago about the close proximity of Soviet missiles in Cuba?"
"There is no doubt that the US is a superpower, and its views, proposals and requests cannot be swept off the table just like that."
"However, if we are really concerned about greater security, especially in Europe, then the road to it follows a more complicated path via negotiations and agreements, not unilateral steps."
"This is the responsibility not only of the major players - the US and Russia - but of the European Union too."
"(CS) There is huge proliferation of medium and medium-long range carriers at the start of the 21st century."
"Unfortunately, in the absence of an international security regime the only way to stop it through effective defence."
"Effective defence is the paramount right of the EU Member States."
"The SOFA negotiations that are currently taking place in Prague are a legitimate right of the Czech Republic."
"Because the radar situated on Czech Republic territory will ensure the security of many European countries and because this will be the first opportunity for the Czech Republic, a country that had been occupied for many years, to actively contribute towards European security, the Czech Government must be extremely responsible in its actions."
"The anti-missile defence system must be trustworthy and defensive and must respect the indivisibility of security."
"We thus welcome information about the Bucharest summit, where a decision on the construction of a complementary LTBMD system should be made."
"Moving negotiations to NATO guarantees implementation of indivisibility."
"Making it clear that this is a purely defensive system is the subject of American-Polish-Czech-Russian negotiations."
"My final point concerns effectiveness."
"Taking into account what we know about Iran's November tests, we must realise that we have a common responsibility."
"We must not ruin the effectiveness of our common defence with quarrels over whether we should defend ourselves at all."
"(CS) Allow me to make use of this one-minute speech to call on the Council of the European Union and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy to discuss the American anti-missile defence system at European level."
"The installation of the American anti-missile defence system in Europe is a pan-European issue."
"It is not just a matter for Czechs, Poles or Americans."
"Intra-European Union relations, EU-NATO relations, EU-US relations and EU-Russia relations are all at stake."
"I would therefore ask that this issue be included in the Council's agenda."
"As far as the Czech Republic is concerned, I would like to mention one fact: 70% of the citizens of the Czech Republic are opposed to this system."
"Three quarters of the citizens of the Czech Republic want a referendum on the subject."
"The Czech Government does not communicate with the public; the Czech Government does not inform the Members of the Czech Parliament, the Czech Government does everything behind the backs of the Czech people."
"It is important to know this and it must be highlighted in the Council of the European Union."
"(PL) Mr President, may I first remind everyone that the missile defence shield is not only an issue for Poland and the Czech Republic: it concerns the United Kingdom and Denmark too, since facilities in both those countries are also to be included in the system."
"So let us not talk only about Poland or the Czech Republic."
"The second point is that the missile defence shield, and the installations that form part of it, will not be a magnet for terrorists."
"Terrorists strike at soft targets, not well-defended military bases."
"Finally, a third point. The European Union is not a military ally."
"Perhaps it is pity that it isn't, but that is the fact of the matter, and the new treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon, changes nothing in that respect."
"That being so, a defence issue is either NATO's responsibility or the responsibility of countries that have not decided to join an alliance and wish to defend themselves separately."
"Obviously, there has to be a discussion in NATO about how this system should fit into other systems that NATO intends to develop. That is absolutely essential."
"Let us not forget that 21 countries in the European Union are members of NATO."
"(DE) Mr President, one of the supreme anti-war novels is about the good soldier Schweik, by Jaroslav Hašek."
"The position adopted by the Commission and the Council, however, outshines Schweik; it outdoes Franz Kafka too, and it even outdoes any ostrich. We cannot pursue this head-in-the-sand policy."
"We must discuss this issue among ourselves, on the floor of the European Parliament, but we must also discuss it, of course, with the members of NATO."
"We must discuss it with the Czechs, the Poles and the Russians."
"This is an essential process that must be conducted on a pan-European scale."
"(DE) Mr President, the technical function of the planned anti-missile system is to take out a potential enemy's second-strike capability - of that there is no doubt."
"In other words, it is also an attack system."
"This must be taken into account in the debate."
"Whether the missile system is set up by the United States, by NATO together with the United States or by any other combination, it remains an arms programme."
"The salient point for me is that the European Union is unable to come up with a common position on the issue."
"In this matter the common foreign and security policy of the European Union is being exposed to ridicule."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit can cite the Reform Treaty until the cows come home - as long as the present situation continues and no common position is adopted at all, the Union will simply make itself a laughing stock."
"What we must do is to say clearly that we do not want this anti-missile system."
"The fact is that a very clear majority of this European Parliament says 'No' to this system."
"In the countries of Europe, including the Czech Republic, public opinion is firmly opposed to the anti-missile system, and of course the Polish Government has undoubtedly refined its previous position."
"For these reasons I would welcome our adoption of a resolution in which the House clearly rejects this missile system."
"(CS) Allow me to thank the Council, represented by the Slovenian Presidency, and the Commission, represented by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, for adhering, fairly strictly, to the tone of the European Treaties."
"According to the Treaties, these issues are entirely the responsibility of the nation states."
"I should mention that even the new Lisbon Treaty explicitly states that issues of national security are the competence of the individual EU Member States alone."
"I am convinced that European security is indivisibly linked to the security of the entire Euro-Atlantic region, and in a situation where the European Union is incapable of protecting its members from new risks, be they financial or technological, this link becomes vital."
"Regarding public opinion, which has been mentioned here several times, I can only add that those who refer to opinion polls and call for a referendum are often the same people who opposed a referendum on another very important issue, namely the new European Treaty."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to sum up all the arguments."
"Essentially this issue is not only about increasing the security of the Czech Republic and Poland, but in fact increasing the security of the whole of Europe."
"The negotiations on the positioning of such a system are the responsibility of the nation state as such."
"Similar systems exist in other countries, in Member States of the European Union."
"Today's speakers have clearly emphasised that there is a real danger."
"We need to realise that when it comes to the issue of security, decisions must be made very quickly."
"Such decisions can also have a preventive element."
"Only if we are ready and strong can we force aggressors to negotiate and to adhere to security requirements."
"To conclude I would like to say that I completely reject the view that the Czech Government has not communicated with its citizens about this system."
"An information campaign has been under way for several months."
"(CS) I would like to make four points concerning this topic."
"The first relates to the Founding Act between NATO and the Russian Federation of May 1997."
"In this Act both sides pledged jointly to eliminate the use of force, and even the threat of force, in the continent of Europe."
"If this Act is valid, then in fact it rules out the possibility of a situation such as the one we have been discussing here arising in our continent."
"The second point concerns the Helsinki Process."
"The signatories to the Accords, to the Declaration, pledged in Helsinki to reduce the presence of military systems in Europe."
"This action would reverse the trend."
"In my opinion, the reduction in the number of military systems in the European continent should continue."
"The third point concerns the number of bases."
"There are American bases in 18 European countries."
"If we include the new ones the total would rise to 20."
"We would thus be confirming Zbigniew Brzeziński's words that the European Union is a de facto American protectorate."
"The fourth point concerns the purpose of the whole system."
"I think it is sufficiently clear: to ensure intelligence coverage and intelligence control over the whole continent of Europe."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I would like to thank Mr Cohn-Bendit for reminding us of the fact that, yesterday, Slovenia was the second Member State to ratify the new Treaty of Lisbon."
"However, the Treaty is not in force yet."
"As we know, we need 24 more countries to ratify it, and the Presidency of Slovenia is hoping that the States will ratify it on time and that the new Treaty of Lisbon will come into force by the planned deadline."
"I would like to stress that it will not bring major changes or anything new in terms of the basic premises on which European security and defence policies are founded."
"In particular, it will not change the fact that this policy is based on national competence, which the Member States retain in the domain of national security and defence."
"The European Union already has a European security and defence policy, which already provides a framework for such discussions within the Council as well."
"Alternatively, such discussions will take place within the framework of the Council, but that will not depend so much on the Presidency as on the will and interest of the Member States."
"Let me assure you that the Council will be informed in detail about today's debate and the viewpoints expressed in it."
"The debate is closed."
"Accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services (13593/6/2007 - C6-0410/2007 - (rapporteur: Markus Ferber)."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of a long debate that has stretched over four legislative terms in the European Parliament, beginning in 1992 with the publication by the European Commission of its White Paper on the development of postal services, which was followed by the adoption of the first Postal Directive in 1997 and its revision in 2002; now, at the start of 2008, after more than 15 years, I hope we are poised to adopt jointly a rational set of rules that will help us to reconcile the interests of consumers, the interests of the companies that have hitherto enjoyed a monopoly in the provision of postal services, the interests of the competitors wishing to enter this lucrative market and the interests of those who are employed in the postal sector."
"We in the European Parliament have been working very hard to achieve these goals over the past months."
"I must point out, Mr President, that the clock is fast - I have not been speaking for three and a half minutes yet!"
"I believe we have succeeded here in the European Parliament in achieving an acceptable compromise between all these interests."
"I should like to thank all those who helped to achieve it - my fellow Members of the European Parliament and particularly Brian Simpson, with whom a 14-year friendship was forged by our joint efforts in the realm of postal services. We have been tracking this important issue together here since 1994."
"I wish to thank the Commission, which has played a very constructive role, both in its proposals and at the negotiating table."
"At this point, I am afraid I have to address my special thanks not to the current Slovenian Presidency but to the Portuguese Presidency of the Council, which succeeded in formulating a common position on 1 October last year."
"I am especially proud, and we in the European Parliament can all be proud, of the fact that the Council, in its common position, embraced the outcome of our inter-group deliberations and incorporated more than 95% of it into the foundations of the common position."
"That is a great success for the European Parliament, and it shows that Parliament can resolve such complex issues as deregulation of the market in postal services, which is further justification for the additional powers entrusted to it by the Reform Treaty."
"Accordingly, in the committee discussions prior to second reading, we tried to identify areas of the common position to which we could make improvements."
"We did not make life easy for ourselves, because every compromise inevitably has some aspect here or there where there might be some scope for improvement."
"In December, however, we in the Transport and Tourism Committee, in an overwhelming vote of approval, established that all the points to which Parliament attached importance had actually been taken into account by the Council and that we could not make anything better."
"Any amendment would have been a retrograde step."
"This is why your rapporteur is now able to say that the recommendation made by a large majority of the lead committee is that the common position be adopted without amendment, and I should be delighted if that were to happen tomorrow."
"We would also have set an example by wrapping up this complex issue of the liberalisation of postal services, which has exercised this House for 15 years, without once having recourse to the conciliation procedure."
"Let me just remind the House that we have always managed to reach agreement at second reading."
"To do so again would be the icing on the cake at the end of a long legislative process."
"I therefore ask for your support and reiterate my thanks to all those who have cooperated very constructively in this process."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I am greatly honoured to be here at your plenary session today."
"The Commission's proposal for the directive on the accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services has been one of the most demanding legislative proposals for the co-legislators over the last 15 months."
"When the Commission proposed it in October 2006, everyone expected endless disagreements and lively debates within our institutions about the future of one of the oldest and most traditional public services in Europe."
"Discussing this matter was an extremely demanding task for the German and especially Portuguese Presidencies in 2007."
"From the outset, in the debates, our institutions established the common aim of avoiding populism and demagoguery and focusing on the essential parameters of this matter, including social aspects for postal employees and the permanent financing of a universal service."
"As we know, the postal sector is threatened with structural change and it must adapt to new economic and social circumstances."
"The final phase of total reform of the internal postal services market offers a unique opportunity for growth to all contractors involved."
"In the end, the public expects us to preserve and improve the quality and efficiency of postal services to benefit the users, regardless of where they live."
"The opening up of the postal services market has so far been a success story."
"New players have entered the market and new opportunities have been exploited, not only by these new players but also by the established ones."
"New user services have been developed."
"It is self-evident that total liberalisation of the postal services is a necessary condition for enlivening this sector and securing its existence alongside new forms of competition and alternative services."
"The approach of our two institutions is further proof of the fundamental principles of protecting high-quality, reliable and affordable services for all users and disallowing discriminatory obstacles for new agents entering the market."
"At the same time both the European Parliament and the Council accept that some postal services markets within the European Union operate under basically different conditions."
"Therefore, when expressing its common position, the Council adopted the decision to set the end of 2010 as the common final date for liberalisation."
"However, some Member States have been allowed a transitional period up to the end of 2012 to implement the new rules."
"In common with the basic principle of all previous directives on postal services, the principle of subsidiarity allows the Member States to adjust the common rules to special national circumstances and ensures an independent regulatory authority to supervise the postal services market."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in concluding this brief address, allow me to congratulate Mr Ferber and the rapporteurs of all the political groups involved, i.e. the shadow rapporteurs, on their contributions to our fruitful and constructive discussions."
"Although we did not always fully agree with their specific remarks, I would like to remind you that the Council included a number of appropriate changes in its common position in November 2007, thereby demonstrating its political decisiveness, openness and constructive flexibility."
"I would especially like to emphasise the fine work of the Commission in the whole process of common decision-making and its commitment to the effective support and guidance of the Member States in all questions relating to the implementation of the new directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow you will receive the final decision and again acknowledge our principal agreement according to the provisions of the Council common position and the recommendation by the Committee on Transport and Tourism on 9 December last year."
"We are certain that we have found the right balance between the different aims and have openly and sensitively dealt with the political challenges without endangering the legal security of postal services contractors and consumers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you once again for your cooperation and for the text, which I am certain will be approved, and thank you for your attention."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, tomorrow the European Parliament should take a historic decision that marks the end of a process launched more than 15 years ago."
"The Third Postal Directive brings to a good end the well prepared gradual process of full market opening."
"What today appears a clear and obvious solution was far from uncontested when the discussion started."
"On 18 October 2006 the Commission presented its proposals."
"Intense and constructive negotiations in the institutions followed."
"It was eventually the European Parliament, through its report at first reading of 11 July 2007, that paved the way for the compromise result in front of you today."
"Many in this House have actively contributed to this important result, and - on behalf of my colleague Commissioner McCreevy - I wish to pay tribute particularly to the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, and his fellow shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups who have shaped the compromise."
"The same goes for the Finnish, German, Portuguese and - last but not least - the Slovene Presidency."
"Some remarks on substance: the text that is now on the table is balanced."
"It takes into account the interests of different political groups and Member States."
"The Commission's proposal had envisaged an earlier date for market opening, confirming the target date set by the existing Postal Directive."
"Two additional years is a substantial period."
"It will give all operators time to complete their preparations."
"It should not, however, lead to complacency."
"What is important for the postal sector, its customers, its operators and its employees is that there is a final and unconditional date for full market opening."
"The common position provides for fair conditions and requires us to do away with market entry barriers."
"A limited number of amendments have been tabled for tomorrow's vote."
"Mostly these are amendments that were already rejected by the Committee on Transport and Tourism in December."
"As my colleague, Mr McCreevy, observed at the time, these amendments do not bring added value for the internal market, for postal users, or for postmen and women."
"There is a momentum to finalise the process of postal reform."
"To sum up, the text in front of you is, on balance, good in substance, and, if you look at its main provisions, you will agree with me that it is faithful to our objective: real market opening not as an end in itself but as the means through which we pursue the broader objective of a high quality, highly efficient and sustainable postal sector adapted to the needs of the 21st century."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, in recent years all of us, myself included, have repeatedly lamented the fact that, even in the case of major legislative projects, most of the seats on the Council bench have remained empty."
"We should therefore make a point of expressing our pleasure at the high-level representation of the Slovenian Presidency at this important legislative debate and at the fact that Slovenia is already entering, as it were, into the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon, which, of course, it has just ratified."
"The internal market in postal services has been a long time coming."
"We are delighted that, if all goes well, this present draft of ours will help to bring the process to a successful conclusion."
"The initial proposal from the Commission was, in principle, coherent and acceptable, but for us in the European Parliament the basic principle was, in many cases, too broadly applied, and we felt that major points of detail remained unresolved."
"In this respect it was a good thing that, under the direction of our rapporteur, Markus Ferber, whom I warmly congratulate on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and European Democrats, our committee, acting by a very comfortable majority, was able to add numerous important elements to the Commission proposal at first reading and to interpret and flesh out its provisions."
"On the financial side in particular we have added an extra option - an important one, since it ensures that a key issue is not disregarded."
"We reinforced the social provisions, especially on matters such as working conditions, working hours and leave entitlements."
"In particular, we introduced a temporary reciprocity clause to ensure that the Directive does not yield windfall profits by letting a few remaining monopolists expand their operations into deregulated markets."
"In return we agreed to the entry into force of the Directive being postponed by two years."
"We believe that the proposal was generally well balanced, and we feel vindicated by the actions of the Council, which very largely endorsed the position of the European Parliament."
"We should accept that position tomorrow and share the satisfaction of the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur with the outcome."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Madam President, on behalf of the PSE Group I would like to thank Markus Ferber for his report and his hard work over many years."
"The PSE Group accepts that a great deal of Parliament's first-reading position has been accepted by the Council, and this will guarantee the universal service; it will guarantee the financing of that service; it will also recognise that social protection must be in place, and it delays the implementation by two years to the end of 2010 for all the old Member States and 2012 for the new ones."
"In my view this is a good deal."
"There are those who still fight the anti-liberalisation battle. But that battle was lost over 15 years ago when Parliament accepted - against my advice at the time - to liberalise the postal services sector."
"Some of us in this Parliament have delayed the full implementation for those long 15 years, but there comes a time, eventually, when we have to face up to reality."
"Although, personally, I would like to see a second reading with no amendments, my group believe it is right to clarify the financing of the universal service and to protect those services presently provided for the visually impaired and the blind."
"So we will be supporting amendments 1, 2, 6, 18 and 19."
"We must ensure that postal services are able to compete, not necessarily against each other, but against other technologies."
"But we need the playing field to be level, and I hope, with the reservations I have outlined, that we can conclude our work on this dossier based on our first-reading position and get back to the most important issue of providing a reliable, regular and affordable postal service to our citizens, and to recognising the important work done by all those postmen and women throughout the European Union."
"Finally, when Markus Ferber and I started work on this dossier, neither of us had any grey hairs."
"Now look at the both of us!"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too, like all my colleagues, would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, on his work."
"This was a job that was initiated a long time ago and during the course of which we have had significant moments of convergence and some moments of constructive discussion."
"As far as my position and that of my group is concerned, there has never been any conflict of principles or ideology against the idea of liberalisation, which we all agree with and support, while, of course, seeking to ensure the guarantees that are necessary for a universal service."
"In the current proposal for the Directive, which was approved by the Parliament during its first reading and then reconsidered by the Council, we can see that this guarantee is there, even if some of the conditions could be made more precise, specific and detailed."
"We do not want to be like those who cannot see the wood for the trees, but, on the other hand, nor do we want to ignore the fact that sometimes the devil is in the detail."
"For this reason we would have preferred that, as regards some of the issues concerning authorisations, concerning ensuring proper competition and also concerning tariff payments between the operator charged with providing the universal service and other individual services, concerning rights and responsibilities as regards network access, that some of the questions had been gone into in more detail."
"We would have preferred this, but the majority of the views taken in Parliament, which were also represented among the committee, was probably that making the guarantees more precise was unnecessary, and preferred instead not to run the risk of coming to a complicated agreement."
"In summary, at this time we hold this standpoint and, as regards the amendments concerning conditions for the blind and the visually impaired, we would like to state clearly that, if these and only these amendments were to force a settlement to be reached, we would not be in favour."
"However, if other amendments should be approved we shall also vote in favour."
"Otherwise, we would vote against all the amendments put forward."
"Thank you, Madam President, Commissioner, Members of the Council."
"I should first like to thank Mr Ferber for his work in seeking a compromise between Parliament and the Council in such a politically sensitive area as postal services."
"I should like to emphasise that the objective difficulties in liberalising the approach to universal services, mainly for the new Member States, were reflected in the directive as an adequate additional time-limit of two years to reserve these services."
"At the same time a sound legal framework has been put in place to guarantee universal services."
"I therefore believe that the ball is now in the court of the Member States' authorities."
"Despite the difficulties encountered by postal enterprises in some Member States, including my country, Latvia, I believe that liberalisation of the market will resolve the seemingly hopeless situation of outdated postal service providers."
"As regards tomorrow's vote, I invite you not to support the aforesaid proposals, because the Member States must make use of their competence also in respect of the visually impaired. Thank you."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I am afraid the facts of the matter prevent me from joining the celebrations."
"Fact number one: who will benefit?"
"Those consumers who live in cities and love to receive advertising material in their letterboxes."
"They will benefit."
"So will businesses that specialise in mass mailings and postal advertising campaigns."
"Those people who are blind or visually impaired, on the other hand, will not benefit."
"I therefore implore you to support our amendment on this matter."
"There will be no benefit to the employees of the postal services either, who will be working for low pay and will be under enormous pressure, which can only increase in the envisaged conditions."
"Another group that will not benefit are people who live in the country or in remote areas and will have to rely on private postal services, for we shall see a creeping erosion of service levels down to the minimum possible and permissible."
"In particular, there will be no benefit to taxpayers, who must once again finance the universal service that was previously funded internally, as it were, being effectively subsidised by revenue from mass mailings and private postal services."
"For these reasons I come down against the directive."
"I believe it is misguided."
"Competition is good, but care must be taken to ensure that it takes place on a level playing field. That has not been done in this case."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Madam President, postal services are a labour-intensive public service."
"In the second half of the nineteenth century the states of Europe decided that they needed to have their own monopoly on postal services because the private sector was not up to the job."
"There have always been private companies that tried to get round this situation."
"They offered cheaper services, but selectively, choosing the busiest parts of the postal delivery service and offering poorer working conditions and conditions of employment."
"Since the 1990s a political majority have tried to create ever broader scope for such companies, and this proposed decision gives them almost an entirely free hand."
"My Group expects this to result in poorer delivery services for consumers, deteriorating conditions for workers and extra costs for the Member States to maintain and restore their universal postal services."
"Even now that the three biggest Groups have agreed a compromise on deadlines and accompanying measures, my Group still sees this choice as a step backwards."
"In addition to measures to improve certain details, such as stricter guarantees for blind customers and for staff, we therefore propose that this liberalisation should be rejected."
"This would also be in line with the recent thumbs down given by voters in the German city of Leipzig to the sale of public undertakings."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, I note the phrase 'a fixed and irrevocable date'."
"One thing EU designer Jean Monnet hated about democracy was that nothing is irrevocable."
"No democratic government can bind its successor with the irrevocable."
"There is a democratic deficit in the EU because the ever-closer Union was designed as irrevocable."
"No openings for democracy."
"The people may only vote to support what the EU elite want."
"It is a one-way street."
"The French and Dutch people voted against this irrevocable union."
"Ignoring them and introducing the same failed constitution proves my point."
"You are failing to learn from history."
"The Soviet Union went."
"Hitler's Tausendjähriges Reich lasted 12 years."
"The backlash you are creating by denying the people a referendum will bring this intolerant EU empire down as sure as day follows night."
"(HU) Madam President, by the end of 2012 postal services will be fully liberalised, and the common market will have been achieved in this area too."
"Since opening the market will have different impacts on the markets in individual Member States, what we have achieved through the legislation is that the market will be opened step by step."
"We have also achieved a situation in which the relevant post offices can keep the revenue they have at their disposal until the end of the derogation period, and I personally put this down as a result."
"After a long time, European regulation has been born, so that puts everyone in a competitive situation."
"Particular thanks to the rapporteur for this."
"In other words, this regulation will not mean disadvantages for competing companies after the opening of the market, but new prospects."
"Madam President, all this is only half a victory if the next steps are not taken."
"What are they?"
"Firstly, the post offices that enjoy the derogation must focus, in the years to come, on being able to meet the requirements supported by European competition, that is, that they really do use the time benefits that they are being given now."
"Secondly, state regulation and policies must ensure that, whilst the post office is slimmed down with the slogan of becoming competitive, universal service really must be ensured at a corresponding level."
"We should not forget that responsibility for service will still be the obligation of the state."
"In fact, regulation was born so that European citizens, wherever they live, even in the smallest places, should have access to postal services, at a suitable price and of suitable quality. Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Madam President, I think that the issue we shall be voting on tomorrow is a historic one, because the post has been a public service from the early days, especially since monarchies."
"That was because the distribution of mail is strategic, and it also ensured a universal and fast service."
"We have just put an end to public control of postal services, or we shall be ending it tomorrow, to replace it with a largely deregulated postal market."
"What is proposed in this directive will first of all be a wonderful market for lawyers and legal practitioners, because it is not harmonisation. Each Member State can decide on its own method of financing and there are four different methods."
"The directive also proposes something completely paradoxical: compensating for the financing of the universal service through State subsidies where, in some countries, what was not financially viable was financed by equalisation when that was viable."
"I think we are making a mistake."
"Time will tell, but we already have some indications of that today."
"Over EUR 880 million have been invested in the postal service in the United Kingdom."
"In Spain it has just been announced that, because of the pressure of competition, rural areas will no longer receive a direct postal service."
"The Germans are having problems in bringing the minimum wage into line with the postal services market."
"My feeling is that we are now benefiting companies, we are going to let them cream off the best part of the market, but we are not serving the general interest in postal services or the external competitiveness of the European Union."
"(NL) Madam President, I support the compromise reached by Mr Ferber and approved by the Council because I am in favour of an open market for postal services."
"I think this directive gives the Member States sufficient scope to ensure that their markets are opened up in a proper manner, and that there are different service-providers competing for customers on the basis of guaranteed quality."
"It is certainly not the intention that the Member States should use this scope to prevent their markets from being opened up, although this is also a risk."
"It would be easy to apply this directive so that new firms faced such strict requirements that no one new would bother with the letter post."
"If this is how the Member States apply the directive, then we will have adopted a fine piece of legislation, but will have changed nothing in practice for postal customers."
"I think we certainly have to approve the text, but I would ask the Commission to make sure that the aim of creating an open market in postal services is not circumvented by measures taken by the Member States."
"I see that the rapporteur's country, for example, has recently taken measures that have actually closed down the postal market in Germany again."
"(GA) Mr President, the postal service in Ireland has a central part to play in the lives of rural communities, especially for rural dwellers and people in remote regions who have no neighbours around."
"So I welcome the provision for universal service - something that is vitally important for people in Ireland and, I am sure, every other Member State as well."
"I should like first of all to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, for sticking firmly to that principle."
"For the benefit of customers it should be laid down in our draft documents, and in this connection I also welcome the new financial service being set up by the Irish Post Office in Ireland."
"This shows that postal service providers can gear themselves to new market requirements while continuing to provide their universal postal service."
"In addition, I should like to welcome the recent ruling by the Court of Justice to the effect that a postal service provider is entitled to enter into an agreement regarding the distribution of social welfare payments."
"(PT) The Council agreed to the full opening of the market in postal services at EU level from 31 December 2010 during the Portuguese Presidency, applying competition rules to what some say should be a public service to create an internal market in postal services."
"'That's great', the Portuguese Prime Minister will say."
"That decision, however, represents a great blow to the public postal services, particularly with the abolition of the reserved areas, setting in motion a process to dismantle them and subsequently hand them over to profit-driven transnationals, and at public expense to boot, jeopardising the rights of the nation and of workers in the sector."
"If there were any doubts as to the true significance of the inclusion of the 'protocol on services of general interest' in the draft Treaty, this directive will dispel them: continuation of the dismantling and destruction of public services, threatening their ownership and provision by democratically managed and controlled public companies."
"Hence our proposal to reject this directive."
"(SV) Madam President, the post is one of the public services which the people of our countries, both old and young, value most highly."
"Hence the formulation of the decision is absolutely vital."
"In previous debates on the directive I have expressed fears that the needs of thinly populated areas might not be catered for."
"It was not clear that the same service would be guaranteed for everyone."
"On one occasion during question time with Commissioner McCreevy I was promised that there would be no change in the requirement to provide a universal service."
"We now have a compromise which gives guarantees that those of us who live in thinly populated areas will have our post collected and delivered five days a week just like everyone else."
"I will support the compromise to the Postal Directive tomorrow."
"Let us hope that this leads to a better service, lower prices and a more effective postal system for everyone when we deregulate the single market in one further sector."
"(NL) Madam President, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Ferber, most warmly for the work he has done."
"He managed to get Parliament to agree on this difficult issue at first reading, even though both he and I felt that we should have gone a step further."
"In the end, however, our united stance was what guided the Council, and so I too wholeheartedly agree with the common position."
"Members of the Socialist and Green Groups have unfortunately got cold feet and cannot see the enormous opportunities that this directive will offer for new businesses and jobs."
"I am absolutely convinced of this, and examples in a number of Member States back me up."
"But everything will now depend on the European Commission keeping to the directive, so that it does not remain a dead letter."
"If the directive is introduced, it will certainly achieve the aim of opening up the markets."
"There will be better services for consumers, and not what Germany is doing, squeezing new players, and not just new players but new businesses too, new services, new jobs, out of the market on the pretext of social protection."
"So I am happy with the response that I received yesterday from the European Commission."
"I understand that the Commission is to investigate the situation in Germany."
"I would urge you to do so, and quickly, because the new players on the German market are in serious trouble, and it would be absolutely terrible if things do not work out, as well as setting exactly the wrong precedent."
"I predict that France and other countries will follow, and then we will achieve absolutely nothing in the end."
"So the Commission has a huge responsibility here."
"I hope that you will use every possible legal channel and also bring political pressure to bear to ensure that this directive is properly applied to the European postal market."
"(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, postal services are of major importance to the economic and social life of communities."
"Therefore we must guarantee the accessibility of postal services and above all we must ensure the quality of those services."
"Full liberalization of the postal service market, including deliveries weighing less than 50 grams, will allow increased competition, the emergence of new operators and the creation of new jobs."
"However, I would like to dwell on several important issues."
"First of all, it is essential for universal service to be guaranteed and for every citizen to be able to receive mail, irrespective of whether they live on a mountain top or on an island."
"Secondly, we must ensure decent working conditions for people in this line of work; in particular, we must ensure that there are social guarantees concerning jobs and incomes."
"Thirdly, for Member States to guarantee universal service, it is essential for them to define as soon as possible the means of funding the universal service."
"The Directive allows Member States flexibility in this regard."
"Fourth, as we live in an increasingly digitized world, it is essential that mail operators should diversify their activity so as to provide electronic services, as well."
"Some Member States may have two extra years before postal services are fully liberalised."
"No matter when liberalisation takes place, mail operators should have an effective management which should guarantee the high quality of those services."
"(PL) Madam President, allowing private operators to provide postal services is a controversial decision."
"Time will tell whether it is beneficial for consumers."
"We must remember that in some of the new Member States with a lower level of development, institutions defending the interests of competition and consumers are weakly anchored in the public conscience. There is a danger of disrupting the balance between the interests of capital and those of the consumer."
"Setting the date at 2012 is therefore to be welcomed."
"At the same time, I would suggest that before 2012 an analysis be made of the operation of the postal services market in those countries that have already adopted the new rules, with a view to identifying and preventing any irregularities in the remaining countries."
"I also consider that an operator providing public services should be rewarded by the authorities and not as - the authors of the report suggest - merely compensated."
"Years of work on this legislation have turned Mr Ferber's hair grey."
"I trust the introduction of the new regulations will not cause him further distress and result in actual hair loss."
"(DE) Madam President, it is surely very obvious that Mr Ferber's position and those of Mrs Wortmann-Kool and other Members are poles apart."
"I believe it is wrong to treat privatisation and liberalisation of public services as the standard response to globalisation."
"I also have reason to believe that increasing numbers of people disagree with that approach."
"In a referendum in Leipzig last weekend, 80% of the electorate, or rather of those who voted, rejected privatisation, thereby preventing the city council from carrying out any more privatisations for the next three years."
"Let me also tell you that it is simply not the case that this directive we are discussing today incorporates real safeguards to protect people - employees - from social dumping."
"We have seen how the introduction of minimum wages in the postal services in Germany has met with resistance from those very companies that have built the foundations of their business on rock-bottom wages."
"I also have serious concerns about the implications of public institutions awarding contracts to such companies."
"(PL) Madam President, work has been going on for over 15 years on liberalisation of the postal sector, which is worth over EUR 90 billion a year in the Union as a whole."
"Today we are on the eve of voting on and inscribing such legislation in the history of the Union, and I want to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"The present version of the project is a broad compromise in which the main aims appear to have been achieved: full implementation of the internal market in postal services, mainly through termination of the mail monopoly, and assured continuation of a high-quality, low-cost public service."
"The present version of the directive is not, however, as ambitious as the Commission's original proposal."
"In the course of the deliberations, departure from the idea of liberalisation in favour of a gradual, rather cautious opening of the postal market for letters weighing less than 50 grammes became increasingly apparent."
"This is reflected in the compromise date for the entry into force of the directive, specifically in the case of new Member States and countries with small populations, small geographical areas and public service clauses."
"The date of 31 December 2012 for Member States that joined the Union in 2004 seems unnecessarily distant."
"I realise it is part of the negotiated compromise, which we accept, but it may well put a brake on the proposed changes."
"I fear such a long period - over four years - for the entry into force of the directive will simply slow down changes which, in the case of a two-year period, for example, would take effect almost immediately."
"Finally, I want to support Mrs Pleštinská's call for clauses concerning the blind and visually handicapped to be reinstated in the proposed directive."
"They are missing from the present version."
"(NL) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members who have helped to achieve a result that is a considerable improvement on the original Commission proposal."
"I understand why many of us want to leave it at that, but behind the positive elements that have been added to the directive there also lurk a number of dangers."
"Nothing has actually been achieved yet, because the Member States are being given a lot of responsibility on two crucial points."
"Firstly, there are still a lot of question marks over how the universal service is to be funded."
"The Member States have a number of options here, but it is not always clear whether these really work."
"In many cases this will lead to all sorts of disputes, including legal ones."
"I therefore feel it would be useful to make two things clear: firstly, that the Member States are under an obligation to guarantee the universal service and funding for it whatever the circumstances, and secondly, that the Member States must be required to get their house in order and to prepare for this new situation thoroughly and in good time."
"The second important point is the social field."
"Here it is important to point out that this directive allows the Member States to require all postal operators, through a licensing system, to comply with the same collective agreements, for instance, or other minimum standards."
"This is a good idea, but it is still only optional, and it will be applied differently from one country to another."
"In a word, I think the directive could be tightened up, and this has nothing to do with having cold feet, but reflects the fact that a free market has to be regulated and liberalisation needs to be carefully prepared."
"(EL) Madam President, we are dissatisfied with the European Commission, the Council and our rapporteur, because they have made no reference to fluctuations in the number of workers in the sector, working conditions, working hours or pay."
"Similarly, provision has been made neither for an effective check on tariff policies for businesses, nor for the private monopoly situations in parcel transport and express post."
"Furthermore, the report stresses the stable employment in Member States, despite local fluctuations, but no data has been produced to demonstrate this."
"In these circumstances, then, it is not possible to make a proper evaluation in the interests of workers."
"Finally, it should be emphasised that the Council has, in a certain sense, ratified Parliament's amendments while allowing for plenty of discussion on the social consequences both for employees of services and for consumers."
"(DE) Madam President, the accomplishment of the internal market in postal services amply illustrates the truth of the saying 'Good things come to those who wait'."
"Even I can support this draft on the table, the result of fifteen years of hard bargaining."
"I happen to be one of those who would rather have preserved the monopoly of national postal administrations for letters below the 50-gramme threshold."
"Now this last stage in the controlled deregulation of the postal market is set to take effect on 1 January 2011."
"In view of the structure of the postal services in Luxembourg, the statutory requirement to employ volunteers from the armed forces in the public service and the resulting costs, I could not have subscribed to rapid and insufficiently controlled deregulation of the market in postal services, because that could have had intolerable consequences for postal staff and customers."
"For the first reading, I therefore asked the rapporteur, Mr Ferber, to allow for a two-year extension of the transposition deadline for small countries with relatively few inhabitants so that they could continue to limit the provision of certain services to the universal-service provider, and I thank him for his understanding."
"I had discreetly circumscribed this arrangement in order to ensure that Luxembourg benefited from the exemption, but the Ministers preferred to preclude any misunderstanding by naming the relevant countries."
"This keeps us safe."
"The important thing is that the universal-service requirement guarantees the collection of mail and its rapid delivery to the designated residential or business address on each working day, even in remote or sparsely populated areas."
"The external funding that might be needed to cover the net cost of the universal service, and hence the question of affordable rates, has also been satisfactorily regulated."
"Lastly, the best possible measures have been taken to safeguard permanent skilled jobs with universal-service providers and to guarantee adherence to terms of employment and social-security schemes based on existing legal provisions or collective agreements, contrary to what the Left would have us believe."
"They ought to read the wording of the draft."
"It also expressly stipulates that preparations for the deregulation of the postal market must take account of social considerations."
"On the motion tabled by our philanthropic missionaries regarding free postal services for the visually impaired, I personally do not see why wealthy people with impaired vision should send their mail free of charge at the taxpayer's expense."
"In any case, those who propose this amendment are barking up the wrong tree, because it is the Member States that guarantee such arrangements."
"Subsidiarité oblige!"
"(HU) Thank you, Madam President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the gradual opening up of the postal services market is an important milestone in achieving the internal market."
"It will contribute to ending special rights within the postal sectors, and it will set a specific and irrevocable date for opening the market, ensuring a sustainable, high level of universal service."
"Opening the market will intensify competition, and so the level of service can be improved with regard to quality, price and opportunities for choice."
"This measure will promote the harmonisation of the fundamental principles relating to the regulation of postal services, and will probably produce lower tariffs as well as better and more innovative services, and greater conditions for growth and employment will still be created."
"The amendment to the Directive is the result of an exemplary compromise, a compromise that took into account the differences arising from the historical and economical characteristics of the Member States."
"It pays regard to the fact that preparing for liberalisation requires more time in some Member States, mainly those in Central Eastern Europe."
"At the same time, taking into account the interests of others and in order to prevent distortion of competition in the market in countries where the postal sector is already fully liberalised, the postal services of countries that are not yet opening their market may not provide services until the derogation deadline at the end of December 2012."
"I would like to thank Mr Ferber for his work, but naturally thanks are also due to Mr Simpson, the shadow rapporteur."
"(PT) I congratulate Mr Ferber and Mr Simpson for the quality of their report and all those Members and parties involved for their openness during the negotiating procedure."
"This liberalisation of the market in postal services is still far from achieving a competitive market in which consumers and companies are the biggest winners. I therefore argued that the Commission's approach might not sufficiently guarantee the universal service."
"I accordingly supported the shadow rapporteur Mr Simpson's position on the need to guarantee the universal service and to establish a compensation fund, and on the commitment to open up postal services below 50 grammes in 2010, or in special cases, such as the new Member States with outermost regions, by 31 December 2012."
"I am also pleased with regard to those states with the special provisions included, though I must point out that they may not be sufficient, in which case additional measures will be required."
"In terms of employment, I am delighted with the addition introduced previously to make it obligatory for a report to be submitted on the overall development of employment in the sector, the working conditions applied by all operators within a Member State, and any future measures."
"I am very pleased with the common position achieved, but support the amendments submitted by my colleagues Mr Savary, Mr El Khadraoui and Mrs Ayala Sender, among others, and by my parliamentary group, since they reinforce the idea of the need for a considered process of liberalisation to reinforce equal universal access, development and employment."
"For all these reasons I urge the plenary to support this report and the Council, and to support Parliament's position."
"Madam President, Parliament should pass our amendments to restore compulsory free postal services for blind people to this directive."
"Mr Vizjak, you say you were open and flexible and yet you completely rebuffed Parliament's amendments on compulsory free services for blind people."
"We have heard Mr Orban say tonight, on behalf of Commissioner McCreevy, that our amendments do not bring added value to postal users."
"Mr Orban, are not blind people postal users?"
"And is not the real added value you are talking about the actual added costs that blind people are going to have to be forced to pay?"
"To Mr Ferber, I regret to say that I believe you were wrong to make a deal, dropping this requirement which Parliament passed at first reading."
"Yesterday you also failed to answer my question: is there a threat to blind people's services?"
"I hope you will today."
"Because if there is not, what objection can you have to putting this into the directive?"
"If there is, that shows why we need to put it in."
"In Italy, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Greece and Portugal, the post office, not the government, provides this free service."
"New and existing providers in a liberalised market will inevitably seek to cut costs; blind people must not be the victims."
"After liberalisation in New Zealand, blind people's services were ended."
"We must not let it happen here."
"Finally, for those who tell us that they are sympathetic to disabled people but this is not the right place or way to do it, you told us that about the Lifts Directive and the Buses and Coaches Directive, other single market legislation."
"But Parliament said no, and we insisted on binding access for disabled people."
"Today, again, we must insist on compulsory rights for Europe's blind and partially-sighted people."
"(SK) Madam Chairman, thank you for giving me the floor."
"The common position adopted by the Council does not include the amendments concerning free postal services for blind people in spite of the fact that at first reading the European Parliament voted to maintain free postal services for blind people following liberalisation of the European postal market."
"I intended to vote in favour of Amendment 3 tabled by Eva Lichtenberger, in which Parliament's position at first reading is reiterated."
"Following today's discussion with the rapporteur, Marcus Ferber, I was informed that approval of any of the amendments would jeopardise a previously agreed compromise on the adoption of the Directive on accomplishment of the internal market in Community postal services at second reading, which could mean having to enter into conciliation."
"I realise the importance of adopting this Directive."
"When transposed into national law, the Member States will be able to solve this issue in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"I would therefore urge all of the Member States to provide free postal services for blind and partially sighted people in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and universal service obligations."
"(PL) Madam Chairman, I would also like to support the amendments concerning visually impaired persons."
"If the European Union declares to all and sundry that it tolerates no discrimination, then access to postal services must also be equal for all, and for the visually impaired that means assisted access."
"Madam President, this directive is yet another example of how one-size-fits-all, incompetent EU legislation adversely affects the lives of British people."
"This directive is the reason why post offices are closing and why postal workers will lose their jobs."
"Post offices play a vital role in the community, especially for the old, the poor, the immobile and the disabled."
"This is just one of a multitude of EU laws that have damaged, and will continue to damage, my country."
"The British people know this, and this is one of the reasons why they are being denied a referendum on the EU Constitution."
"If it is ratified, they can look forward to a lot more of the same."
"Madam President, I believe the rapporteur has, in general - though not entirely - achieved a fair balance."
"The universal service provision will ensure consumers have full access to postal services and Member States still have the flexibility to determine the most effective and efficient mechanism to guarantee the USO."
"The USO will also ensure that sufficient access points are established to take full account of the needs of users in rural areas and sparsely populated areas, and I know this will be welcome, particularly in my own country, Ireland."
"Initially, I have to say I had some reservations about the impact on postal workers, but Member States still have the authority to regulate employment conditions and collective bargaining in the sector, where this does not lead to unfair competition."
"Finally, I want to say that I support the amendment that there should be an obligation to supply free services for blind and partially-sighted persons."
"I disagree with Commissioner Orban - or is it Commissioner McCreevy? - I do believe this will provide added value, because, in a fully liberalised market, free services for blind or partially-sighted persons will disappear, and it will be added value if we can guarantee to them that they will continue."
"(SK) Thank you for giving me the floor, Madam Chairman."
"First of all, I would like to thank Mr Ferber for an excellent report, thanks to which the long-awaited Directive will soon enter into force."
"This Directive will mean that from 1 January 2009 the internal market in Community postal services will be fully accomplished."
"I am particularly pleased that the principle of subsidiarity has been maintained and that concrete implementation has been left to the Member States, which will draw up legislation that is specific to their own situation."
"However, I would also like to stress the social aspect of this legislation as regards the rights of disabled people, especially blind or partially sighted people, and their right to avail of free postal services."
"I call on my fellow Members to support the relevant amendments that were tabled in plenary this week and that were adopted by Parliament at first reading."
"These services are appropriate and crucial for this section of the population: people with exceptionally low income, areas with very high unemployment levels and people in difficult social situations, not to mention those affected by social exclusion."
"Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this debate."
"I congratulate the rapporteur for the work done."
"I think the public believe this is already happening because in many Member States there is not a postal service of equal value between the regions."
"I am glad to see that there will be subsidiarity on this issue and the Member States will decide the best way to implement the principle of a deregulated market."
"I need to support my intergroup chairman, Richard Howitt, on the issue of disability."
"Unfortunately, the point was raised that rich blind people will benefit."
"Sadly, there are too few rich blind people in Europe and globally."
"I wish we could stand up and say that they were all rich and, indeed, famous, but it is not the case."
"I think we have to make a big stand on this, just to show that, while Europe is about freedom of movement of capital and services, it is also concerned about those who have no voice and those who have no sight."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Today's lively debate has shown that there are many justifiably differing opinions about the regulation of this traditional and oldest public service."
"It was also right that many different opinions and concerns were expressed."
"However, we must stress that the proposed text is a balanced compromise between, on the one hand, the opening up of the internal market in postal services, securing competitiveness and the added value that comes with it, and, on the other hand, consumer protection and protection of the rights of consumers and the rights of vulnerable consumer groups and those living in remote areas."
"In short, in the Council's estimation, it is a good compromise text and I would like to express my support for that opinion."
"We also appreciate the intention behind certain amendments, but through discussions in previous debates a final compromise solution came to light."
"We are therefore of the opinion that this is a good text and I hope you will exercise much political wisdom tomorrow when you have the final chance to support this text."
"The Commission. - First of all I would like to extend my thanks to all the participants in the debate and stress that this debate has proven the MEPs' great interest in this dossier."
"This interest is closely linked to the crucial role that postal services play in the European economy and in the everyday life of European citizens."
"I would like to stress that the completion of this process will ensure a consistently high quality of universal service for all European citizens and for the business community."
"The main goal of postal reform is to benefit all consumers and postal service users, including special needs groups."
"In this context, I paid particular attention to the contributions of several Members who spoke about the continuation of free service provision for the blind and partially sighted."
"The European Commission is particularly sympathetic to these concerns."
"We believe that the liberalisation of the market will not change this, and that international obligations will continue to be met in full."
"I would like to underline that the common position specifies that market liberalisation will not prevent the provision of free services to the blind and partially sighted."
"Under Article 23 of the Directive, the European Commission must prepare a report on the application of this Directive, including information about the groups mentioned above."
"The Commission believes that the Directive as it now stands, in the current format to which the European Parliament has contributed significantly, is the best legal framework, that will lead to high quality and sustainability in European postal services, while complying with international obligations."
"In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the report, as prepared by Mr Markus Ferber and adopted by the Committee on Transport by a large majority, should be supported."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, permit me to make just a few remarks."
"Firstly, I should be happier if those Members who delivered impassioned speeches for the whole world to hear would at least stay in the chamber for the rest of the debate."
"That did rather disappoint me, I must say."
"I am referring specifically to Members such as Mrs Lichtenberger."
"Secondly, I must point out that we are talking here about liberalisation and not privatisation."
"The proprietary structure of existing postal services does not interest the European Union and is not mentioned in this directive."
"Thirdly, let me say that, 500 years ago when the first postal services were created, it was private undertakings that provided postal services."
"Not until later did governments decide they could do it better."
"So let us have no distortions of history please."
"Fourthly, I should like to remind the House that government monopolies are also abused."
"I am glad that Mrs Zimmer drew attention to that problem."
"In point of fact, she comes from a region in which the state most certainly abused its postal monopoly until 1990, to the detriment of innocent people."
"This is another point that needs to be made forcefully in the present debate."
"Let me get one thing straight: we did not forget blind people in this legislation."
"They are included, but they are included in a way that accords with the spirit of this directive."
"Through its provisions, the European Union is telling the Member States that they are responsible for the universal service and for funding the fulfilment of universal-service obligations, that they are responsible, through licensing and authorisation procedures, for ensuring that certain services, such as postal services for blind people, can be maintained in the long term."
"I am very grateful to the Commissioner for his announcement that the Commission intends to give consideration to this matter in its report under Article 23 of the Directive."
"We have not forgotten anything; we have not forgotten blind people."
"Nevertheless, I do wonder whether blind people should have free access, guaranteed by European legislation, and wheelchair users should not."
"That is something else to ponder."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 31.1.2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the approval, at second reading, of the Council common position amending the 1997 postal services directive with a view to full accomplishment of the internal market in postal services and I congratulate my worthy German colleague, Markus Ferber, for the huge amount of work he has done."
"I am pleased that the Council accepted all the key aspects of the European Parliament's position, particularly deferral of general market opening until 31 December 2010, with a two-year extension for those Member States that have joined the Union since 2004; the principle of a universal service comprising at least one delivery and collection five days a week for every EU citizen, with a sufficient number of access points maintained in rural, remote or sparsely populated regions; and observance of subsidiarity with regard to social considerations - a matter on which I hope the social partners will work at European level."
"I am sorry that provision has not been included for the creation of a European regulatory mechanism."
"My final point is this: I am keen to see operators reaching agreement soon on the introduction of a European stamp for 50 g letters and I intend to take a policy initiative to that end at an early date."
"in writing. - (RO) The common position satifies the demands made by Parliament in its votes for the first reading, as well as the amendments proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"However, the Commission has yet to provide clear research on the impact that the liberalisation of postal services is likely to have on employment."
"In its opinion, the Committee asked for an impact assessment of the effects of this measure on the five million or more jobs related to or depending on postal services."
"This study is facilitated by the fact that postal services have already been liberalised in several EU Member States, such as the UK, Sweden, and the Netherlands."
"Experience in those countries has not so far indicated that liberalisation has led to an increase in the number of jobs in this sector, or to an increase in their quality."
"I believe that certain protection mechanisms should be allowed for situations where the emergence of new postal service providers on the market will lead to massive redundancy."
"One of the mechanisms available to the companies and Member States affected could be the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the road to the liberalisation of postal services is getting longer, and for that the European Parliament is partly to blame, having extended the European Commission's deadline by two years."
"The positions taken by national delegations reflect the varying situation on the markets of the 27 countries."
"Sweden, the United Kingdom and Finland, as front runners of the open market, as well as Germany and the Netherlands, which have gone a long way in that direction, all see the final deadline as a victory for protectionism."
"Starting from their model of a state-controlled economy, the new Member States consider not only the original proposal of 2009 but also the compromise deadline of 2011 as a threat to jobs in the postal sector."
"Poland, for example, has some 100 000 people employed by Poczta Polska, which is incapable of facing open competition in the medium term."
"Having found allies in public services in western Europe, first and foremost France's La Poste, they have succeeded in negotiating special conditions that postpone the free market in practice to the end of 2012."
"In the event, the corporate interest of the postal workers has prevailed over that of the customers, who were sorely tried during the Christmas peak period in December 2007, when the incapability of the postal monopoly was harshly demonstrated."
"The slow progress made in liberalising this sector of the European market, which began as far back as 1989 with the first draft directive, shows the strength of the corporate interests defending the status quo against an extension of the public interest."
"in writing. - Yet again we have an ideologically driven proposal, this time on postal services."
"There has been no assessment of the social impact it will have, and no serious consultation with post office management, with employees or with consumers."
"There is no demand, no logic and no justification for the liberalisation of postal services."
"People do not want to be presented with an array of competing post offices marketing their products."
"They do not want to see their local post offices closed because the market offers insufficient profit for the private postal companies which will swamp the market, driving public operators like An Post to the wall."
"People want a reliable postal service which will deliver their mail with the minimum of fuss and which will keep local post offices at the centre of the communities they serve."
"How can people take seriously the idea the EU is promoting a social Europe when this proposal drives yet another nail in its coffin?"
"It is time to call a halt to the ideologically driven forced march towards liberalisation and privatisation."
"People in Ireland have the opportunity to stop this by voting no to the Lisbon Treaty."
"in writing. - (ET) I support the market being liberalised as quickly as possible and I welcome the directive which accomplishes the establishment of the internal market in postal services."
"The closure of small post offices in Estonia has generated anger among people, but it is clear that with the implementation of new technologies such as the Internet the demand for a traditional postal service has fallen."
"Where there is competition a new business in Internet-based services may arise, and this is to be welcomed."
"I also understand the need for a known deadline in the Member States."
"It is therefore important for the principle of reciprocity to apply when allowing Member States to refuse to open their market to postal service providers from neighbouring States whose providers are protected by law."
"The important thing is for the universal postal service also to be guaranteed for everyone, including people in outlying areas and islands."
"The postal service must be affordable, high-quality and accessible to all."
"It is necessary to draw up plans for a cost-oriented universal postal service, since the concept is viewed differently in different Member States."
"I believe that there are grounds for demanding that cost considerations of all services should be excluded from the universal postal service indicator."
"in writing. - (DE) EU-wide liberalisation of postal services will happen - not in 2009, as originally planned, but in 2011."
"In economic terms, the postal sector is very important, and it also impacts on other sectors of the economy."
"As in all other areas of economic activity, more competition in the realm of postal deliveries makes sense."
"Nor will businesses be the only beneficiaries, for consumers will reap great benefits too. This will not be the case, however, unless the basic conditions are right."
"In other words, it must be guaranteed that letters will be delivered as efficiently as ever and at reasonable prices."
"Care must be taken to ensure that the blanket provision of postal services is guaranteed in the long term - and guaranteed everywhere, including remote areas."
"Particular importance attaches to good working conditions and, above all, job security for all those who work in the postal services."
"It is also important that the same conditions should govern the operations of all postal-service providers."
"It was firmly established from the outset that this was not to be a cut-throat liberalisation."
"We must create a good and sustainable arrangement for everyone - the postal companies, their employees and, of course, their customers."
"in writing. - (FI) Opening up postal services to free competition will inevitably mean a worsening of services, especially in sparsely populated countries like Finland."
"The post office should be a public service, and we need to guarantee it has adequate funding by using the cash earned from services which are 'easy' to manage to assist in areas which are more 'difficult'."
"A nation that wishes to preserve its unity and its sense of community will not privatise public postal services."
"We also rely on a public service to safeguard protection of privacy and ensure the kind of security we demand of the post office."
"Privatisation might result in an unsound staffing policy, which will damage confidence in the post office."
"That is why our Group is voting against the position on privatisation adopted by the Council."
"in writing. - The liberalisation of postal services is an important area of the European internal market."
"Throughout the discussion we have had many concerns about universal postal services."
"I think we can build on the experience of some European postal markets, which are already liberalised."
"Postal services have been secured in these countries at the same time as quality and service has improved through more businesslike operations."
"At the same time, travelling around in Europe I am faced with poor and slow service in many countries that are trying to get as many exceptions as possible from the liberalisation plans."
"Furthermore, this report leaves much space for Member States to implement the liberalisation."
"Many concerns that were brought up will thus remain concerns to be dealt with by national authorities."
"I would like to thank Mr Ferber for his perseverance while dealing with this very tough process."
"in writing. - (RO) The full liberalisation of postal services in Member States will have a positive impact not only on postal service users and consumers, who will benefit from new and innovative services and lower postal charges, but also on the economy of Member States as a whole."
"The proposal for a Directive under discussion is complete in its current form, which allows for the extension of the deadline for full liberalisation of the postal service market in the case of certain Member States."
"Romania is one of the beneficiaries of the new provisions adopted by the European Parliament."
"The Romanian universal service provider is currently being restructured according to a schedule set by the Romanian Government for 2007-2010, and preparations for liberalisation will begin only afterwards."
"This timeline benefits Romanian consumers, as the prospect of market liberalisation after 1 January 2013 means improved quality services at an affordable price."
"Outcome of the Bali climate change conference (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the Bali climate change conference."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I am honoured to be with you again today and, as President of the Council, to present to you the evaluation of the results of the Bali Climate Change Conference."
"I am very pleased that the European Parliament took a very active role and was involved in the debate on climate change."
"A strong delegation of the European Parliament led by the Vice-President of the Parliament, Mr Vidal-Quadras, and consisting of a number of eminent representatives of the Parliament, was also present at the Bali Conference."
"I would also like to express support for the first interim report on climate change presented last Monday to your Climate Change Committee."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the last days of the Conference were conducted in a very, so to speak, electrified atmosphere of uncertainty."
"When it seemed that the negotiations would fail and that an agreement would not be reached, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon, also became involved and his intervention was important."
"The fact that the negotiations were extended by one day and that they were conducted through the last two nights is testimony to their difficulty."
"The final agreement resulted in a decision on long-term cooperation within the framework of the Convention under the title Bali Action Plan."
"In compliance with this document, negotiations will start as early as March or April and, by the end of next year, should lead to a full global agreement on tackling climate change after 2012."
"Allow me to mention some essential elements of this agreement: firstly the part relating to international measures for improving, that is, reducing emissions."
"This agreement stresses that the efforts of all developed countries to reduce emissions must be comparable with each other."
"This means that the United States of America will also be included in the reduction of emissions."
"Here we must stress that, unlike the Kyoto Protocol for 2008-2012, this plan does not secure any quantified obligations."
"The second element is that developing countries will contribute to the reduction in emissions within the framework of sustainable development."
"This is where the support of developed countries, with the transfer of technology and suitable finances, is very important."
"Alleviation of the effects of climate change will also include measures and positive encouragement to prevent the clearing and destruction of forests in developing countries, which makes a large contribution to the global emissions of greenhouse gases."
"The third element consists of improved adaptation measures to include international cooperation."
"The fourth includes improved measures for the development and transfer of technologies that enable adaptation and alleviation concomitantly with economic development."
"For more effective alleviation of, and adaptation to, climate change, it is necessary to secure easier access to environmentally friendly technologies for developing countries."
"The fifth decision relates to improved financing and investment in the alleviation of climate change."
"This foresees support for developing countries to implement the national measures for the alleviation of, and adaptation to, climate change."
"Further negotiations will take place under the auspices of a newly established ad hoc working group for long-term cooperation within the framework of the Convention."
"They will already be meeting four times this year."
"The negotiation process will be intensive and will demand great efforts on the part of the negotiators."
"The current negotiations relating to the post-2012 obligations of developed countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol will continue."
"These negotiations should also be concluded by the end of next year."
"They will run in parallel with the negotiations within the Bali Action Plan."
"In our opinion, the decisions adopted at the Bali Conference are appropriate."
"They contain essential elements towards which we in the European Union are striving."
"Among the greatest achievements is the involvement of all countries, developed and developing, in the common reduction of emissions."
"We acknowledge the equality of inclusive adaptation."
"We expect the Bali Action Plan to shift the deadlock on the transfer of climate-friendly technologies to developing countries."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Conference gave us a broad framework for further negotiations."
"This compromise is, in a way, the most that could be achieved in view of the current state of the global consensus."
"Future negotiations will be technically and politically very demanding."
"We are of the opinion that they will have a successful outcome if we manage to preserve the trend evident over the last year, when climate change has continued to climb up the political agenda."
"To reach an effective international agreement, we will need stamina and patience as well as a lot of political will."
"Sometimes, the most necessary measures are last to be accepted."
"Member of the Commission. - (EL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by thanking you for this opportunity to debate both the results of the climate change conference held in Bali late last year and plans for what is to come after agreement on the commencement of negotiations has been reached."
"First of all, I should like to express my admiration for the active role played by the European Parliament, and the support it has given, before and during the conference."
"The contacts and meetings we had with your delegation throughout the course of the conference proved exceptionally useful."
"I should especially like to stress the very important role of the European Parliament in providing information to officials from other countries."
"We certainly need mutual support to communicate and more broadly disseminate the EU's position, which is a decisive element in maintaining our leading role."
"This was particularly useful in Bali and will prove even more so over the next two years."
"As for the Bali results themselves, I should like to begin by saying that the conference has been an unqualified success, since at the outset of negotiations all the important countries arrived at an agreement on climate change for the post-2012 period."
"The agreement will be finalised in 2009 and will cover all the fundamental elements which the EU has resolutely sought."
"We thus have a basis and a much-needed impetus to start negotiations so that an agreement can be reached on climate change. We are aiming for an agreement that will lead to drastic reductions in global emissions, in a first phase by 2020, and to still greater reductions thereafter."
"We are therefore satisfied with the overall result, which is fully consistent with our common aims for Bali."
"The participation of the United States in the Bali discussions is a clear sign that it intends to play an active role in negotiations."
"Just as important as the Bali decision, however, is the emphasis placed for the first time on the need for developing countries to take active measures."
"The leading, not to say mediating, role played by the EU, together with the perceptive and constructive input of certain developing countries such as Brazil and South Africa, were of crucial importance in bringing about this result."
"From now on, our aim is to achieve agreement for a future framework on climate change at the 2009 Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen."
"Of course, we also aim to match our ambitions based on scientific findings."
"Let us make no mistake: the road to Copenhagen will be long and difficult."
"Above all, the EU must continue to play a leading role, as it did successfully in the preparations for the Bali conference; it placed its cards on the table in the run up to the conference, showed us what course we should take and persuaded others of its views before the main conference had started."
"The EU significantly influenced the conference's positive outcome."
"We must bear this in mind when looking ahead to Copenhagen."
"The Commission's proposals accepted last week on the package of measures on climate and renewable sources of energy do exactly this; they prove that the EU is determined to make progress."
"I rely on your support and determination within the framework of the legislative procedure just begun to approve the package of measures before the end of the current parliamentary term and well before Copenhagen."
"Over the next two years we really must maintain the great political pressure being brought to bear on the issue, for it proved exceptionally useful in 2007."
"Good use of all the opportunities must be made to ensure that attention to the issue does not wane, both at European level and, more importantly, at international level."
"If we are to reach an agreement before the end of 2009, we will clearly need to work together more closely and even more strategically with our primary partners."
"This is true of our partners from developed countries most of all, because we must ensure that they display greater willingness in making more determined progress towards drastically reducing emissions."
"Without such efforts we know that it will clearly be difficult to persuade developing countries to commit to further action."
"We must therefore use all the available international forums, including G8 summits, meetings between the major economies and bilateral dialogues, to guarantee and secure their agreement and to guide them determinedly in this direction."
"We all know that some of our partners will be hard to convince."
"There is still a great reluctance on the part of the United States."
"On the other hand, we also know that progress is being made at state level, in business circles and, more generally, in the way in which public opinion perceives this issue."
"Climate change is already a central issue in political debate, as we can see in the current US presidential primaries."
"Climate and energy will be among the priority items on the agenda for this year's G8 summit chaired by Japan."
"This is expected not only to help in the announcement of a major and significant policy, but also to provide valuable opportunities that must be put to good use in the exchange of views with our partners from the industrialised nations."
"At the moment a lively debate is taking place in Japan on climate change."
"Let us use this opportunity to bring our partners closer and to demonstrate that ambition is not inconsistent with economic development or competitiveness."
"Allow me to comment on the parallel courses of action. The UN will evidently remain the main negotiating forum for a post-2012 agreement on climate change, at which point the final agreement will need to be reached."
"More specifically, bearing in mind the limited resources and means available to us, as well as the very short time period that remains, we must ensure that all these international forums and action plans are used strategically in order to support and complement the UN plan of action without undermining it in any way whatsoever."
"We simply cannot afford to duplicate efforts or waste time when the UN action plan has to a certain extent already evolved."
"We also need to work more closely with our partners from developing countries in order to plan carefully for their participation in and contribution to a future agreement."
"As was evident even in Bali, the development issue will be at the centre of negotiations: this is why our main challenge will be to build on mutual trust."
"The developing countries, the most advanced ones at least, are willing to take action."
"They will do so provided only that the developed countries fulfil their existing and new commitments to reduce emissions. The developed countries must also open up access for developing countries either to technology or, more generally, to funding."
"In view of this, we must collaborate closely with the emerging economies in order to find the best combination of methods and incentives to ensure that these economies make fairly ambitious contributions, which will lead to even more serious efforts on their part after 2020."
"Bilateral cooperation and dialogue with important countries such as China and India will be of crucial importance."
"Finally, I should like to say that the package of measures on climate and energy is evidence of our determination to progress from words to deeds; it also demonstrates that this can be done in a fair and economically effective manner, allowing everyone to be a winner."
"This, I believe, is the best way to influence our partners positively."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, you had an excellent team in Bali."
"They worked until they dropped, and I ask you to convey these thanks to your staff."
"As a European patriot, I believe that the real success of Bali lies in the absolutely crucial decisions taken by the European Union last March in favour of a trio of 20% reductions, and that is the basis on which our lives will be lived in this continent in the coming years."
"I do not intend to deal with the various successes achieved in Bali, because my fellow Members will no doubt see to that."
"I am pleased that, besides making progress with the United States, we were also able to ensure that, in addition to the 38 countries which have already signed the Kyoto Protocol, the closest G77 countries are now committed to doing something rather than constantly lamenting the fact that every government is waiting for the others to act."
"This cat-and-mouse game is over."
"That breakthrough, incidentally, could not have been achieved without the help of the United States."
"Allow me, Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office, just to say a few words on the things that will exercise us in this debate."
"We learned in Bali that we fall short if we confine all our discussions to CO2."
"I believe we need to develop far greater awareness of the sustainability debate, and it has also become apparent that we have more than just a climate crisis but also a raw-materials crisis, but even that can be turned to advantage."
"I believe we must associate the concept of sustainability far more closely with our objectives in this field in order to heighten awareness."
"But that, of course, brings me straight to the Council, Mr President-in-Office."
"We are already observing our Member States starting to baulk at the 20/20/20 goals and trying to move heaven and earth to avoid having to achieve them."
"I believe you face an extremely formidable challenge as you strive, together with us, to achieve these goals, for when the show moves on to Poznań and thereafter to another northern country, we shall have to stand our ground."
"I hope that the Commission and Parliament will be the guarantors of further progress on this issue."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say at once that I completely agree with the statements that Minister Podobnik and Commissioner Dimas gave a short while ago."
"We see them more and more frequently and shortly we shall be able to communicate in nods and winks, without speaking and without interpreters, because, it seems to me, we understand each other very well."
"I also agree with what they said concerning the fact that the additional responsibilities taken on by the European Union during the Bali Conference puts us under an obligation to play our part with even more coherence than before."
"However, today we are discussing Bali and on this issue we should pause for a moment, as, perhaps even tomorrow, we will approve a resolution that seems to me to be well put together."
"The most accurate opinion that I have come across concerning Bali was one that had been written by Mr de Boer, who, as you know, is the executive director of the Framework Convention."
"He wrote about the fall of the 'Berlin Wall of climate change'."
"This seems to me to be highly appropriate since, at Bali, as we have been reminded, a road map to Copenhagen was decided, with sufficiently precise stages and outlines."
"Specifically, and this is something I would like to emphasise, the issue of adaptation was discussed, even before 2012, as also increased financing."
"There was specific discussion of technology transfer, the issue of deforestation was included, but above all, and for me this is the most important and most promising issue, the barrier - hence the 'Berlin Wall' - of Annex 1 was overcome between industrialised countries and developing countries in a world that has changed, in which a good number of those that were developing countries are now experiencing massive growth."
"In summary, the game of pass the parcel played by the USA, India and China so as not to do anything has, we could say, been exposed, and for this reason a situation has come about in which difficult negotiations - they will certainly be difficult - have a good possibility of reaching a successful conclusion."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I think the Minister is correct in saying that we can be content with the agreement, and we can congratulate those involved in securing it."
"I do not underestimate the difficulties in getting between here and Copenhagen in 2009; besides other matters - the rainforest issue and the technological transfer - there are all sorts of hurdles in the way."
"We also have to be aware that climate change is going to take place anyway, whatever the outcome of these negotiations is."
"I was at the Holocaust Memorial Day service in Liverpool on Sunday, and I was conscious of just how is Europe, how are our people, how are our politicians going to react as billions of people across the world find themselves in positions of acute water scarcity, with ever more movement, ever more migration across the planet?"
"What sort of reaction is there going to be?"
"How much bigotry is going to be caused by this inevitable consequence?"
"We must do what we can."
"I have high hopes of emissions trading."
"I think it is getting better all the time, and I think the cap-and-trade system allows us really to tackle a huge proportion of the gases."
"Technology, too, is improving and being stimulated."
"I had a fantastic meeting this afternoon about reducing CO2 from cars, where the push that the introduction of the legislation has given seems to be already transforming attitudes and opening up opportunities."
"Maybe we can actually reach those targets without the need for biofuels."
"We can put those into power stations."
"And carbon capture and storage (CCS): I really think we could be more ambitious in our targets."
"I think we could bring that forward by perhaps three or four years and try to get realistic programmes up and running well before 2020."
"We need, from the European summit this spring, to get some firm commitments from governments."
"But, also on the European summit, I would say: renewable energy and energy saving - I think there is huge opportunity for governments to slip there, not to deliver on the goods, to find it politically difficult to bring about the institutional changes necessary, and I think the Commission needs to put as much pressure as possible to name and shame, to find new mechanisms, to ensure that Member States deliver on the goals they have now agreed."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Climate changes have accompanied the human race throughout history."
"In the opinion of many eminent scientists, however, man's influence on these changes is not very great."
"That opinion is expressed, for example, in the open letter addressed to the UN Secretary General by a hundred scientists from all over the world."
"The European Commission seems totally unaware of this aspect of the matter, and instead of acting to alleviate factors that contribute to global warming, it is taking up arms against things that have nothing to do with human activity."
"The Commission is now seeking to impose huge costs on the citizens of Europe for an action it has dreamed up from the realm of science fiction - actually, more fiction than science."
"According to preliminary estimates, each family will pay an average of more than 50 euros a month for this project, whose results may possibly be perceptible in 100 years or so."
"The real outcome, however, will be a worsening of the economies of the new Member States within the next two to three years."
"Such a drastic reduction in CO2 emissions will cause a serious slump in Poland, for example, which mainly derives its energy from coal."
"If the European Union institutions want to take a practical approach to CO2 reduction, they should begin with themselves."
"May I remind you that 20 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide are emitted into the atmosphere every year solely as a result of pointless journeys to sessions in Strasbourg."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FI) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Bali conference on climate was a success and we can be proud of the EU's role there."
"Talks on the future of Kyoto were officially begun and all the essential issues are on the table."
"Not one of them has been omitted."
"The United States has thus not succeeded in limiting future negotiations, which are bound to be difficult, as people here have said."
"The main message now, however, which Europe can send the world, is connected with our own climate policy."
"The best way to speed up the difficult international process is for us to pass ambitious laws on emissions trading, renewable energy and energy efficiency."
"I am glad that the Commission last week saw climate protection as a positive economic option - the new industrial revolution."
"How we can remain at the forefront of the development in clean new energy technology is crucially important for our economic future."
"We also have to understand that the real Gordian knot with regard to international negotiations on climate is fairness."
"The planet cannot be rescued unless the big developing countries, like China and India, also limit their emissions."
"For them to be able to accept this they have to feel that any negotiated solution is fair."
"We must be prepared in one way or another to compensate developing countries for the fact that our emissions per head of population are many times greater than those in the developing countries."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the last-minute compromise at Bali has allowed us to set our sights on Copenhagen in 2009; it has also revealed the forces of opposition which will undermine the required agreement."
"Until then the EU must remain in the vanguard, working for a broader agreement according to specific, ambitious commitments and a timetable."
"The benefits which will derive from such an agreement far outweigh the economic cost."
"My Group, as well as the November 2007 European Parliament resolution, sets more ambitious and binding targets than those that the Commission presented a few days ago, both for the EU and for the Member States; my Group seeks more generous assistance for developing countries."
"A word of caution, Commissioner: the traditional industrial lobby has already begun to chip away at the Commission's proposal and, at the same time, the nuclear lobby, like a wolf in ecological clothing, is trying to replace renewable sources of energy with nuclear ones."
"Please beware these attempts."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, the European Union went to Bali full of good intentions to obtain the best possible outcome."
"It did not achieve everything it set out to, but I am still positive."
"First of all, I am, of course, pleased that all the participating countries were able to sign up to the Bali Action Plan, and that negotiations can start."
"It is a pity that no specific emissions standards have been included in the final text of the Action Plan, but progress has been made in other areas, such as the creation of a programme to tackle the serious problem of deforestation."
"Just last week there were more alarming reports about deforestation in Brazil."
"It is also good that western countries are to provide more support for the developing countries in the use of sustainable technologies."
"Finally, one problem that has not been resolved is greenhouse gas emissions from maritime shipping."
"The complex nature of this highly polluting sector means that a global approach is necessary."
"Pressure must be put on the IMO to come up with an effective policy here as soon as possible."
"Commissioner, you can be very sure of our support for your approach."
"Madam President, I understand that, on the day the Bali climate conference commenced, there were so many private jets that Bali's airport ran out of parking space."
"Thus do our achievements fall short of our aspirations."
"The Bali conference was supposed to pave the way for a post-Kyoto consensus, but Kyoto itself has failed."
"Not only did we fail to engage some of the world's largest emitters, here in Europe only a handful of Member States will actually achieve their Kyoto obligations."
"Indeed, the United States, which we vilify for not ratifying Kyoto, is actually doing better than the EU in terms of emissions trend."
"Yet we have agreed little more at Bali than to keep talking in our attempts to replace one failed climate treaty with another."
"I would like to see us worry less about climate change and more about energy security."
"Let us hear less about wind farms and auto emissions and more about investment in nuclear generating capacity and in waste-to-energy incinerators."
"(SL) I think the resolution which was prepared by the Committee on Climate Change reflects the essential decisions of the Bali negotiations as well as the opinion of the European Parliament."
"My evaluation of the Bali timetable, i.e. the deadline for concluding the agreement for post-2012, is very positive."
"Only a clear working plan can secure continuity after expiry of the Kyoto Protocol, for which this Parliament has constantly striven."
"I am pleased that the developing countries also undertook part of the responsibility for reducing CO2 emissions and committed themselves to sustainable development."
"That, of course, means strengthened international cooperation in the field of financial and human resources."
"I truly hope that the existing and currently implemented mechanisms in Europe, such as the carbon market, will be successfully translated at international level."
"However, we must simplify them and prevent them from becoming a disproportionate bureaucratic burden in relation to their potential advantages."
"Only in that way can we expect to succeed in reaching the set targets."
"I see the current situation primarily as an opportunity."
"I see successful, sustainable development depending mainly on increased research capabilities."
"For example, the global investment in research into the energy supply has been reduced by 40% since the 1980s."
"The situation in the European Union is not much better."
"We need more money and more educated and creative people."
"I congratulate the negotiators from the European Union and I hope that, in future, we will always be represented by such persistent, sharp and successful negotiators."
"Finally, I would like to say that, usually, when it comes to climate change all eyes turn towards politicians, but action in the field of climate change does not involve politicians alone."
"This is a time for a fruitful reaction from industry, business people and researchers."
"(PT) In the resolution to be voted on tomorrow, Parliament acknowledges the political importance of the Bali Conference."
"Scientific knowledge has led to the political will to take action, and by 2009 all countries, whether developed, emerging or developing, will commit themselves to combating climate change with different but specific targets."
"Contrary to some fellow Members, I would have liked to have seen greater involvement by some partners, particularly the United States, in Bali as well as in Kyoto."
"On the positive side, however, Bali remedied Kyoto's shortcomings in areas such as forestry management, the need to support adaptation by the poorest countries in particular, the role of technology and the extension of climate responsibilities to economies not usually considered to be developed."
"Europe's leading role was clear, and this resolution shows that Parliament intends to create conditions that will allow Europe to make even more ambitious commitments."
"The work programme involved is demanding and Parliament is ready to carry it through."
"To this end and on a personal note, I applaud the Commission for the set of decisions taken on 23 January."
"Translating political will into policy instruments lends credibility to the European Union."
"A great deal of detailed analysis will be required, but quantification of renewable energy targets, clarification of sustainability criteria for biofuels and revision of climate-related financial instruments, for example, are welcomed."
"Personally I am delighted with the change in the emissions trading system from a national to a sectoral approach, though it seems to me that its compatibility with European competitiveness must be enhanced before 2009 as a matter of urgency."
"The development of the emissions trading system to the international level, based on agreements for the principal sectors among the major world producers, could be a path to explore."
"(DE) Madam President, when we look back at the Bali conference, we cannot but conclude that it was the biggest, most expensive and most elaborate climate conference ever held and that it actually achieved only one result, namely an agreement to continue negotiating."
"If truth be told, nothing more came out of it."
"An honest appraisal in the aftermath of Bali compels us to analyse the conference as follows: first of all, the International Panel on Climate Change managed to convince much of global public opinion with its climate scenarios but was by no means as convincing on the conclusions to be drawn from the present situation; secondly, while Europe forges ahead on its own, there is scarcely any sign of willingness among the international community to enter into binding agreements on CO2 reductions."
"This applies not only to the United States but also to Japan, Canada, Australia and many other countries."
"A glance at the four remaining candidates with a realistic chance of becoming President of the United States shows fairly clearly that there is virtually no prospect of commitment to a UN process in the field of climate policy."
"We - by which I mean the EU - should rethink our strategy."
"What happens if the 2009 Copenhagen conference ends in failure?"
"There are cost-effective alternatives to an international agreement, such as technology transfer, a decent system of incentives to protect tropical rain forests, carbon capture and storage and the development of nuclear energy too."
"The law of scarce resources will eventually induce even the United States and China to save energy and avoid CO2 emissions."
"The new industrial revolution will come when the price of oil rises."
"We do not need to force it by enacting laws."
"(FR) Madam President, the Bali Conference has reminded us that global warming is a challenge to development."
"There is a danger that global warming will increase the gap between the developed and the developing countries; there is no doubt that they will be most affected by the impact of climate change."
"That is particularly true of islands, which are vulnerable in more than one way, especially to cyclones and rising sea levels."
"In my view, aid to those countries for adaptation and the transfer of appropriate technologies should therefore be a priority."
"Action against climate change has become inseparable from poverty reduction and achievement of the Millennium Goals."
"I see that as the best way to obtain the support of the G-77."
"If we want the process leading to Copenhagen in 2009 to succeed and additions to be made to the modest road map drawn up in Bali, it is absolutely essential to make progress with the developing countries."
"I see that the Union has given that its attention, which is to be welcomed, but I would like to draw very particular attention to the question of islands."
"(SK) Thank you very much, Madam Chairman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"The Bali Roadmap that was agreed at the international conference and the newly created Adaptation Fund both oblige the European Union to take a leading role."
"The European Union must, however, realistically examine and assess the level of reduction that is tolerable."
"The proposal to reduce emissions by 25% to 40% by 2020 compared with 1990, or even by 50% by 2050, seems to me like random numbers without any real knowledge of the extent to which the emissions can be reduced."
"This is like a lottery game of percentages: an unpremeditated and unrealistic game of picking numbers out of a hat."
"In addition to that, unless the US, China and India participate, none of the EU efforts will have the desired effect since we cannot solve a global problem on our own."
"If we set the stakes too high, then one country will fail to meet the target, then another country will fail to meet the target and in the end we will realise that we have all failed."
"Given this situation, I would say that if we are less ambitious yet realistic about emissions reduction, we will achieve a rational solution."
"It would suffice to look at how the European Union can meet the targets laid down by the Lisbon Treaty."
"Madam President, media critics have labelled the Bali COP as 'talks with a tan'."
"However, having attended the last five COP sessions, for me Bali was effective."
"A two-year roadmap was elaborated, providing negotiating tracks for all countries to respond to the climate challenge."
"Of course it is a pity that we have to admit that there is no global binding target yet and we still are lonely riders."
"But at least there is a theoretical possibility that within two years we will have a wider front than only one quarter of the emitters."
"Not long after the Bali results, some hopefuls already raised the question as to whether this now automatically means that the front is wide enough for the 30% reductions, as was agreed in the March summit provided that the EU is not acting alone."
"The answer, however, is: not quite yet."
"This is not only for economical but also for environmental reasons."
"For the EU, it is politically important to take the lead, hoping that the others will follow, but our unilateral effort - which it still is - reduces our competitiveness in global markets giving the advantage to the polluter."
"This is called carbon leakage, as I have emphasised many times."
"The global capital will simply move to where there is no cost for emitting CO2."
"A pollution shift is not a pollution cut."
"A unilateral climate policy hits the energy and employment intensive industries hardest so the polluter-pays principle becomes a polluter-wins or polluter-relocates policy."
"Luckily the Commission has understood this risk, as you, Commissioner Dimas, just very clearly indicated, and I thank you for that."
"As Commissioner Verheugen said recently, when describing the dangers of one-sided reductions: 'We are exporting pollution and importing unemployment."
"Is that not stupid?'"
"He is right."
"Therefore we must devise a truly global-market-based mechanism and I believe that balancing this triangular dilemma of energy supply, environmental sensitivity and retaining globally competitive industries to employ our workforce is the key priority for a recently published climate package."
"(FI) Madam President, the best outcome of the Bali talks was the fact that international negotiations on a post-Kyoto agreement were begun."
"It was also important that we settled on a deadline, i.e. Copenhagen 2009."
"People here have expressed surprise at the percentage figures the European Union has proposed in the Bali agreement."
"They are the same figures which the IPCC Panel presented in their assessments and they indicate the sort of reductions in emissions we in Europe - and globally - need to achieve to manage climate change without massive sacrifices being made."
"In a little less than two years we have to establish an agreement in which there is commitment to the earth's temperature not rising more than two degrees."
"For this we need everyone: we need the European Union to show the way, we need the developed countries and we need to make a common effort to include the developing countries."
"For the present we have our own job to do."
"We have to ensure that the laws the Commission proposed last week are carried through as ambitiously as possible here in Parliament and are implemented in the Member States."
"(DE) Madam President, for 'Bali' read 'Kyoto' or 'Rio 1992', and most of the speeches made here would not be out of place."
"Why should that be, Mr President of the Council?"
"Since yours is a small country, you might be able to diagnose why we never arrive at solutions."
"Is it the power of big business and business interests, is it the fact that the international system is not working, or is it a lack of public awareness?"
"I believe an awareness deficit is no longer the problem, certainly not among decision-makers."
"It all boils down to business and politics, and I think a great number of mistakes are being made in those domains."
"We cannot engage credibly in the process and find truly constructive solutions unless we start with ourselves."
"In practical terms, this would simply mean reducing the CO2 emissions that result from political activity."
"Here is one quite specific example that the Slovenes could examine: if we were to give up Strasbourg and hold all our meetings here in Brussels, it would send out a small signal, both on the CO2 issue and in other respects."
"That would certainly be achievable for your Presidency, unlike the major projects that will have to be passed on to someone else in any case at the end of your six-month term."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Allow me a brief response to some views expressed in this very interesting discussion."
"After all, we were told that we do not achieve any results."
"The opinions of the Presidency and the President of the Council are different."
"Things are moving and we are obtaining results."
"After all, the Bali Conference and the agreement entered into by undeveloped as well as the most developed countries were actually a great success, but the success will only be complete in Copenhagen."
"That is why the next two years will be very important."
"I would also like to express my support for the resolution to be adopted by the European Parliament tomorrow."
"We see it as ambitious and thorough and as an additional aid to reaching an agreement after 2012."
"The Presidency also supports your evaluation, already expressed here, that the European Union delegation was very successful."
"It was competent, unified and very dynamic."
"And last but not least it was credible, which is very, very important for the European Union."
"In truth we can be proud of the European Union and the role it played in Bali, especially its consistency."
"It was said that the European Union is a pioneer in the development of new technologies."
"That may also answer some of the warranted fears or doubts also expressed among the Member States of the European Union about the new energy and climate package presented by the European Commission so effectively last week."
"In response, we think that it is also an opportunity for new jobs and new ecological innovations and should not raise fears about economic development."
"We agree with the opinion that it is not only a matter of politics, but also of the economy."
"Actually, we could be even more ambitious."
"Dealing with climate change is de facto a success story of European politics."
"It is a great challenge not only for European politics and economics, but also for the citizens."
"I strongly support the Commissioner's position that the attitude of the media is also very important."
"The media could play a very, very important role here."
"The package adopted by the European Commission last week is the result of an expert approach."
"The principles of equity and solidarity are built into it."
"As it has a very important role in adopting this package, we expect the European Parliament to play that role in a very dynamic way."
"Somebody asked why it was necessary to travel to Bali and use unsustainable means of transport."
"One cannot get to Bali in any other way but by using various means of transport."
"However, our answer is that it was a well-chosen destination."
"Why?"
"Because it was ..."
"Indonesia is a developing country."
"One of the key moments for the Bali agreement was that developing countries joined this global agreement."
"Such an agreement was easier to reach in Bali, Indonesia, than elsewhere on our planet."
"I would like to finish with a question relating to the 20/20/20."
"Are these targets going to be reached?"
"The credibility of the European Union stands or falls on the achievement of these targets, not least because at the Council meeting last spring the Presidents and Prime Ministers of the governments of the European Union committed themselves to the 20/20/20 vision."
"The Presidency is committed and will do everything to reach these targets."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, it goes without saying that I congratulate the representatives of the Commission and Parliament on the work they did in Bali."
"I shall adopt a more Euro-centric, more Euro-centrist view in addressing this and associated issues, as follows:"
"I should like to start by saying as has been said, although slightly differently, that necessity offers opportunities."
"The greater the need, the greater the opportunity."
"What are we facing?"
"We are facing two needs: one is to combat the effects produced by climate change, mainly as the result of development and population growth; the second is to resolve issues concerning the supply of traditional sources of energy whose use is shrouded in uncertainty either because they are becoming more scarce or because they are located in areas where the geopolitics is complex."
"What is there an opportunity for?"
"There is an opportunity to develop efficient forms of energy which allow us to continue to be competitive, and which are clean and non-polluting; and also to guarantee supply because these are new forms of energy."
"Wherein lies the problem?"
"In my view, there is a leadership deficit in the European institutions when it comes to tackling these issues, a deficit in the Commission and in Parliament."
"There is one simple reason for this, namely that we are not able to explain that clean energy is made up of both renewables and nuclear energy."
"This is not being done, this is not being explained, and it is the job of leaders to put solutions forward even though they may be difficult to discuss at a particular time."
"Are we going to find ourselves in the paradoxical situation where China, India and other emerging economies have cleaner energy because they have developed nuclear sources and, what's more, can compete with lower salaries?"
"This is a matter which simply must be addressed, Commissioner."
"I hope therefore that in Parliament and the Commission the nuclear energy question can be discussed calmly but decisively as we are continually pussy-footing around it and turning our backs on it."
"(NL) Madam President, Bali was just the beginning, a welcome first step on the way to an international climate agreement in 2009."
"Its success at the eleventh hour was down to Europe's leadership, and I congratulate Commissioner Dimas and his team."
"In December there is a global conference in Poznan."
"This will be the next test of European leadership."
"Europe must speak clearly with one voice, and loudly in favour of firm measures."
"We must make our position very clear to the rest of the world."
"Europe wants to reduce greenhouse gases by 30% by 2020."
"This is still our starting position in the negotiations."
"The fierce lobbying by some governments and captains of industry against the energy and climate package has sent out the wrong signal."
"European leadership also means that we will implement the emission reductions that we are demanding of other countries in our own 27 Member States."
"This is important."
"In Poznan we have to show that Europe is willing and able to go further than a 20% reduction."
"If we take the Bali consensus seriously, we have to start with at least 25%."
"We have to show that we can achieve this without job losses, and I have every confidence that an historic climate agreement will be signed in 2009."
"A sound European climate policy is essential for this, however."
"(PL) Madam President, the climate change conference in Bali was a test of whether there is generally a chance of worldwide cooperation to combat climate change."
"This is clearly a matter of exceptional importance for the whole world, but the political arena in which we are moving is highly differentiated, and we have to adapt our arguments to varying geopolitical realities."
"Although there were no spectacular successes, more was achieved than hitherto."
"We gained important partners."
"In the European Union climate change is a priority issue."
"Putting it simply, nobody wants the lights to go out in their children's homes."
"But not all European countries are at the same level of technological progress, and this is a further challenge for the European Union."
"Poland is a country in which 96% of electric power is produced by burning coal, and for that reason adapting our energy industry by 2020 may be an unbearable burden."
"We here in Brussels, who are responsible for the well-being of the people of Europe as a whole, must take greater account of the possibilities of individual countries and not set the bar so high that only a few can clear it."
"With regard to the reduction of gas emissions, resource diversification is not the only possible approach."
"Non-emissive coal combustion is also worth investigating."
"Another possibility is nuclear power."
"Provided that, when the construction of a nuclear power station is planned, specific strategies are adopted to address all subsequent exploitation issues, nuclear power is one of the cleanest energy sources."
"In short, I believe it is crucial for our future that we exert specific pressure on the research community to develop new technologies that are significantly more advantageous and more efficient for our planet than those currently available to us."
"(PL) Madam President, the energy and climate change package proposed for the European Union is an elaborate organisational and legislative mix aimed at achieving a significant reduction in CO2 emissions."
"The Commission's ambitious plans are based on the assumption that the climate changes taking place in the world, which are an undoubted fact, are the result of CO2 emissions, and yet that has not been proved and was not sustained in Bali."
"All predictions in the matter are based solely on computer simulations and do not constitute proof."
"First of all, Commissioner, more credible data is required on the influence of CO2 emissions on the climate."
"CO2 is the necessary substratum for photosynthesis."
"Is it therefore a destructive agent?"
"I would refer you to the previously mentioned letter addressed by a hundred distinguished scientists to the UN Secretary-General last December."
"Second, the Commission's imposition of restrictions on CO2 emissions within the European Union without the issue being tackled on an international level will result in a downturn in economic development, with serious social consequences."
"Third, and most important, in its energy and climate change package the Commission has ignored the main conclusion of the Bali conference concerning the adaptation of societies to unavoidable climate changes, i.e. to steppification, desertification, lack of drinking water, floods, etc. These are the main aims to which the resources which the Union is planning to devote to combating climate change in Europe should really be assigned."
"Madam President, in the debate over so-called climate change, we take for granted a few disputable prerequisites."
"Firstly, climate changes are real and dominantly caused by people."
"Secondly, conclusions made by the IPCC Panel are the only valid results."
"There are no other groups of scientists with different opinions on global climate change."
"Thirdly, people are generally willing to discount their future and sacrifice current living standards."
"Fourthly, European businesses and enterprises will survive in global competition, even with higher prices."
"Fifthly, we will manage to persuade the rest of the world to follow our obligations."
"As I listen to the debate, I realise that I am in a minority in this House, but let me stress my position."
"Firstly, the outcomes of the IPCC Panel are exaggerated."
"There are other groups of scientists who offer different positions on climate change and its causes."
"Secondly, there is no evidence that mankind is dominantly causing climate changes."
"Thirdly, climate change has become a fashionable political tool for manipulating people. Fourthly, the conference in Bali proved that there is no widespread support for excessive and extremely expensive measures for handling climate change."
"Fifthly, European producers will have to incorporate political decisions into prices, which will subsequently result in higher prices and further loss of European competitiveness at global level."
"Sixthly, ambitious plans for the reduction of greenhouse gases will harm developing countries, which will lead to deeper differences between the rich and the poor."
"So what should be done?"
"We had better reduce the legendary European red tape, limit the production of legislation at a supranational level and let people work and invent."
"(RO) We are all beginning to feel climate change, no matter which continent or country we live in."
"We are facing floods, desertification, water shortages, forest fires, glacial meltdown, and changes in the flora."
"The UN has declared 2008 the International Year of Planet Earth."
"The Bali conference is extremely important for a post-Kyoto agreement on the fight against climate change."
"The European Union should remain in the vanguard of action to reduce climate change and adapt to its effects."
"Existing European legislation and the new package recently presented by the Commission for the promotion of renewable energy sources are cases in point."
"I'm glad that we are having this debate during the European sustainable energy week."
"Transport accounts for 30% of the global energy consumption, and urban transport accounts for 70% of emissions."
"Including air transport in the emission quota exchange system is a major step."
"Other Community objectives should be more effective urban transport and promoting railway and waterborne transport, as they cause less pollution."
"We call on the Commission and the Council to include climate change among its priorities, both in EU affairs and in its international relations."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the conference in Bali was a step in the right direction, and I should like to express my warm thanks to my fellow Members and to the Commission for what I regard as a good result."
"The increase in the average global temperature is already having an impact in many parts of the world."
"It is therefore imperative to adhere to the aim of limiting global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels."
"Efforts to achieve that aim must be reinforced and nurtured by means of new innovations, investments in research and development and, above all, investment in education and training."
"Climate change interacts with agriculture in three different ways."
"On the one hand, farming is the third-biggest source of pollution after transport and industry."
"Secondly, it bears the heaviest brunt of climate change, because our agricultural production takes place in the open air, which means that it is more directly exposed than any other economic activity to the effects of climate change."
"Thirdly, farmers can also see climate change as an opportunity and turn it to account."
"New prospects are opening up to us in the farming community as producers of renewable resources and above all - in the second and third generations - as producers of substitutes for petrochemical products, not to mention the scope for new cultivation methods."
"I must re-emphasise the importance of research and development and of education, especially in the agricultural sector."
"The production of renewable resources, however, is crucially dependent on the development and application of sustainability criteria."
"Climate change, Commissioner, is a global problem, affecting entire societies rather than being confined to specific areas of activity."
"Accordingly, this comprehensive EU-wide and indeed worldwide approach is the only way to tackle it."
"The European Union should play a leading and facilitating role in these efforts."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the road from Bali to Copenhagen is now open and I think that it should not occupy us so pressingly."
"We must now concentrate as a matter of urgency on the new package of targets that you have submitted: the three 20s for 2020, as I call it, or what others refer to as the 'Dimas package'."
"As things stand, though, I believe that in the next 18 months until the end of this Parliamentary term, this package of initiatives ought to become Community legislation."
"That is our absolute priority."
"Many have criticised you for making this package too ambitious, and others for its complete lack of ambition. This, I daresay, is the best proof that you are on the right track."
"Allow me to make one further brief point. Not merely governments and the European Parliament, but also individual citizens must play their part."
"We can all do better here."
"Everything from traffic jams to how we design buildings and live in them concerns citizens, not just governments."
"I trust that your work in Brussels will help raise general awareness of this."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, listening to today's debate I noted with surprise that the term 'sustainable development' was not used once."
"It was a fashionable even if a somewhat overworked concept as recently as the early 1990s, as shown by the agreement of the states attending the Rio de Janeiro conference in 1992 to protect the environment in a reasonable fashion in the course of its exploitation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, sustainable development is not an outdated concept, a passing fad of politicians and environmentalists."
"It is a concept that seeks to reconcile the interests of the huge ecology lobby with those of the industrial lobby."
"So let us look at the achievements of the Bali conference in the light of the old principle of sustainable development, a principle valued not only in Europe but at international level too."
"We must protect our planet against climate change, but not at the cost of destroying our industry."
"Let us seek an intelligent compromise."
"(PL) Commissioner, I attended the Bali conference as a member of the Polish delegation."
"It was moderately successful."
"European countries are now responsible for COP14 and COP15."
"What is the greatest obstacle to complete success?"
"In my opinion it is the lack of effective, accessible cheap technology."
"We, as the European Union, should concentrate on this."
"In so doing we shall be helping ourselves and our economy, and also helping others through the transfer and exchange of the best technologies."
"It will be a lot cheaper than imposing on industry ever more increasingly drastic emission reductions."
"It requires revision of the EU budget and a transfer of resources."
"Let us decide to do that."
"This year in Poznań, in the framework of COP14, the Polish Government will be proposing a worldwide review of the best technologies."
"The leading firms and most advanced countries will be presenting the best technological solutions."
"If Copenhagen is to succeed in 2009, we must first make a success of Poznań 2008."
"Madam President, having attended my fifth UN climate change COP and MOP, I returned from Bali with a sense of achievement for the first time on this most important of global issues."
"One of the clearest messages from Bali was the urgent need to find a mechanism to ensure avoided deforestation and degradation of our forests is part of any post-2012 international agreement."
"I would like us to be in a position to add another 20% to the '20/20/20 by 2020' formula."
"If we had an agreed system of credits to reward or compensate native communities, thereby mitigating the present rate of deforestation, particularly of our tropical forests - notwithstanding the immense difficulty in mapping a baseline figure for existing forestation - we could reduce global carbon emissions by another 20%, so that '20/20/20/20 by 2020' must be our goal."
"Bali produced the roadmap for global agreement by COP15 in 2009 in Copenhagen, very ably led by you for the EU, and I would like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on your personal contribution."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, the EU is in the vanguard of the struggle to combat climate change and in this struggle you are clearly playing a special role."
"If the EU is to remain in the vanguard of this struggle, however, it is not enough simply to create legislative initiatives or draw up binding targets."
"The EU must also play a leading part in the implementation of the binding targets that it has set, with as united a front as possible."
"We can see that there are many serious divergences amongst the EU Member States in the implementation of targets for combating climate change."
"For this reason we are now awaiting measures, incentives and initiatives to narrow the gap and make the responses to this target of the EU Member States as a whole more cohesive."
"(SK) As a substitute member of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change, I would like to highlight the huge success achieved by the European Parliament at the global conference in Bali."
"The European Parliament must become a visionary pressing for permanent sustainable development."
"What do we have to do next?"
"Firstly, we cannot slacken our efforts."
"The European Union must encourage investment in research and development aimed at developing efficient technologies that require less energy."
"We cannot talk solely about CO2."
"Setting increasingly strict ecological conditions is not the correct solution: by doing so we risk putting our small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe at a disadvantage."
"We must not resist new ideas such as the strategy of helping the climate to recover through the medium of water."
"A team of Slovak and Czech scientists led by Michal Kravčík, an eminent expert in using water to recover arid urban spaces, has prepared a new water paradigm."
"Concentration of rainwater in water containers is a simple, quick and very effective solution."
"I believe that storing rainwater for future use instead of letting it go down the drain is a good strategic solution not only in the US but also in Europe."
"I trust that the Commission and the Council will support innovators' ideas and that the use of new water paradigm will get the support it deserves in Europe too."
"Madam President, it is great to listen to a debate and then be able to respond and to hear from those who were in Bali because we do not hear enough as to what happens out there."
"Can I raise just one particular issue?"
"It is fashionable to talk about climate change and, while the public have bought into it at the moment, I think we are at risk of switching them off."
"We need to be very careful that what we suggest and propose is doable and we have practical results to show for it."
"In relation to agriculture, raised by Ms Schierhuber in particular: in Ireland, for example, 28% of our emissions come from agriculture."
"I believe that agriculture has contributed significantly already."
"We need, again, to be careful not to ask too much of agriculture and risk our food security."
"So this is not an easy problem to solve."
"The point was made about forests."
"I think we need to look at encouraging those continents with vast forests not to rip them out, just as we are trying to encourage our farmers not to plough permanent pasture because of such important carbon sinks."
"So let us do what we can on the global stage and let us all hope that people are buying into the European leadership on this, because without it we really do not have a chance of achieving our objectives."
"Madam President, I should firstly like to thank the Members of the European Parliament for their highly positive contributions."
"One thing is clear: we have tonight heard views representing the arguments of those such as the United States and Australia who did not want to move towards ratifying the Kyoto Protocol."
"These views have since been abandoned, as Australia has ratified Kyoto and in the United States, at both federal and state level, these views are no longer accepted."
"I also heard an erroneous statement, which I am sure the honourable Member made in good faith, namely that the United States has better results than the EU."
"As is shown by the data for 2005, however, the United States has increased its greenhouse gas emissions by 16.4%, while the EU is reaching the Kyoto target and in 2005 emitted in total 7.9% less than 1990 levels."
"T here is therefore a wide gap between the EU's achievements and what the United States is failing to achieve, and it should be noted that the United States was due to reduce its emissions by 7% under the Kyoto Protocol, which it signed but did not ratify."
"Instead of the -7% target, emissions were +16.4% in 2005, while the EU is on its way to meeting its target of -8%."
"This is already below 1990 levels."
"I should also like to point out that Ireland's greatest problem is the major increase in its carbon dioxide emissions from transport."
"In recent years we have seen a 160% increase in greenhouse gas emissions."
"Undoubtedly, agricultural production plays a major role and there are many solutions in that area."
"For example, New Zealand has developed special animal feeds, which are contributing greatly to limiting carbon dioxide emissions."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Bali action plan, which was agreed last December, is an important element in the debates on the future international climate change regime."
"Our fundamental achievement was to have already begun formal negotiations; there are now clear indications that the requisite target in the fight against climate change is being reached, with regard to the agreement on climate covering the post-2012 period."
"Within the scope of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change the creation of a new ad hoc group has been approved to negotiate long-term cooperation, together with an ad hoc working group already operating under the Kyoto Protocol."
"All the parties contracted to the United Nations Framework Convention, including the United States, will take part in these negotiations."
"A major issue will be funding the struggle against climate change."
"We must find ways to speed up funding, channel investments and make these ways even more environmentally friendly: this will encourage clean technology and efforts to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change, thus attracting investment both from the public sector and also to a large extent from the private sector."
"This is the central element of the negotiations; allow me, though, to stress how important it is that we in the EU take action without a moment's delay."
"As your resolution correctly emphasises, we must, among other things, increase our efforts to integrate climate parameters into our development policy."
"I am convinced that we can also be more successful in areas such as trade and investments at bilateral and regional level."
"Further mobilisation of the private sector is also vitally import and must be exploited even more."
"Preventing deforestation is undoubtedly very important. As you have correctly pointed out, relatively small investments can help us make gains both in the fight against climate change and also in the prevention of loss of biodiversity."
"We shall move in this direction because the prevention of deforestation can be achieved even before an agreement is concluded or the new agreement comes into force."
"This is therefore a vital area for us to tackle."
"The Commission is determined to help the EU maintain its leading role in these new discussions on future climate change arrangements; I am greatly relying on your support in this matter."
"We are at the very beginning of negotiations on climate change policies for the post-2012 period."
"The EU's leading role in the climate change issue will be crucial in ensuring that this dialogue continues and yields positive results."
"We must, however, always bear in mind that our leading role depends on and is influenced by the policies and measures we adopt within the EU."
"The implementation within the EU of climate policies and the speedy approval of the raft of climate and energy measures will continue to be crucially important if we want to maintain our leading role and drive international efforts in combating climate change to a successful conclusion."
"Let me once more stress that we look forward to continuing and close cooperation with Parliament in this process."
"In accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received a motion for a resolution winding up this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 31 January 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (RO) We have recently received a document concerning the climate change that all of us can perceive."
"The document entitled ""Don't fight, adapt - We should give up futile attempts to combat climate change"" has been sent as an open letter to the UN Secretary General."
"As its title indicates, 100 specialists are urging us to accept climate change not with resignation but with enthusiasm, arguing that CO2 is essential to photosynthesis."
"I'm no chemist or biologist, but I haven't been able to ignore the dramatic climate changes taking place in recent years."
"I can't help noticing that we no longer have four seasons, but two."
"I will not resign myself to the idea that in ten years' time I will be skiing indoors, on a 100-yard slope."
"I will not accept the notion that I can only sunbathe between 5 and 7 a.m., for fear of getting skin cancer."
"So I say to myself - I couldn't care less about their photosynthesis, what I want is to go skiing, to sunbathe and to lead a normal life."
"in writing. - (HU) The climate summit organised by the UN in Bali did not have any specific results, but did open up the way for a new, global climate agreement after 2012."
"Unfortunately, the largest emitters, such as the United States and China, still do not want to be part of this important process that serves the Earth's future."
"Considering the preparations for the American presidential elections that have taken place up to now, however, we may hope that a candidate who, in contrast with the current administration, feels responsible for the future of our planet is the one who wins."
"If the United States signs up to the climate agreement, it will hopefully be easier to convince China."
"Of course, we must not forget that Europe is the largest consumer of Chinese products, and consequently, as buyers, we also have a hand in Chinese greenhouse gas emissions."
"The European Union's representatives in Bali spoke of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40% in their declarations."
"Last year, the European Parliament voted for a 30% reduction in emissions."
"The latest report by the Commission still only recommends a 20% reduction in emissions by 2020."
"It would be advisable to sort out these objectives, to support the same targets externally and internally, and for my part I naturally support the more ambitious reduction of 30%."
"in writing. - (RO) The crowning moment of the Bali conference was the adoption of a roadmap for a secure climate future, which is a new negotiation process due for completion in 2009, leading to the resumption of negotiations concerning global warming after 2012, when the first stage of the Kyoto protocol ends."
"The outcome of the conference consisted of major decisions underpinning the roadmap: the Adjustment Fund, the transfer of green technology from the rich countries to the poor, measures for decreasing emissions resulting from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries."
"Fighting deforestation is an essential priority in European environmental policy, and a coordinated effort on the part of Member States will help to combat global warming."
"It is a promising sign that the Bali Action Plan includes strategies for containing environmental disasters and means of addressing the losses and damage associated with climate change in developing countries."
"The European Union played a major part in the successful conclusion of this conference, ensuring that the latest scientific recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were given due consideration."
"in writing. - (HU) I welcome the compromise achieved at the Bali climate protection summit, and the decision relating to this by the EP Climate Change Committee."
"In my opinion, the Bali compromise is a breakthrough, because the parties agreed to a mandate for negotiating a new climate change agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol which will expire in 2012."
"At the same time, for the first time, developing countries and the United States have also committed themselves to reducing the impact of climate change."
"Hungary's position is the same as that of the other Member States of the EU."
"In March 2007, the European Council decided to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 20% by 2020 in comparison with the 1990 level."
"In order to meet this ambitious target, the European Commission prepared its plan for a climate protection and renewable energy package, thus providing an example for other industrialised countries."
"I hope that its report on sustainable agriculture and biogas, adopted yesterday by the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, will also contribute to the fight against climate change."
"I would like to draw attention to the fact that climate change is already a real problem in Hungary, since desertification threatens the area between the Danube and the Tisza."
"The environmental and social erosion of the Homokhátság area must be stopped, because it would lead to the subsistence of around 800 000 people falling into even greater danger."
"We must stop the desertification of the Homokhátság!"
"(The sitting was suspended at 8.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"The Regional Development and Cohesion Funds are very important for the new Member States, since the differences between regions are very significant for them."
"My country, Romania, can apply for more than EUR 20 billion for regional development by 2013."
"One year after our accession, experience shows an improvement in drawing on funds dedicated to regional development, but we are still far from accomplishing what we want."
"It is crucial for the regions of Romania that they increase their ability to draw on the Funds, by using them effectively and accounting for them systematically."
"Romania needs tools for this, such as, for example, an effective and increasingly decentralised system of public administration institutions, and a new division into areas of economic development, since the current regions are not fit for purpose, nor are they effective, so new regions need to be created from the bottom up according to appropriate social agreements, and which would be led by elected regional governments."
"The new division of Romania into areas of economic development cannot be delayed. Thank you very much."
"(BG) I would like to draw your attention to some problems related to disaster and accidents at sea."
"These are usually discussed when they occur, and then time quickly sweeps tragedies away from memory."
"Accidents at sea, however, are part of the common maritime policy."
"We must get ready for them just like we get ready to implement a transfer."
"The Bulgarian ship Vanessa was shipwrecked recently in the Sea of Azov."
"During the past several months there were a number of accidents in the Bay of Kerch in bad weather."
"Sailors died, others went missing, there were damages worth millions of euro."
"The Sea of Azov and the Black Sea were polluted with oil."
"The common maritime policy needs to provide for measures to minimize risks and establish navigation arrangements which will reduce accidents."
"We need a comprehensive scheme for rapid response and conduct of emergency rescue operations."
"We need equipment which can operate in severe weather stationed so as to enable its rapid deployment at accident sites."
"(RO) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: obesity affects more than half of the population in most Member States."
"What is even more worrying is that every year more than 400 000 European children become overweight."
"One of the issues to be addressed in combating obesity is the effective labelling of food products."
"Unfortunately, European food labels do not yet provide the information consumers need in order to make healthy and safe decisions."
"Therefore, I welcome the European Commission's proposal to review the Directive on the labelling of foodstuffs and implicitly the establishment of a simplified labelling system, printed on the front of the packaging of foodstuffs."
"However, I regret that the Commission's proposal does not include a colour-coded labelling system clearly indicating the nutritional value of the product (low, medium, high)."
"Labelling should be to the advantage of both manufacturers and consumers, and a well informed consumer will make wise dietary choices."
"Mr President, with regard to the upcoming referendum in Ireland on the Reform Treaty, I would like to put into context the importance of this from an economic point of view, because the Reform Treaty, if nothing else, is about making the European Union more efficient in its decision-making capacity, which in itself will lead to greater economic success and greater growth."
"From an Irish perspective, last year there was EUR 2.6 billion worth of investment in Irish industry and Irish business; 9 000 new jobs were created; there were over EUR 80 billion worth of exports; over 80% of all products manufactured in Ireland were exported, mainly to the European Union markets."
"Average salaries in Ireland are EUR 44 000 per year, and over EUR 3 billion are taken by the Government in corporation tax."
"These issues - to ensure the continuing growth in economic terms, in employment terms, in economic growth and in wealth management - are what is so important."
"That is why we are all seeking a 'yes' vote for the referendum in Ireland."
"(PT) When unemployment in Portugal has risen to one of the highest levels in the last 20 years, affecting women and young people in particular, yet another multinational is exerting pressure on workers to rescind their contracts of employment."
"The company concerned is Yasaki Saltano, which wishes to abandon cable production in Serzedo, Gaia."
"It intends to continue to transfer production to other countries, particularly in Asia and Africa, after already making drastic cuts in its labour force."
"This multinational employed over 6 000 workers in its factories in Ovar and Serzedo, for which it received millions of euros in Community aid."
"Those jobs have now been cut by more than two thirds, however."
"We must therefore once again stress the need for effective measures to prevent these relocations of production, rather than mere palliatives such as the current globalisation fund for workers affected by relocations of multinationals, particularly in the automotive and automotive components sector, examples being Opel Portugal, Johnson Controls and Alcoa Fujikura, which have now closed."
"(PL) Mr President, at the last session I was not allowed to speak, and I am therefore protesting today, in the European Parliament, at an infringement of human rights and an assault on the dignity of the individual."
"During a flight to Buenos Aires at the invitation of the Polish American community, where we transmitted and defended universal European values together with the director of a Catholic radio station respected by millions of listeners, we were harassed by journalists from the private, commercial television network TVN, who tried to force us to give interviews, and personally insulted the clergyman and myself, a Member of the European Parliament."
"This psychological violence, which endangered our mental and physical wellbeing during the fourteen-hour flight, was relieved by several interventions on the part of the Lufthansa flight crew, but it continued after we landed."
"I would also draw attention to the danger of supplying third parties with information about flights, seat numbers and hotel reservations, contrary to existing legislation, since it can be used by all sorts of terrorists."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, in their speeches in the European Parliament our Hungarian colleagues regularly attack Slovakia without any justification."
"The last attack consisted of lies about the abolishment of the national radio broadcasting network in Slovakia and teasing about how Slovakia should cooperate with Hungary on the normalisation of protection of Little Rye Island waters on the Danube."
"We have already come to an agreement, after all, on the water regime in the entire Danube region."
"The last agreement consisted of a treaty concluded by Hungarian and Slovakian Government delegations in 1998 - I led the Slovakian delegation - and I remember well that this treaty accommodated the Hungarian requirements concerning this area too."
"The Slovakian Government has ratified this treaty and respects it, and now, finally, it needs to be ratified and respected by the Hungarian Government too."
"(RO) Mr President, as rapporteur on regional cooperation in the Black Sea region, I would like to express concern for Bulgaria's agreement of 18 January 2008 to take part in and support the Russian South Stream energy project."
"This project poses a dual challenge to the energy security of the European Union."
"First of all, a Member State's support to this project runs counter to the primary objective of diversifying the energy resources of the Union."
"The South Stream project would only increase the EU's dependence on a single source."
"Secondly, by its very existence, the South Stream project undermines the NABUCCO project, which is believed to be of strategic importance for the success of EU energy security policy."
"Allow me to remind you that this agreement between Bulgaria and Russia came at a time when the European Parliament was adopting with a majority of votes the report on Black Sea cooperation."
"(RO) I would have preferred my first one minute speech not to deal with a negative topic, but what happened last week on the Eastern border of the European Union should serve as a warning to us all."
"On 21 and 22 January, groups of Ukrainian citizens blocked the access of cars to the Siret-Porubnoe border post, between Romania and the Ukraine, because of their discontentment with the requirement to pay for a visa for entering Romanian territory, whereas Romanian nationals no longer require a visa to go to the Ukraine as of 1 January 2008."
"As a Member State, Romania must comply with European regulations concerning visas for non-EU nationals and cannot possibly grant preferential treatment to the Ukraine."
"This is why I believe that the Parliament and the Commission should ask for more consistent action from the Ukraine, as a means of asserting its European vocation..."
"(President interrupts the speaker)"
"Mr President, I want to draw attention to a recent report by the Environmental Protection Agency on water quality in Ireland."
"While we have invested significantly in upgrading waste water systems under the Water Framework Directive, we still have to achieve certain objectives with regard to water quality."
"In this connection, I want to mention an issue which we have ignored and continue to ignore in Ireland: the issue of putting substantial resources into upgrading and refurbishment of septic tanks in Ireland, particularly in rural Ireland."
"There is far too great a tendency to blame septic tanks for the threat of pollution to Irish drinking water."
"But, to the extent that there is a problem, it is imperative that the Irish Government put in place a grant-aided programme to examine and, where necessary, upgrade existing septic tanks."
"But perhaps there is an agenda here not to invest in upgrading septic tanks, and then to use this as a stick with which to beat the rural population. If so, this is short-sighted and totally contrary to European legislation."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Neapolitan politicians are in the habit of sending their rubbish throughout Europe."
"Today the waste has reached the Quirinale, where the dirty Bolshevik Napolitano has given the order to provide blandishments to prolong the death-agony of his drinking friends, without a care for democracy or for the people's wish to vote for a new parliament."
"This, however, is all you would expect from someone who spoke in favour of the Soviet invasion of Hungary."
"(PT) I would like to take this opportunity to speak in the plenary to denounce the unacceptable situation of Kader Şahin, a young Turkish Communist Party activist who has been detained by decision of the Turkish authorities since January 2007, with no grounds being given for the charges against her, or for holding her in preventive custody awaiting trial."
"Kader Şahin was arrested when a press conference denouncing the repression of Turkish political prisoners in December 2000 was violently disrupted by Turkish police."
"Bearing in mind that another hearing on her case is scheduled for 5 February, we express our dismay at this situation and call upon the Turkish authorities to release her immediately and drop the unfounded allegations against her."
"Mr President, Alexander Litvinenko testified to the Mitrokhin Commission in Italy and made to me personally the allegation that Romano Prodi was an agent of some kind of the KGB."
"Mario Scaramella of the Mitrokhin Commission later came to London to warn Mr Litvinenko of murder threats."
"Mr Litvinenko was soon murdered."
"Mr Scaramella returned to Italy, where he was immediately arrested."
"He has been detained for the last 13 months on trumped-up charges, without trial and denied access to the outside world."
"Mr Scaramella has lost his income, his home, is separated from his children and his health is at risk."
"Mario Scaramella is a political prisoner."
"His continued detention is a scandal at the heart of the European Union."
"His only offence, if it can be so called, was to help shine a light into the rotten corners of European politics."
"All democrats should call for his immediate, unconditional release."
"(HU) In this European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, I would like to draw your attention to an extremely discriminatory draft law by the Romanian Conservative Party which, if adopted, would penalise people who belong to ethnic minorities and who do not speak the state language of Romania with loss of their nationality."
"This language law is primarily aimed at the Hungarian community in their ancient homeland of Transylvania."
"Up to now, not a single Romanian parliamentary party has opposed it, and the National Council for Combating Discrimination has even given it the green light."
"At the same time, the Romanian parliament is preparing to adopt another discriminatory law, the Education Act."
"We will be contacting Leonard Orban, the Romanian Commissioner responsible for multilingualism in the European Commission, about these issues very soon, because we are convinced that Romania must follow the democratic practice of the European Parliament with regard to its language laws."
"Mr President, I wish to raise an issue in relation to the Convention on the Adoption of Children."
"This was adopted by the Council of Europe in 1967."
"Four decades later it is out of date and needs to be replaced."
"In 2002 the Council of Europe decided that it should be changed."
"There were proposals agreed in 2004."
"The text of the new convention was agreed in 2007 by the legal experts."
"However, it appears that one country is now having a road block and blocking it from coming before the Committee of Ministers."
"I think a clear message should be sent from Parliament to the Council of Europe that this matter needs to be amended at the earliest possible date and a new convention put in place to bring it up to date with what has happened in individual countries, and also taking into account the decisions of the Court of Human Rights."
"I would ask that a clear message be sent to the Council of Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, the cost of visas for non-EU citizens has increased following the extension of the Schengen zone."
"Belarusians, for example, now have to pay 12 times as much for a visa - 60 euros instead of 5 euros."
"That is as much as a junior doctor earns in Belarus."
"Sixty euros is a third of the average monthly wage."
"For many Belarusians it is a barrier that prevents them from obtaining visas and visiting their EU neighbours."
"The Union is impeding direct contact between citizens just when it is enshrining a policy of good neighbourliness in the Treaty of Lisbon. The increase in the price of visas is thus a painful paradox."
"It is also a perfect present for President Lukashenko, who says Belarusians can expect nothing from Europe."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this must be changed."
"I call for all steps to be taken to reduce the price of visas for citizens of Belarus."
"Mr President, yesterday the Russian state-funded youth organisation Nashi published the list of Estonians whom they propose to declare personae non gratae in Russia."
"Amongst them, next to the President of the Republic of Estonia, Toomas-Hendrik Ilves, a former MEP, is my friend and colleague, Tunne Kelam, a member of the delegation to the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee."
"Nashi, supporting the non-democratic regime of President Putin, describes Mr Kelam as a consistent Russophobe, who has been notable for his nervousness and unhealthy homespun nationalism."
"All of us who know Mr Kelam well are perfectly aware that those heartless words are complete lies."
"In my opinion, the European Parliament should react to this insult."
"But, on the other hand, being an enemy of the enemies of democracy in Russia is quite a grand compliment to Mr Kelam and his efforts."
"(PL) Mr President, one of the main principles valued throughout the European Union is that of non-discrimination."
"Many documents contain references to the need for special protection for the rights of the disabled."
"The social role of sport, including its role in social integration, is also appreciated."
"Some EU countries are now adopting legislation on social assistance for sportspeople and former sportspeople, especially former Olympic participants, in difficult material circumstances."
"So much the better."
"But it is hard to accept that disabled sportspeople should be overlooked in this connection."
"(BG) For the past 20 years Bulgaria should have been a rule-of-law country but it is not."
"Neo-communists in our country will stop at nothing."
"Georgi Pirinski, the Speaker of Bulgaria's Parliament, restricts the freedom of speech by imposing prohibitions on journalists, thus preventing them from doing their job."
"At the same time it turns out that Mr. Pirinski is a US citizen and according to Bulgarian legislation he is anything but a Bulgarian citizen."
"On the other hand, one of the most notorious drug traffickers in Europe, Budimir Kujovic, has Bulgarian citizenship because he was issued a passport by the top people in the Ministry of Interior, so that he could travel across the Union freely and go about his business."
"The Prosecutor's Office conducted an inquiry, no one is to blame, but the passport is a fact."
"At the same time, the party most strongly in opposition in our country, Ataka, is subjected to daily attacks by the powers that be."
"Our leader's wife, Kapka Siderova, had a miscarriage because the harassment against her got so far that charges were pressed against her in a fabricated political trial."
"Finally, I suggest to Mr. Pöttering that he should do something more than sit apathetically and support neo-communists in Bulgaria."
"(CS) As far back as 2000 the Council of Europe expressed its wish to transform the European Union, within 10 years, into the most dynamic and competitive part of the world."
"Since then it has been repeatedly said that somehow we are not succeeding."
"Nothing substantial has been done about the patents legislation and our entire innovation environment is lacking dynamism."
"The modified Lisbon Strategy does not bring anything that is very new."
"Perhaps the targets it sets are slightly more modest."
"This is a further reason why we should try to set targets that are easier to meet."
"In my opinion, these include the simplification of legislation and the abolishment of unnecessary regulations in all areas where this is possible."
"Curbing the high rate of European legislation is a promising method."
"Introducing the principle of 'discontinuity' into the workings of the European Parliament would surely be beneficial in this regard."
"It would be a positive step if the legislative proposals that have not been tabled could be abandoned once the parliamentary term is over."
"(FR) Mr President, last week the package of legislation on climate change and energy was presented."
"We must welcome the spirit of the Commission proposals."
"These issues affect a large number of areas, in particular housing and more especially social housing."
"We realise that a large proportion of the housing stock in the Union will be affected by these necessary changes."
"The charges relating to heating, for instance, are a major expense for tenants and they need to be regulated and even reduced."
"The changes to social housing form part of our sustainable development policies and they call for appropriate financing in order to meet these new requirements."
"Until now, the Commission has concentrated financing on the new Member States, who have therefore received substantial support."
"The older Member States have not."
"National housing policies need consistent financial support to speed up changes to social housing."
"If the policies described are to be credible, we need to match actions to words."
"The Commission will have to take the necessary follow-up action and finance changes to social housing everywhere in the Union."
"(DE) Mr President, I wish to place on record in this forum an incident that occurred in the chamber this afternoon."
"When President Pöttering was in the chair, Martin Schulz, the Socialist Group chairman, called out so loudly and clearly to me from the front row that he could be understood up here."
"'Shut your trap, you idiot!' were his words."
"That is truly unacceptable behaviour; it is insulting as well as calumnious."
"I expect appropriate steps to be taken, particularly since the man in question aspires to the position currently held by Mr Pöttering."
"That is no way to conduct the business of a parliament. Matters were made worse by the fact that, at the same time, some Members were singled out at random because they had the courage to call for a referendum and were then threatened with absurd sanctions."
"(BG) The second year of Bulgaria's membership to the European Union is about to turn fatal for many Bulgarian dairy farmers."
"High fodder prices, low farm-gate purchase prices for milk and the shortage of funds for feeding the animals during the winter months, and the lack of a targeted government policy in stockbreeding are factors that could lead to liquidation of the livestock and to bankruptcy for many Bulgarian farmers."
"Today, when reforming the common agricultural policy is a particularly important topic for the European Union, we should take into account the current condition of the agrarian sector in the new Member States as well."
"We cannot neglect the difficulties faced by farmers in the newly acceded countries which result from adaptations to meet European standards."
"Bulgarian farmers, like their European colleagues, expect wise decisions for the future of the agri-business in the Community."
"(ET) Ladies and gentlemen, the harassment of the Director of the St Petersburg Office of the British Council, Mr Kinnock, and his colleagues going as far as questioning by the Russian authorities requires our full attention."
"The charges levelled at the British Council are a link in the chain to which the cyber attacks against Estonia, the blockade of Polish food products and the radioactive attack in London also belong."
"In each case the Kremlin has innocently claimed that the incident was an isolated one."
"Ladies and gentlemen, such a high number of isolated incidents points to a system."
"The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Lavrov, said explicitly last Thursday that the reform of Europe's security architecture is a priority in Russia's foreign policy for 2008."
"Russia wants to reform the European Union by paralysing our foreign policy and by squeezing us in an energy vice between the North Stream and the South Stream."
"As we do not wish to become the undefended target of a strong Russian foreign policy, we must stand firm together in solidarity."
"We in the European Parliament must condemn the harassment of the British Council."
"(RO) The free movement of goods is one of the cornerstones of the European Union."
"I would like to draw Parliament's attention to the situation of this fundamental principle in Romania."
"On accession, the Romanian Government decided to adopt a first registration fee for motor vehicles."
"The Government then announced its intention of discontinuing this fee which the Commission considers to be in breach of the acquis communautaire, in order to prevent the continuation of the infringement procedures opened against Romania."
"However, the Romanian authorities refuse to reimburse citizens for the fees they have already paid, although this obligation is enshrined in ECJ case law."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the concept of European citizenship and equal rights for all European nationals will only be fully realised when all the Member States transpose and comply with the rights defined in the Treaty."
"I would like to inform you that I have started a written statement and I would like to ask you please to sign it, to avoid such situations occurring in the future."
"(RO) The Lisbon Strategy expresses the EU's commitment to becoming the most competitive knowledge-based economy."
"The Lisbon Strategy objectives include increasing investment in research, the development of the information society and the creation of highly skilled jobs."
"Unfortunately, woefully few Member States have invested 3% of their GDP in research."
"Two-thirds of these funds should come from the private sector."
"Today, when we are talking about reducing climate change, sustainable energy resources, greener vehicles, increasing the energy efficiency of various industries, switching to digital technology etc., investing in research should be one of our priorities."
"Unfortunately, despite the allocation of national or European funds to research, the link between basic research and the industrial application of its results is still very weak."
"I call upon the European Commission to prepare a strategy and an action plan enabling all European citizens to benefit from the results of research."
"I am convinced that the development of applied research will lead to the creation of high-skilled jobs and the development of a knowledge-based economy."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to speak about a topic that is very important in terms of maintaining a variety of regional products and protecting traditional products, namely 'České pivo' (Czech beer)."
"It was this name, 'České pivo', that was published in the Official Journal of the European Union in the middle of January this year, together with a proposal to register it as a protected geographical designation."
"'České pivo' is unique not only according to its consumers but also according to brewing industry experts and Commission officials."
"Due to the way in which the Czech brewing industry developed in the past, the types of malt and hops used and the brewing processes used have all given 'České pivo' a taste that is different from European beers such as Heineken or Stella Artois."
"The Czech Republic was pressing for registration for more than three years."
"Long and exhausting negotiations culminated in publication in the Official Journal."
"I would like to thank the officials of the European Commission as well as the Czech experts for their responsible approach to this matter."
"I believe that from now on nothing will prevent 'České pivo' from becoming a part of Europe's cultural heritage."
"Mr President, I wanted to raise the issue of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease which by 2020 will be the third largest cause of death worldwide."
"COPD killed 2.7 million people in 2000."
"Up to three quarters of people with COPD have difficulty with simple tasks such as walking upstairs."
"COPD is associated with many other health problems, and smoking is not the only risk factor: environmental tobacco smoke and pollution are also linked to COPD."
"As the population ages, COPD will become a bigger problem."
"I urge colleagues to sign Written Declaration 0102/2007."
"(HU) Mr President, I am speaking in my mother tongue, Hungarian."
"I cannot do that at home."
"I am delighted that it is possible here."
"In relation to the question of the Roma, it is the duty of all of us to ease the tensions that have recently built up between ethnicities and to stop the widespread anti-Roma sentiment."
"We must find an urgent solution to economic migration."
"The EU Roma Strategy does, however, form a basis for working out a policy for new and traditional national minorities within the EU."
"Kosovo has reminded us again that the question of human and minority rights has become an international, European issue."
"We are responsible for what happens inside and outside the EU."
"Today, in one of our Member States, it is not Community rights but Community crimes that are being raked up."
"In Romania, the language law would deprive several hundreds of thousands of people of their nationality."
"We are mentioning this because we are all responsible for our countries, for our neighbours, and for the whole of Europe."
"This responsibility is not only present at elections, but it continues to be present in our everyday work, and in finding a reassuring solution to the Roma question. Thank you."
"(SK) The situation in the Slovak Parliament is tense and unusual."
"A decision is to be made on the Lisbon Treaty but the opposition MPs do not intend to take part in the vote as a protest against an anti-democratic press law."
"This is surprising news but what is behind it?"
"Robert Fico's Government continues to adopt measures that contradict the basic principles of democracy and a state governed by law."
"The Prime Minister ignores the opposition and, as he has said himself on more than one occasion, the main opposition in his view is the media."
"The press law is restrictive and the way in which it curtails the freedom of speech and press freedom is unacceptable."
"This was highlighted not only by the Slovak Syndicate of Journalists but also by the OSCE; the latter even vigorously appealed to the Parliament to reject the controversial proposal."
"On behalf of the vast majority of opposition MPs, I can say that we support the Lisbon Treaty and we regret that the Slovak opposition's means of protesting against such a shameful press law are restricted."
"(SK) The European Parliament recognised the struggle for human rights in Cuba by awarding the Sakharov Prize to the Cuban dissident Oswald Payá Sardiñas in 2002 and to the Ladies in White in 2005; however, ladies and gentlemen, there is much more to solidarity."
"The people of Cuba, who can only dream of freedom while being threatened by repression and imprisonment, need more than solidarity."
"The 'Damas de Blanco' need concrete help from the European Parliament today to free their husbands, opponents of the dictatorial regime, whose health has deteriorate due to inhumane conditions in prison and who risk dying in prison."
"Mr President, I am asking you to help secure the release of 45-year-old Antonio Ramón Díaz Sánchez, who was sentenced to 27 years in jail in 2003."
"Antonio, whose family we have been supporting, and whom I have symbolically adopted along with my fellow Members Peter Šťastný and Milan Gaľa, is seriously ill and urgently needs help: without it he will succumb to his illness in prison."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Last week, here in Parliament, President Barroso presented the Commission's road map for bringing about the ambitious European reduction in carbon dioxide."
"The next day, the council of Trebišov in Slovakia unanimously rejected a plan to build a power plant that would emit 4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, and against which there have been widespread protests for a year and a half, with petitions and fines on both sides of the border."
"We could say ""Hurrah!"
"Democracy, subsidiarity and civil courage work.”"
"There is, however, another question here. How can it even occur to the Slovak Ministry of the Environment to support and recommend such a power plant?"
"This suggests to me that some countries have still got lots of free carbon dioxide quotas from the Commission."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to review the grounds for the carbon dioxide quota awarded to Slovakia, because if the Slovak government is racking its brains about a giant coal-fired power plant using obsolete technology in 2008, it means that the Union's incentive system is not working. Thank you."
"(SK) In its report published on 17 January 2008 the European Regulators Group states that since the European Parliament and the Council adopted the Directive on roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community roaming call charges have fallen and operators have not been attempting to compensate for their losses by increasing charges for other types of calls."
"It was also found that when it comes to roaming calls, overcharging by EU mobile networks can be as much as 20% due to call tariffs: roaming calls are billed on a per minute basis."
"I appreciate the efforts of Commissioner Reding, who announced that the Commission would be looking to remedy this situation."
"In my view, it is essential for the mobile operators to offer consumers roaming calls billed on a per second basis just as they do at national level."
"I further recommend that the document that is being prepared also address the cost of SMS and roaming data services."
"Mr President, a wise December decision by the Commission to allow the import of Brazilian beef only from approved holdings envisaged by 1 February a positive list of approximately 300 farms, based on previous inspections by the Food and Veterinary Office."
"Confusion is rife following a statement today by Commissioner Kyprianou that there would be a ban from this Friday, as the Brazilian authorities had presented a list of 2 600 farms, raising major doubt, so more time will be needed to check them out."
"But the Commissioner continued - and I am quoting - 'There is no positive list for the time being ... but, of course, this can change in the next few days'."
"So, will there or will there not be a ban?"
"Will the 300 or so FVO-inspected holdings form a de facto positive list, pending inspections of others?"
"Why was there no press release today from a Kyprianou source?"
"Our consumers and our farmers deserve clarification."
"Mr President, could I bring to the attention of the House a very important report published yesterday by the Commission about the lives of over a million European people who live in institutions?"
"These are people with a disability, and the conclusions are not very comfortable reading."
"The quality of life in these institutions varies greatly, and the dignity of the people who live there is not always guaranteed."
"Institutional care is often of unacceptably poor quality."
"Can I ask people in the House to read their own country report, because it might just wake us all up?"
"I know the situation in Bulgaria received media attention recently, and lots of us are concerned about that, but even in my own country we could make improvements there too."
"It is not just about money."
"Services in the community are not more expensive than institutional care if we take into account the needs of the residents and the quality of their lives."
"Lastly I will mention the Delta Centre that I visited in Carlow in Ireland just last week."
"It is a model of best practice for adults with a disability who can live in the community and visit this centre."
"(RO) Mr President, the Roma issue is one that concerns the entire European Union, not Romania alone."
"The Union has made available significant funding to ensure the promotion of equal opportunities."
"Funds have been earmarked for the desegregation of Roma; however, problems still persist."
"I believe that the implementation of these European funds should be monitored, and in particular it is the sustainability of EU-funded projects that should be monitored."
"Mentalities are hard to change."
"However, education plays an important part in changing mentalities."
"Therefore, I believe that additional funding is needed for intercultural education, cultural and artistic activities, sports events, ""second-chance” education, healthcare education etc. leading to Roma integration in all European societies."
"I'd like to reiterate the need to monitor these programs, in particular their sustainability."
"That is the end of the one-minute speech, which was a little longer than usual."
"I think it was the longest one-minute speech in the history of this Parliament."
"That had to happen one day."
"Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: Realising the Potential (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Fiona Hall, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency: Realising the Potential."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs very much for their good collaboration on this report."
"Energy efficiency is vital for cutting carbon emissions, enhancing security of supply and boosting economic efficiency."
"In October 2006 the Commission produced an action plan for energy efficiency, proposing a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 and setting out 10 priority areas for action."
"These ranged from appliances to buildings and transport and included financial incentives, energy efficiency awareness and much more."
"EU Heads of State endorsed the Commission's action plan last March and energy efficiency made the headlines because Chancellor Merkel declared that inefficient incandescent light bulbs should be banned."
"Now it is the Parliament's turn to assess the action plan."
"I hope that our report will send out a strong signal about what MEPs want to see happen on energy efficiency."
"The first signal that this report makes is that some of the Commission's proposals do not quite go far enough."
"I would like to give three examples."
"Firstly, the proposal to revise the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive: the Commission proposes minimum energy performance requirements for buildings and for building components, which is good."
"Buildings are key to cutting energy demand."
"Over 40% of the energy we use is consumed in buildings and 75% of the buildings standing today will still be here in 2050, so we need to tackle energy efficiency in existing buildings as well as in new stock."
"But we should not just be lowering the 1 000 m2 threshold in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive - we should be getting rid of it altogether and applying the Directive to all buildings requiring heating and cooling, regardless of size."
"We also need to bring forward the deadline for a passive house standard for residential and non-residential buildings across Europe."
"It is not good enough just to have this as a medium-term goal."
"Secondly, on appliances, Parliament's report welcomes the proposal to put in place minimum energy performance requirements coupled with a dynamic system of energy labelling, to keep up with advances in technology."
"But our report calls on the Commission to come forward with a one-watt performance requirement for standby, and to carry out an analysis of the potential energy savings to be made from eliminating standby altogether."
"Our report also urges the Commission to set a timetable for taking completely off the market some very energy-inefficient items of equipment, such as patio heaters."
"Thirdly, the report calls for more help for small businesses, which are particularly affected by rising fuel prices and in need of energy efficiency."
"Unfortunately, both the EU and national financing schemes tend to be complex."
"It is fine if you are a big company, but if you are a microbusiness with a handful of employees, you do not have the capacity to access complex programmes."
"Small businesses need to be treated like domestic households and offered simple schemes and up-front money."
"So that is the first message of the report: that we need to go a little further."
"The second big message is that there has been a failure by both the Commission and national governments to implement existing energy efficiency legislation."
"The Commission's action plan for saving 20% by 2020 is not a stand-alone plan."
"It builds very heavily on previous legislation, and the implementation of this legislation has been a disgrace."
"The Buildings Directive has only been properly transposed by a handful of Member States."
"Six months after the 30 June deadline, a third of Member States have still not submitted their national energy efficiency action plans."
"The Commission has not put in place all the 20 extra staff it said were necessary to deliver energy efficiency commitments and, for that reason, the timetable on the action plan has slipped."
"I would, however, like to thank the Commission for responding in a very positive and constructive manner to the criticisms voiced in this report and, in particular, the exchange of letters between Commissioner Piebalgs and Ms Niebler, which has brought an update to Parliament on the situation."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would very much like to thank Ms Hall for a very timely and important report."
"We are definitely concentrating our efforts not only on the implementation of current legislation but on actually delivering our agenda of energy efficiency action plans."
"I would like to mention that we have also achieved sustainable successes."
"This week we launched the Covenant of Mayors, in which more than a hundred cities are now participating."
"We have now adopted in the College a renewable energy directive which indirectly strengthens energy efficiency."
"We adopted the proposal for CO2 reduction in the non-ETS sector."
"We adopted a proposal for emissions from cars."
"I could name more very strong measures, where the Commission has delivered."
"We have not only delivered on issues of legislation."
"Sustainable Energy Week is a good example of how the Commission policy of promoting energy efficiency and renewables is bearing fruit."
"I believe that we should strengthen implementation."
"The Commission has started launching 59 infringement cases for non-timely implementation."
"Today, 42 infringement cases are running."
"The Commission will continue to work on this and will also check all the legislation on compliance."
"The European Commission is strongly focused on this."
"I believe the current legislative proposal on ETS, on non-ETS and on renewables will definitely make the Member States put more emphasis on energy efficiency."
"Concerning the energy efficiency action plans, we had rather a lukewarm start."
"I wrote to ministers reminding them about their duty to report and to make qualitative plans and now 21 out of the 27 Member States have done so."
"We have made a preliminary analysis of energy efficiency action plans, which are part of the package and sometimes a bit overshadowed by the legislative efforts."
"I believe that it is right that we continue to do this."
"On the issues Ms Hall mentioned, a recasting of the Buildings Directive is in this year's work plan."
"We are now in the final stages of defining energy performance in appliances."
"We will also change the Labelling Directive."
"We are in fact following all the requests that the European Parliament has made of us."
"But I believe this directive also offers very good guidelines for the Commission to follow, because it is very concrete."
"I could say in some cases things are better and in some cases worse."
"I really believe that we are paying attention, but we could pay more attention."
"We will definitely deliver."
"This report will not stay on the shelf but we will use it as working document."
"I will be continually updating Parliament on how we are proceeding in the area of energy efficiency."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report is complete and coherent."
"In the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we have emphasised the important issues."
"By general admission, the improvement of energy efficiency is the fastest, most sustainable and most economical way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency."
"We ought to encourage research and eco-innovation through the development of energy-efficient technologies, without, however, ignoring the need for a shift in our consumer habits."
"We have emphasised the potential role of the public sector in achieving European targets by choosing energy-efficient products and services."
"I should point out that as European citizens we can all contribute to the effort, as much in terms of mapping out policies as in implementing existing legislation, through the choices we make in our everyday lives."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President, I agree with Ms Hall when she points out in her report that energy efficiency is the most cost-effective and immediately available tool in the battle to cap greenhouse gas emissions."
"Yes, the Commission is right when it states in its action plan on energy efficiency that, more than anything, political will and engagement at national, regional and local level are necessary if the objectives here are to be achieved."
"The whole report has been rightly critical of both the Commission and Member States for not doing more to implement existing energy-efficiency legislation."
"This pressure has resulted in the Commissioner augmenting his staff in the area of energy efficiency and, I understand, setting up a special unit to follow up on the energy efficiency plan, underscoring the priority the Commission is finally giving to energy efficiency in order to contribute to a reduction of our CO2 emissions and to help tackle the critical issue of climate change."
"However, Parliament's report shows that progress on Member States submitting their national energy efficiency plans is still lamentably slow and I would ask the Commission to continue to put pressure on them."
"Even in Bali, Europe was criticised for not giving enough emphasis to the area of energy efficiency and our efforts to reduce our CO2 emissions."
"We need a mixture of legislative and market-based responses."
"For instance, if all EU lighting switched to new technologies, there would be massive savings on energy."
"Fifty million barrels of oil would be saved and CO2 emissions would be reduced by 28 million tonnes per annum."
"We await the revision of the Energy Efficiency Labelling Directive from the Commission this year, as the current A to G scheme for household appliances allows no further room for increased energy efficiency and, while very clear and consumer friendly, it is now creating marketing problems for genuinely more efficient products as it has reached its limit."
"Many appliances are classed as A+ or A++, categories that do not even exist."
"On the other hand, there are currently 188 million household appliances in the EU that are over 10 years old and are frighteningly inefficient."
"I thank Ms Hall for her wide-ranging report and I commend it to colleagues."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, the report by Ms Hall, whom I congratulate on her complex approach, draws attention to a significant delay on the part of the Member States and the Commission in implementing existing legislation in this area."
"The efficient use of primary energy depends on improved efficiency in converting it into electricity, on the introduction of standards for minimum energy end consumption, on the widespread thermo-modernisation of buildings, on the widespread introduction of co-generation by eliminating administrative barriers, and on the reduction of energy transfer losses and losses due to friction."
"The report also highlights the global scale of the problem and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions."
"Housing accounts for some 40% of all energy consumption, and thermo-modernisation could reduce its intake by at least half, i.e. 20% of all energy consumed."
"Furthermore, co-generation, together with the reduction of energy transfer losses, can double energy efficiency."
"Taken together, the potential savings in primary energy achievable through the use of known technologies, namely thermo-modernisation and co-generation, can be estimated at around 25% to 30%, with an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions."
"The paradox, however, is that the implementation of these plans may be held back by later European Commission regulations, specifically restrictive CO2 emission standards which, in the case of older power stations and heating plants in need of modernisation, raise production costs and reduce the possibilities for modernisation investments."
"Another aspect of the global nature of the problem is the need to draw up common standards of environmental suitability applicable both within the European Union and in its partner countries."
"That is a precondition both for beneficial cooperation and for fair competition on world markets."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, may I begin by thanking and congratulating my colleague Fiona Hall, who has come up with the right response to a very important and judicious fundamental initiative from the Commission."
"I must praise Commissioner Piebalgs for having put himself at the head of those who are committed to energy efficiency, because energy efficiency is undoubtedly one of the main sources of self-sufficiency with regard to energy supply."
"It is also a source of innovation, for if we do everything we are proposing in the report, we shall establish ourselves well ahead of the field, even on a global scale, in terms of innovation and the objectives of the Lisbon Process."
"Be that as it may, I am struck by the immoderate criticism of people's lifestyles at some points in the report."
"Let me just cite one example: paragraph 16 baldly asserts that the Commission should take certain appliances off the market."
"A specific reference is made to patio heaters or Heizpilze - 'heat toadstools', as some people call them in Germany."
"Hysteria about climate change does sometimes bring out veritable totalitarian traits!"
"We have just managed to evict smokers from cafés."
"I believe that was the right thing to do, and I have no problem with it."
"Many landlords have now acted shrewdly and have put up these patio heaters outside."
"A new culture has developed."
"People have started to have convivial evenings outside, where they can smoke, and now along come the European politicians, we few individuals here, and tell 490 million people how they can and cannot spend their leisure hours."
"We are trying to change lifestyles again."
"I do not think our citizens will put up with this for much longer."
"It is right that the aims of climate protection should be writ large, but we really must ask ourselves whether we should be seeking to regulate the details of people's lifestyles."
"Or do we want to outlaw patio heaters at the Christmas markets that we know from Germany and - yes, Claude - from Luxembourg as well as from Belgium and Austria?"
"We would all be well advised not to forget our fellow citizens and to avoid interfering in such a pleasant aspect of society as people's personal lives."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Commissioner, to this day homo sapiens has been causing serious damage to the environment, of which he himself is the most important element."
"To a considerable extent this is due to energy use, and Ms Hall's report on the rational use of energy is therefore most welcome."
"I particularly appreciate the fact that the report deals with the demands to be made with respect to buildings."
"The highest standards of energy efficiency and thermo-insulation must apply not only to new buildings but also to renovated building stock."
"The next thing is to use lighting based on LEDs, which are energy-saving and long-lasting."
"Many domestic electrical appliances could also consume much less energy during use, and energy waste caused by keeping appliances on stand-by must also be avoided."
"I am in favour of tax incentives for rational energy consumption."
"Educating the public on energy issues is also very important and should begin in childhood."
"These are things we must do if our planet is to have a future."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, the Hall report is ringing the alarm bells."
"We are in the middle of Sustainable Energy Week and, however positive this event is, it should not divert attention from the fact that what governments, in particular, have achieved over the last two or three years on energy efficiency is extremely disappointing."
"Not implementing legislation, sending energy efficiency action plans which are not action plans but just a compilation of some sort - that is ridiculous!"
"I call on the pride of prime ministers."
"Come on, prime ministers!"
"You come to Brussels in March one year after the historic summit where you prime ministers have given a lot of speeches about the priority of priorities being energy efficiency, and then you come one year later and you have achieved almost nothing as governments!"
"I think we should all join forces to urge governments forward."
"The Commission must also approve and take new initiatives on building on CHP and on labelling electricity savings."
"Finally, on my good friend Schatzi:"
"(DE) The only one being dopey around here is you, because there were Christmas markets long before patio heaters were invented, and I believe Parliament is perfectly within its rights at least to ask how inconsistent we are being on climate change."
"It is not a matter of interfering with people's lifestyles; it is a matter of applying pressure to a wound, which is what this House must do if we intend to heal it."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Madam President, there is general agreement in the EU that we need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in order to stem climate change, but this must not lead to a bureaucratic society without freedom and dynamism."
"Two basic principles apply here: we must set targets for emissions for each country and then leave it to those countries and the market to attain the targets in free competition, and we must internalise the cost of emissions by pricing emission rights at sufficiently high levels."
"Emissions will then be automatically taken into account in the billions of economic decisions taken every day around the world by households and businesses."
"Then households will of their own accord choose energy-saving light bulbs, car manufacturers will produce vehicles with low fuel consumption, property developers will build passive houses, energy producers will produce energy with low emissions."
"It will then pay to carry out research and development in the field."
"But the EU must not introduce bans and detailed regulations."
"We therefore have to say 'no' to a ban on patio heaters, and we say 'no' to tax concessions for building demolitions and to the public funding of energy-saving."
"(EL) Madam President, Commissioner, I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Hall, on her bold, holistic approach to the issue of energy efficiency, which goes beyond the European Commission's proposals."
"Given today's energy situation, energy efficiency is the most effective tool in combating climate change, as the system of trading greenhouse gas emissions has not yet produced the desired results."
"As for energy efficiency, emphasis must be placed on the construction sector, which is responsible for consuming more than 40% of our energy."
"In Greece the construction sector consumes about one third of the total energy resources and contributes 40% of carbon dioxide emissions."
"Nonetheless, Greece has yet to incorporate into national law the Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings; it was recently censured by the European Court of Justice for this, and was also listed among the 10 countries which have not yet produced a national action plan for energy efficiency."
"However, although the harmonisation of national legislation with that of the Community is essential, it is not enough if we are to reach our desired objectives."
"I am pleased that the Commissioner emphasised that the EU must insist as far as possible on a more coherent implementation of the energy objectives by all Member States."
"The measures and incentives suggested in the report, such as access to energy efficiency funding by the Structural Funds, an increase in the minimum percentage allocated under the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, tax incentives and, most of all, VAT reduction on energy-efficient homes and SMEs, can be extremely helpful to this end."
"The climate change target cannot be attained in isolation but by all the Member States together."
"If we want the EU to continue to be in the vanguard of this effort and to negotiate strongly with other states, we must make it a priority to close the gap between those countries playing a leading part and those lagging behind."
"(PL) Commissioner, I congratulate you on the measures taken."
"Europe's most important problem today is energy use and its impact on the climate."
"It is more important for Europe today than food production - that we can be sure of."
"After checking carefully, I find that all of the last eight Council Presidencies made it a priority, and some made it priority number one."
"But if energy issues are so important, they must receive commensurate funding."
"Otherwise we shall go on mouthing empty phrases with nothing to back them up."
"We know how much added value can be generated when we in the European Union all pull together."
"If we share our experience, choose the best solutions and combine them, we can be certain of great progress."
"So the question is: are we prepared to spend joint European funds on research, technologies, innovation and development in the energy sector?"
"The energy efficiency we are talking about - suitability and savings - is even more important than renewable energy or clean coal."
"Yet out of a total budget of a thousand billion euro, only a few hundred million over seven years is allocated to joint European research and development programmes."
"I call on the Commissioner, the European Commission and the European Council to rethink the matter and choose the path of rapid technological development before imposing very severe emission standards."
"Today in this House we are once again discussing important energy issues, which comes to prove that addressing energy problems in their interplay with climate change is one of the highest priorities of European institutions."
"Ms. Fiona Hall's excellent and comprehensive report also bears evidence to that."
"Energy efficiency is definitely one of the pillars that will underpin our energy policy for a long time to come."
"European citizens realise their role and the role of energy efficiency in terms of achieving the goals of climate stabilisation and a future of more energy security."
"Therefore, in the presence of public support and a favourable political situation, I encourage the Commission to show even more initiative, use all mechanisms to influence behaviour so as to ensure that the ambitious 20 per cent goals are met and that the benefits of energy efficiency can be felt by every European."
"At the same time, if our ultimate goal is to save the planet from catastrophic climate change while having a energy-secure and competitive Europe on the global market, then the remaining 80 per cent of energy should be given adequate attention."
"These 80 per cent include nuclear energy which is currently underestimated and continues to be overshadowed by apprehensions and dogma over the past two decades."
"The need to pool together all of our wisdom and common sense to overcome this and start discussing nuclear energy openly and clearly as business and an opportunity which mankind and Europe cannot afford to miss."
"All of us in this Chamber have the political responsibility to make this happen."
"(NL) I am very pleased to be allowed to speak using the catch-the-eye procedure."
"This debate on Ms Hall's report has clearly shown that we need to move more quickly."
"There are so many opportunities for energy efficiency."
"It is what we in the Netherlands call a 'low-hanging fruit': if we seize these opportunities, then we can very quickly help to achieve the common targets we have set ourselves and that we reiterated in Bali and confirmed again in the Commission's package of 23 January."
"Mr Piebalgs played a very important role here."
"In the Committee on Regional Policy we noted - and Mr Buzek mentioned this - that in the period up to 2006 it was perfectly possible to prioritise energy and energy efficiency among the aims of the Structural Funds, yet only 1.16% was actually spent on this."
"Now, Mrs Hübner announced in discussions with the Regional Policy Committee last week that the regulation was to be revised and greater priority given to these issues in the 2007-2013 programmes."
"So my conclusion here is that we need to move faster and make better use of the existing instruments at European level."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank Members of Parliament for a very substantial debate."
"As I said, it is the Commission's ambition to follow the energy efficiency action plan."
"I know sometimes you wish that we would move faster, but there are some steps that we should also take - better regulation, public consultation and impact assessment."
"Everything takes time."
"I believe we need a debate about regulation and also incentives."
"I think both should be in balance but both instruments should be used."
"Today I met a Minister from Montenegro."
"They have an excellent energy strategy developed until 2025, but I urged him to go very strongly for regulation, because this is a country which will have a huge increase in its buildings."
"They will not deter investors if they set an extremely tough requirement for the immediate reintegration of renewable energies."
"All standards and the country will benefit."
"Otherwise, the taxpayers will pay for additional energy supplies."
"So I believe ambition is needed."
"We have set out new guidelines on the budget issue."
"We need to make much more effort to establish when state aid for new technologies, energy efficiency and renewables is to be applied."
"We are also working on an international platform for energy efficiency that could create synergies at international level."
"However, budgetary authority lies not only with the Commission but also with Parliament."
"I am very grateful for the work Mr Buzek did for the seventh Framework Programme."
"I think that we still have substantial means."
"It is also part of your good work and the work of this House."
"An increase in the budget or redistribution is a much more complex issue, one I cannot answer."
"I would not mind additional money in my colleagues' budget - Mr Potočnik's budget or the external relations budget - but it should be seen in common in the budget debate."
"So I thought this an excellent report."
"It is not always very kind to the Commission but it is not about kindness."
"We are speaking about energy efficiency and ambitions will definitely be high on the Commission's side as well."
"rapporteur. - Madam President, I would like to thank colleagues for their positive and supportive comments, and also to say again that I appreciate that the Commission is being very constructive in response to the criticism from Parliament."
"I would just like to take up two points."
"First, I think it was indeed a shame that there was not more attention paid to the Commission's assessment of the energy efficiency action plans that came out with the energy package last week because it was a very worryingly downbeat assessment."
"It is clear that national governments are still not being ambitious enough in their action plans."
"They are not looking ahead to the 20% target and, to quote the Commission, there exists a 'considerable gap' in certain Member States 'between the political commitment to energy efficiency ... and the measures adopted'."
"I think that this is worrying."
"Secondly, the fact that we now have the Renewables Directive and the targets therein means that energy efficiency has never been more important."
"If we are going to reach the 20% binding target across the EU, we have to keep energy demand under control."
"We can only do 20% if the 100% of the total amount of energy use is something that is reduced rather than being allowed to increase."
"So I hope this report does mark a new beginning and that it marks the start of a closing of the gap between political rhetoric on energy efficiency and its actual implementation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 31 January 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"I welcome the drafting of this report and the global approach it proposes to energy efficiency in the European Union, in terms of its topics and geography."
"It is important that we should be speaking today of an action plan and its details; this shows that we are taking concrete steps in this direction."
"As rapporteur on regional cooperation in the Black Sea region, I would like to stress the importance of energy efficiency in this region in order to achieve the energy security goal and to decrease dependency on energy sources."
"I also appreciate the international approach to the topic and the examination of global challenges."
"As such, I welcome the European Parliament's awareness of the fact that in the future Russia will be unable to meet the internal and contractual demand for gas, and that it expresses its concern in this regard."
"This prompts us to reiterate to the European institutions the importance of two major objectives: increased substitution of EU energy imports with other sources, effective ways of ensuring security of supply, and the need to promote energy reform in the Black Sea region and in EU-neighbouring countries with a view to creating a transparent and sustainable energy sector."
"in writing. - The Plan of Action was targeting 20 % efficiency by 2020 is an ambitious plan but a necessary one."
"On the other hand, it is useless to set targets if there isn't a will to achieve them."
"For instance, out of a total of 21 actions scheduled for completion by 2007 only three were completely finalised."
"This is a dismal record."
"It is true that many others are in progress but nonetheless a percentage which is less than 15 % of completed projects is not something to be proud of."
"I am ashamed to say that in me country, Malta, the issue has not been tackled seriously."
"In an island where the sun and wind exist in abundance one would have expected that full use would be made of these two elements."
"Regarding solar energy very few private, commercial and public buildings make use of this alternative energy."
"Wind energy was more popular in the past in agricultural areas."
"The Government is intent on setting up offshore wind farms notwithstanding that the technology is not available for the depths of Maltese waters."
"Not only but it has made it known to a major developer, who waited to set up four wind mills generating energy, that the permission would not be given because of aesthetic reasons."
"in writing. - (HU) Improving energy efficiency is the most obvious solution for reducing the emission of harmful substances."
"Joint action in this area can also make a real contribution to eliminating Europe's dependency on energy supplies."
"The greatest opportunity for saving energy perhaps lies in the efficiency of industrial and residential buildings."
"This is increasingly true in the new Member States of the Union."
"The Socialist heavy-industry facilities and tower blocks that are home to hundreds of thousands and which are so characteristic of the region have become symbols of energy wastage."
"It is a welcome development that the European Commission has acknowledged the particular situation of the former Socialist countries in its action plan, and specifies the promotion of energy efficiency as a priority objective in the new Member States."
"We feel it is unfortunate that several Member States are not keeping their promises when implementing the energy efficiency legislation."
"For example, the Hungarian government, whilst paying lip service to climate protection measures, has postponed adoption of the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan for months."
"At the same time, it is to be welcomed that, despite this, some communities are taking advantage of the opportunities."
"A good example of this is the programme started in Óbuda, one of the largest districts of Budapest, under which many tower blocks will be refurbished in the years to come, using Community aid."
"We are convinced that Europe is capable of playing a leading role in the issue of energy efficiency."
"It is also its primary interest."
"The most efficient use of energy also means a more efficient economy, new jobs, better competitiveness and, last but not least, a more liveable environment."
"in writing. - First of all, I would like to welcome the initiative report by Ms Hall."
"As a matter of fact, this report comes at a time where all initiatives aiming at reinforcing concrete actions for greater energy efficiency should be warmly welcomed."
"Energy efficiency is indeed the most effective objective providing already available technological tools for genuinely and rapidly addressing the challenges of global warming and limited fossil resources."
"We are now embarked on a plan to cut energy consumption and it is essential that we reach our goals on schedule."
"But of course such a plan will require enormous costs and economical sacrifices."
"These costs and sacrifices will be especially very challenging for those countries with the lowest budgets and less developed economies."
"It is essential that the energy efficiency targets will not simply worsen the situation of the weakest economies and industries in the poorest Member States."
"Therefore, ad hoc transitional measures to support the most vulnerable sectors and countries while implementing the legislation are required to avoid market failures."
"Of course, in the long run, there is indeed huge cost-effective potential of energy conservation and stronger energy efficiency policy would very likely benefit the job market in the Union."
"in writing. - (FI) There are probably few decisions as far-reaching in their effect and as self-contradictory as the Council's three-pronged plan on climate policy as stated in spring 2007: a reduction in emissions of 20%, a 20% saving in energy, and a renewables share of 20%, all by the year 2020."
"The third-mentioned binding target unfortunately threatens to accelerate climate change."
"Until this is understood, any climatic benefit can only be gained from the first two."
"Saving energy specifically to improve energy efficiency is of course one of the most effective tools in the fight against climate change."
"There is broad consensus on this and on the content of the report in Parliament and I would like to thank Mrs Hall for making this possible."
"What is creditable about this report is that it shows an understanding of the scope of the issue and the options it offers: the insistence on energy efficiency must have an effect that permeates the whole of society."
"It has to relate to all planning and activity at all levels."
"The aims of energy efficiency and the rules that apply must extend equally to equipment, buildings, energy production and transfer, transport and consumer habits."
"We need to take action right away."
"That is why it is regrettable that Parliament should need to remind the Commission that there is already legislation in place in this area."
"So far the degree of implementation among the Member States has been less than satisfactory, which is something the Commission should focus its attention on."
"Improving energy efficiency is about effort, where the best result as far as climate is concerned is achieved with reference to market conditions."
"An example of this is the various standardisation systems."
"We need to be wary of inflexible legislation: if the best available technology is under the yoke of a carrot and stick regime, the efforts made are sufficient."
"The legislator's pernickety interference in the ways and means only serves to exhaust the organisations in question."
"in writing. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, in this debate on the rational use of energy, while agreeing with the main arguments of the rapporteur, Ms Hall, I want to draw attention to some issues that are of particular importance for the new Member States."
"1."
"In order to narrow the gap between themselves and the most developed EU countries, the new Member States must develop two to three times faster than the latter, i.e. at an annual GNP growth rate of at least 6%."
"Such a growth rate will mean a significant increase in CO2 emissions, something that was not taken into account in the proposals put forward by the European Commission in its recent energy and climate change package."
"2."
"The Commission's proposals are clearly directed at restricting the use of coal, which will mainly hit economies like that of Poland, where energy production is based mainly on burning various kinds of coal."
"3."
"The proposal that the energy production industry will have to purchase all its CO2 emission allowances by auction as from 2013 will cause a massive increase in energy prices that will be particularly painfully felt by the domestic economies."
"At the present time, when the Polish energy production industry buys barely 10% of its emission allowances at auction, the price of electric power has risen by some 15% in 2007, and is set to rise in the next few years by a further 20% to 30 %."
"in writing. - (HU) As the EPP-ED rapporteur in the Committee on the Environment on the Green Paper on improving energy efficiency (Doing More with Less), I welcome the repeated and increased Community efforts in this area."
"At the same time, I must express my disappointment that while the European Commission and Parliament are making serious efforts to create consensual rules and prepare implementable plans, the attitude of Member States towards realising them is in many cases inadequate."
"Some Member States have missed the deadline for preparing action plans by months or more; for example, there are seven countries which, to date, have still not submitted them, even though they are already 7 months overdue."
"This is not the only problem, however."
"There is a lack of social agreement on these plans, and the plans that have been prepared are often very anaemic, and in many cases do not reflect the realistic schedule and system of instruments for achieving the common objectives."
"Consequently, we can say quite bluntly that many Member States of the Union have only paid lip service to energy efficiency, thrift and the ultimate aim of a 'low-carbon society', so what future is there for an economy, households and transport with zero carbon dioxide emissions?"
"It would be good if the guardian of Union legislation, the Commission, prepared summary analyses and evaluations from time to time regarding the quality of the national plans submitted, and the extent to which the Member States are implementing them."
"in writing. - First of all, I would like to welcome the initiative report of Mrs Hall."
"As a matter of fact, this report comes at a time where all initiatives aiming at reinforcing concrete actions for greater energy efficiency should be warmly welcomed."
"Energy efficiency is indeed the most effective objective providing already available technological tools for genuinely and rapidly addressing the challenges of global warming and limited fossil resources."
"We are now embarked plan to cut energy consumption and it is essential that we reach our goals on schedule."
"But of course such plan will require enormous costs and economical sacrifices."
"These costs and sacrifices will be especially very challenging for those countries with the lowest budgets and less developed economies."
"It is essential that the energy efficiency targets will not simply worsen the situation of the weakest economies and industries in the poorest Member States."
"Therefore, ad hoc transitional measures to support the most vulnerable sectors and countries while implementing the legislation are required to avoid market failures."
"Of course in the long run there is indeed huge cost-effective potential of energy conservation and stronger energy efficiency policy would very likely benefit the job market in the Union."
"in writing. - First of all I would like to congratulate Ms Hall on a truly comprehensive report, dedicated to improving energy efficiency and calling on the Member States that are far behind the implementation of existing legislation to take all the necessary measures."
"Secondly, I am glad to concede that the report has not only pointed out ways for industrial consumers to save energy, but for small consumers as well - especially by means of raising consumer awareness and providing reliable information of the most environment-friendly options."
"It must be noted that the consumption of households accounts for 40% of overall energy consumption."
"Therefore it is an individual responsibility for all of us to contribute to maximise energy efficiency."
"Thirdly, energy consumption is progressively increasing and so does the expenditure on energy."
"It is simple common sense to enforce measures for energy efficiency in order to gain the optimal use of means of production."
"in writing. - Mr President, I congratulate Ms Hall on this report, which contains a number of sold, sensible, achievable suggestions to encourage energy efficiency."
"Amidst the current fuss on generation and security of supply we risk losing sight of the fact that changes in building and equipment standards, as well as how we use energy, will in themselves allow a great deal of energy capacity."
"I am glad to support this report and hope that it will be the start of more measures in this direction."
"Reduction in unwanted by-catches and elimination of discards in European fisheries (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Carl Schlyter, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European fisheries (2007/2112(ΙΝΙ)) (Α6-0495/2007)."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Madam President, I am grateful to the shadow rapporteur for helping us to end with a good report."
"I also want to thank Commissioner Borg for at last - at last! - proposing powerful measures to deal with the discarding of fish and unwanted by-catches."
"Today we have a fisheries policy which is emptying the world's oceans, ravaging seabeds, destroying ecosystems and causing fish stocks to collapse."
"Even seabirds are killed by our current fisheries policy."
"If this destruction had taken place on land - if we had treated our forests in the same way as we are now treating the seas - we would have had rioting on the streets, but the destruction of the oceans is happening out of sight and in silence."
"Rachel Carson's book, Silent Spring, had a powerful impact in 1962 and was a wake-up call for many to become committed to caring for the environment and to nature conservation."
"We are now in the time of the Silent Sea."
"In fact, last year, the journalist Isabella Lövin published a book with that very title."
"Let us now put some life into the fight to rescue future generations of fish and fishermen."
"The Commission's proposals will in fact mean an end to quota systems and detailed regulation, which have in practice encouraged fishermen to empty the seas and throw back unprofitable fish dead, and under which the development of fishing equipment was aimed mainly at taking more and more from the seas."
"Faced with the threat of having to fill their vessels with unprofitable fish, fishermen in the EU are getting an incentive to fish more selectively."
"But a successful policy needs carrots as well as sticks."
"We can, for example, allow more fishing days for vessels with selective gear, or give them access to areas which are closed to vessels without selective fishing gear."
"It is important, for each type of fishery, to set annual reduction targets for by-catches and discards and to have a dialogue with interested parties in order to achieve best results."
"Positive examples are the Bay of Biscay, the Kattegat and the Skagerrak."
"In those areas French and Swedish fishermen have used sorting grids with great success in the Norway lobster (Nephrops) fishery."
"These have in practice completely eliminated by-catches."
"With a little more freedom and accountability for the fishing fleet, perhaps cooperation can grow between the research community and fishermen, and that can lead to positive development."
"This goes together with better data on what fish are caught."
"We need to look at systems using electronic logbooks and possible video surveillance to see whether we can devise a good solution for maintaining personal integrity."
"Another important aspect is what we are to do with fish landed in the form of by-catches when there is a ban on discards."
"It is important that it should be possible to use it in some way but at the same time that the level of compensation should be so low that it does not provide an incentive actively to seek by-catches."
"I hope and believe that the Commission will quickly finalise a proposal that can be implemented."
"It would then become an important element in the fight against overfishing and in achieving a sustainable fishery."
"But of course that is not enough - we also need general reductions in fishing effort where currently endangered species are concerned, but perhaps we shall be able to debate that another day."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur and all the members of the Committee on Fisheries for the excellent work."
"We all share the view that discarding is, to say the least, an unnecessary waste of good natural and economic resources that should be stopped."
"However, each fishery is different and requires tailor-made solutions."
"We have therefore chosen a results-based approach which implies that we set targets to reduce the amount of discards over a timeframe and then leave it up to the fishermen concerned to choose how to reach the targets - such measures could include an increase in mesh size, the use of selectivity devices, real-time closures, spatial changes of activity or any other possible measure or a combination thereof."
"Turning now specifically to the report. Concerning Community action plans on seabirds and sharks, I can inform you that the latter is under way and that, on the former, my services are gathering information and scientific advice with a view to completing the plan by the end of 2009."
"I particularly agree that the discard policy should not be seen as an isolated action but as part of the general approach to move towards the MSY objective."
"We are also in agreement concerning a case-by-case approach and the importance of participation and consultation of the sector at all levels."
"Here I note with interest your proposal to test new uses of monitoring of discard practices as was done in some third countries."
"In addition we must ensure that incentives reward a real reduction in discards."
"They therefore need to be assessed carefully so as not to lead to adverse effects."
"Indeed, Member States already have possibilities to favour cleaner fisheries through the allocation of quotas."
"Having said this, I am of the view that incentives should accompany the various phases of implementation, in order to boost a change in behaviour until the final objective is reached."
"Concerning policy implementation, I generally agree with your suggestions, with a different focus, however."
"We should set the goal of a discard ban in a fishery wherever this is possible from the outset and not as a last resort measure as you seem to suggest."
"I need to clarify here, however, that in certain instances the set target may be that of reducing discards to the absolute minimum possible."
"So where are we in the process?"
"On the basis of scientific advice expected soon, we will choose fisheries for specific legislation during the course of this year and at the same time plan a roadmap with a timeframe for the subsequent proposals covering - over time - all European fisheries."
"In parallel, as decided at the December Council, Member States will trial discard reductions in the whitefish fishery in the North Sea in order to reduce discards of whiting by 30%."
"For cod, the commitment with Norway is to reduce discards to less than 10%."
"Other activities include the proposal on technical measures in the Atlantic, the proposal on a revised cod recovery plan, the revision of the control regulation and several studies and impact assessments for the legislative proposals."
"Finally, I can agree on Amendments 1, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 10 to 12."
"Amendments 2 and 7 are related and I can agree to them with a slight change."
"On Amendment 9, some cautious thinking is needed since these techniques need further research."
"There are problems with high costs and reliability."
"Finally, I cannot support Amendment 4 as such."
"With respect to Amendments 13, 14 and 15, I need to reflect further, since the whole question concerning appropriate incentives for fishers to encourage them to adopt an effective discards policy needs to be further studied and assessed before a definitive position is adopted."
"Let me conclude by restating the urgent need for legislative action on this file, and I look forward to your continued cooperation in developing this policy."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Madam President, the discarding or dumping of fish in European waters destroys over a million tonnes of fish a year, particularly in multi-species fisheries."
"Globally, according to the FAO, millions of tonnes of unwanted fish by-catch are thrown back into the sea each year."
"This has a very negative effect on the economy of future fisheries and on the health of marine ecosystems."
"The practice is amoral, unethical and completely unsustainable and results directly from the Common Fisheries Policy, which criminalises fishermen for landing by-catch, thereby forcing them to discard - fishermen who are desperately trying to make a living while faced with ever-depleting levels of fish stocks."
"Our ultimate aim has to be the reduction of these unwanted by-catches and the virtual elimination of discards through a discard ban, with incentives in place to ensure that all unwanted by-catch must be landed."
"But how and when we get to this point of a ban should be a matter for all stakeholders involved, including the Commission, the regional advisory councils (RACs), the fishermen, the scientific experts, the national governments and NGOs, and fishery by fishery if necessary."
"The negative micro-management spiral has to be avoided and the common fisheries policy needs to be fundamentally altered, as the discard issue seriously discredits it."
"Solving the problem of discards is beneficial for all actors concerned, particularly the fishermen."
"It is possible to implement bans, as the examples of Norway and Iceland show us."
"I am pleased that the report emphasises that fishermen and other stakeholders need to take responsibility and ownership concerning any policy to eliminate discards."
"New ways to monitor fishing vessels could be used, such as electronic logbooks and the use of CCTV on the perimeter of fishing vessels, which has been piloted in Canada and New Zealand with some success. The only successful way to achieve implementation of any eventual discard ban will be through the involvement of the fishermen in monitoring and controlling and, above all, by peer pressure to ensure a level playing field."
"I thank the rapporteur for all his cooperation and this balanced report, which I commend to the House."
"on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President, discards are an appalling waste."
"Vast quantities of fish are thrown away every year in European fisheries around the world: as much as seven to eight million tonnes."
"The Commission's communication is welcome, despite the delayed action, and the Commission now intends to act quickly, with certain aspects to be included in a new technical measure regulation in 2008."
"In an ideal world we would move straight to a complete and instant ban on discards."
"But the reality is more complicated."
"Mr Schlyter's report recognises the complexity of dealing with the problem of discarding fish and I really welcome his inclusive approach."
"It highlights practical aspects including the cost of dealing with discards and what to do with landed discards, the costs of introducing more selective gear, the implications for the total allowable catches and quota regime if discarding is banned, and the need to give fishermen incentives to fish in a more sustainable way."
"It acknowledges that, since both the causes of discards and the measures needed to reduce them vary from fishery to fishery, no single solution will work throughout the Community."
"An amnesty on discards is not the solution as it may create a market in discards instead of encouraging fishermen to fish in a sustainable way."
"Given the levels of overfishing and concerns over fishing stocks including cod and bluefin tuna, we still need good management of existing stocks."
"The report also places the discards issue in the broader context of the problem of by-catches of seabirds and of sharks and it calls for a significant range of pilot discard projects with a geographical spread."
"I call on colleagues to support this report which makes an important contribution to dealing with the disgrace of discards."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the ALDE Group warmly welcomes the content of Mr Schlyter's report, which is to be commended for its sensitive, yet highly practical, approach."
"Members of the public find it almost impossible to understand just how it is that we can allow fish to be caught and then thrown back dead into the sea."
"Fishermen too have major concerns with the fact that this kind of action is, to some extent, forced upon them, for the current combination of rules and technical possibilities means that some fish are simply not wanted on board."
"Sometimes this is because they are of insufficient economic value."
"We must make an early and concerted effort to prevent the kind of discarding that results from attempts at high grading."
"I suspect that there is already less temptation to this practice in those fisheries where days at sea are limited."
"Sometimes, though, discarding is the outcome of conditions we ourselves impose, for example minimum landing sizes, and restrictions on quotas."
"Of course, if we are serious about conservation, we need total allowable catches."
"But, in my own view, we need to look seriously at the methods we employ to keep fishing within the limits that are set by those TACs, to determine amongst other things, just how far there is an interconnection between the establishment of quotas and the problem of discards, particularly where mixed fisheries are concerned."
"This, as well as the adoption of the measures suggested in the report, must of course be undertaken with the full engagement of stakeholders."
"Without that, we cannot hope for success."
"The industry is already leading the way."
"I am particularly proud of the Scots, for their voluntary system of real-time closures."
"We need proper incentives to positive actions of this kind for a great deal remains to be done."
"I trust that Parliament will give its full support to the report and that the Commission and Council will take matters forward in the manner it recommends."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, I should like to say that I approve of this report; to my mind, the rapporteur has worked out a practical, comprehensive approach to the problem of fisheries discards at sea."
"But things are not so easy, and everyone is thinking about the new methods to be applied."
"It is time to put an end to the volumes of talk about this matter and take action."
"There are plenty of practical suggestions in the report and they could be put into operation."
"The one thing that we definitely cannot do is to do nothing."
"We have to act for as long as fisheries discards pose a problem."
"I should also like to ask the Commission ensure that small fishermen do not incur any additional cost on account of measures to resolve the problem of these discards."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, the common fisheries policy (CFP) has been a miserable failure."
"It has failed to conserve stocks, it has failed to sustain our fishing-dependent communities and it has failed to win public support or credibility."
"One of the main reasons for that is the scandal of discarding."
"The CFP quota system itself is a direct cause of discarding."
"It does not measure the amount of fish caught; it only measures the amount of fish landed."
"That said, I broadly welcome this report by Mr Schlyter."
"In particular, I strongly agree with the principle of positive incentives giving some reward to those fishermen who take steps to reduce or eliminate discards."
"I also agree that measures must be tailored to different types of fishery."
"It has long been a major flaw of the CFP that it has been over-centralised and inflexible."
"I draw attention to paragraph 15, which welcomes the voluntary real-time closure scheme introduced by Scotland, an excellent example of the kind of initiative which should be encouraged and incentivised by the CFP at least for as long as we are stuck with it as a management measure."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, discards are just one aspect of the nightmare that is the CFP."
"The EU, through its ill thought-out policy, is destroying livelihoods in developing nations across the world."
"The export of fish is significantly more important to the developing world in trade terms than other commodities such as rice, coffee and tea."
"Mauritania, for example, is dependent on its fishing industry for half of its exports, which represent 15% of its GDP."
"But, having devastated Mauritanian waters, the Commission now wants to dump its deal."
"It does not think that these now sterile waters are worth EUR 86 million a year."
"This denunciation of a fisheries agreement is supposed to be a secret; well, it was until now."
"I think African people should know about the EU's shabby and dishonourable plans."
"It is colonialism at its most vicious, and I accuse these institutions of racism and exploitation of vulnerable societies."
"President Barroso's non-imperial empire is not as benign as he would have us believe, so, if you want to move forward, discard Giscard and dump the Lisbon Treaty as well as the CFP."
"Madam President, the scandal of discards is one of the EU's own making."
"Impossible quotas and restrictions are imposed in mixed fisheries, prohibited stocks are inevitably caught and in consequence they are dumped back - dead - into the sea."
"And all this while hunger prevails in many parts of the world."
"For years the EU has wrung its hands over this but, frankly, has done nothing to stop it."
"Such fish, I believe, should be landed; they should be sold at a fixed price, sufficiently low to discourage deliberate catching and sufficiently high to make their landing worthwhile."
"Also, it is sensible and right that we should reward the use of more selective fishing gear."
"But I do most positively reject any blanket discard ban as translating into yet another device of driving more of our fishermen out of business."
"We have ruminated on this issue for years."
"Now is the time, at last, to do something about it."
"(ES) Madam President, in general terms I support the rapporteur's report as an expression of the long-standing concern about the rigidity of the common fisheries policy when it comes to tackling problems which are entrenched in our fisheries management system, of which discards are simply another example."
"In particular I support the paragraphs advocating a fishery-by-fishery introduction of reductions in unwanted catches and discards, and their gradual elimination, and for any ban to be introduced only when it has been ascertained that there is no alternative, as the Council and all the regional consultative committees have said."
"We could not adopt another approach and we could not move to a full blanket ban on discards within a management system which encourages them, both through the rigid TAC system and quotas in force, and through the absence of adequate technical measures which constitute a fundamental factor in preventing by-catches, the review of which we have been waiting for years so that they can be adjusted for the Atlantic."
"What I cannot accept, Madam President, is Amendment 10, which would allow the creation of a parallel fishery market based on discarded fish, which would therefore be unlawful."
"I think we should remain firm in defending the principle of non-commercialisation of discards as set out in paragraph 32 of the report, as have countries with a longer history in this matter such as Norway."
"Incentives to prevent discards must be of a different kind: for example, incentives aimed at reducing them to a minimum through the use of more selective gear."
"It is much better for a juvenile fish to continue to live in the sea and grow up to feed people or other fish instead of being discarded and the subject of negotiations on fishmeal production."
"(EL) Madam President, I should firstly like to express my satisfaction with the draft report on fish discards and to stress that this is one of the most important problems in European and international fisheries."
"Allow me to make a couple of points about the report."
"I believe that, apart from the points suggested, a common policy for the final elimination of discards must be implemented."
"This policy should emerge from a study of the problem in all the fishing countries of the EU, and should incorporate all national studies and global research."
"In order to tackle the problem in a radical way, the EU must immediately finance a study on all fishing equipment, types of fishing and kinds of catch. The EU must also commission specialised research institutions to conduct it."
"This will enable the EU to impose the best and most efficient solutions centrally, through regulations, on Member States."
"If this does not occur, I fear that the problem will be considered and then shelved, while all the fishery stocks are devastated."
"(FR) Madam President, I should also like to say how much I approve of the approach suggested by our rapporteur to remedy the rightly criticised waste of resources in the current practice with discards."
"Whilst drawing up his report, Mr Schlyter has been conscious of the effects that the immediate implementation of a total ban on discards might have, first of all, on the fragile financial equilibrium of those working in the sector and, secondly, on monitoring of its implementation by the Member States and the Commission, obliging them to tighten up methods of supervision that do not conform to the budgetary rigour required of them."
"For that reason, he thought it more appropriate to propose the gradual introduction of a series of measures to encourage the fishermen themselves to alter their fishing methods and equipment, an approach strongly approved of by the Commission."
"(inaudible) ... from the outset, I think that is highly ambitious."
"Can I also congratulate Mr Schlyter and Mrs Doyle for the great amount of work they have both done on this report?"
"I am delighted to support Mrs Doyle's land-all policy, whereby fishermen will be compelled to land everything they catch."
"It has many benefits."
"Scientists will get a much clearer picture of what fish are being caught and where, which will enable more accurate conservation and recovery plans to be devised."
"Also, when young, undersized fish are landed, fisheries inspectors could immediately call for a temporary closure of specific fishing grounds to avoid further pressure on immature stocks."
"Under this policy, undersized fish and other species which previously would have been discarded could be sold to the processing sector, which is desperate for raw material to supply the fishmeal and fish oil industry."
"They would be paid - through a regional compensation fund - a token amount, say about EUR 50 a tonne, which would not be enough to encourage targeting these fish and creating the black market that Ms Fraga Estévez fears, but would be too much to throw them, dead, back into the water."
"The whole operation could be policed by attaching weatherproof CCTV cameras to every vessel."
"In an industry already constrained by limitations of the number of days that can be spent at sea, time spent catching and sorting fish of no commercial value is regarded by fishermen as valuable time lost."
"So I think fishermen will support this proposal."
"(ES) Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Schlyter for his work and I am particularly glad that several of the amendments I put forward have been incorporated into the text of the report we are debating today."
"I refer in particular to the amendments stating that discards are not only to do with the use of a particular gear type, but are also influenced by the nature of the fishery concerned, as in the case of European fisheries, almost all of which are multispecies in nature, where the risk of discards is higher."
"Therefore, any measure which is adopted must be case-specific."
"Also thanks to my amendments we can see from the report that discarding is caused by a range of factors, including excessive fishing effort, and the current TACs approach requiring fish for which there is no quota to be discarded. Measures must therefore be taken to prevent species of legal size which are inevitably caught from being compulsorily discarded owing to the lack of a quota for them."
"Having said this, I would like to warn Mr Schlyter to tread carefully, because after the criticism he made in his speech of fishermen and the selfless, age-old tradition of fishing, I am not sure what we are doing here or if Mr Schlyter is going to put the Commissioner, the members of the Fisheries Committee and fishermen out of a job. (That's a joke, Madam President)."
"Madam President, I thank Mr Schlyter very much for his report."
"I think it is excellent."
"Can I also thank the Commissioner for his points at the beginning, where he is moving towards a discard ban, because he is very well aware that I have seen him many times, as many other Members of this House have, about bringing in a discard ban, and I think it is high time we did it."
"I also think that, at the end of the day, if we can protect fisheries' stocks, then actually it is better for fishermen in the long run, because we do have to have sustainable fisheries."
"Of course the scientific advice that we are using can very often be flawed."
"Therefore, the landing of all catch and by-catch so that it can be thoroughly investigated will actually give us a much better idea of what is in the sea."
"I also think that some of the practices, such as pair trawling and others, which do have an awful lot of by-catch, again, will emphasise what is happening."
"Of course, a lot of trouble catching dolphins, sharks and porpoises and many other things will be highlighted in the by-catch that is landed."
"So, if we can bring in the right amount of carrots to encourage it to be landed and not too much to encourage by-catch, then I think this is the way forward."
"So I welcome the Commissioner's support for this report, I welcome the report itself, and we should all support it."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all I would like to thank Members for their interesting comments, which demonstrate once again that we share the common objective of eliminating this appalling practice."
"As I stated before, our proposal will be gradual but effective."
"Realistically speaking, we simply cannot bring about a discard ban overnight."
"However, as one speaker said, doing nothing is not an option."
"And, undoubtedly, during the course of this year we will be coming up, hopefully, with three legislative proposals on reducing discards for specific fisheries, apart from incentivising and encouraging Member States to come up with pilot projects, by virtue of which we could achieve the introduction of a reduction in discards or even, possibly, discard bans."
"The example of Scotland, which was adopted by the Council in December, was a very laudable one."
"Concerning the point that was made on positive incentives, I agree that these are important, but we need to find the right mix and the right levels, because otherwise they could be counterproductive, and we could end up with a situation whereby we encourage more catches when, for sustainability reasons, we would want to reduce them in order to reach MSY levels."
"I would also like to point out that I could not agree more that our proposals must be tailor-made to the specific fisheries and must contain in-built incentives, as I said, and support for the changes in behaviour that fishermen will have to adopt."
"Indeed, already, in our TAC and Quota Regulation, we adopted incentives for fishermen to adopt more selective methods, thus avoiding discards."
"In the very first intervention and in others that followed, the point was made that discards are caused by the common fisheries policy."
"I would like to state that this is not really correct, because the causes of discards can arise form the high grading of fish by fishermen for the purpose of getting better quality fish, which is done independently of quotas, and the catching of juveniles, which is also independent of quotas."
"It is only where there is exceeding of catch quotas, and again this depends, because if it is a clean fishery and the quota is exceeded, then the quota is set for purposes of sustainability."
"It is, in reality, where you have a mixed catch, and you have one of the types of catch which has a low quota for sustainability reasons, and the other catches targeted, that you have discarding of fish as a result of the TAC and Quota Regulations."
"These are the aspects which we would like to address in order to introduce more selective gear, so that the catches can become even cleaner - which is one of the methods whereby discarding could be effectively reduced."
"I would also like to point out that, according to FAO estimates, discards within Community waters are around one million tonnes. Worldwide they are around eight million tonnes."
"These are very conservative estimates. When one takes into consideration that the system that we operate is producing less than one tenth of all discards - taking into account the TACs and quotas - I think that there are various other factors which contribute to discarding apart from the system operated by the common fisheries policy."
"Having said that, we are actively seeking ways and means whereby we improve the management so that the TACs and quotas operate in a way whereby discards are reduced to an absolute minimum or are completely banned."
"Finally, on the point raised concerning Mauritania, I would like to say that we have just signed a new memorandum of understanding with Mauritania, and this will lead to a new protocol which will guarantee for Mauritania the same amount that they have under the existing protocol but which will reflect the actual fishing possibilities in a more realistic way."
"So we will be paying Mauritania to help it strengthen its fisheries infrastructure and its economy in general under the development funds, so that, in that way, Mauritania is guaranteed the full amount."
"But at least what we pay for fish would reflect the actual amount of fish that it is possible to catch in Mauritanian waters."
"rapporteur. - (SV) Thank you, Madam President."
"Yes, Commissioner, clearly there are many reasons why fish are thrown overboard, but I still think that this has been exacerbated by aspects of our fisheries policy."
"There is one thing I want to ask you: I do not really understand why you are against Amendment 4 when it points in the same direction you yourself want to go in."
"The report currently states that a discard ban should only be adopted after other measures have been tried."
"The amendment means that the implementation of a ban on discards would only take place after other negative incentives had been applied."
"Thus we start from the same premise if Amendment 4 is approved, namely that we have a policy on the banning of discards but that its implementation is dependent on the conditions in each individual fishery."
"I do not really understand why you said you were opposed to Amendment 4, but perhaps we can talk about that again later."
"What makes me optimistic is that in spite of everything we have a kind of consensus."
"I have spoken with both research workers and fishermen."
"There is a good consensus here on what needs to be done."
"The Commission and Parliament are on the same lines and the fishermen and environmental organisations are also on board."
"It gives me a certain optimism."
"Perhaps all the interested parties will cooperate and we shall indeed get a result."
"A split vote has been requested on Amendment 10."
"It will therefore be possible to take account of what Mrs Fraga Estévez said if we can vote for the first part and against the second part."
"I thank you and I thank all of you who have taken part in the debate and in the work."
"It has been a pleasure to work on this report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday 31 January 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Ladies and gentlemen, the amount of fish discarded, which the rapporteur estimates as possibly a quarter of the total catch, is a serious environmental and economic problem to which we cannot remain indifferent."
"The scale of the phenomenon points to an enormous waste of resources and serious damage to biodiversity caused by irresponsible human interference."
"Tinkering with the rules will not achieve the desired result."
"The situation requires much more wide-ranging action - a complete change of approach and thinking on the matter."
"We must clearly define our aims, adopt correspondingly coherent CFP instruments, and ensure the necessary funding."
"We must avoid a situation like the present, where the side effects of certain legal instruments are simply ignored."
"The imposition of total permissible catches or minimum sizes of fish that can be landed (especially in the case of mixed catches), is a case in point, since it leads to discards."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur's view that our approach to limiting discards should largely consist of incentives to fishermen to look for new, innovative solutions in fishing methods and gear."
"Greater use should be made of their experience and the knowledge of the scientific community."
"I would emphasise that an effective information campaign will be crucial to the success of this strategy."
"Without understanding on the part of the fishing industry of the fundamental importance of eliminating excessive discards, and without the general support of fishermen, the strategy is doomed to failure."
"European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation by Gerardo Galeote, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development (Ο-0076/2007/rev.1 - Β6-0008/2008)."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, an essential aspect of the revision of the rules on the Structural Funds, which the Committee on Regional Development has carried out successfully, was to make the promotion of territorial cooperation the priority objective of our cohesion policy, whose funding, I note, was increased by the European Parliament as part of the negotiations on the financial perspective."
"Because of this the calling of this debate cannot come as a surprise to anyone: it was unanimously called for by the political Groups, and I am opening it on behalf of the Regional Development Committee."
"I thank the Commissioner for attending and regret that the Council has been unable to join us in a debate which affects it directly."
"Drawing on the experience we gained during the years of the INTERREG Programmes we can conclude that the absence of an initiative-taking structure with its own legal personality has hindered its effectiveness, and we welcome the Commission proposal to establish European groupings of territorial cooperation as instruments with their own legal personality."
"In a united Europe of States and citizens, regions, as the Treaty of Lisbon says, have their highest form of expression in these bodies."
"Admittedly, even when under examination by the Council a number of Member States expressed reservations about the usefulness of European groupings of territorial cooperation."
"It is up for debate whether the nature and content of the regulation as adopted are too vague, and whether it introduced a degree of legal uncertainty by making its application subject to domestic law in too many instances."
"It might be said that the way that some Member States deal with a complex situation depends on their degree of decentralisation, which requires them to identify strategies in the field of territorial cooperation."
"However, it should be noted that Regulation 1082/2006 was adopted in July 2006, one year after it was adopted unanimously by the European Parliament on a proposal from our colleague Jan Olbrycht, and has been binding in all Member States since 1 August 2007."
"The Member States therefore had six months to make the necessary legislative arrangements."
"According to the information available, however, and the Commissioner will correct me if I am wrong, not even ten Member States have taken the necessary measures to ensure that the regulation has full effect now."
"It is common knowledge that it is the European Commission's duty and responsibility to ensure effective implementation of European law and to intervene to remove barriers which may hinder its implementation."
"Explanations, suggested informally, that the principle of subsidiarity prevents measures being taken against defaulting States will not be accepted: if they were, the Member States could delay or refuse to implement any Community legislation which they viewed as inappropriate or subject to challenge."
"Therefore, Mrs Hübner, through our question to the European Commission we demand that Parliament should be clearly informed of the problems encountered by the Member States in the implementation of this regulation."
"Which Member States are not introducing the measures necessary for this regulation to be implemented appropriately, and what measures has the European Commission taken or is it considering taking, specifically initiation of infringement proceedings before the European Court of Justice to ensure that all Member States comply with the regulation and to prevent the funds allocated being jeopardised by some States' inability to comply with the established rules?"
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to start by saying that the deadline of one year for the adoption of national rules was, in fact, very ambitious."
"If we look into other regulations establishing legal bodies, it can be seen that the deadlines foreseen are usually between three and four years."
"So this is something which we also have to take into account."
"In order to accelerate the whole procedure, the Directorate General for Regional Policy has prepared a questionnaire covering the elements of the regulations which have to be taken into account in the national rules."
"This questionnaire was sent in March 2007 to all Member States via the networks of the members of the Committee for the Coordination of the Funds (COCOF)."
"The questionnaire was also subject to discussions with Member States during the COCOF meetings twice last year: once in April and then in the middle of July."
"So where are we today with the adoption?"
"We have six Member States that have adopted appropriate national rules: Hungary, the UK, Bulgaria, Portugal, Romania and Spain."
"In another four Member States, the finalisation of the process of adoption of national rules should take place very soon: France, Luxembourg, Germany and Belgium."
"Of the remaining 17 Member States, 15 have already launched either the parliamentary or the government adoption procedure."
"We have, however, two Member States - Denmark and Estonia - where we do not have any information on the process."
"They are expected to respect the deadline of mid-February as fixed in the Director General's letter, which was sent to all the Member States, in which we request information on the communication on the adoption of the procedures of the rules by the deadline of 14 February."
"In the same letter, in which we gave this deadline of mid-February to those Member States that still have to inform us whether they have adopted or what the calendar of the adoption is, we also inform the Member States of the preparation process for the interinstitutional EGGC seminar, which, together with Parliament and the Committee of the Regions, will be held on 19 June in Brussels under the Slovene Presidency."
"We have also encouraged them to participate in the EGGC expert group which was set up by the Committee of the Regions."
"On the possible infringement procedure, let me say firstly that this is a very specific regulation: it is not a directive."
"This is a regulation of direct applicability in all 27 Member States, which requires some additional action from the Member States and not merely the adoption of the implementing rules."
"After 14 February, when we have received the responses of individual Member States - especially those whose agenda for adopting the necessary regulations we do not yet know - on which any decision of the Commission to start infringement procedures will depend, we will consider our position again and see where the infringement procedure will start. In any case, we will, of course, also be carefully monitoring the application of the regulations when they are in place."
"But let me say - and I think this is a very important part of this whole process - that, in the mean time, the first EGGC was established last Monday between France and Belgium, although the national rules have not yet been adopted, because this regulation is directly applicable and regional and local authorities have the right to set up the groupings."
"National rules need to identify the ex ante check procedure, including the designation of a competent authority that would receive the request of the regional or local authority to participate in an EGGC."
"We have today around 30 examples of programmes of projects across Europe where the option for EGGC is already envisaged."
"There are also regions that have already signed the letter of intention."
"A great deal of preparatory work is going on, so we expect that the process will gather momentum once the finalisation of the national implementing rules is completed."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Commissioner, I had the honour to be the rapporteur on the regulation that established the European grouping of territorial cooperation as part of the European legal system."
"I witnessed and took part in many discussions concerning the new possibilities opened up by territorial cooperation on the basis of the new legal instrument."
"The arguments stressing the new possibilities were accompanied by fears of an organisational and political nature, especially on the part of representatives of the Member States."
"Finally, a regulation was drawn up that satisfied both supporters and sceptics."
"Realising that the introduction of this new type of legal entity into national systems would give rise to complications, the Member States agreed on a deadline by which work on the corresponding national legislation had to be completed."
"That deadline was not met, and so far only a few states have finished the task, among them Bulgaria and Romania, who were obliged to accept the regulation as part of the acquis communautaire."
"Under the terms of the regulation itself, the Committee of the Regions is monitoring the implementation and functioning of European groupings of territorial cooperation and is already in possession of interesting information on preparations for the creation of the new bodies."
"On the basis of the information available, I can say that there is a need for the European institutions to play a particularly active role - not only the Commission but the Council above all - in persuading governments to take the action which they are obliged to carry out and on which they have previously agreed."
"It would not be beneficial if implementation were to be based on judgments resulting from complaints to the European Court of Justice."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, from the outset the INTERREG initiative was the germ of a truly polycentric idea of the European space through cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation."
"The establishment of this new legal instrument, the EGTC, was born of difficulties which this type of action encountered as a result of the different systems and different procedures in place"
"The solution reached by the European Parliament after almost two years of legislative work permitted and permits public authorities and public bodies to register as bodies with legal personality recognised Union-wide."
"The Member States were, as has been noted, required to take a number of measures by 1 August 2007."
"Given the very obvious delay, in July last year the Committee of the Regions held a seminar to study the situation, to which I was invited as rapporteur; at the seminar, as a sign of the European Parliament's willingness to cooperate in the search for a solution, I tabled a question which Mrs Krehl signed with me and which sowed the seed for the debate we are having today."
"Commissioner, I can say today with pride that my country, Spain, and my region, Galicia, together with the northern region of Portugal, are pioneers in this and a blueprint which other European regions can follow."
"For that reason I would like to ask you how the European Parliament can work with the Commission to encourage countries which have not yet done so to adjust their national legal systems and sign up to and form territorial groupings of this kind?"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SL) During the debate about this regulation we were aware that the key point was the issue of the choice of legislation to be used for the acts adopted within the framework of territorial cooperation."
"The aim of the regulation was to enable the cooperating partners to use legislation which would have same effects in both countries, because until then the method of simultaneous application of two legal systems had not been effective."
"In this respect, the regulation is clearer than any other earlier document of a similar nature. It means that the law of the place where the seat of authority for cross-border cooperation is registered will be applicable, if such an authority has been established."
"We were aware that this regulation was not intended to be a new legal instrument, but a tool to be used in conjunction with other structures already in existence."
"Now it is clear that this regulation is not going to have the same effects throughout the whole of the European Union and that, due to different conditions to be imposed by the States, it is very probable that various kinds of groupings of territorial cooperation will come into existence."
"In order for the regulation to be applied effectively, it is necessary to adapt the national legislation in an appropriate manner in accordance with the provisions of Article 16."
"Only if that happens can we really expect to see the effects of uniform practice in the longer term."
"The Member States are therefore called upon to adopt legislation which will launch the development of territorial cooperation and improve the legal security of its framework."
"In short, because of its incompleteness, the regulation will probably become some kind of legal laboratory for comparing practices and conditions as and when they are established by the States."
"It would therefore be reasonable systematically to monitor instances where the regulation is applied and thereby simultaneously to develop a public database of European groupings of territorial cooperation."
"(NL) Mr President, what are we actually doing this evening?"
"We are trying to take stock of the situation following a very clear decision taken by the European Parliament and between the three institutions in which we announced that there were now new instruments for improving cross-border territorial cooperation."
"The national borders still represent scars from the past which sometimes run straight through communities and new development areas."
"We need cooperation between universities, hospitals and so on in Europe."
"We need new instruments, and if we analyse the legislation that has been introduced, the Member States have been given a great deal of latitude here."
"This is why it is so disappointing - given the need to speed up cross-border cooperation - that so few Member States, which insisted on having all this freedom, are now actually using it."
"Parliament is therefore quite rightly calling on the Commission and above all the Council, which is not here this evening, to take their responsibility and follow this up very quickly."
"I am pleased that there are good examples from elsewhere - the Committee of the Regions was mentioned a moment ago - of how the process of integration can be speeded up without calling the national governments' legal systems into question."
"I am firmly convinced that we need to take this approach further."
"People have got cold feet: it all seems to be too difficult."
"Just this evening we discussed the subject of energy efficiency in the built environment."
"It took five years for the Member States to implement this."
"In my view what we need here is a Community initiative to ensure that the seven Member States that have already implemented this regulation grow to 25 or 27 within a year, say."
"This has to be possible."
"This is why I want an answer from the Council, but the Council is not here this evening, which I very much regret."
"(HU) Thank you very much, Mr President."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, because of Hungary's special situation, it is particularly important for us to promote the practical application of cross-border cooperation."
"It is for precisely this reason that Hungary was one of the first to formulate and introduce a national regulation corresponding to the Community Regulation creating the EGTC."
"However, the application of the new instrument in practice is encountering difficulties, so we would like to set up a working group to prepare a handbook, in cooperation with our partners in the programme."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner whether she would support an EGTC working group within the framework of INTERACT technical assistance and, if so, how this can be done."
"Moreover, not only internal cross-border programmes, but also external IPA and ENPI programmes, are important for EGTC cooperation."
"Our internal cross-border programmes have already been approved by the European Commission, and the programmes supported by the IPA will probably be approved in February."
"However, we need to wait for the indices, to be prepared by the Commission, in order to finish planning the cross-border programme between Hungary, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine, funded by ENPA."
"I would also like to ask when we can expect the publication of the Commission's indices relating to the neighbourhood programmes. Thank you very much."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, let me say how pleased I am to speak on this subject this evening, because when we considered this addition, tabled by Mr Olbrycht, I expressed my confidence in the report."
"In fact this subject was discussed in the French Parliament yesterday and - this is worth emphasising, because it does not happen very often - all the political groups were in favour of the creation of this EGTC, and there were many examples showing how, in the north and south of France, in the Alps, in Lorraine, there was reason to put the EGTC into operation very soon."
"As the Commissioner said, this was based in particular on the example of Lille, which last Monday signed an EGTC that will cover two million inhabitants in Belgium and France."
"Why did that raise such high hopes?"
"It was because for three or four years our colleagues looked for legal possibilities without success."
"With the EGTC, they found a solution."
"We are now expecting that the 70 000 French people who work in Luxembourg every day, the 30 000 French people who work in Monaco and Italy, as well as in Spain and so on, will really be able to foster new forms of cooperation with the EGTC."
"My colleagues and I would like to see the Commissioner urge on the States that are lagging behind."
"Apart from the fact that they are subject to the requirements of the regulation, they can be told that some countries are already operating the system perfectly happily."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the purpose of the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is to implement and administer cross-border, supranational and interregional cooperation measures."
"It is no exaggeration to say that this new network is intended to improve the quality of people's everyday lives, to make our businesses more competitive, to extend the scope of our research and education centres and, last but not least, to preserve our environment."
"There is no compelling need for the EU to provide financial support for EGTC measures."
"This instrument will enable regional and local authorities to form cross-border alliances with their own legal personality - a significant innovation in terms of the scope for territorial cooperation."
"The EGTC offers a unique opportunity to generate synergetic effects that transcend the institutional framework and to guarantee better, coordinated investments and uniform and efficient use of resources."
"On 5 July 2006, as we know, this instrument was created by virtue of a European Parliament and Council Regulation."
"By 1 August 2007, all Member States were to have enacted supplementary legal and/or administrative provisions."
"The fact that only five or six Member States have adopted national rules gives us cause for serious concern."
"The losers will be the potential committed participants who want to foster cross-border cooperation with their good ideas and innovative projects."
"To that extent, the questionnaire was warranted, and we also urgently await information on this matter from the Council."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, territorial cooperation is the third target of the cohesion policy for the new programming period."
"According to this target, cooperation is vital in the promotion of balanced, harmonious development within European regions."
"The European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is a new means of endowing teams for cooperation between regional and local authorities from different EU Member States with legal personality."
"The decision to create this means was not taken lightly; it was the response to technical and legal problems faced in cooperation programmes."
"Now, unfortunately, six months after the deadline, local and regional bodies have not managed to set up a territorial cooperation grouping because Member States have unjustifiably neglected to take or have delayed taking appropriate measures to implement the regulation."
"We must now send a crystal-clear message to Member States on the importance placed by the institutions on the correct implementation of the regulation in the new programming period, as well as on cooperation as a way of achieving economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"(SK) Fifty years have passed since the first Euroregion emerged along the German-Dutch border."
"Since then many other regions have initiated mutual cooperation."
"They help each other to solve similar or identical problems that often occur in border regions."
"They create new job opportunities and share their culture."
"The Regulation establishing a European grouping of territorial cooperation that was approved in July 2006 seems to be a very good tool for regional cooperation and a step in the right direction."
"It offers the regions flexibility in cooperation and has a positive influence on the population of the Member States, the economy and the business environment."
"More is the pity, then, that the Member States have not transposed this useful Regulation into their legislation in spite of the fact that this should have happened by 1 August 2007."
"Many regions are very interested in the European grouping of territorial cooperation because it gives them the opportunity to cooperate with other regions and at the same time offers them a significant level of autonomy in their relationship with governments and central administrations."
"It has also a positive effect on the lives of the population in individual regions: one of the aims of regional cooperation is to facilitate more efficient development of human resources and so reach a balance in the development of supply and demand in regional labour markets."
"We must not forget either that the EGTC will benefit the business world as well, namely by supporting development of the economy with the aim of improving its productivity and structure, creating new job opportunities and stabilising those that are at risk."
"Individual groupings of territorial cooperation will be able actively to promote a rise in employment and social inclusion."
"The Regulation simplifies and supports regional cooperation in the Member States of the Union and so facilitates economic and social cohesion."
"This is a good thing and for that reason I urge the Council and the Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure implementation of this Regulation in the individual Member States."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Grouping of Territorial Cooperation is a new tool to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the Union."
"It is an instrument for advanced, structured cooperation with its own legal personality which will have access to Community funding and resources from other sources."
"The culmination in Braga ten days ago of the 23rd Luso-Spanish Summit was a decisive milestone."
"Both countries are among the six which have already adopted the provisions necessary to implement the European Regulation of July 2006 effectively."
"Galicia Council and the authorities in the northern region of Portugal, which had finished drawing up the draft agreement and statutes in November 2006, will soon form a grouping which will cover 6 400 000 inhabitants and will have its seat in Vigo."
"They will take the lead in establishing a Euro-region with government bodies which will promote ambitious European cooperation serving as an example of re-generation."
"Their efforts deserve recognition by the European Parliament."
"(NL) Mr President, the EGTC, as has already been said several times, is an extremely useful instrument particularly for border regions."
"I am very pleased, Commissioner, that you referred to the Eurodistrict project on the border between France and Belgium."
"Mr Beaupuy also mentioned this."
"The towns of Kortrijk, Doornik and Lille have signed a cooperation agreement just this week in order to work together in practical ways on projects that also involve the public."
"Then there is transfrontier work, public transport, cooperation between hospitals and fighting crime - these are the sorts of things that people expect us to deal with on a practical level."
"Various initiatives have also been taken in another border region - between Belgium and the Netherlands - to promote practical cooperation between universities using an EGTC."
"The areas in question are Belgian Limburg, Dutch Limburg and the region of Aachen."
"The idea is eventually to create one cross-border combined university with the help of the EGTC, using it to overcome or circumvent many of the existing administrative obstacles."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the EGTC cannot solve every problem, of course, and I realise - as we have heard - that a lot of Member States have yet to start using it."
"However, we should now look a little further ahead on the basis of preliminary experiences with this instrument, and think about what improvements we can make on the basis of this first evaluation."
"There are some existing problems that we will have to overcome, such as the different social regulations that workers are faced with when they are working under an EGTC."
"Commissioner, all I can say is that it is absolutely crucial for the Commission to keep pushing the governments that have so far failed to make this instrument operational."
"(SK) Commissioner, the number of projects in border regions, both successfully completed projects and new projects currently being developed under the auspices of Euroregional groupings, proves that there are many development activities with a great deal of potential and that these activities could not be implemented without European assistance."
"However, there must be clear rules, otherwise the money will not get spent."
"I trust that this debate will encourage interested border parties to participate in the EGTC."
"Any parties that have not fulfilled their obligations must be identified in the Member States."
"The Commission must step up its efforts to ensure that cross-border cooperation is not damaged."
"The Euroregions are cross-border structures that have long been in existence and completed tasks under Interreg in the previous programming period, notably in the case of small 'people-to-people' projects."
"I do not believe that the Euroregions have failed."
"I am convinced that with the active support of the Commission, the Member States, the regional and local governments, the chambers of commerce and industry, and all the people living in border regions, the Euroregions will use their experience to make use of this new EGTC tool."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I thank Members very much for their comments and also for all their support for this tool, and for their commitment."
"Let me just remind everyone that no Member State has refused to implement this tool and this is, I think, very important."
"It is absolutely clear that all of them have to implement."
"We have, as I was trying to say in my introductory remarks, tried to move towards completion and accelerate the whole process through very different instruments."
"Certainly, today we can still give encouragement directly through your active presence in your Member States and regions, which we have doing for the last year."
"During all my visits, all my meetings, all the conferences - not only on territorial cooperation but also on the core of the policy - we have been encouraging, we have been talking and giving instructions."
"We have worked a lot with regions to help them prepare for implementing this new tool for cooperation."
"But I think today we are in the process."
"I think the awareness among the Member States has greatly increased."
"I hope that, with the recent impetus from the Director General's actions, we will have most of the national adjustments for the implementing regulations in place by June."
"We have to remember, however, that any programme can transfer its management to the EGGC at any time of its existence, so no potential damage to the policy arises from the fact that the Member States have not yet implemented the requisite adjustments."
"Also, any project can use this tool for the implementation of the project and, as we know, we can have new projects until the end of 2013."
"So there is no threat here either."
"This is not a consolation, but I would like you also to see that the fact that we have not yet completed all the implementing procedures does not cause damage in this sense."
"What we see today is the great interest of other directorates general in the Commission that are eager to use this instrument within the seventh Framework Programme, but also within the CIT programme and in other policies as well."
"It is important in your meetings at regional and local level to remind the regions that, even if there are not yet implementing rules in place, the recent example of France and Belgium clearly shows that the EGTC can be established and a Member State can implement and designate an ad hoc authority to play the role of the authority to which the regional and local bodies would direct themselves for information about the establishment of the EGTC."
"Concerning the handbook on EGTC, INTERACT is working on the handbook."
"In March there will be a conference in Brussels, and everybody interested will be invited to this seminar on the preparation of the handbook."
"Concerning the Madrid Convention, we should remember that it has taken 20 years so far to ratify this convention and, if I remember correctly, not all of our Member States have ratified the Convention yet."
"This regulation was renegotiated less than two years ago, and we are now in the first year of its implementation."
"That, I think, would be the reaction to what you have been saying."
"I would like to assure you that we are strongly committed, because we see the value added and we work with the regions."
"This is why so many of them are also so well prepared."
"We see all the value added of this instrument that you have mentioned."
"However, of course we have to remember that it does not guarantee the money."
"It is not a project, it is a tool that we want to use for the cooperation."
"But, of course, the EGGC can receive Community funding according to the normal rules, under the European cohesion policy."
"This is also important to bear in mind."
"Again, thank you for your interest."
"We are absolutely committed to completing this process as quickly as possible."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (GA) I wish to suggest that the Committee on Regional Development take initiatives and exert pressure for action enabling ability to be pooled in a European grouping of territorial cooperation with a view to bringing policies to light."
"The new EGTCs will serve to enforce legislation in Member States, generate new dynamics in cross-border cooperation, and enable a higher degree of confidence and cooperation to be maintained beyond the limits of borders."
"In my divided country a key role could be played by initiatives of this kind and other EU support schemes aimed at mitigating the adverse impact of partition on Ireland."
"I fully support the sound thinking behind cross-border cooperation, as this is a European ideal."
"There is a great need for Ireland to explore every avenue for cross-border cooperation because our border areas are in poor counties and the level of development is low."
"We have spent a long time dawdling and making excuses."
"Member States have a duty to help border areas to implement the ECTC legislation as quickly as possible"
"in writing. - (PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the problem of the implementation of Community legislation by Member States is not a new one."
"I daresay it affects the majority of Community policies."
"Working out a common position of 27 countries at European level is in fact only the beginning of a laborious process of harmonisation and implementation of the principles adopted."
"It is high time the Member States took responsibility for this process themselves."
"The effectiveness of our joint endeavours at European level depends to a large extent on commitment and the implementation of recommendations by the national administrations of the Member States."
"What is needed is cooperation between the different levels of our public administration. I can safely say that, as Members of the European Parliament elected directly by the peoples of the individual Member States, we are ready for and open to every form of cooperation with our national and regional administrations that can improve and speed up the implementation of Community legislation."
"We cannot allow matters like the strengthening of economic and social cohesion, which is one of the basic principles of the Treaties, to be marginalised - as is happening with the problem submitted to us today."
"A proper EU regulation on territorial cooperation groupings has existed since July 2006, but to this day it is impossible to take advantage of it owing to the absence of corresponding legislation by Member States."
"Agenda for the next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m.)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"(The sitting was opened at 9 a.m.)"
"(IT) I have received a request from Mr Hannan for an item on the interpretation of Rule 19 of our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, yesterday the President announced an interpretation of Rule 19 which puts this House in plain violation of its own regulations."
"We have now departed from the rule of law and given arbitrary power to the Chair to tear up our rule book and proceed as he sees fit."
"This is plainly illegal under our own rules."
"This Chamber may be sovereign but it must, nonetheless, follow its own rules."
"This interpretation by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is going to be contested today."
"It may come before this House in a vote."
"If we vote in favour, collectively, we are voting to abandon the rules under which we proceed."
"I would almost be tempted to compare it to the Ermächtigungsgesetz of 1933, but I think that would be disproportionate and perhaps a little rude to our President, who is a committed democrat and a decent man."
"Let me instead quote the grandfather of British resistance to totalitarianism, Edmund Burke."
"'They must be worse than blind who do not see with what undeviating regularity of system, in this case and in all cases, they pursue their scheme for the utter destruction of every independent power. ..."
"Their will is the law, not only at home, but as to the concerns of every nation. ..."
"They have swept away the very constitutions under which the Legislatures acted -'"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(IT) Thank you."
"I have taken note of your comments, but on this point on interpretation of the Rules of Procedure, as you know, there is already a vote planned for 11 a.m., so we will proceed in this direction."
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Communication of Council common positions: see Minutes"
"Freedom, security and justice (annual debate) (Articles 2 and 39 TEU) (debate)"
"(IT) The next item is the debate on"
"the oral question by Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Council on the 2007 annual debate on the progress made in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty) - B6-0006/2008), and"
"the oral question by Jean-Marie Cavada, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, to the Commission on the 2007 annual debate on the progress made in the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (Articles 2 and 39 of the EU Treaty) - B6-0007/2008)."
"deputising for the author. - (FR) Mr President, President of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are having today is taking place, as you know, in a context characterised by two essential elements."
"The first of these - I don't have to remind you - is the calendar."
"Being generous, we have at best 16 operational months before the end of the European Parliament's current term."
"So you see how, with such a tight timescale, we need to agree on the matters we hope to finalise together in the time that remains."
"We cannot do everything; we will need to choose and stick to our decision."
"The second element, Mr President, is even more significant from our point of view. This is that the prospect of the entry into force of the new treaty, you know as well as we do, will lead to major structural changes in our area of competence."
"I would particularly mention the removal of the artificial separation of policies in the first pillar from those in the third pillar, which will have the effect, in particular, of introducing codecision and subjecting measures that until now were mainly the sole preserve of the Council and fell outside the competence of the European Court of Justice to real judicial control."
"You will therefore understand our impatience to see the new treaty enter into force as quickly as possible, since it represents both a strengthening of democratic control and a strengthening of the rights of citizens."
"And you will also understand in the light of these two criteria, which are - I repeat - the strengthening of democratic control and the strengthening of citizens' rights, the reticence we feel in principle about dealing under the current treaty set-up with sensitive matters that could soon be dealt with under the provisions of the new treaty."
"This reticence in principle is very real. It runs deep, and it is widely shared by the different political groups represented both in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and in the more general setting of our assembly."
"However deep it runs, this reticence is also, at least at present, quite measured."
"We are not motivated, Mr President, President of the Council, Commissioner, by the perverse intention of delaying taking action on important matters that have reached maturity and the urgency of which is not in doubt."
"On the contrary, we are willing to try to reach a kind of gentlemen's agreement, through genuine dialogue, that would give each of our institutions the safeguards and guarantees it believes necessary."
"In our view, it should be possible to come to an agreement very quickly on some kind of interinstitutional legislative programme for 2008 and the first half of 2009, which would contain a limited number of common priorities in sensitive matters, would come with mutual commitments, and would enable us to benefit from the positive provisions of the new treaty, without bringing them in early."
"Parliament already indicated a possible method of responding to this request during the vote held at the last plenary in Strasbourg on modifying the Staff Regulations and missions of Europol."
"Indeed, President of the Council, Commissioner, it was by an overwhelming majority of 537 votes that Parliament adopted an amendment stipulating that this decision would be revised within six months of the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Of course, even though it was adopted by an overwhelming majority, this unilateral amendment is not binding."
"However, as you will have understood, it is a very clear manifestation of our political will to open up a discussion and find solutions."
"It is in this spirit that our committee confirms both its determination and its availability for a genuine interinstitutional dialogue."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) I am happy to be here with you today and to take part in such an important debate."
"The implementation of policies in the field of justice and internal affairs is of extreme importance for our citizens."
"With the development of our society and modern technologies, the question of security has become one of the most important issues for our citizens."
"I think that we, as representatives of the Council, the Commission and Parliament, have the same aims: to secure conditions for cooperation between Member States which will offer our citizens an appropriate level of security."
"Two years ago we began debating two items of legislation which were intended to enable a giant leap in the quality of our cooperation."
"The first was a decision to establish Europol as a European agency, and the other was to incorporate the Treaty of Prüm into European legislation."
"In accordance with the new legal basis, Europol will be able to respond more rapidly to changing trends in terrorism and organised crime and it will further improve its analytical capacity and ability to support the Member States."
"This will substantially help in a more effective struggle against the organised crime and terrorist organisations which are active in several States of the European Union."
"The incorporation of the Treaty of Prüm will enable a faster exchange of DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data from national databases."
"The two previous Presidencies, Germany and Portugal, have done everything to assist the adoption of both items of legislation by the end of our three Presidencies."
"In accordance with the programme which I presented to your colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, we are planning to reach a consensus on both items by June of this year."
"In view of their importance, a delay in adopting them would not be justified, especially as we have already approved them and harmonised them among the Member States and among all three institutions to this current level."
"As for the legislation still awaiting debate, the Presidency is willing to cooperate closely with Parliament on a case-by-case basis and in the spirit of joint responsibility for their adoption."
"Both institutions will thereby share responsibility for the security of EU citizens and in other areas."
"The Council is currently discussing proposals for legislation of general application to do with combating all forms of organised crime and terrorism. This mainly concerns data gathering and exchange procedures and also applies to cooperation within Europol."
"We are also discussing legislation relating to specific problems and specific criminal activities."
"In addition to the proposal to incorporate the Treaty of Prüm and the decision on Europol, we are currently building on the measures for preventing undesirable persons from entering the territory of the European Union."
"I am personally involved in the efforts to accelerate the development of the second generation of the Schengen information system."
"We are preparing to accelerate the adoption of legislation that will make it easier to use the visa information system."
"In external affairs, we are working hard with the countries of the western Balkans and Russia to prepare regional assessments of threats from organised crime."
"This month the Council started to debate the first of two proposals for directives on legal immigration."
"After the first meeting of working groups, where the debate concerned highly qualified workers, the Presidency felt that there was a wide consensus on the application of the directive."
"We hope that further debate will identify the key political issues by the end of our Presidency, and we will then hand the dossier on to the French Presidency so that work can continue effectively."
"For two years now, Parliament and the Council have been debating the proposal for a directive on the return of third country citizens who are living illegally in the European Union."
"The debate is focused on several specific issues on which the institutions have very different opinions."
"The Presidency will continue to do its utmost to reach an agreement with Parliament that will enable the directive to be adopted as soon as possible, preferably at first reading."
"However, we must be careful that this directive does not make the return procedures worse and thus reduce the effectiveness of our policies in the fight against illegal migration."
"In deepening this dialogue with the countries of origin and transit, the Council will continue to strive for the ongoing implementation of global approaches to problems of migration, emphasising that they have to be included and that there has to be a geographic balance."
"Our attention will thus be focused on north Africa and south-eastern Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the President of the Council and thank the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Deprez, for his introduction."
"Clearly today we are not just discussing an assessment of the results for 2007, which in our particular area have been positive, in my opinion: we have opened up internal borders to more than 400 million EU citizens with Schengen enlargement; we have created and implemented the Fundamental Rights Agency; we have reached a very important agreement with Parliament on the Visa Information System; we have worked on immigration, as the Slovenian Minister Mr Mate mentioned, and on terrorism."
"Just to give a statistic, in 2007 the proposals that fell within my remit and that I presented to you constituted almost 20% of all the strategic initiatives of the European Commission, which means that this area has been and continues to be of truly vast importance."
"We have achieved everything that was in the strategic programme."
"Today, in 2008, we are facing a challenge every bit as important."
"As you know, the Commission identified 26 strategic proposals for 2008, and eight of these, so almost 30%, concern the area of freedom, security and justice."
"This year we will deal with external borders: there will be a package of proposals in February to strengthen security at our external borders, along the same lines and using the same criteria as for the Schengen and visa information systems; we will carry out a comprehensive assessment of Frontex, which will enable everyone to learn lessons for the future too; we will, I hope, make some progressive and ambitious proposals on civil justice; we are discussing with the Slovenian Presidency what is known as e-justice, or how to give citizens better access to civil and criminal justice through the use of the latest technologies."
"Of course we will continue to deal with immigration."
"The initiatives of last year, on which a broad political consensus was reached, will be dealt with and developed during this year."
"This year there will be the action plan on asylum, asylum seekers and the European system for the treatment of refugees; in July and November we will have the two comprehensive proposals."
"We will be proposing a European strategy for the prevention of violent radicalisation, one of the key factors of a political strategy to fight terrorism; this will happen in June."
"However, I think the political issue raised by Mr Deprez deserves a political response, which I will happily give."
"2008 is a year of transition."
"It is a year of transition to the Treaty of Lisbon and its ratification, with a view to its entry into force - which we would all like - in January 2009."
"Then it is clear that the three requirements, on the one hand to work together with Parliament to assist this transition, and on the other not to slow down initiatives that are ready for action and on which there is consensus, and at the same time not to anticipate what the Treaty of Lisbon will say or do when it comes into force, must all be kept in mind."
"So I believe that an interinstitutional political agreement will be necessary."
"Clearly, this can be reached only if the Council, Commission and Parliament agree on the working method, even before agreeing on the specific priorities."
"If there is political agreement on the working method, we can define common priorities together, and the priorities should be initiatives that have an immediate added value for citizens, that attract sufficient consensus, and that achieve the balance we want between the interests at play: security, safeguarding the security of citizens, and also promoting and protecting civil liberties - the usual political balancing act that is the challenge facing all of us."
"I believe that the best working method is the one we have begun to explore with the Council: not working in six-month periods, but bringing together the trio of Presidencies, which the current and previous Presidencies have done, to look at initiatives over an eighteen-month period rather than a six-month period, because it is clearly the case that if we work only with initiatives over a limited timescale, we do not have the vision that should carry us - I believe - reasonably, at least to June 2009, because the date of the European Parliament elections is, in my opinion, the only real deadline we should be looking at."
"So I am prepared to do this, I am prepared for a political dialogue with the Council and with Parliament to identify those things we can offer our citizens as an immediate response from among the 2008 and 2009 priorities, and those that deserve to be looked into in more detail."
"This is how I believe we will demonstrate, without prejudice to the Treaty, that when the institutions work together they get there more quickly and with better political results."
"This is the path I think we could all follow together."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate concerns European internal policy and I believe it is right to do what the Vice-President of the Commission, Mr Frattini, has already done, and that is to take a brief look back."
"2007 was a great year for European internal policy."
"The opening up of the Schengen area has been a great success and we are also able to confirm to our citizens that if all the investigative authorities in Europe have access to one database system, this will not reduce security, but increase it."
"Nevertheless, we must also look to the future, of course."
"I read here that the SIS II was debated at the informal Council meeting in Slovenia under the Slovenian Presidency."
"As I understand it, the central system is now once again being shelved."
"Sections of the Commission appear to be ready, but now a new political group of specialised interior ministers is being set up to deal with the SIS II."
"Their aim as regards SIS II is to make real practical progress in combating organised crime and crime in Europe."
"Therefore, why do we have to delay any further here?"
"I am concerned that after enlargement we are falling into a black hole because everyone is satisfied that enlargement has turned out well."
"I should like to point out that we in Parliament carried out an evaluation of the systems after six months and will also insist on doing so."
"A second practical subject area in which I would ask for action to be taken is the issue of police cooperation."
"As you know, unfortunately not all sections of the Prüm Treaty have been incorporated into Community law, but in particular essential issues of police cooperation were not adopted. Further progress therefore needs to be made here too."
"We are awaiting proposals from the Commission regarding border protection."
"I am looking forward to proposals regarding the entry and exit systems because it will be very interesting to find out how many overstayers we have in Europe."
"One final point: we are to have a new treaty."
"I should therefore like to encourage our Committee Chairman, Mr Deprez."
"We shall gain the citizens' confidence in this treaty if we haul the decisions in force in the internal policy sector out from the back rooms of the Council and bring them into the bright light of this plenary sitting."
"Here people will see how decisions are made."
"Therefore, please accept Parliament's outstretched hand."
"We are ready to cooperate."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, President of the Council, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I believe I can share Commissioner Frattini's approach to the debate."
"We need to look to the future, we need to understand how we can manage the time left to us with a sense of responsibility and commitment shared by all the European institutions."
"We believe that after years of debate on the area of freedom, security and justice, in which this Parliament has been critical of the clear democratic deficit - such a tricky area for the fundamental rights of citizens - we can welcome the signature of the new treaty, which finally creates a European dimension in this area, and which gives Parliament full legislative powers, including on judicial, criminal and police cooperation and on entry and residence policies."
"For this reason, my group also believes that, even during the delicate phase of ratification, no institution can escape the fact that the framework has completely changed."
"We know it is not possible simply to bring forward the entry into force of the Treaty, but we believe it would be a mistake politically to carry on working on highly sensitive dossiers in a way that sidesteps the democratic scope of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"For this reason, our group also believes that a joint commitment from Parliament, the Council and the Commission is necessary to identify any dossiers of particular importance, not to block their passage but to guarantee that Parliament can be consulted with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and to integrate them into the new institutional framework."
"I am thinking in particular of the important dossiers on which until now we have merely been consulted, such as the proposal for a European PNR system, the proposal to revise the framework decision on terrorism, the directive on the admission of highly qualified workers and the directive on a uniform procedure for the admission of labour migrants."
"May I take a few seconds, Mr President, to express concern over what the Council was saying about the Returns Directive."
"We appreciate the Council's availability and cooperation, but we believe that there are a few extremely delicate points. One in particular is that 18 months' detention is not considered an improvement in the effectiveness of this directive, but an oppressive measure on which a good many in this Parliament will continue to express their displeasure."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we are looking at the progress that the European Union has made towards becoming this area of freedom, security and justice. This means a development towards a Europe in which both civil rights are upheld and complex issues of law enforcement, such as terrorism and transnational crime, are addressed."
"But, unfortunately, what we have had in the last 10 years is a failure to strike the right balance between security, freedom and justice, and actually rather a narrow definition of security."
"Law enforcement needs to be better targeted and civil liberties need an upgrade."
"For instance, the failure - in 10 years - to agree on a measure upholding minimum rights for suspects and defendants is a real hole in the record."
"Advocate-General Maduro, in an opinion on terrorist blacklists - quoting, I think, from the Israeli Supreme Court - said, 'It is when the cannons roar that we especially need the laws."
"There are no black holes."
"The war against terrorism is also law's war against those who rise up against it.'"
"It is a pity that the Council of Member States did not bear that in mind in considering our report from the Temporary Committee on Extraordinary Rendition."
"We have had no substantive response to that report."
"I agree with Commissioner Frattini that we need an agreement between the Commission, Council and Parliament about the way forward in the transition from the unsatisfactory intergovernmental procedures in criminal justice to normal Community decision-making."
"This is going to take a change of culture and attitude as well as procedures."
"Some of the third-pillar measures in the pipeline, like Prüm, data protection, EU P&R, are of low-quality in terms of both democratic scrutiny and civil liberties safeguards."
"A lot of confidence is being invested in technological projects, either of exchange of data between Member States or of construction of new EU databases."
"I am all in favour of appropriate data sharing, but I caution against over-reliance on technological quick fixes."
"Do not let us forget traditional, intelligence-led policing; even if it is more difficult in making it work across borders, it should not be relegated to a secondary effort in the light of the dazzling allure of databases, because this raises big questions of data protection and data security."
"I have asked Commissioner Frattini to consider doing a green paper on whether our regime of data security is adequate, particularly in the light of the scandalous losses of data in the UK."
"He has declined so far."
"I hope he might reconsider."
"Also, can he consider the need for that in the light of the route of profiling that we are going down?"
"Commissioner Frattini does not acknowledge this, but the UK Government does quite openly say, 'we are doing profiling'."
"Let us have a debate about what safeguards we need."
"Finally, on the UK opt-out, I think colleagues in Parliament might appreciate - and certainly I, as a British MEP would - having some idea what the UK strategy will be in the use of the opt-ins and opt-outs, because I think that would be quite helpful in making clear that the UK intends to engage positively in justice and home affairs in the years to come."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (GA) Mr President, the Irish Government is playing an active, central role in Europe in the fight against international organised crime."
"Irish police forces are making their contribution through the European Police Office - Europol."
"With a population of 500 million, in what are now 27 countries, it is vital that international borders should serve as a protection against the illicit activities of criminals."
"To enable this to happen, there has to be solidly based intensive cooperation among police, customs, naval, and intelligence services, encompassing all of the Member States."
"I should like to stress that the Lisbon Reform Treaty will in no way affect Irish neutrality."
"Ireland is a neutral country, and Irish troops cannot be deployed overseas unless an appropriate resolution has been adopted in the UN and the necessary consent has been obtained - after a vote in the Dáil Éireann - from the Irish Government."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, my group would agree with much of what has been said, particularly the emphasis on the need for the protection of fundamental rights as a core basis of many of the decisions we would like to see taken in the remaining period of this Parliament."
"My group would also agree that an interinstitutional agreement would be useful to avoid the sort of arbitrary use of codecision that we have seen on occasion, that sort of arbitrary use at the behest of the Council when many of us felt, because things could not be got through by unanimity, Parliament was being used as a sort of alibi."
"We would rather see these sort of arrangements set within a proper framework - and within something that is not going to delay for five years much of the progress that we want to see happen."
"In terms of the issues about fundamental rights, we are deeply concerned that one of the issues which does not seem to have been resolved in the Council is the question of procedural safeguards."
"Many in this Parliament agreed to the introduction of the European arrest warrant, believing that procedural safeguards would soon follow."
"Others who were obviously more sceptical said we wanted to see the safeguards first and then we would look at greater cooperation between Member States."
"So we would like to know, please, when we can expect these measures, which are deeply important to all of our citizens."
"We also share the concern voiced this morning on questions about data protection."
"There are growing concerns about the lack of transparency and, certainly, growing public concern about the way in which data is being used and exchanged without any clear information to the public as to what exactly is happening."
"I was slightly concerned, to put it mildly, to hear the Council talk about the issues of the Returns Directive, saying that some Member States do not want return to become more difficult."
"Some of us might believe that what this means is that the Council does not want to see a safe, secure and open procedure put in place that guarantees the rights of individuals rather than simply, as in the case of some Member States, trying to meet targets through return."
"We do not want return necessarily to become more difficult."
"We want it to become a more open procedure which safeguards rights."
"One of the issues with which we have concern, for example, is the use by some Member States of an automatic re-entry ban."
"We also share the concerns on length of detention."
"I welcome the statement that was made about the proposal on highly-qualified migrants."
"At last we may see a positive measure on an immigration policy, a move away from what some of us see as a policy of deterrents that the Union has been following for some time."
"At last we will get an agreement on something more positive and more open, even if it is only affects a small part of those people coming to the European Union."
"But I would welcome a comment, please, on what is happening on the sanctions against employers."
"Lastly, I would also like an answer to the question posed to both the Council and Commission on the comment about the UK's position on treaty reform."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I much appreciated the willingness of the Commission and also of the Council to reach an interinstitutional political agreement quickly in view of the new transitions we will be experiencing in the next few months."
"From January 2009 this Parliament will be able to play an important role in freedom, security and justice, particularly in terms of the need for European citizens to be able to exercise democratic control over the choices being made within the area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union."
"We think that 2008 will be a year of transition, and therefore a number of priorities in terms of freedom, security and justice must be identified in the course of it."
"I think we need to go forward with matters on which we cannot turn back, matters we need to insist on."
"I am thinking about the need to introduce a common asylum policy for 2010 and the need to speed up the process that could lead to defining this common policy;"
"I am also thinking of the need to come up quickly with a general plan for legal immigration, not just to encourage the admission of qualified or highly qualified immigrants, but to prepare a plan that covers all admissions to the European Union;"
"I believe that we also need to focus on the freedom of circulation of men and women within the Schengen area, profiting from the results achieved in 2007, and to try to capitalise on these aspects."
"I believe we also ought to try during 2008 to assess some of the choices that have already been made."
"In particular I am thinking about two important questions."
"I think that a genuine assessment must be made of the usefulness and effectiveness of Frontex."
"It seems to me that an objective assessment could quietly bring us to admit that it has not produced the effects that the vast majority of this Parliament and Europe's citizens had hoped for."
"In the same way, I think that an assessment must be made of the enormous quantity of databases at our disposal."
"All too often, the exchanges of information are not of any value and sometimes the information is lost."
"To conclude, Mr President, I think that we should probably also make a final assessment of the Returns Directive."
"It appears that we have now reached the point of no return, and we probably need to change our strategy: to come up with an action plan and a plan for legal immigration, and then we will know how to kick out, expel and detain immigrants."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the questions to the Council call for particular attention to developments with regard to Frontex."
"I have drawn attention to this issue repeatedly in the past."
"This debate is therefore a good opportunity to raise our concern about Frontex once more."
"I concur with Mr Catania's words in this regard."
"Several national parliaments have urged the governments of the Member States to provide manpower and material for Frontex's activities."
"Obviously, the Member States are not exactly champing at the bit to participate in operational activities, and I am therefore pleased that the Netherlands has finally agreed to deploy a frigate."
"Hence my question: what will happen with the boat people and migrants after they are picked up?"
"Can the President-in-Office tell us how people intercepted in boats at sea will be dealt with?"
"We receive regular reports of the interception of boatloads of migrants; as a rule, these people are first brought to shore and taken care of."
"Is it the Member State in command of the navy vessel who is obliged to grant asylum or take care of the reception of the intercepted boat people?"
"From the reaction of the Dutch State Secretary for Justice this week it can be deduced that there is still no definite answer to this question."
"I should like greater clarification in this regard, as it is not right, of course, that Member States who provide material and manpower should have to bear the full burden."
"President-in-Office, if you are unable to give us an answer to this question during this debate, will you do so in writing?"
"I now have another question for Commissioner Frattini."
"It is easy for ministers of justice to promise to provide navy vessels, for example; but implementation is in the hands of the defence ministers, who are often lucky even to be informed of the promises made by ministers of justice."
"Clearly, this gives rise to major coordination problems."
"My question to Commissioner Frattini is this: what do you intend to do to avoid this kind of problem in future?"
"After all, it has taken a very long time for the promises made so long ago to show the beginnings of the slightest effect."
"(NL) Mr President, quite rightly, the need for all manner of measures to increase the security of our citizens is extensively debated in this Hemicycle."
"Frontex springs to mind in this regard."
"However, let us not bury our heads in the sand, as Europe itself has become much less secure precisely because of the open border policy that has been pursued."
"The fact is that this policy has tangibly strengthened the power of internationally organised crime without putting adequate measures in place to combat it."
"That is not all."
"European citizens have also fallen victim to waves of legalisation on the status of illegal immigrants that certain countries have decided to carry out."
"This will certainly not reduce the disgraceful trafficking in human beings."
"The area of security we are discussing here is, however regrettably, to some extent also an area in which criminals - particularly Islamic extremists - are given free rein."
"The essential State competences in this field are all being increasingly eroded - competence with regard to legal immigration, for example."
"This is unacceptable."
"The Member States must retain total and unconditional control of their own labour markets, and there must be absolutely no restrictions imposed on the way in which they conduct their labour market policy."
"(ES) Mr President, I think Mr Deprez has correctly identified the problem and Vice-President Frattini has provided the solution to that problem."
"Strictly speaking we are facing a year of transition, but during that year of transition, to which we need to add six more months up to the end of the parliamentary term, we have some mature decisions to make that we cannot neglect."
"This is why I think that the interinstitutional agreement is absolutely essential in order to be able to harmonise mature initiatives with the much needed and much desired codecision."
"Therefore, Mr President, I think that the importance of initiatives such as those within the framework of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - let us bear in mind that, of the Commission's 26 strategic proposals, a third come under the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - gives us a huge responsibility when dealing with the draft legislation that we have under way."
"This is why the much called for evaluation of the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders deserves all our attention, as do all issues relating to migratory phenomena, concerning both legal and illegal immigration."
"Civil and criminal justice to provide better services for citizens, Europol, a revised European Agency in the new framework of the Constitutional Treaty - not forgetting, Mr President, data protection in the third pillar - all of this merits the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice being harmonised in terms of both methods and time."
"- (EL) Mr President, the Internet is the new battlefield."
"According to the Commission and the Council, it is a battlefield for combating terrorism, and we do not argue with this. For many of us, however, the Internet is also a battlefield for the protection of citizens' fundamental rights."
"Of course, as we well know, the Internet is used by terrorists, but it is also used by millions of innocent citizens for discussion."
"What they discuss also happens to be terrorism which, without justifying it, they are trying to understand: something we do all too rarely here, unfortunately."
"So, notwithstanding the importance of a legislative initiative against the circulation of pro-terrorist propaganda on the Internet, this is also a highly sensitive issue."
"Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, I have to tell you that this legislative initiative in its present form is somewhat problematic."
"It does not require that a person spreading pro-terrorist propaganda do so intentionally and... 'and' that propaganda be likely to lead to a terrorist act."
"Instead of 'and', your text reads 'or'."
"In other words, should a member of the public try to make sense of terrorism that is being committed somewhere in the world, they risk ending up in trouble simply because 'somebody' believes that their words have led to an act of terrorism: that member of the public is accused, even though they have no intention of causing such an act."
"This is something you must correct."
"I should also ask you to explain whether the contents of our e-mails will be checked."
"Who will check them to enable the police to judge whether this new law that you are promoting has been violated?"
"Let me remind you that in the case of data retention of telephone calls, you have repeatedly reassured us that the contents of our SMS messages and phone calls will not be monitored."
"Will the contents of our e-mails here be monitored as a result of the measure you are promoting?"
"Another point I wish to emphasise is the European PNR system initiative."
"My friends, we do not need it."
"At least, you have not explained to us why we should need it."
"We have the APIS; we have, as Mr Frattini has quite rightly pointed out, the VIS, a successful outcome of our agreement; and we have Schengen: so we know very well who is travelling where in the world today, and who is coming to Europe."
"Furthermore, of the 27 countries in Europe, only 3 currently have measures in place for the possible implementation of PNR."
"Where is the pressure to harmonise PNR legislation now?"
"Why are you promoting this measure so fanatically, even though the European data protectors have disagreed with it?"
"Why do you not sit down and discuss it with Parliament, with people who are set on fighting terrorism, but who might be just as concerned about protecting rights - if not more concerned, as we are sometimes accused of being?"
"- (DE) Mr President, what can be affirmed is the fact that not only do the Council and the Commission place greater emphasis on the term 'security' in their documents, but they also appear to have become increasingly aware of citizens' basic freedoms and rights."
"We in Europe, however, can do as much work as we want on the common area of freedom, security and law when third countries' legal systems are apparently impeding us in this exercise."
"I believe that the Commission, and specifically the Member States too, should be increasingly monitoring the extent to which the US legal system, for example, is impacting on the households of European citizens."
"The Commission and the Council will find themselves faced with a question from me and some of my colleagues, asking how it is possible that mail transfer data from the United States, which to all intents and purposes should be used only for customs purposes, is being passed on to the security authorities."
"The confidentiality of mail is one of the last bastions we have so far been able to protect."
"I hope that the Commission in cooperation with the Council will be able to resolve the problem of a global approach to combating terrorism and organised crime not only from the security aspect, but also from the aspect of freedom, protection of citizens and elimination of the problems of conflicting legal systems."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the deputy chief editor of Corriere della Sera, Magdi Allam, who could hardly be accused of racism or Islamophobia, has raised a serious issue: the imams and all the requirements of the large mosque in Rome - funding and pay - are supported by the embassies of a number of Islamic countries."
"Does this provide security in Europe, in one of its major capitals, against the genuine risk of the spread of extremist Islamic doctrines?"
"I do not think so."
"Rather, I believe that there should be control of the spread of fundamentalist Islamic ideas closely linked to terrorism and that this is what the European Union should be looking at very carefully."
"Terrorism: what do we make of the recent opinion of Advocate General of the European Court of Justice Poiares Maduro, which suggests that Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 on freezing the assets of those on the blacklist of members of Al-Qaida and the Taliban is unlawful?"
"I would like to restate the fact that this Regulation is nothing more than the application of UN Resolution 1390, adopted by the whole international community in response to the attacks of 11 September."
"The civilised world wants to defend itself against the risk of terrorism: never drop your guard against the deadly threat of Islamic terrorism!"
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we have not made any considerable progress in the matters of freedom, security and law."
"On the contrary: the governments are not allowing their citizens to have their say on the Lisbon Treaty through referenda and we are therefore moving away from freedom."
"Why are citizens not free to decide whether they want their country's participation in EU decision-making to diminish?"
"Why are citizens not free to decide whether they want to see an end to their governments' vetoes in the areas of migration, energy and transport, as well as control over the European Central Bank?"
"Why do citizens of the Member States, especially the smaller ones, not know that it is going to be practically out of the question for them to hold the rotating presidency of the European Council?"
"Indeed, has anyone told them that in six years' time their country will lose its automatic right to have a Commissioner in the European Commission?"
"The Reform Treaty changes the pivotal European Union documents in a fundamental way."
"If it is adopted just by parliaments, without referenda and nation-wide discussions, instead of freedom there will be unrestrained arrogance of the powers that be."
"The European Commission should remind the governments of this."
"(SL) Firstly, I would like to thank you for the very good presentations on this fairly complicated issue we are discussing today."
"I would like to use this opportunity to draw attention to another field which we have not yet dealt with sufficiently clearly."
"I am talking about the external borders of the European Union."
"All the Member States which are now in charge of the new external borders of the European Union have invested great efforts in securing these borders properly in order to protect them and ensure that the infrastructure is suitable and facilitates implementation of the Schengen standards."
"However, we have at the same time found that life at the border has deteriorated."
"I would like to draw your attention to the reduced quality of life of people at the border, especially in less developed regions, and I would like to ask whether the Council and the Commission are planning any special additional measures to improve the quality of life in border regions so as to prevent people deserting these areas."
"We are all very aware that if people leave border areas, i.e. if they are uninhabited spaces, they are also difficult to protect."
"My second question is: At the committee meeting, the Council President mentioned that cooperation with the Balkan countries is also one of the important tasks on which the Council is focusing."
"In this context I am especially interested to know whether implementing the Schengen standards and securing our safety will hinder cooperation between our police forces and the police forces within the Balkan countries."
"(FR) Mr President, we are at a turning point for the European Parliament in the setting up of a genuine area of freedom, security and justice, and the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon allows us to strengthen democratic and jurisdictional control."
"Obviously I wish to support the requests of my fellow Members to come up with a list of priorities we can work on using an early codecision procedure, on the basis of an interinstitutional political agreement."
"Indeed, the full participation of the European Parliament can only improve the quality of decisions, and sometimes, as we have already seen, enable an agreement to be reached at all."
"Obviously this cannot happen without the national parliaments being involved in this debate, and I propose that we also bring forward the strengthened role conferred upon them by the new treaty."
"Another of our priorities, of course, should be data protection."
"It will be no surprise to you that I am coming back to this."
"Indeed, you know that we encouraged the adoption of the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar."
"Naturally, we are pleased that the European Parliament is being consulted again on the subject."
"However, we are extremely concerned about the mediocre results achieved in the Council on this text, precisely because of the unanimity rule."
"Given that the pillars will soon be eliminated, and to ensure true protection of the private lives of our fellow citizens, do you not think that a solution would be to modify the existing directives on data protection so that they also apply to police and judicial cooperation?"
"It is particularly important to ensure a high level of data protection because this must also govern the proposal to establish a European PNR."
"This is an important question I am putting to you and I would really like an answer."
"(NL) Mr President, first of all, I should like full transparency from the Commission and the Council regarding the ongoing negotiations with the United States on a transatlantic data protection scheme."
"It seems that now - at the end of the negotiation process - the Commission is going to ask the Council for a mandate."
"This is the wrong way round."
"Secondly, the PNR dossier is starting to turn into a shambles."
"The need for the whole programme is far from well established."
"The legal basis is unclear."
"There is still no system for the protection of personal data in the third pillar. Yet it would seem that this has not stopped the home affairs ministers from deciding on a European PNR programme."
"Moreover, the European Parliament's representative, Mr Deprez, was not invited."
"I should like to understand how it can be that the German Minister of Justice has at the same time declared that a European PNR programme would be contrary to the German Basic Law."
"In my opinion, this dossier is far from ready; the European Parliament would first like to hear why this programme is necessary."
"- (PL) Mr President, the most important event of 2007 in the area of freedom, security and justice was clearly the enlargement of the Schengen area."
"Today we can say that expectations of easier movement across borders have suffered a brutal collision with reality."
"Movement across the Polish-German border between Saxony and Lower Silesia is now problematic because of the enlargement of the Schengen area."
"People are being accused at random of smuggling illegal emigrants and are being held by the police for hours on end like ordinary criminals."
"Such accusations are being levelled at taxi drivers in the border area."
"In violation of the law, they are being told to check passengers' documents."
"Vehicles with a Polish registration plate are being subjected to checks lasting several hours."
"The Schengen Agreement is being introduced on the Polish-German border in a way that discourages people from crossing the border."
"This is not in line with the aim of that agreement and demands urgent action by the European Commission."
"(RO) The efforts of the Commission and the Council to ensure the free movement of persons across Europe came to fruition in December 2007 with the extension of the Schengen area."
"In the field of illegal migration, the draft legislation on common standards for the repatriation of illegal immigrants from third countries and the sanctioning of illegal migrant employers are sure to help reduce this phenomenon."
"Concerning legal migration, the Commission has initiated legal measures by submitting to Parliament the draft legislation on conditions for entry and residence for highly skilled workers and the single permit procedure for third-country nationals."
"I would like to draw attention to a topic that I believe to be of utmost importance: transitory measures are still in force, imposed by some Member States in order to limit the movement of the labour force from other European Union Member States."
"It is all very well to promote a single policy to deal with legal immigration from third countries, but it is not normal to impose restrictions on EU nationals."
"We cannot speak about a space of freedom if there are restrictions on the freedom of movement of the work force."
"In my opinion, it is obvious that the directives on legal migration from third countries should be enforced, while at the same time lifting the restrictions applied to some Member States."
"This can be done gradually by asking Member States that apply the legal migration Directive to repeal any labour restrictions that apply to nationals of other Member States referred to by the Directive."
"Moreover, the concept of preference should be applied, so that European nationals would take precedence in meeting labour market demands."
"Moreover, I believe a further distinction should be drawn between third countries, where nationals of neighbouring countries, especially of those countries included in the neighbourhood policy, would have priority."
"I hope that the discussion between Mr Frattini and Mr Deprez that opened our debate, will lead to actual results and a positive activity on our part."
"- (PL) Mr President, the birth of the Lisbon Treaty and the reform of the European Union are bringing about significant changes in the area of freedom, security and justice, although these were expected by EU citizens."
"In particular, the subjection of this area to the competence of the European Court of Justice requires good preparation on the part of both countries and EU institutions."
"Parliament is aware of this and is preparing itself for the new tasks, and especially for taking the majority of decisions jointly."
"In this context I would like to ask the Council: are we to begin work on a common list of priorities in the area of freedom, security and justice, and if so, when?"
"I know that both the Council and the Commission have programmes."
"Parliament, through my committee, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, also knows what needs to be done."
"However, we need common, effective and transparent action, and a common list of priorities for the benefit of our citizens."
"I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Portuguese Presidency for enlarging the Schengen area, and at the same time appeal for a regular evaluation of the functioning of this system."
"Just a few weeks in, we can already see some incidental negative consequences alongside the excellent advantages."
"These include the prohibitive cost of visas for citizens of third countries, particularly for Belarusians."
"The cost of a visa - 60 euros - is an obstacle and makes it impossible for them to visit their EU neighbours; it also makes it difficult for us to carry out our neighbourhood policy, which is after all enshrined in the Reform Treaty."
"Commissioner, this requires more than just monitoring; ladies and gentlemen, this must be changed."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to focus on something that may seem minor, but which has become seriously worse during 2007 and affects millions of people: security in European airports."
"The European Commission and the Council have allowed and are allowing terrorism prevention in airports to be managed as if it were a transport policy."
"Freedoms are being limited and rights restricted through procedures designed for the logistical and technical standards for aeroplanes and trains."
"As a result citizens are being left with no protection against abuse and limitations of rights are being approved with no assessment of proportionality or evaluation of effectiveness."
"Men and women are being treated, at times, like livestock at the checkpoints by security officers who do not know the rules they are applying or the exceptions to those rules, because the rules have been declared secret."
"I ask the Commission - and Mr Frattini in particular - to re-establish their authority in this area; and I ask the Council to examine it seriously."
"We have turned airports into areas in a state of emergency where neither the law nor the most basic guarantees apply, but rather police authority with no type of control."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to mention three matters that are particularly close to my heart."
"The first concerns the way we are going to deal with the phase leading up to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Like all my colleagues on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I would like us to reach an interinstitutional agreement on bringing forward the new provisions applicable to our area of competence."
"Indeed, this seems to me to be the sine qua non for an effective and transparent collaboration."
"The new rules on the role of the national parliaments should also be tried out this year."
"As rapporteur on the Framework Decision on combating terrorism, I made a commitment to cooperate in a close and structured manner with the national parliaments."
"On the subject of terrorism, an overview of the various texts already adopted would provide a better picture of their respective scope and how they relate to one another."
"Furthermore, whilst the fight against terrorism has to be a priority for the European Union, so must the protection of fundamental freedoms."
"I will therefore be extremely vigilant, when working on the framework decision, regarding the clarity of the definitions and terms used, to rule out any potential risk of infringing these freedoms, particularly freedom of expression."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words about our future action on immigration."
"The EU has for a long time been mainly concerned with equipping itself with a veritable arsenal of laws to fight illegal immigration, though this protective attitude towards its borders has not been counterbalanced by a policy on legal immigration worthy of the name."
"I am therefore delighted with the initiatives adopted over the last few years in this area, and I hope that the political will to support a welcoming Europe will be as strong as it was to defend fortress Europe."
"We are now going into the practice that the English call 'catch the eye'."
"In any case, as I am also Vice-President responsible for multilingualism, I am going to try to talk to the interpreters, my friends the interpreters, to see how the term 'catch the eye' can be translated into other languages."
"For now we will say that whoever wishes to speak may do so, if the President gives them speaking time by 'catch the eye'."
"By 'catch the eye', then, I grant speaking time to Mr Cavada, who I am sure has much to say to us on this subject."
"(FR) Mr President, I would first beg you to excuse this disruption to the agenda, or more precisely to the order of precedence."
"A train breakdown between Paris and Brussels nearly took me out of Europe, but it has been put right now, thank you."
"Every year, we debate the progress that has been made on building the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Today, however, this debate is of particular importance and that is why I want to present the reasons that led the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to table these two oral questions, to the Council and the Commission respectively, and to press the representatives of these institutions to provide clear answers to the questions we are asking."
"If this debate is important, it is because with the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon last December and its entry into force planned for 1 January 2009, the policies linked to fundamental rights and the progress made in the area of freedom, security and justice must and will undergo substantial changes, changes that Parliament - as you know, ladies and gentlemen - has been calling for incessantly for some years now."
"Among these, I will mention the end of the pillar structure, allowing most of the procedures in the current third pillar to be dealt with at Community level, qualified majority voting to be generalised, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to be extended and the role of Parliament as colegislator to be strengthened; the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be binding."
"To benefit fully from the potential offered by this new treaty, we need as of now to prepare a common interinstitutional strategy allowing us to draw up a list of the proposals to be negotiated politically in 2008 and officially adopted during the January 2008 - May 2009 period."
"To conclude, Mr President, I would like to say that a strategy of this kind would mean that, once the new treaty comes into force, we will not constantly be having to amend proposals that have just been adopted, and it will guarantee full jurisdictional control for the Court of Justice and the full and complete involvement of Parliament in defining policies that go to the very core of citizens' rights."
"As for the question you asked me, I am going to catch my own eye and think about it, to help you in my modest way."
"President-in-Office. - (SL) Thank you for the questions you have asked here today."
"Sadly, there is not enough time to answer them all in great detail, so I will try and touch on the most important ones."
"I will first address Mr Weber's question relating to the SIS II system."
"I would like to say very clearly that we in the Council feel that security in transferring from ""SIS I for all” to the SIS II system is of the utmost importance and we cannot allow data to be lost in any way or the operation of the system to be subject to any kind of threat."
"That is why we decided on a gradual transfer from one system to the other, which, of course, entails development of the converter."
"Consequently, that will somewhat prolong the period needed to bring the SIS II system into operation."
"I think it is a very good decision because it will ensure data security and, of course, an improvement in the quality of the data which the new system will offer, this being the most important aspect of the SIS II system."
"I would further like to touch on a question posed by a number of MEPs regarding cooperation between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament."
"I think it is necessary for this cooperation to be close in most cases."
"Naturally, we need some kind of political consensus and mutual relationship in order to establish and ensure an adequate level of security and the safety of human rights."
"We need a valid and balanced approach, which is where the European Parliament plays an extremely significant role, and I can hardly imagine how we could operate without this close cooperation with the Parliament."
"Naturally, we must be clear that the Treaty of Lisbon is still not in force."
"The ratification process is underway."
"It is a relatively sensitive process, perhaps more so in some countries than others."
"However, we must work and operate in a way which will not threaten the ratification process in any of the Member States of the European Union."
"Therefore, I think it would be wise, in this year leading to the application of the Treaty of Lisbon, to cooperate with one another and to divide the legislation we are debating into two sets."
"One set consists of the legislation which is nearing conclusion and on which we have Parliament's opinion, or which has been fully concluded or is in the final stages of conclusion."
"The other set consists of legislation which we are launching or will be launching shortly and for which we need close and regular cooperation with the Parliament."
"I think this is the way to find an appropriate form of cooperation to ensure adequate security and a sufficiently effective method of operation and to lay down future working practices."
"I would also like briefly to mention the Returns Directive and Frontex."
"The technical discussions and negotiations on the Returns Directive will continue during the Slovenian Presidency and we have also agreed to hold political negotiations."
"I hope, therefore, that we will find the necessary and appropriate political compromise."
"I still hope that it will be reached and we have already been in touch with the rapporteur, Mr Weber, leading me to believe that the matter is progressing well."
"Regarding Frontex, I would simply say that the evaluation of the Frontex work is in progress and the Presidency is planning a more detailed discussion at ministerial level during the conference at the beginning of March, when we will talk about Frontex and its future and evaluate its work so far."
"After that discussion we will be able to give Parliament a more detailed report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this morning's debate has shown a shared willingness to work together on the part of all three institutions."
"Therefore, not only is the working method important, but so is the merit."
"So the wish expressed at the start by Mr Deprez, on which I would say there was a broad consensus including from the President of the Council, and which I personally agree with, is the right working method to use."
"As I said at the start, in the Council the idea of working to a timescale not limited to six months has proved a success."
"We should try to use it here too, because I think, from what people have said, that a number of subjects have emerged that are clearly a priority."
"The fact that we cannot slow down the work towards setting up SIS II - the new generation of the SIS system - is apparent to everyone."
"We need to go forward and, beyond the discussion of timescale, what concerns us is that the process of trialling this new system is showing it to be truly of added value for the security of our external borders."
"Rather than talk about delay, I would talk about the need for the Member States - something I agree with - to trial the system in depth to see how it works and could work better, before actually rolling it out."
"The timescales we have been discussing with the Presidency, and which we will formalise with the February Council of Ministers in a few weeks' time, are timescales that demonstrate our commitment to the added value from the new generation of SIS, something that is clearly a priority."
"Many people have spoken about assessing the effectiveness of security measures, particularly counter-terrorism measures."
"This is something Parliament asked for, which I agreed to a year ago."
"Today we have an exercise under way."
"In December, all the Member States received a detailed questionnaire about the results achieved by the counter-terrorism measures being applied."
"I can say, not only to Baroness Ludford but to all of you, that by mid-April I will be able to publish in full the results of this analysis for all 27 Member States."
"This, I believe, is another priority matter for discussion, something this Parliament has always been interested in."
"Some people have talked about procedural safeguards."
"You know that no agreement was reached on this because some Member States put insurmountable problems in the way, but now the Slovenian Presidency has raised something that I think could be dealt with as a priority: the matter of judgments in absentia."
"This is one of the aspects related to procedural safeguards."
"It is not the whole discussion, but it is an extremely important aspect: harmonising the rules on judgments in absentia - a matter I think Mrs Lambert touched on - is a matter that deserves to be dealt with as a priority in 2008."
"We have already mentioned the assessment of Frontex."
"On 13 February we will publish our first comprehensive assessment of Frontex."
"Clearly, the Commission document will be discussed in the Council and in Parliament, and will form the basis for action, which I would also say is a priority, in 2008: how Frontex has worked, how we can improve it, how we can encourage Member States to participate more."
"Terrorism was spoken of; many people mentioned it."
"Terrorist propaganda on the Internet and violent radicalisation are both matters that will be the subject of non-legislative initiatives."
"A few legislative measures are already planned, there will be communications from the Commission and it is worth debating."
"I much appreciated what Mrs Roure said about the European PNR."
"This is a discussion that will continue throughout 2008."
"I do not believe that we will have adopted the European PNR by the end of this year."
"However, I believe that three criteria - mentioned by Mrs Roure if I am not mistaken - should guide us: proportionality in the collection of these data and their added value for the fight against terrorism, because this is what we are dealing with."
"If this instrument works, we will adopt it, if it does not work we will adapt it or else we will not adopt it."
"I personally believe it will be useful, but I think we need to discuss it here."
"And then there is the matter of how to protect the data collected and how to punish anyone who misuses these data."
"These are matters for discussion, obviously open, that we can tackle during 2008."
"Lastly, immigration."
"I believe that we should now continue with the general approach to immigration, as the European Council in December said, to think, in view of the future French Presidency, about what the French Government intends to propose as a European pact on immigration, and I have already planned for the Commission to be fully available to work on this matter."
"Finally again, asylum policy."
"2008 will be decisive, since 2010 is the deadline for setting up a European asylum system."
"2008 will be the year in which the action plan will be presented to the Commission."
"I have given examples to show how, in this spirit, Mr Deprez's proposal, which I think should be welcomed, is to get together and define in concrete terms what can be done immediately because it is ready - and there are many things we can conclude during the Slovenian Presidency - and what we can continue to discuss between now and, say, June 2009."
"Mr President, I note with some surprise and regret that, first of all, the Council has not replied to any question on PNR."
"I wonder if it would agree here to give us written replies to all the questions that have been put here."
"Secondly, I note - again with regret - that for a year now we have been asking about information about the high-level contact group and the negotiations between the Commission and the Americans on data protection."
"Again, we have not received a reply."
"They have been negotiating for a year, and I think it is high time that they tell us what they are negotiating about."
"I would like a written reply."
"Thank you Mrs in 't Veld."
"I think that both the Commission and the Council have taken note of what you said and I am sure that they will provide written answers to the requests that you have just made."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place during the March part-session."
"Cooperation between the special intervention units of the Member States (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the report by Mr França, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the initiative of the Republic of Austria with a view to adopting a Council decision on the improvement of cooperation between the special intervention units of the Member States of the European Union in crisis situations (15437/2006 - C6-0058/2007 -."
"rapporteur. - (PT) The face of the old Europe has changed."
"Today the European Union, with 27 Member States and nearly 500 million inhabitants, is facing complex and stimulating challenges, requiring us to adopt an ever broader world view and a stance that is very attentive to issues such as peacekeeping, security, stability, freedom and the exercise of democracy."
"As immortalised by Victor Hugo's wisdom, it requires us to know how much of the future can be introduced into the present, as the secret of great government."
"It is therefore the scope and major challenge of this report - the challenge of the security of persons and property in the EU area - and is an issue in the everyday lives of Europeans."
"I am talking about security, specifically, today and tomorrow, every day, in the streets, at work, at leisure and at home, on land, at sea, in the air."
"It is the security of our common space that, without being imposed, guarantees and underpins freedom in a balanced society."
"Freedom is a cornerstone, a fundamental value of the Union; security is a tool in the service of well-being, it offers stability and safeguards freedom."
"Freedom as a value and security as a tool are essential to the European project."
"Austria's initiative, taken up by the Portuguese Presidency and which gave rise to the Council Decision, provides for the improvement of cooperation between the special intervention units of the European Union in crisis situations."
"It is a good and necessary initiative."
"This initiative also complements Prüm, since that Treaty provides for cooperation only in the event of natural disasters or serious accidents."
"My report proposed 11 amendments to the proposal for a decision which also establishes a minimum general framework for possible cooperation in man-made crises, hijacking, terrorist attacks, etc.; i.e. man-made crisis situations presenting a serious direct physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions."
"In the proposal, cooperation in terms of training, preparation and action by special intervention units is always a possibility and the Member State may or may not request cooperation, indicating what type of assistance it requires."
"The effectiveness and promptness of interventions will always depend on the degree of preparedness, coordination, linkage and the existence of uniform methods in the modus operandi of the intervention units, which is why I propose, firstly, the possibility of joint training and exercises, and secondly, that the training and exercises be funded from the budget of the European Union, pursuant to Articles 30, 32 and 34 of the Treaty on European Union."
"I would also point out that, in our understanding, the rules on civil and criminal liability applicable in the event of joint operations must be the same as in the Prüm Decision."
"Mr President, fellow Members, this Council Decision is very important."
"It is a common solution to common issues and threats facing all Member States."
"It is a solution that values the essential cooperation in preparing for and reacting to man-made crises, which are always unforeseen but always possible."
"Finally, I would like to highlight and offer my thanks for the institutional and technical cooperation I have been given and draw attention to the amendments proposed by Mr Díaz de Mera, Mr Demetriou and Mrs Iotova which have improved and enriched my draft report."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I have supported this Austrian initiative, very well relaunched by the Portuguese Presidency, since the very beginning."
"I firmly believe that practical and operational cooperation between special intervention units in the European Union is very important in order to deal with the threatening situation."
"First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr França, for the excellent work he has done on this dossier, and also the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs as a whole for the very useful amendments which are contained in the report."
"I welcome the amendments suggested by Parliament which are aimed at improving the initiative."
"I would just like to mention the amendments to make sure that there is no overlap with the Prüm Decision or questions relating to fine-tuning the liability provisions or to redefining and clarifying the term 'crisis situations' or an amendment referring to the possibility of obtaining funding for common projects."
"It should be remembered that special intervention units currently operate under the ATLAS network."
"They carry out joint training and exercises and we fund such projects."
"We have funded such activities from our budget since 2006 and my proposal for 2008 is to increase that funding for ATLAS up to EUR 900 000."
"In conclusion, I reiterate my support for this report and I strongly wish for rapid progress on this dossier and quick adoption also by the Council."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SL) This decision regarding cooperation between the Member States' special units for intervention in crisis situations is one of many documents which should increase the readiness and capability of the Member States to respond adequately to crisis situations, such as acts of terrorism."
"Action in crisis situations and in the fight against terrorism is a complex task that demands good cooperation among all the Member States."
"A lot has been done so far in terms of establishing political and legal foundations and taking practical preventive measures."
"However, we have not adequately tackled the causes and roots of terrorism."
"That is why I am repeating my suggestion that the Council and the Commission should pay more attention to the roots and causes of terrorism."
"The first steps made in the field of information exchange have also been good, but not sufficient."
"So far, the difficulty has been in the substantial formal obstacles which would arise if a Member State in a crisis situation, say under terrorist attack, asked another Member State for help."
"To take more effective action in crisis situations, it is necessary for the authorities in the Member States to cooperate with each other."
"In particular, it is necessary for their special units to be familiar with and cooperate with one other."
"This decision opens up scope for cooperation in the event of the most serious acts of terrorism, i.e. in real crisis situations."
"It enables a State, when asked, to provide help through its special units."
"This will in no way threaten the sovereignty of the other State, it will simply be helping it."
"This is important not only because of circumstances in practice, but also because it enforces one of the fundamental values of the European Union - solidarity."
"My Group supports this decision and we hope that it will receive a huge vote in favour."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr França, for his fine work."
"Mr President, in discussing the draft legislative resolution on the initiative of the Republic of Austria with a view to adopting a Council decision on the improvement of cooperation between the special intervention units of the Member States of the European Union in crisis situations, one must bear in mind that no single Member State has all the means, resources and expertise at its disposal to deal effectively with all possible kinds of large scale threats or crisis situations requiring special intervention."
"It is therefore of crucial importance that each Member State be able to request the assistance of another Member State."
"This is particularly important first and foremost in combating terrorism, organised crime and cross-border crime and in the event of disasters and serious accidents."
"I also hope, and this must be borne in mind, that Parliament's amendment will introduce a material safeguard against the unauthorised expansion of these simplified rules for cooperation 'by analogy' to the interactions with the agencies of third countries, in order to prevent abuses in, for example, dubious interventions, and so that such interventions are not in breach of Member States' rights."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, the Austrian initiative and the Commission's report aim to further strengthen cooperation between special intervention units of the EU Member States and the organisation of joint operations in each Member State, allegedly to combat terrorist attacks."
"These operations are already included in the Prüm Convention, under which police forces will be completely free to intervene and carry out pursuit operations in the territory of each Member State, even with the use of arms."
"For some years now the European Union has been a breeding ground of 'terror hysteria', insecurity and fear of an unseen enemy. Fundamental human rights and democratic freedoms are being drastically curtailed, allegedly in order to combat this enemy."
"But who in fact is the enemy of the European Union?"
"We have been hearing about terrorism for so many years; in reality, the European Union is trying to shield its policies and protect its economic and political system against opposition from the workers."
"Indeed, the report itself admits this."
"Whatever it says about terrorism and the like is theoretical: it legalises intervention and joint police operations even, so it claims, in cases where there is only a suspicion of criminal acts having been committed, or of a threat to property belonging to state infrastructures or organisations, or of unspecified offences."
"It is precisely this deliberately vague wording that can be used to justify intervention; it can even suppress traditional forms of popular mobilisation or protest, such as, for example, the symbolic take-over of roads and public buildings, large-scale strikes and the organisation of strike rallies."
"Such, we believe, is the report's aim, and this is why we disagree."
"We oppose it. We are voting against the initiative and the report, and we call upon citizens to protect their individual and democratic rights."
"- (DE) Mr President, specialists able to carry out tasks with an increased risk of danger doubtless make a valuable contribution to security - on that we are agreed! - just as planned and improved cooperation is an advantage in the event of a terrorist threat."
"Current developments are in some ways alarming, precisely because of the rising crime rate."
"Police stations are being closed and special units reduced while we are increasingly having to fight ever more unscrupulous criminal gangs rubbing their hands together with glee every time another border opens up."
"In this situation the EU still wants it to be as difficult as possible for responsible citizens to protect themselves with weapons and has contributed, with its mistaken multicultural visions, to a multi-crime society with no-go areas and the propensity to violence on the increase."
"It is, of course, important that in preparing for a terrorist act the fight against criminal activity should not suffer."
"In my opinion we should put an end to the nonsense of siphoning off police officers for terrorist units and closing functioning special units only to create new special units - against gangs of youths, for instance."
"- (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, unlike the previous speakers, I welcome this initiative and would preface it with the saying: 'good things take time!'"
"This is because the Austrian initiative dates from an initiative by the Heads of State or Government in 2004 and addresses the issue of how each of the Member States can best be supported by special units in the event of a terrorist attack."
"It therefore has nothing to do with the matter raised by the previous speaker, nor do I understand the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, which simply dismisses this kind of initiative of mutual support through the use of special units."
"We know that no Member State can in fact be permanently protected against all eventualities. Therefore, with this initiative Parliament has also been trying to find ways to provide the best possible, but above all the most rapid, cross-border assistance in a special case of this kind, and particularly in the event of terrorist attacks, hostage-taking and hijacking."
"I particularly welcome Parliament's additional proposals because they make it easier to decide who, for example, should bear the costs at the end of the day, namely the Member State asking for help, or to decide which regulations should apply if officials are active in another Member State."
"This also includes regulations on liability."
"I welcome the fact that there are also joint training courses for combining these special units and then for improving their deployment, too, should they be needed."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be supporting this initiative."
"I can only grant speaking time by 'catch the eye' to Members who have not previously spoken during the debate, and I do not see anyone who has not spoken asking me for speaking time."
"In addition, Mr Frattini has told me that he does not intend to speak on behalf of the Commission."
"Let us therefore give the rapporteur, Mr França, two minutes' speaking time to close this debate."
"rapporteur. - (PT) I would first like to express my thanks for the references to my work, to the report and to colleagues on the committee of which I am a member, to Mr Frattini and the other Members who expressed their support for the report and for Austria's initiative and the decision by the Council and the Portuguese Presidency to continue it."
"I would like to stress one aspect that seems very important to me."
"In this area, security - I repeat - security is a tool, it is not a value; it is a tool in the service of freedom and in the service of the effective and positive exercise of the fundamental rights specifically of EU citizens."
"And another aspect that seems no less important to me is that this decision will not favour any intervention, as was said here; this decision will promote a fundamental aspect of EU integration, namely cooperation between the Member States, and will also promote cooperation on joint training and exercises, and hence on prevention."
"Only when Member States ask one another will there be a possibility of action in specific crisis situations that arise and this will of course have to be assessed by the Member States concerned."
"I also proposed support from the EU budget mainly to stimulate and foster cooperation in this area, as well as to provide some financial support to Member States that need it."
"Finally, I would like to say that it is important to implement, execute and expedite it because crisis situations that threaten our security and hence our freedom in an EU Member State, can arise at any time, any day and undermine the confidence of all the EU's 500 million citizens."
"Mr França, congratulations on your excellent report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. -Together we have been working towards minimising the necessity of special intervention units."
"However good the units and their cooperation are, an ounce of prevention is still better than a pound of cure."
"I believe that the certainty of coordinated and powerful response will go a long way towards making any hostage takers, terrorists or desperate criminals think twice."
"This means that there should be no unnecessary obstacles, no incentives to compromise our security for the sake of procedural rules."
"I think it is possible that the currently envisaged network of bilateral agreements will serve our needs adequately."
"Only close neighbours can guarantee rapid reaction, which mostly goes together with the need for special intervention."
"On the other hand, in the case that several Member States are attacked simultaneously, as is the clear possibility with cyber-attacks, we do need transparency and a certain consistency of arrangements throughout the European Union."
"This report is a part of complex equation, the result of which might change as new data comes in."
"We should not view the current arrangement as permanent one."
"We must be ready to develop this cooperation into a Community policy."
"My congratulations to the rapporteur."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and resumed at 11 a.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday a comment was made by Martin Schulz to another Member here in the House - Hans-Peter Martin - the substance of which was very specific."

"Interpretation of Rule 19(1) (vote)"
"- Before the vote"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, I rise under Rule 170(4) to make the point that this proposal that we are being asked to vote on gives the President of this Parliament such arbitrary and dictatorial powers that no one who believes in democracy would ever even consider it."
"But to be asked to vote on it, when the political groups in this Parliament have not even had time to discuss it, surely cannot be right."
"So I ask that this vote be adjourned to the next part-session in Strasbourg so that people actually get a chance to understand the huge implications of this vote if it is passed."
"Mr Farage, firstly, you are entitled to ask for the matter to be adjourned."
"Nobody is questioning this right."
"We did briefly discuss the substance of the issue yesterday, however, after Mr Hannan asked for leave to speak."
"I would say to you very clearly that the substance of your statement, in which you refer to dictatorial measures, is inappropriate here."
"Accept the majority decision of this Parliament, accept the majority decision of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs!"
"Everything here proceeds properly, according to the law, and you should be good democrats and accept it."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, our Group has discussed this issue very thoroughly."
"We believe that the President should consult the House once again prior to the decision, particularly with regard to how the revised version is worded, since accusations of authoritarian action are completely unjustified."
"Far from it!"
"There is no reason at all in this regard to make use of wording as the last speaker has done."
"Please may we therefore proceed with the vote as you have proposed."
"I was rather too quick."
"A formal proposal has been filed."
"One Member is able to speak in favour of the proposal and one against."
"We have listened to the speaker who is critical of the proposal."
"Someone in favour of it can now speak."
"I assume that Mr Hannan wishes to support Mr Farage."
"For this reason he and he alone now has the floor."
"Please proceed, Mr Hannan."
"Mr President, an absolute majority is not the same as the rule of law."
"I accept that there is a minority in this House in favour of a referendum, and that there is a minority in this House against the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty."
"But this House must nonetheless follow its own rule books."
"And by popular acclamation to discard the rules under which we operate is indeed an act of arbitrary and despotic rule."
"It is only my regard for you, Mr President, and my personal affection for you that prevents me from likening it to the Ermächtigungsgesetz of 1933, which was also voted through by a parliamentary majority."
"I ask this House not to vote on this matter until we have ..."
"(Protests)"
"Mr Hannan, I do believe we ought not to adopt these comparisons."
"(FR) Mr President, I have been patient for several days, for several weeks."
"Now, there are limits."
"We have not yet taken a decision within our group."
"This comment is intolerable."
"We are going to take internal sanctions within the group and I am going to ask for Mr Hannan to be excluded from the group."

"Situation in Iran (vote)"
"- Before the vote"
"(ES) Mr President, I would just like to say that my Group supports the groups that put forward the motion for a joint resolution and will endorse it."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 6"
"Mr President, I am sorry my amendments are being moved in this special way because of technical problems."
"I ask for support in replacing one word. So 'potential military use' would become 'potential military link'."
"(The oral amendment was accepted.)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 9"
"Mr President, it is again very simple."
"The insertion of one word: 'sincere cooperation'."
"(The oral amendment was not accepted.)"
"- Before the vote on Amendment 9"
"Mr President, I regret to announce to the House that Mr Zamel Bawi, whose execution we asked to be stopped, was executed at 4 a.m. yesterday in Karoon prison in Ahwaz."
"Therefore I am moving an oral amendment to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra's existing amendment, on which I hope to obtain his agreement."
"The oral amendment relates to this execution and states that one of the inmates on death row is actually a European citizen, who was kidnapped from Syria."
"The other two are UNHCR refugees who had already obtained asylum in Norway."
"The oral amendment reads as follows: 'Protests vehemently against the execution in Iran on 30 January 2008 at 4 a.m. local time of the Ahwazi activist Zamel Bawi, the 19th Ahwazi activist executed in the last 12 months, and urges the Iranian government to desist from executing the Dutch citizen and human-rights activist Faleh Abdulah al-Mansouri and the UNHCR-registered refugees Rasoul Ali Mazrea and Said Saki, whose resettlement to Norway has been secured, as well as to allow them to proceed to their countries of citizenship or refuge'."
"Then it continues as before: 'calls for the release of the Kurdish journalists Abdolvahed ""Hiwa” Butimar and Adnan Hassanpour who have been sentenced to death'."
"(The oral amendment was accepted.)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 15"
"Mr President, when we mention all forms of torture, I propose inserting 'including extremely inhumane executions' because these occur, particularly executions with torture."
"(The oral amendment was accepted.)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 17"
"Mr President, this relates to existing text."
"The text already 'calls for minorities to be able to exercise all rights granted by the Iranian Constitution'."
"But even rights according to their own Constitution are not granted."
"So I propose the last part of the text should begin 'urges the Iranian authorities to act constitutionally and eliminate, in law and in practice, all forms of discrimination'."
"The rest would be unchanged."
"Thus they should act according to their own Constitution, which is not respected."
"(The oral amendment was accepted.)"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 19"
"Mr President, I agree to withdraw this oral amendment because it is complementary to the consensus that has already been agreed."
"Paragraph 19 is about disregard by the Council and Commission of the ruling of the European Court."
"It has already been agreed in a compromise, so I agree to withdraw it."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 3"
"(ES) Mr President, in a resolution of this political importance we are convinced that it is very helpful to have as much support and agreement in the House as possible."
"With this in mind, we are proposing an oral amendment that would remove any value judgment from the original amendment and would make it a simple reference to a specific fact, which we could call a 'relevant fact' relating to the subject of the resolution, but, I repeat, eliminating any value judgment in order to achieve maximum support from the House."
"The oral amendment would replace the text of the amendment with the following: 'notes the judgment of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 12 December 2006.'"
"In other words, a simple mention, with no value judgment, of a relevant fact."
"(The oral amendment was accepted.)"
"- Before the vote on Recital C"
"Mr President, I apologise."
"A technical problem caused my amendments to appear in such a special way."
"I am not such an enfant terrible as to torture you here."
"But anyway, as they are tabled, I have to present them now."
"It is about the implementation of the additional protocol which Iran was urged to implement at the earliest possible date."
"My proposal is to add 'which is not yet the case'."
"(The oral amendment was not accepted.)"
"- Before the vote on Recital H"
"Mr President, there is a very unpleasant use of cranes for public hangings, especially hangings including torture."
"So it is my proposal to insert after the words 'often by public hanging': 'for which cranes provided by Western companies are used'."
"We are not pleased by it."
"I imagine nobody is pleased at this."
"(The oral amendment was not accepted.)"
"- After Recital R"
"Mr President, this is an important amendment on which I ask for the attention of the House, because our own people and the citizens of the EU are endangered by some activities."
"So, a new recital: 'whereas several EU Member States are participants in an international action to build democracy in Iraq and defend its people from terrorists trained and supplied also by outside powers, including Iran, which means that servicemen from EU Member States - citizens of the EU - are suffering losses and injuries caused by terrorist attacks to which Iran is not unconnected'."
"Please give your support."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"Mr President, you will have to excuse the fact that I have lost my voice."
"I wish to state that I voted in favour of this interpretation and I want to say that Mr Hannan's comparison, while pretending not to make it, of our vote with Hitler's Ermächtigungsgesetz of 1933 was an absolutely disgraceful comparison."
"But such a ludicrous comparison just shows the state of mind of the person making it."
"We have simply confirmed, in accordance with our rules, that Rule 19 of our Rules of Procedure already gives the President of Parliament the right to bring an end to successive uses of points of order, procedural motions etc., 'where the President is convinced that these are manifestly intended to cause and will result in a prolonged and serious obstruction of the procedures of the House or the rights of other Members'."
"This is not stifling debate."
"We have ample speaking time in debates, shared out proportionally to every group in accordance with their size."
"This is simply a safeguard against those who are trying to disrupt this House."
"The powers that our President has are far less than what exists in most national parliaments, if you take the Speaker of the House of Commons, for instance."
"We are right to take that safeguard measure, and I note that the former leader of Mr Hannan's party, a member of our committee, actually voted in favour of that, so his attitude is disgraceful."
"(FR) Ladies and gentlemen, the rule is as follows."
"When explanations of vote have begun on a subject, in principle - and I say in principle - the President does not accept any more speakers on that subject but, in view of the sensitivity and the subject, I propose to depart from this rule and allow all Members who have asked to speak to do so."
"- (PL) Mr President, in view of the fact that the first roll-call vote on a change to the Rules of Procedure was not reflected in our documents, a certain error has crept in."
"I am speaking here on my own behalf, and also on behalf of Mr Czarnecki and Mr Libicki."
"We voted in favour of Mr Farage's request by raising our hands, and we thought that the roll-call vote also related to this, and a mistake came about here."
"We therefore wish to correct this here verbally. At the same time we are electronically registering a change in our vote to the counter-proposal."
"- (PL) Mr President, the same question: we here, in a group of several Members, voted against our own convictions; we should in fact have voted against this amendment to the Rules of Procedure, which is a distinctly non-democratic amendment; here in the heart of democratic Europe a rule is being introduced which hands absolute power to the President of Parliament."
"Such far-reaching solutions are not present in any democratic Parliament, so we wished to vote against this, but owing to the mistake referred to by Mr Piotrowski, we voted in favour of it."
"This concerns Bogdan Pęk, Dariusz Grabowski and Andrzej Zapałowski."
"- (PL) Mr President, as the previous speaker said, I too am asking for my vote on the Rules of Procedure to be changed."
"I voted out of line with my own convictions, so please could this be altered."
"I am against the change to the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, may I thank you for your very wise interpretation of your new powers in allowing us to make explanations of vote even if we did not put our name down for this report?"
"May I also thank you for allowing Mr Corbett an extra half a minute to make a political aside that might not have been truly relevant to the subject of the matter?"
"I just rise to say that I really do think this is an aberration of our Rules of Procedure."
"I am very concerned about it."
"I have been in communication with the Presidency, and I hope the Presidency respects the views of the minority of this Parliament."
"Mr Corbett made the statement that we had the opportunity to rise within debates in this House because all groups get speaking time."
"Alas, as we have seen today, sometimes some groups are not as tolerant of different views as others."
"It is very difficult to get speaking time for those Members that might express a minority view in a big group."
"Thank you very much indeed for allowing us to make this point."
"- (PL) Mr President, I too was led astray."
"I thought we were checking the previous vote."
"I am definitely against this interpretation of Article 19, which ranks procedural matters above principles and rights, particularly freedom of speech."
"Mr President, thank you very much for showing discretion on this matter and allowing me to take the floor to offer my explanation of vote."
"I did understand what I was voting for on this issue, and I clearly voted against."
"I understand that some people in this House interpret the Rules and I understand that to mean that we are within our Rules on this."
"But what I would say is that we always have to be very careful about giving arbitrary powers to a chairman or a president."
"I am sure that the President and the Vice-Presidents of this current Parliament will use these powers with extreme caution, and I am sure we welcome that."
"But what of future presidents?"
"What of future chairmen who choose to interpret these rules as they see fit, to frown upon dissent and to suppress it?"
"We have to be careful that this is not a slippery slope, or perceived to be a slippery slope, to dictatorship, rather than a diversity of views."
"Therefore, I say to everyone, the true test of a democracy is how you treat your minorities, and, if you treat your minorities well, then we can all be agreed that this is a true democracy."
"(DE) Mr President, I have never so far used the word 'dictatorial' in connection with the European institutions despite all my criticism over the years."
"I think and am convinced that what has become possible today owing to this unbelievably far-reaching empowerment of the President is opening the floodgates to despotism."
"We cannot always assume - and certainly not in this House - that the President will always act in an even-handed and well-balanced manner."
"As a result of the decision that was made here and against which I voted, of course, the President now has unbelievable arbitrary power and this Parliament will therefore be able to mutate into an arbitrary Parliament."
"The citizens of Europe do not deserve this!"
"I believe it has quite clearly gone beyond a rift here and this will lead to major democratic problems."
"Mr President, I am sorry."
"I was temporarily delayed by a colleague."
"We were discussing democracy: a very important concept that I am sure we all support in this House, even though we do not always act that way."
"I understand about the amendments to this report in terms of cooperation between the different special intervention units, but we have to remember that this is actually an amendment to the Prüm Treaty."
"The British Conservatives originally opposed the Prüm Treaty."
"The reason that we opposed it was because, initially, it was an agreement on cooperation between a limited number of Member States."
"Under the presidency of one of the Member States, they decided to extend this provision without proper consultation."
"Even the European Data Protection Supervisor had to submit his own opinion after he realised he was not consulted."
"We as Conservatives are against the use of rapid border intervention units and the implementation of the Prüm Treaty, and we did not support the amendments to this Treaty."
"Mr President, my Irish PPE-DE colleagues now fully support the liberalisation of the postal services within the Union, and we voted accordingly."
"We do so knowing that universal service is guaranteed to all citizens within the Union, and that specific measures have been taken to ensure that rural and sparsely populated areas are served by an adequate number of postal outlets."
"(GA) Mr President, I should also like to stress that it is equally important to have postal services for the visually impaired and the blind."
"My Irish EPP-ED colleagues and myself appeal to all Member States to maintain readily available nationwide postal services or to set up such services in countries where they are not provided at present."
"(CS) Mr Chairman, today, after many years, our discussions have come to an end and we have agreed to provide all citizens of the European Union with a fully open market in postal services."
"This is an important milestone on the road towards a single postal services market and does not threaten public services."
"I am glad that we have reached a sensible compromise, for example postal deliveries to remote areas are preserved."
"Furthermore, the Directive does not prevent the Member States from maintaining a number of exceptional measures, for example free postal services for partially sighted persons, although today Parliament rejected a specific article in this regard."
"The advent of new electronic means of communications is having a fundamental influence on changes to the structure of the demand for postal services; liberalisation will thus lead to a better, and in particular more flexible, response to a wider range of services for postal items."
"I believe that this will also result in lower prices in return for more efficient services and I congratulate us on this compromise."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, I regret very much that Amendment 3, identical to Amendment 18, concerning free postal services for blind or partially sighted people, was not incorporated in the Ferber report."
"Being blind or partially sighted is a disability that makes it impossible to see the world through one's eyes."
"However, I believe that these people will hear the 321 voices of those Members who voted for this amended Directive with their hearts."
"Since the Directive was adopted at second reading, I believe that the Member States will, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, solve this problem to the satisfaction of people who are blind or partially sighted."
"Mr President, before I became a Member of the European Parliament, I had a real job."
"One job I had was advising companies on the newly liberalised industries - the telecoms industry, the postal industry (to a limited extent) and the energy industry."
"What we saw in telecoms liberalisation was an explosion in choice."
"We saw an explosion in innovation."
"We saw competition leading to lower prices and consumers and businesses across Europe, which led to great innovation and great choice for all consumers."
"Let us hope that, with this directive, what we will now see is the same sort of market discipline that was applied to the telecom sector spread to the postal sector; that we will enjoy a spread of wealth, innovation and better services right across Europe; and that, at the end of the day, it will be the consumer who wins."
"Mr President, I would like to associate my comments with the latter part of Mr Kamall's statement because I truly believe that liberalisation in the postal services market is the way forward for innovation and consumer choice."
"I have a significant problem, though, with the definition of universal services and how that is applied to rural services."
"Earlier this week, in my own constituency in the UK, there was an announcement that seven post offices would close."
"This was after a massive consultation."
"Some of these post offices were profitable."
"The consultation reports stated that nearly 100% of people were in favour of keeping these post offices open."
"However, because of a definition of what service was required by government, the consultation turned into a sham, everybody was ignored."
"Rural services will be decimated in places like Staverton, Hellidon, Brington and Harlestone, and Milton Malsor in my constituency."
"So I am very concerned about the implementation of this directive within Member States."
"(SK) Mr President, I should like it to be recorded that I wanted to vote for the motion for a resolution on the situation in Iran, only I did not hear the interpretation properly at the time of the roll-call vote and in the final vote I did not press my voting button."
"(CS) Mr Chairman, I am convinced that humans should reduce their negative impact on the climate of this planet."
"Not only the Union but the whole world must be included in the process of slowing down climatic change."
"That is why in our development policy we must strive to achieve more efficient tools and provide help to developing countries in such a way that will enable them to adjust to the impact of climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"This is one of the next important tasks we are facing, tasks highlighted in today's resolution on the Bali Conference."
"(SK) Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to say that as an owner of a small hydropower plant I do know what production of electricity from renewable sources means."
"Unfortunately, I also know a lot about the problems, often artificially created, faced by people who want to produce and distribute energy in this way."
"I also own a somewhat old family home."
"I carried out extensive renovations of this house in 2001, using my own funds, in order to achieve a higher standard of energy efficiency."
"I know that a kilowatt saved is as good as a kilowatt produced."
"I welcome the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency (and I supported it with my vote) for many of the reasons stated here."
"That said, I very much regret that the European Commission as well as many governments of the Member States are guilty of neglecting energy-saving measures and continuously underestimating their strategic importance and the need to make them a political priority."
"(CS) Mr Chairman, I welcome the report on the Action Plan for Energy Efficiency."
"It calls for financial support in order to introduce as soon as possible leading-edge technologies that help to save the environment."
"It will also result in less dependency on energy supply from the East."
"The emission permit trading system is nevertheless controversial."
"It could fulfil its purpose if the individual countries of the Union were starting from the same place."
"Special conditions must apply to the less-developed economies, such as the Czech economy."
"It is also necessary to provide support to improve the energy efficiency of newly constructed buildings."
"This may be the most efficient way of reversing the trend because year after year the increase in energy consumption is still higher than the savings made by applying energy-saving technologies, and this will continue in the future."
"The public-private partnership will support research into, and practical application of, energy-saving technologies in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy."
"The requirement for appliances to be labelled with energy-related information must not be a bureaucratic burden on manufacturers and the information must not misguide consumers."
"Mr President, unlike the previous colleague who spoke, I do not own my own power station, but I do own a very old house - an 1840s house - and it is a wonderful house."
"If you are ever in London, you are most welcome to drop in for a cup of tea."
"But what I would like to say is that, whatever one feels about climate change, I think we can all be in favour of the need for energy efficiency."
"You may not realise this, but I represent London, the greatest city in the world, capital of the greatest country in the world."
"We have a number of office blocks and buildings that leave their lights on at night."
"That is a sign of success, but they should be aware of energy efficiency."
"We also have a number of establishments for the hospitality industry - restaurants and pubs - and recently, due to smoking bans, they have been forced to use patio heaters to accommodate their customers who wish to sit outside and have a cigarette."
"What worries me is that it is a completely disproportionate measure to ban the use of these patio heaters, which contribute less than 0.1% to CO2 emissions."
"So let us get this in context."
"We all need better energy efficiency, but let us have solutions that are workable."
"Mr President, like everyone in this House I know the statistics that are commonly available, that prove that we could save ourselves a ton of energy and a ton of problems in the future if we were more efficient about the way we use energy."
"I did not vote on this report, because I forgot to make a declaration of interest - of financial interest, no less."
"Under paragraph 22, it calls for getting rid of fixed-cost systems by which people buy their energy, be it electricity or gas."
"I have signed up to a fixed-cost system in the United Kingdom."
"I signed up to it because it is easy to budget for my energy bills, and millions of people - generally poor people - in the United Kingdom do exactly the same thing."
"I think limiting their choice in this matter is a retrograde step."
"I also think we should be very savvy as to what we have called for in the past in this place and how we act."
"We talk about energy efficiency and energy saving, yet we still have trade difficulties with China - a massive tax on imports of energy-efficient light bulbs from that country."
"So we are being very two-faced in passing this report and not acting on those sorts of measures."
"Mr President, I rise on this report because I absolutely despise the Common Fisheries Policy and the ecological disaster that it has caused for my country and the waters around it."
"There are many good things in this report because it aims to cut down on the amount of fish that are disposed of, that are caught and not needed, or for which fishermen do not have the appropriate quota."
"But this does not sort out the root of the problem, in that this is a policy that deserves to be consigned to the rubbish bin."
"It does not conserve fish, it does not help fishermen, and in fact many fishermen in my country think it would be best to get rid of it."
"There are plenty of examples around the world where fisheries policy aids conservation and keeps fishermen in jobs and doing what they want to do."
"Iceland has transferable quotas that become the property of the fishermen and their families and which can be transferred throughout generations."
"We are not being wise enough or clever enough in this policy, and we should just get rid of it."
"(SK) Mr Chairman, the 12 million Roma people who are scattered all over Europe also have a place in our current multicultural society."
"Europe must respond to the often complex problems of the Roma community."
"That is why it is necessary to propose a complex approach to their solution."
"Since I firmly believe that education and consequent career progression can break the vicious circle of discrimination against the Roma, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution."
"The EQUAL programme, which focuses on support for marginalised groups, has proved that it has a good practical use."
"It is important to appreciate the activities of associations, notably the work of the Kolping Society, which has set up consultation centres offering long-term unemployed people assistance with finding work."
"There is the danger that these important activities could come to a halt in Slovakia because of delayed re-financing of implemented activities."
"I would call for the removal of all obstacles that lead to the insolvency of non-profit-making associations and local authorities, thus making the implementation of further projects impossible."
"I believe that the Commission will be more careful in monitoring national strategies and will harmonise, using the best methods, the joint progress of the Member States in cooperation with international and Roma organisations."
"(NL) Mr President, I voted against the resolution, as this text has all the obnoxious characteristics typical of the texts adopted here with respect to discrimination."
"There has to be a framework strategy, there has to be a special task force to coordinate this framework strategy, presumably yet more staff need to be recruited for it, and so on."
"It goes without saying that the Roma must be able to enjoy their fundamental rights as EU citizens, and that it is unacceptable if they cannot, but this resolution is another case of over-involvement."
"The Roma should also be encouraged to take responsibility themselves, an aspect that has been completely overlooked here."
"The amendments tabled by Mrs Angelilli were justified."
"Problems such as forced marriages and the disadvantaged position of women and children have to be solved within the Roma communities themselves."
"It really is no help if we continue to say that all the problems these people face have to do with discrimination."
"They must also be encouraged to face up to their own responsibilities."
"(CS) (The beginning of the speech was inaudible) Each Member State faces issues concerning the Roma community that cannot be solved quickly."
"That is why I do not like the fact that the resolution, which is an articulate document but only general in nature, mentions only one concrete example: the Czech Republic, and more precisely the concentration camp in Lety."
"I supported the general resolution in spite of this but I have one objection."
"The Commission is urged to end pig fattening on the site of the former Roma concentration camp, which is inappropriate - in my opinion, too - and to help erect a dignified memorial."
"I would also call on the Commission to provide sufficient funds to help the Czech Republic to cope with this situation."
"Given that the European Parliament only mentions the Czech Republic as a concrete example, I believe that this should become a priority for the European Commission and its financial resources."
"(DE) Mr President, the proposal adopted today is a further, if still somewhat tentative, step towards a genuine strategy for integrating the Roma."
"Parliament has today called for the pig breeding activities in the former concentration camp in Lety to be relocated, as it did three years ago, in order to set up a memorial there."
"This practical example once again shows how inadequate the current measures have been."
"Socio-political efforts there, as in many other European countries, leave a lot to be desired."
"A genuine integration of the Roma into our society would be actual proof of the fact that the cornerstones of democracy, the rule of law and human rights still form the basis of the European Community."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - The way the Parliament conducts votes is sloppy, and this ruling will make it worse."
"This means that the rights of minorities have been curtailed."
"Minorities will find it harder within the Parliament to ensure that votes are credible."
"We must recognise that some Vice-Presidents are considerably better than others."
"In any case, I am of the view that the 'electronic votes for everything' policy was working pretty well."
"It means MEPs need to be in their seats and paying attention (and, let's face it, many do not) and the lack of checks and challenges to the ruling of the Chair mean that sessions are actually going pretty smoothly, and all votes are recorded for posterity so our electors can see, on the record, how individual members vote."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my British fellow Member Michael Cashman at first reading according to the codecision procedure, on the simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition by Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia of certain documents as equivalent to their national visas for the purposes of transit through their territories."
"I approve the amendments by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs aimed at taking into account the new situation that exists in the Schengen area and the fact that, as of 21 December 2007, many of the countries at which the measure was directed are members of the Schengen area with no internal borders."
"in writing. - (IT) I was rapporteur for the Committee on Development on the 'Crossing external borders' report and therefore welcome with satisfaction the excellent work done by my colleague Mr Cashman."
"In 2008, the 1957 dream took another step forward: the European family formally enlarged its borders."
"Other frontiers fell and the 'Schengen area' became decidedly larger, with obvious positive implications."
"However, it is important that, beyond the physical and geographical sphere, we make more effort in the political and economic fields."
"In many areas, the 27 Member States still have different set-ups today; in some cases, they are very far apart: in too many areas there is not even basic synergy and the picture that emerges from this is completely fragmented."
"The European Union must implement procedures for a synthesis of Member State policies and strategies: we welcome freedom of movement of people and goods, but we stress even more strongly the need to create a political and regulatory framework that in the end is homogeneous."
"The report being put to the vote today is crucial for simplifying the control of persons at the EU's external borders."
"Under the new regulations, visas issued by Poland and the new Member States confer the same rights as those issued by the rest of the Member States."
"This means that citizens of Ukraine, for example, will be able to move throughout the EU with a visa issued by Poland."
"I would also like to point out that this report is a form of response to the enlargement of the Schengen area, which facilitates the transit of individuals from third countries within the EU."
"One positive aspect I recognise is the strengthening of action within the EU to combat the smuggling and trafficking of narcotics, trafficking in people, human organs and illegal arms and terrorism."
"In this respect I am categorically in favour of Michael Cashman's report."
"The aim of this initiative is for Cyprus and the two countries that joined the EU in 2007 - Romania and Bulgaria - to be able to introduce a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders, based on the unilateral equivalence of visas and residence permits."
"This recognition is limited to transit through the territory of these three Member States for a period of up to five days."
"I firmly support this simplified regime since third country nationals holding a visa issued by another Member State who would benefit from this system, have already been subject to a strict screening process in that Member State and were not considered a threat to public order or a risk in terms of illegal immigration."
"These rules on the unilateral recognition of visas and residence permits were introduced for the first time into the Community acquis on visas in 2006, with the aim of simplifying the transit of certain categories of persons and, at the same time, avoiding unnecessary administrative burdens on consular offices."
"For the nine countries that joined the EU in 2004 and became fully integrated into the Schengen area from 21 December 2007, mutual recognition of these documents became mandatory at the end of the transitional period."
"As in the case of the report on Switzerland and Liechtenstein, we believe it is important to stress that, in general, these agreements should be made in a broader framework that also aims to promote the rights of immigrant workers and to protect them against the appalling phenomenon of exploitation, by fostering the effective exercise of their rights and their integration, for example, guaranteeing the right to family reunification, applying the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families - we would stress that it has yet to be ratified by any EU Member State - drafted under the auspices of the UN, an international legal instrument that aims to safeguard the defence of the human rights of migrant workers, particularly the unalienable right to family life."
"In other words, facilitating the movement of citizens between the various countries should not be used as a means of facilitating the exploitation of cheap temporary labour that is easily 'discarded', of increasing exploitation and pressure on wages, of promoting precarious conditions, of deregulating labour relations, fuelling a retrograde step in terms of workers' rights and social conditions as a whole, but rather to combat such phenomena."
"in writing. - (DE) It is an open secret that an enormous potential threat emanates from many eastern states; organised gang crime, prostitution, people trafficking and drug-related offences are all too often controlled by the East."
"And many of our new Member States are regarded as transit countries, from which people can converge on Western Europe."
"Tighter controls at the EU's eastern external borders are therefore long overdue to ensure that the abolition of the Schengen borders does not degenerate into a 'free ticket for criminals'."
"For this reason I too have voted in favour of the Cashman report."
"I voted against this report."
"I have already expressed my fundamental reservations about the Schengen system time and again in the past, and so cannot accept today the principle of mutual recognition contained in the report."
"Schengen naturally stands or falls by the watertight control of its external borders."
"Commission President Barroso can tell us a thousand times that Schengen enlargement will not lead to a decrease in security, but the reality is quite different."
"For example, German security experts in Chancellor Merkel's entourage note enormous weaknesses in the new eastern external borders and also in cooperation between the national police forces."
"The widespread fear is that illegal immigration will increase considerably."
"Once again, the enlightened souls of Euroland are engaging in wishful thinking and playing with the security of European citizens."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted for the report by my excellent Cypriot colleague Panayiotis Demetriou, at first reading under the codecision procedure, on amending the 2006 decision establishing a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition by the Member States of certain residence permits issued by Switzerland and Liechtenstein for the purpose of transit through their territory."
"I also approve the technical amendments proposed by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in order to align the text with the original provisions in particular as regards the territorial provisions."
"in writing. - (PT) As we have pointed out, the measures and agreements that facilitate the movement of citizens from different countries should be based on principles of balance and mutual advantages for the various parties concerned."
"We would recall the earlier agreements between the EC and Switzerland on the free movement of persons, which were of particular interest to Portugal, since more than 100 000 Portuguese work in that country, including many thousands of seasonal workers."
"These agreements should help to resolve many limitations and problems facing Portuguese workers in Switzerland, for example, with regard to changes of job or profession, family reunification, relocation to another canton, or the social protection of workers and their families."
"In this sense, and in general, these agreements should be part of a broader framework that also aims to promote the rights of immigrant workers and protect them against the appalling phenomenon of exploitation."
"Facilitating the movement of citizens between the various countries should not be used as a means of facilitating the exploitation of cheap temporary labour that is easily 'discarded', undermining labour relations, and in particular fuelling a retrograde step in terms of workers' rights and social conditions."
"in writing. - (PT) This proposal by the European Commission aims to improve and simplify the relevant legislation which dates back 10 years."
"Over the past decade, aquaculture has been the fastest growing sector of the agri-food industry and European aquaculture currently provides more than 80 000 jobs."
"The growing importance of the sector, in both economic and social terms, warrants an improvement in the information made available."
"Thus the aim is to improve data collection and transmission."
"It is also fundamental to harmonise data between Member States."
"I have therefore decided to vote in favour of this proposal, as enhanced by the amendments introduced by the European Parliament."
"in writing. - (PT) The rise, especially in the past decade, of terrorist threats and attacks, along with their devastating consequences, has led to a pressing need to introduce the necessary measures and instruments to face up to this scourge."
"This is a common threat requiring a global response - one that provides the means, resources and specialist knowledge to deal effectively with major crisis situations that a Member State would have difficulty tackling alone."
"This initiative by the Austrian Presidency allows joint support teams to be set up that must be capable of providing a Member State with any necessary operational assistance following a terrorist attack."
"I have no doubt that this type of major crisis situation requires a rapid response by special intervention units."
"I therefore support this Decision that aims to establish the necessary legal framework, simplifying such cooperation and allowing Member States to respond more quickly in crisis situations or terrorist attacks, while ensuring that the affected Member State receives the highest possible level of help."
"in writing. - (FR) This text, on the initiative of Austria, provides for the possibility of a Member State asking for the assistance of a special intervention unit of another Member State to control a crisis situation (hostage taking, hijacking, etc.)."
"The help provided could consist either of the provision of equipment or specific expertise, or of the possibility of conducting an operation on the territory of the Member State requiring it."
"We are in favour of this text, for various reasons."
"Firstly because this arrangement, aimed at fighting terrorism, is not binding because it does not force Member States either to ask for assistance or to grant it."
"Furthermore, the text states that all the practical arrangements (types of unit, equipment, etc.) will be laid down in bilateral agreements between the requesting Member State and the requested Member State."
"In the context of the fight against terrorism, which by definition knows no borders, it is indeed very important to strive for the most effective cooperation between national police forces in the EU."
"At a time when all justice and home affairs matters of Member States are soon going to fall within supranational competence under the Treaty of Lisbon, a kernel of intergovernmental resistance seems to remain: we are very glad about this."
"in writing. - (PT) In the field of civil liberties, justice and home affairs, the EU has been treading a very dangerous path that is seriously jeopardising the rights, freedoms and safeguards of citizens and the very sovereignty of States and peoples."
"The EU's growing federalist and militarist tendencies and measures have been responsible for the taking of decisions designed to establish structures, in terms of both information and police task forces, with powers to intervene on national territory, in a move that actually aims to overlap the national police."
"The actual aim of this initiative by Austria, ably aggravated by the EP's proposals, is to set up or allow the formation, on the pretext of 'terrorism' and hypothetical 'crisis or risk situations', of real 'praetorian guards', duly indoctrinated, to take part in particular in the control, intimidation or repression of the exercise of rights and freedoms, in violation of the basic principles of democracy, the rule of law and the very constitutional legality and national sovereignty of Portugal."
"We therefore warn against the dangers involved in the content and objectives of this initiative, and of any other measures relating to the exercise of any form of unlimited, irrational, disproportionate and unconstitutional power."
"in writing. - (SV) I voted against the report because I am uneasy over what it will mean for the future."
"I am not opposed to pitching in and helping each other in crisis situations, but it must happen as and when required and in a natural way."
"I do not think it is justified to have joint exercises at EU taxpayers' expense, and I am absolutely opposed to foreign agents operating and exercising authority on Swedish territory with retained immunity."
"The logical consequence is a development towards a common police force, to which I am entirely opposed."
"in writing. - (FR) The text before us is attempting to give a legal framework to operations carried out by special intervention units of one Member State sent to the territory of another, in the event of a terrorist attack."
"Because these interventions can be so diverse (exchange of equipment, expertise, active units, etc.), it is left up to the Member States to conclude bilateral agreements to define the practical arrangements and to decide whether to accept or refuse the request for intervention on their territory of one of these operational units."
"Unbelievable."
"Finally, here is a real case of the application of that controversial and complicated principle of subsidiarity!"
"Finally, here is an area - that of national security, the sovereign area par excellence - that is resisting the supranational bulldozer of a Europe that legislates on everything, everywhere."
"For effectiveness in the fight against terrorism, then, Europe is putting its money on cooperation between national police forces."
"We support this initiative."
"But the key to victory over terrorism does not lie solely in cooperation."
"It requires an awareness of the revolutionary desire of Islamists, who advocate the destruction of humanist and Christian Western society and its values."
"in writing. - (SV) We voted for the report because it is based on voluntary action and cooperation such as can only be brought about by a reciprocal agreement between two Member States."
"However, we hold to the principle that foreign agents should not be allowed to operate or exercise authority on Swedish territory with retained immunity."
"We can see this leading to the possible development of a common police force, about which we have serious misgivings."
"in writing. - (CS) Allow me an explanatory remark concerning voting on the report on the European Research Area."
"The European Research Area, discussed here endlessly, is a very good idea and a very good vision."
"However, there is still a long way to go before it becomes a reality."
"Talking is not enough."
"We also have to assess how it functions and indeed whether it functions at all."
"Being a Member of this Parliament who represents a new country, I know from my own experience that at this stage the European Research Area is only an illusion and wishful thinking."
"The first available data on the priority given to projects involving new Member States demonstrates this."
"Out of 559 subsidies approved under the grant for young scientists, only two went to the Czech Republic (none whatsoever went to Poland, which is several times bigger!), while over 100 went to the United Kingdom and 80 to Germany."
"It is difficult to believe that the difference in the quality of the projects was big enough to justify such numbers."
"Of course, the lack of experience of the people submitting projects in the new Member States is partly to blame."
"At any rate, this indicates that so far the European Research Area has not been functioning as it should."
"We therefore need less talk and more action to achieve tangible results."
"It must be said that in this regard we are still lagging behind."
"This report contains some contradictions and positions that we do not endorse."
"However, it is true that scientific research must go back to its main mission: the creation of new knowledge."
"The truth is that there is no linear relationship between R&D and innovation, though there are certain correlations, but they are complex and have to do with areas well outside the realm of science."
"The perception of research as a sort of panacea to solve all economic and social problems therefore needs to be corrected, and more needs to be invested in research."
"Some steps taken at the Lisbon European Council in 2000 were a reaction to the concerns about Europe's underinvestment in the knowledge economy, and this was further reinforced at the Barcelona European Council in 2002, where the EU set itself the objective of reaching an R&D intensity of 3 per cent by 2010."
"However, the growth in its R&D spending since 2000 has been insufficient, averaging only 1.84%, partly borne by industry."
"Private sector investment in research is lower than the socially optimum level."
"States must play a central role and develop cooperation to make it possible to create new knowledge, making it available to society as a whole."
"I fully support the report on the European Research Area, which outlines new prospects for research and development in the European Union."
"There is no doubt that progress and social development, as well as Europe's place in the globalised world, depend on investment in science and research, and on the development of new knowledge that meets the needs of the 21st century."
"Scientific research and new technologies do, after all, have a direct impact on social development, and they can even be crucial to economic growth, as they bring measurable benefits."
"A good and effective system of scientific research management at European level is therefore essential."
"Moreover, if we want Europe to rise to the new challenges, especially those of economic competition and environmental protection, we must appeal to Member States; we must in fact orient them towards a regular increase in expenditure on scientific research."
"in writing. - (SK) The Commission has presented us with the Green Paper on the European Research Area at a time when Europe faces an unending transatlantic drain of investment and qualified researchers."
"If we want European research to become globally competitive, and this is one of the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, then the Union must overcome the fundamental obstacles it faces in this area."
"In this respect I am thinking especially of the fragmentation of research in the EU and poorly developed European strategies in the area of scientific cooperation, the lack of human and material resources, and poorly developed research infrastructures, which have a hard time competing with global research centres."
"Added to this is the low mobility of scientists, expert knowledge and experience, caused primarily by legal, administrative and linguistic barriers."
"In the course of developing the European Research Area and surmounting its fragmented nature we must pay considerable attention to our regions."
"The regions should devise strategies for the development of human and material resources in the area of research and should promote access to research for everyone, especially female researchers and the young."
"The Member States should become more involved in the process of creating better working conditions for researchers and adopt measures that would allow them to reconcile their professional and family lives."
"The regions are equally important in promoting and ensuring more efficient ways of funding research, in accordance with the commitments made in the Operational Programmes."
"The regions should also help to develop European centres of excellence that fall within their territorial spheres of activity, by establishing links between universities, research institutes and industry."
"in writing. - (SK) Ladies and gentlemen, no one doubts any more that science is the catalyst behind the development of our society."
"The present world trend points at the importance of science and demands that it be given adequate importance in society."
"Only investment in a knowledge-based society will make the Union competitive, creative and strategically attractive."
"In the Green Paper 'The European Research Area: New Perspectives', the Commission offers an analysis and solutions and it also highlights the importance of creating a knowledge-based society."
"The European Parliament underlined, in the report by rapporteur Umberto Guidoni, that investment in education, science, research, culture and IT results in sustainable development for the future."
"Of course we have to realise that these steps will not bring immediate and tangible results."
"This is a marathon not a sprint, but I am sure that we will succeed in the end."
"The European Research Area gives the research institutes, universities and scientists of the 27 EU countries the opportunity to cooperate."
"Cross-border administrative obstacles that hinder cooperation between scientific institutes nevertheless still exist."
"Opening up the European Union towards the East means significant enlargement of the European Research Area and offers approximately 150 000 researchers new opportunities to improve their scientific and technical potential."
"I am convinced that new concepts and innovation in all areas will help us to create new job opportunities and find new ways of protecting the environment, improving food safety and health, and ensuring safer infinite sources of energy."
"in writing. - (PT) The idea that research, development and innovation are fundamental to competitiveness is not new and is still current."
"Aside from differences of opinion over the need to direct efforts towards innovation or towards more academic research, it is clear that Europe needs to improve its investment in knowledge and the practical application of that knowledge."
"But this need is not merely a matter of financial investment."
"Various successive reports relate the many reasons why Europe lags behind other parts of the world."
"From American universities to Indian research, we are surrounded by fierce and growing competition."
"On the other hand, European tertiary institutions are less attractive, as these reports also demonstrate, consistently referring, among other things, to poor funding overall and per capita, and our universities' lack of autonomy as factors inhibiting better performance."
"For all these reasons, any approach that frames this as an urgent economic and strategic issue merits our approval."
"And while it is true that time is against us, it is also true that it is better to spend time selecting the right options than to take hurried and ineffective decisions."
"In view of the cancellation of the debate on Mr Guidoni's report on the European Research Area, as the rapporteur for the Socialist Group I would like to explain the reasons why we voted in favour of it."
"First of all I should mention the good work done by Mr Guidoni, which includes many of our proposals."
"A European research area should certainly include:"
"a single labour market for researchers, which means establishing a single European career path in the field of research and an integrated information system for jobs and training contracts;"
"making the recruitment and promotion procedures more open, with a better balance between men and women on boards;"
"removing barriers to mobility and promoting greater participation of women in R&D, with measures to reconcile professional and private life;"
"strengthening research institutions and the participation of SMEs in R&D;"
"greater coordination with national and regional programmes, and more synergies with other European programmes;"
"building infrastructures exploited by joint European ventures; and"
"encouraging international cooperation, promoting multilateral initiatives, exchanges to use infrastructures and scientific cooperation programmes for development."
"These are necessary and coherent ways to move forward, which is why we voted in favour."
"in writing. - (FR) Science knows no boundaries, and the questions at the root of research are increasingly global in nature."
"The European Research Area (ERA) must ensure scientific and technological cooperation contributes effectively to the stability, safety and prosperity of humanity."
"So I hope that the ERA, from the point of view of its openness to the world, will favour the EU's outermost regions (ORs), in order to make the most of the advantages and riches offered by Europe's regional diversity, by incorporating them coherently into research programmes in the context of 'networks of excellence'."
"I would also urge the ERA to recognise the importance of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT), which are valuable partners in establishing bridges between nations and continents within the perspective of sustainable global development, in order to meet the challenges facing the planet."
"I sincerely thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for supporting my amendment on this matter contained in the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development."
"This is additional proof of the spirit of coordination and complementarity that reigns in our Parliament."
"in writing. - (EL) We oppose the reactionary restructuring of the field of research that is being promoted in the EU's basic guidelines for the creation of a European Research Area (ERA) within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The ERA is encouraging conflict and competition for profit between countries and large business groups."
"As a result, inequalities in scientific development will be intensified."
"Incentives, subsidies and tax exemptions are increased for monopoly companies, allowing them to invest in and make use of the results for themselves."
"The public sector is subordinated to the needs of the monopoly groups it serves."
"The mobility of researchers between companies, universities and research centres is being promoted and the European patent system is being supported on the grounds of cost."
"Everything is being subordinated to competitiveness and the rise in profitability."
"In such a harshly competitive environment, which is present even in the world of research, attention will inevitably focus on the well-known 'centres of excellence' of the powerful nations. These centres will secure the lion's share of the research programmes, which will be channels for public and private funds."
"We are striving to overturn the EU's research policy. This is part of our struggle for the complete reversal of the anti-popular policy upheld by the EU and by capitalism."
"We hope to restore the social nature of science: research and science should serve today's popular needs and social welfare."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption at second reading of the Council common position amending the Postal Directive of 1997 and aimed at full accomplishment of the internal market of postal services, and I congratulate my excellent German colleague Markus Ferber for the immense job he has done."
"I am delighted that the Council has accepted all the major elements of the European Parliament's position, particularly the postponement of the deadline for market opening to 31 December 2010 with a two-year extension for Member States that joined the EU from 2004; the universal service with at least one delivery and collection five days a week for every EU citizen, with the maintenance of a sufficient number of access points in rural, remote or sparsely populated regions; and respect for subsidiarity in social considerations, on the subject of which I hope the social partners work at European level."
"I am disappointed that the foundations for a European regulator for this sector have not been laid."
"Finally, I hope that operators will quickly agree on the introduction of a European stamp for 50 gram letters and I will soon be taking a political initiative on this matter."
"in writing. - (FR) Despite the improvements made to the Commission's original text and the compromise put forward by the European Parliament aimed notably at postponing the total liberalisation of the postal market to 31 December 2010, the text retabled at second reading by the Council is still not satisfactory."
"It is not satisfactory because it only summarily and minimally settles the issues and problems raised concerning in particular the financing of the universal service, the obligation to deliver mail five days a week and indeed equal treatment of areas and the existence of a single price for a stamp."
"It is not satisfactory because legal uncertainty results from all these points."
"In reality, this text, the only consensual virtues of which were hard won, merely delays the inevitable uncontrolled consequences of opening the postal sector to competition."
"The European Union's plans will inevitably lead to an upturn in post office closures, large-scale job losses and downward pressure on pay and conditions in the postal sector in Europe."
"in writing. - (SV) I take the view that the Member States should decide for themselves whether they want to deregulate their national postal monopolies."
"I have therefore voted in favour of Amendment 10, which rejects the common position of the Council."
"in writing. - (PT) We regret the non-adoption of our proposal to reject this Directive aimed at full liberalisation of postal services, thereby creating a 'market' at EU level."
"In this way the majority in the EP - representing the same political forces that are at the centre of right-wing politics in each country - is seeking to take one more step along the path of dismantling this essential public service."
"This is an attack by the big multinationals on the public postal service, the public ownership of this service and the public administration that has to provide it, as well as on its democratic nature, attempting to wrest from the power of each people, i.e. from their national sovereignty, the control and power of decision on these crucial issues, which go on to be decided at supranational level by the EU institutions, following interests alien to the people and to Portugal."
"Also significant is the rejection of our amendment which aimed to safeguard the requirement for all 'operators' to comply fully with labour legislation, namely any legal or contractual provision concerning employment conditions, including health and safety at work, which Member States apply in accordance with national law, as well as social security legislation and collective agreements concluded."
"With reference to my speech of yesterday on the subject of liberalisation of the postal services, I would like to add a comment which I was previously unable to include owing to the restricted time available to me, and which concerns sources of finance for the universal service."
"I fear that methods of funding it through a specially created fund or state subsidies may block liberalisation of the sector and may constitute an instrument that Member States can use to slow down and evade implementation of the provisions of the directive."
"I therefore believe that the European Commission has a major role to play here, its task being to monitor the proper introduction of the directive's provisions."
"in writing. - I supported amendments which would have obliged Member States to guarantee the financing of universal postal services."
"This is a hugely important issue, especially in the many rural and island communities of Scotland."
"I also supported amendments tabled by my Group calling for the strengthening of obligations to finance the provision of free postal services to blind and partially-sighted persons."
"The fact that the Ferber report was approved unamended in these respects may lead to concern that further erosion of postal service provision could occur."
"in writing. - (SV) I support the Swedish deregulation of the postal market, but I oppose the notion that the EU institutions should decide whether the various postal monopolies are to be abolished or not."
"I consider that the Member States should be left to decide for themselves whether they want to deregulate their national postal monopolies."
"I have therefore voted in favour of Amendment 10, which rejects the common position of the Council."
"Along with all the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I have voted against the common position of the European Parliament and the Council, because it strengthens the dogmatic neo-liberal approach to a key area of public interest: the postal services."
"The directive offers no long-term solution, and the postponement of its entry into force simply postpones its negative effects by two years."
"With the effective abolition of the principle of 'universal service', public access to high-quality, inexpensive postal services will be limited."
"The consequences will be all the more serious for residents of remote and inaccessible mountain or island regions, which companies will not be able to serve profitably."
"In countries where the market has already been fully liberalised, experience to date is anything but positive."
"The demand for forced liberalisation of the postal services creates more problems than it solves."
"in writing. - (FR) I was keen to oppose the liberalisation of the postal services market based on three fundamental positions:"
"the need to have free postal services for the blind and partially-sighted, an essential value of a non-discriminatory society."
"a guarantee from Member States of finance for the universal service before the opening of the markets, an essential condition for the protection of consumers."
"compliance with employment legislation, particularly social security, by all operators."
"Because the relevant amendments were not adopted, I can only lament this drift towards uncontrolled liberalisation that fails to respect the fundamental right of European citizens to a public postal service."
"We welcome the final approval of the report on the market in postal services, noting that the lengthy institutional procedure demonstrates the importance of this dossier for achieving its two main objectives, namely ensuring the maintenance of the universal service and appropriate opening of the market to fair competition."
"In particular I would like to stress that the opening of the markets will mean a better service and better choice for citizens, thereby avoiding distortion of competition and bringing a definitive end to existing monopolies."
"Another issue is the financing of the universal service."
"Where it entails a net cost for a Member State, it may be covered by a financing plan to be submitted to the Commission."
"Yet it is worth recalling the Portuguese case, and others, which demonstrate that universal public service can be provided perfectly well with resources from the reserved area, a transparent and neutral method that does not involve state subsidies."
"I would repeat that there is no reason to prevent such a service from continuing, as it is fundamental to territorial and social cohesion and for supporting populations living in deserted areas or more remote and inaccessible territories."
"in writing. - (EL) The Council's common position on postal services, which is submitted by the European Parliament for approval, will result in the complete liberalisation of the 'market in postal services' with effect from 31 December 2010."
"With the amendment of the directive, yet another lucrative sector - the postal services - is being handed over. This is happening within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy to maximise the profitability of the postal services."
"The postal services are being transformed from a public good into a commodity."
"In Greece the privatisation of sections of ELTA (Hellenic Post), promoted by the ND (Nea Dimokratia/New Democracy) and PASOK (Panhellenic Socialist Movement) governments, will continue at an increased rate."
"From now on, ELTA will be operating on the basis of economic private-sector criteria, in the interests of profit instead of the good of society. This will immediately impact on the quality of service."
"The consequences will be dire, not only for ELTA employees, but also within the private postal services companies. Here flexible forms of employment are already the norm, as are an absence of labour rights and social and insurance rights."
"The constitutionally safeguarded principle of secrecy of correspondence is also being jeopardised: correspondence is now being entrusted to private contractors, with no guarantees and with minimal scope for checking that its secrecy is being maintained or that personal data is being protected."
"The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) is opposed to the liberalisation of the postal services and is fighting for services that are exclusively public, modern and effective, and for the protection of workers' rights."
"in writing. - (SV) The European Parliament has today voted for the compromise with the Council under which Europe's postal market is to be liberalised by the end of December 2010 at the latest (except for those countries with a particularly difficult topography, which are to be given a further two years)."
"As the work has progressed, I have argued especially for the application of reciprocity, i.e. there should be a reciprocal agreement to prevent those countries which are holding back their liberalisation from competing in those countries which are commencing theirs."
"I therefore note with great satisfaction that, first the rapporteur (Mr Ferber), then the Council accepted my amendment and that henceforth it forms part of the compromise which is now being approved."
"in writing. - The proposal seeks to create a European single market in postal services."
"Without appropriate safeguards, liberalisation could jeopardise the concept of a universal service."
"The reluctance of the Council to include a clear commitment to providing a free postal service for the blind and visually impaired in the proposal led me to vote in favour of making such a commitment more robust."
"In general, I am satisfied that the proposal sufficiently attends to the other issues and welcome the guarantee that letters will be regularly collected and delivered in remote areas and cities."
"in writing. - (IT) The 'nuclear' issue in Iran should be marked by a diplomatic approach aimed at 'normalising' relations."
"We need to maintain a political line based on diplomacy that allows us to abandon the escalation of attitudes and threats of military action, to make way for dialogue through the recognition of Iran's right to develop nuclear technology for civil use."
"Nonetheless, it is right that we should commit ourselves to reaching a negotiation situation that persuades Iran to give up the option of military use, in a multilateral perspective of nuclear disarmament, to guarantee a state of calm and international peace."
"On the other hand, I cannot fail to express a certain amount of concern about the current human rights situation in Iran, where we are witnessing a fresh upsurge in repression of freedom of opinion and of the rights of minorities and women, where order is kept through a harsh and inhuman judicial and prison system that all too often uses capital punishment, torture and stoning."
"The efforts made so far have not produced any tangible results."
"To claim a place at the table of the great international powers, Iran must now present itself not as a military superpower, but as a country capable of protecting the human rights of its citizens."
"in writing. - Only a few months ago US intelligence acknowledged that its claim that Iran was developing nuclear weapons was in error."
"In fact, Iran's nuclear weapons programme was abandoned in 2001/2002."
"Yet Washington has failed to draw the appropriate political conclusion from this intellectual U-turn."
"The argument for deploying National Missile Defence technologies in Eastern Europe was to supposedly defend against a nuclear Iran which had mysteriously acquired ICBMs."
"Now if Iran's nuclear programme does not exist, the justification for NMD deployment vanishes, unless the hidden agenda is to threaten a resurgent Russia."
"I am resolutely opposed to such a deployment and will campaign against it."
"in writing. - (FR) The resolution voted on today concerning Iran has definite political importance."
"Iran is central to international concerns and we needed to come back to it."
"This text deals both with the nuclear issue and with the human rights situation."
"On both points, we are clear."
"We cannot accept the development of a military nuclear programme in Iran."
"The resolution expresses its agreement with and support for the EU's efforts to arrive at a negotiated long-term settlement for the Iranian nuclear issue and underlines the essential role to be played by the IAEA."
"It also reaffirms that a solution to the current escalation of the nuclear issue is possible and that military action should not be envisaged."
"On the other hand, the serious and repeated human rights violations must be firmly denounced."
"The situation is worrying, in four areas: the death penalty, women's rights, freedom of expression and the repression of religious minorities."
"It seems absolutely essential to me not to appear complacent on this subject and the resolution strongly urges the Iranian government to change course in this matter."
"in writing. - (FR) The UN Security Council is again going to adopt a resolution imposing sanctions on Iran for its nuclear activities."
"Will it be a matter of backing a military operation against the country?"
"Or simply a matter of using a harsher tone and coming up with diplomatic or economic sanctions?"
"For months this cleverly staged psychodrama has been holding Parliament and other international bodies in suspense."
"But is Iran's nuclear capability really the main threat that the world in general, and the West and its allies in particular, have to confront?"
"It is completely paradoxical that we are not reacting to Pakistan's nuclear weapons, which do actually exist, in a particularly unstable geopolitical context, or those of North Korea, in the hands of a particularly dangerous regime."
"I have already had occasion to say this: the rules of law we claim to uphold should be the same for everyone."
"Otherwise they lose all meaning and legitimacy."
"Meanwhile, I am much more worried about Islamist threats on our own continent, which, far from being hypothetical, have already demonstrated their murderous capacity in London and Madrid, without the involvement of Iran."
"It is true that this threat is one of the consequences of the mass immigration policy you are carrying out, and which you want to make even worse."
"The hypocrisy of the 'international community' - i.e. the United States and its allies - regarding the NPT and, especially, Iran's nuclear programme must be denounced."
"There is no such political initiative on the nuclear weapons programmes of some EU members or the United States - or even the nuclear programmes of Israel, Pakistan or India, countries that have not signed the NPT but do have nuclear weapons - the United States already having stated that it could use them offensively."
"Therefore, what is needed is full compliance with the NPT and the elimination of all nuclear weapons."
"The real issue regarding Iran is that the United States and the EU both know that peak oil production has already ended in many countries."
"The reason for the serious threats of military aggression, provocations and so much haste regarding Iran's nuclear programme, is that the country has the world's best reserves of hydrocarbons, and the United States and the EU are trying to create the conditions, even by manipulating public opinion, to control its energy resources and the whole Middle East, as we are seeing in Iraq."
"in writing. - I support the recommendations made in the resolution."
"However, as regards the PMOI, I voted against the amendments referring to the group in the text."
"in writing. - (EL) The opinions of Javier Solana and of EU representatives and supporting parties have put paid to any illusions about the EU's position with regard to Iran and the Middle East generally."
"These opinions prove that the EU is in favour of promoting the US-NATO plan for 'democratising the Middle East', which aims to subject nations and peoples to control of their wealth-producing resources."
"The assurances on behalf of the IAEA and the CIA's report on Iran's non-military use of nuclear energy are deliberately being ignored by the EU, which is stepping up the pressure with sanctions against Iran, and is intensifying propaganda to accustom public opinion to the idea of a war against Iran."
"Furthermore, Javier Solana has clearly linked the situation in Lebanon and the wider area with the issue of nuclear weapons - without, however, making any reference to Israel's nuclear weapons."
"In the wider area of the Middle East, we are witnessing the emergence of imperialist aggression and clashes over the sharing out of markets."
"The victims of this are, among others, the peoples of Palestine, Iran and Lebanon. The only answer to these new aggressive, warlike plans is for citizens to resist imperialism and harbour no illusions about the role of the EU."
"Those who are in a position to decide on issues of human rights and their violation are the citizens of each country; they should not allow themselves to become an excuse for another Iraq."
"Iran is currently a regional and global threat and a challenge to the EU Member States' ability to stand firm together on the international scene."
"Aside from the successive and contradictory reports that are appearing, the truth is that Iran has not complied with its transparency obligation, nor has it helped to create a climate of confidence."
"Quite the contrary."
"Moreover, aside from the nuclear dossier, the news is not encouraging either."
"Violations of human rights, state violence and sham electoral democracy are all factors to be taken into account in our attitude towards Iran."
"Therefore, in the light of the above, but also on account of what I have stood for in the past, I agree with the essence of the adopted resolution, and emphasise the European Parliament's insistence that the Council and the Commission comply with the European Court of Justice's ruling by removing the Iranian resistance, the PMOI, from the list of terrorist organisations."
"The EU (and some Member States) have been treating the Iranian resistance in a way that benefits the Iranian regime and neither the Iranian people nor the democratisation objectives for that part of the world."
"That strategy has to change - and it is beginning to change."
"in writing. - (IT) I am pleased at the way the Bali conference went, and that it produced unhoped-for results, partly thanks to the role played by the EU during the negotiations."
"In this tricky situation it was fundamentally important to give a signal of unity, cooperation and responsibility in a way that would get the negotiations to set new emission reduction targets for the post-Kyoto period (2012) off to a good start."
"By accepting the conclusions of scientists on the IPCC, all the participants recognised at the political level that climate change exists, that its origins are anthropogenic and that we need to act by 2020 to avoid irreparable damage to the Earth's climate."
"I hope that Copenhagen in 2009 signals the turning point in the fight against climate change with the acceptance of stringent targets for reduction by 2020 by all industrialised and developing countries."
"Certainly, this new challenge will involve costs and inefficiencies that are difficult to justify unless, as I have already said in previous interventions, we make necessary and courageous choices such as the return to nuclear power."
"Inaction, procrastination and exhausting conferences will lead only to irreversible damage to the environment."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the outcome of the Bali Conference on Climate Change (COP 13 and COP/MOP 3) because, in view of the urgency of reducing global warming, I believe that the agreement reached in Bali was an important step forward so that in 2009, in Copenhagen, a new protocol can be drawn up and approved, with new targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions."
"I feel that the Portuguese EU Presidency played a key role in the Bali Conference, making an active contribution to the progress of the negotiations and managing to reach a very positive agreement."
"It would be desirable, however, for the Bali Action Plan to refer to quantified targets for the reduction in CO2 emissions."
"in writing. - (PT) Overall, this resolution merely repeats general ideas, and is inadequate in various areas."
"Hence our abstention."
"For instance, since the main objective is to reduce CO2 emissions produced by burning fossil fuels, the issue of measuring those emissions arises."
"We know that this measurement is very complex and can be manipulated, since fossil fuels, after extraction, are transported and processed, and their by-products distributed and used in many ways, at thousands of end points."
"As various specialists in the field have indicated, to reduce emissions and achieve targets, it is more effective and simpler to monitor an instrument approved under a protocol on the extraction and international marketing of fossil fuels."
"Thus, it would be easier to set rates or targets for reducing primary fossil fuel production, and corresponding exports/imports, thus setting maximum emissions limits by country."
"But there is also a need to negotiate commitments by the richer countries to release funds to support developing countries, to help them bear the economic and social costs of the necessary measures."
"I regret that the Group's proposals to that end were rejected."
"in writing. - (PT) Last December, the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met in Bali, having made progress on many aspects relating to global climate protection."
"In addition to the start of negotiations on a new protocol to replace the Kyoto Protocol, I would highlight the statement that the fourth IPCC Report was a better scientific basis for the Convention's work, and the reference, for the first time - thus ending the taboo - to developing countries also having to cooperate, obviously taking account of their economic context and their development."
"Finally, I believe that the major innovation at Bali was the inclusion, for the first time, of the issue of deforestation which, as part of the Bali Action Plan, will be discussed with a view to its inclusion in the future Protocol."
"I am voting in favour of the resolution of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change since it supports the outcome achieved in Bali, makes a number of observations on the role of the EU in future negotiations, with which I agree, and specifies where the Bali Action Plan could have gone further."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report."
"The Thirteenth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held in Bali from 3 to 15 December, was supposed to set out a schedule for the next two years and reach an agreement extending the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012."
"Although the first objective appears to have been met, we are still a long way from achieving the second."
"It is most regrettable that the international community was not able to agree on a target figure for the stabilisation then reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20% from their 1990 level by 2020."
"The European Union should strengthen the constructive and proactive role it was able to play in Bali so as not to provide the countries that reject all targets with an excuse to refuse to act."
"Although the Bali agreement, which was signed by all the countries present, should be welcomed, we should not give way to a new set of environmental platitudes."
"There are still two years in which to reach an agreement, and hesitations over the roadmap indicate that the toughest part is still to come."
"in writing. - (EL) The Bali Conference resolution on climate change is seeking to find positive signs where there are none. At the same time, it conceals the cause of environmental destruction: the plundering of natural resources by capital in order to profit from the commercialisation of the land, air, energy and water."
"The resolution points ahead to the danger that climate change 'could be a major factor in destabilisation of the poorest countries'."
"This Euro-monopoly capital can use climate change as a pretext for further exploiting the developing countries, as we know that the activity of the multinationals is one of the major reasons for poverty."
"The resolution calls for serious commitment from the emerging nations, in accordance with their development stage and the composition of their economies."
"It refers more specifically to China and India on the issue of promoting cooperation on energy policy to limit pollutants."
"Essentially it aims to put pressure on them by curbing their developing potential and their claims to larger market shares in the face of imperialist competition for the allocation of markets."
"Perhaps this is why there is no reference to measures for the direct reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and why there are only general expressions of good intent."
"In a nutshell, climate change at the Bali conference was mere window-dressing."
"The real issues were the intensifying of intra-imperialist conflicts in the energy sector and the commercialisation of the environment."
"in writing. - I fully support the resolution's assessment of the outcome of the Bali Summit negotiations."
"Thanks to the EU, Bali achieved more than might have been expected, but less than was needed."
"The lack of agreement among all negotiating parties on concrete objectives and figures for the reduction of CO2 emissions is regrettable."
"I voted in favour of the resolution."
"in writing. - (DE) It is important that the link between deforestation and climate change is explicitly highlighted in the resolution adopted."
"The role of the rainforests is crucial to the world's climate."
"They store huge amounts of CO2."
"In addition, they are the earth's largest reservoirs."
"They soak up water like a sponge and thereby cool the atmosphere."
"Deforestation and slashing and burning, however, jeopardise this extremely important role enormously."
"Stopping deforestation and slashing and burning would therefore be an extremely radical contribution to combating global warming."
"Increased demand for biofuels in Europe is diametrically opposed to the protection of the rainforests."
"Thousands of hectares of rainforest have already been cleared to extract palm oil in order to meet the increased demand for bio-diesel."
"Certification and identification of the sustainable production of biofuels is therefore an essential requirement for the protection of the rainforests and the world's climate."
"In addition, production is also aggravating the social situation in the countries concerned owing to the massive increase in the price of staple foods."
"I am therefore against the Commission's proposal as part of the climate and energy package to fix a binding target of 10% for biofuels by 2020, because this contributes nothing to climate protection and is a far cry from a sustainable policy."
"in writing. - (SV) There must be a drastic reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases in the years ahead."
"The resolution contains many good ideas as to how this goal is to be attained, so I have chosen to vote for the resolution."
"The targets being set can be summed up in the expression 20-20-20, which means that emissions must come down by 20%, that the use of renewable energy sources must increase by 20% and that these aims must be achieved by the year 2020."
"However, I think that the emphasis should be on reducing emissions and that it must then be left to each Member State to decide how this aim is to be achieved."
"Hence the EU should refrain from specifying how countries are to change the ways they use renewable energy sources."
"In so far as it may be appropriate to issue any such specification, it is regrettable that nuclear energy is not included under the heading of renewable energy sources."
"The IAEA has concluded that nuclear energy is a necessary element in the drive to reduce carbon dioxide emissions."
"It is regrettable that this resolution chooses to disregard that fact by insisting that emissions must not be reduced through the use of nuclear energy."
"In the implementation of this resolution it will become clear that the EU has indirectly ruled out a role for nuclear energy in improving the climate situation."
"Such an attitude is distinctly odd in my opinion, and it should be clearly noted."
"in writing. - (SV) We have voted for the resolution on the grounds of its general focus, but we do not support all the points of technical detail or the ambitions to regulate by political decisions what products may be manufactured or sold - such things as patio heaters, for example."
"in writing. - British Conservatives support the broad thrust of this own-initiative report - who could be against energy efficiency?"
"However, we have reservations about certain aspects of the proposal where the rapporteur seems to have lost a sense of proportion."
"Energy efficiency marking is good for enabling consumers to make a choice but to start proscribing particular products merely because they use energy in a way that some do not approve seems excessive."
"It seems particularly unreasonable to pick on patio heaters (paragraph 16), which have become widespread as a direct consequence of the UK Government's anti-smoking legislation."
"We trust that this particular suggestion will not be incorporated into any future Commission proposal."
"in writing. - I fully disapprove of discards - and this is the policy of my party - but I am unable to vote for the imposition of EU decisions, however enlightened they may sometimes appear."
"in writing. - (PT) This is yet another report that takes stock of a situation without going into its causes or pointing out essential routes to follow, but merely takes up controversial statements by international organisations and, in one or two cases, such as the reference to Russia and Africa, shows that its concern is much more the defence of the EU's interests than any cooperation policy, which we disagree with."
"What is clear is that the scarcity of fossil fuels, as reflected in their prices, requires a reduction in consumption."
"In order to avoid reducing economic and social activities, we therefore need to deliberately reduce unnecessary consumption, waste in conversion processes, transport and distribution, and final consumption."
"Since energy cannot be recycled after use and since the sources are scarce, it must be managed in accordance with technical knowledge and complex political priorities, requiring central planning by governments in the public interest, eliminating the fluctuations and nervousness of the market agents."
"We have yet to achieve this."
"Other well intentioned recommendations already relate to living and working in cities and metropolitan areas, with potentially very positive consequences for renewal and innovation in energy networks, buildings, transport and other public utilities."
"in writing. - I support the general principle of this report as an Action Plan for Energy Efficiency."
"I have no problem with investigating ways of making 'space heaters' more efficient, but I am not in favour of banning 'patio heaters'."
"As far as I can see, the majority of these are used by publicans to warm smokers that recent legislation has driven out into the cold."
"Already the smoking ban has closed hundreds of public houses with the consequent loss of jobs."
"Such a ban would only multiply closures and job losses."
"in writing. - (FR) Even beyond the refrain that has become commonplace here on climate change and measures to combat it, the issue of the energy security and independence of European states in itself justifies us trying to make better use of energy."
"The reason we will not vote against this report is that it is at European level that most standards are developed."
"However, in this report, we fall back into the Malthusian and guilt-apportioning vision present in all Parliament's reports on the subject: blind stigmatisation of motorists, bans on certain equipment, the desire to dictate individuals' behaviour and to press-gang children from their earliest years, to meddle in planning and construction policy, to promote energy taxation and pricing schemes that in fact will harm only the most fragile sectors of the population."
"Therefore - yes to minimum standards, yes to encouraging research, yes to objective information that allows enlightened choices, yes to the promotion of tax incentives."
"No to persecution and bludgeoning."
"in writing. - (SV) Research results indicate that emissions of greenhouse gases caused by man are contributing to rapid climate change."
"We therefore support the main conclusion that all countries must take comprehensive measures to reduce these emissions and that the EU countries must take the lead."
"At the same time we object to the tendency of both the Commission and Parliament's rapporteurs always to exploit great challenges in order to centralise political power and create an EU without freedom and dynamism."
"The EU's role in energy policy should be limited to:"
"setting emission targets for each country and then leaving it to those countries and the market to attain the targets in free competition"
"internalising emission costs by pricing emission rights at sufficiently high levels."
"(Emissions will then be automatically taken into account in the billions of economic decisions taken every day around the world by households and businesses."
"Then households will of their own accord choose energy-saving light bulbs, car manufacturers will produce vehicles with low fuel consumption and property developers will build passive houses."
"It will then pay to carry out R&D in the field.)"
"allocating money for research and legislating on product labelling."
"EU politicians must not regulate in detail."
"No one knows at present how best to plan this gigantic transformation."
"We therefore oppose such things as bans on patio heaters and tax concessions for building demolitions."
"We have voted 'no' in order thereby to encourage a rethink of the EU's energy policy."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report, which falls in with the conclusions of the European Council in March 2007 on energy efficiency, which underlined the need to improve energy efficiency in the EU to achieve the objective of saving 20% of the EU's energy consumption compared to forecasts for 2020."
"I welcome the measures aimed at improving the energy performance of products, buildings and services, improving the efficiency of energy production and distribution, reducing the impact of transport on energy consumption, facilitating finance and investment in the field, to encourage and reinforce sensible behaviour with respect to energy consumption."
"European citizens must be able to benefit from infrastructure (including buildings), products (appliances and cars, among other things), processes and energy services offering the best energy efficiency in the world."
"The action plan will also have the effect of strengthening industrial competitiveness and developing exports of new technologies, and will have positive effects on employment."
"Furthermore, the savings made will also compensate for investment in innovative technologies."
"in writing. - I do not support the paragraph calling for the withdrawal from the market of specific household appliances as this is too strong a statement."
"in writing. - I have voted in support of the report, which is on the whole excellent."
"However paragraph 16 which 'Urges the Commission to establish timetables for the withdrawal from the market of all the least energy-efficient items of equipment, appliances and other energy-using products, such as patio heaters', would have been better without singling out one particular piece of equipment for a 'ban', since it is only one among many that raise concerns over energy wastage and it is one that many people enjoy using, not least in an urban social context like my own London constituency."
"I welcome moves by some retailers to stop selling such heaters in response to consumer pressure, and I would not buy one myself."
"But I believe that the best course is to set minimum standards for energy efficiency of appliances, inform people of energy consumption and encourage them to consider their overall carbon footprint and choose their appliances, use of transport, social behaviour etc. accordingly, rather than to ban patio heaters or any other particular item as such."
"After all - and hopefully - innovation in response to efficiency standards may deliver more efficient patio heaters."
"I welcome this proposal by Mrs Hall, and the fact that the transition is being made at long last from abstract theories to concrete proposals in order to increase energy efficiency in the European Union."
"I am pleased that this report retains the target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020."
"I do not endorse section 16 of the report, which calls for the withdrawal from the market of the least energy-efficient appliances."
"After all, industry needs to be encouraged to produce better, more efficient appliances."
"I therefore abstained from the final vote."
"The People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) opposes bans, but supports improvements."
"Thus the VVD opposes a ban on patio heaters, but supports innovative solutions to combat inefficiency."
"The VVD Group in the European Parliament takes the view that, in the context of the fight against climate change, it would be strange if we did not also look at how to make patio heaters more efficient."
"Therefore, the group has endorsed the Hall report's appeal to the European Commission for the phasing out of energy-inefficient appliances and their replacement with more efficient models."
"The report must be regarded as an incentive for industry to develop more energy-efficient appliances - patio heaters, for example."
"in writing. - The action plan delivers the most cost-effective tools to fight against climate change."
"Indeed, I welcome the plan and feel that the target of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 is feasible both technically and economically."
"The plan is a step in the right direction and I voted in favour of it, though this should be seen as a first step and more ambitious targets should follow."
"in writing. - (DE) Energy-saving measures and greater energy efficiency are desirable for environmental and economic considerations."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Hall report, but hope that we are more successful here than with the reduction in energy consumption that we are aiming for by 2020, or with the agreed increase in the proportion of renewable forms of energy - both noble intentions, which we shall probably not be able to sustain as things currently stand."
"in writing. - (SV) Fiona Hall's report concerns an extremely important subject."
"It is not enough for the EU to lay down tough rules for carbon dioxide emissions."
"People must be able and willing to change their own consumption and behaviour patterns in order to make a real difference."
"Paragraph 61 dispenses sound sense on this point: the fight must begin at home."
"For the sake of our credibility the European Parliament should therefore set a good example in its own activity."
"We exhort the people of the EU to dispense with everything from kettles to heated bar and restaurant terraces, while at the same time the energy consumption of the European Parliament's second seat alone generates 5322 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year!"
"A study commissioned by MEP Caroline Lucas shows that Parliament's monthly relocations to France have dramatic environmental consequences."
"Altogether the trips to Strasbourg, where Parliament holds its votes, result in 18 901 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year."
"That corresponds to over 10 000 flights from Europe to New York."
"It was good that the report was passed."
"To cease travelling to Strasbourg for our votes, which could just as easily be taken care of at home, would be better."
"in writing. - I support a ban on discards which is in line with my party's policy on sensible rules for commercial fishing."
"I am unable to vote for the resolution because it represents more EU interference in UK affairs."
"The UK is more than able to make its own arrangements for fishing and fishery protection, as we always used to do before joining this wasteful organisation."
"in writing. - (PT) Discards (throwing dead or dying fish overboard) and by-catches are a serious problem to be solved in the context of the CFP."
"With management mechanisms that take account of landings rather than catches, the EU fisheries industry needs a rapid reformulation of its policies in order to reduce these bad practices."
"In this connection the European Commission produced a Communication announcing its intention to introduce a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and gradually eliminate discards in European fisheries."
"Unwanted by-catches and their subsequent discarding has innumerable negative consequences: it is a waste of resources, the catching of juveniles of target species results in lower catch opportunities for those species and a reduction in the spawning biomass and, together with catches and discards of species which are not targeted by fisheries (fish, crustacean, sea mammal or sea bird species, etc.) amounts to a biological attack on the marine ecosystem."
"In the light of the above and because this report works towards sustainable fishing, in accordance with the principles of the reformed CFP, I intend to vote in favour."
"in writing. - (PT) It is of course desirable and necessary to reduce unwanted by-catches and discards, but it should not be done by legislation."
"As it is impossible to mention all the aspects raised in the report, we welcome the adoption of our amendment that 'points out that the impact of small-scale fishing on discards is minimal, and therefore calls for greater Community support for the promotion and development of small-scale inshore and artisanal fishing'."
"We regret the rejection of our proposals that emphasised:"
"that in order to lay down suitable measures to promote a real reduction in discards it is first necessary to establish and analyse the various causes that give rise to discards, such as commercial reasons (linked to price, marketing, maximising the value of fish), catches of fish below the minimum landing sizes or by-catches;"
"that a detailed study needs to be made of the measures to be adopted and of their impact on the socio-economic situation in the industry;"
"the importance of voluntary reductions in fishing effort and the putting in place of mechanisms to make it possible for fishermen to be granted financial compensation for that effort and the adoption of positive market intervention measures to combat discards (guaranteed marketing of fish at fair prices and the development of the canning industry)."
"in writing. - I support the call for a ban on discards, in line with my party's policy, but I am unable to vote for the resolution as a whole as it includes the establishment of instruments at EU level."
"Specifically regarding Amendment 14, whilst I commend the efforts of Scottish fishermen, who have taken a lead in voluntarily reducing the catch of immature fish, I cannot support the implementation of a compensation scheme that is administered by the EU institutions."
"in writing. - (EL) It seems reasonable that measures should be taken to avoid discards so as to protect fish stocks."
"Let us consider, however, why catches are discarded, at a time when many workers would love to eat more fish."
"The reason is capitalist production."
"Fish catches are a commodity placed on the market to earn a profit for big fishing companies, rather than simply goods to meet dietary needs."
"If a fishing company estimates that it will not make a profit or, more likely, that the price of certain catches will drop because of plentiful supply, then we can explain why catches are discarded, although there are other reasons as well."
"The new proposal is essentially a show of good intentions and reiterates a comparable policy which, according to the report, was supposed to have been applied more than five years ago."
"We have no objection to certain measures being taken to limit or prohibit discards, but we do have a reservation: some of these measures may be a burden to small- and medium-sized fishing enterprises and may essentially be a pretext for preventing them from fishing freely."
"In other words, some of the proposals may be an excuse to shrink SMEs and inordinately expand large fishing enterprises."
"in writing. - Any bid to improve Europe's fisheries policy is positive for Scotland and its fishing industry."
"The report seeks to research ways of progressively reducing the amount of unwanted by-catches and implementing the banning of discards: two damaging practices that have become far too commonplace in the fisheries sector."
"With this view, the report proposes a logical and effective approach to information gathering and calls for simple measures that are both easily enforceable and economically viable."
"My vote was one in favour of the report's recommendations."
"in writing. - As an avid viewer of that great TV series 'Deadliest Catch' I am now a great admirer of fishermen and the work they do."
"I will be voting in favour of this report because we seriously have to address the waste that goes on, with perfectly good fish being thrown back into the sea because of the workings of the complicated quota system."
"Whilst I do not believe that market intervention is the answer here or that quotas should be abandoned, we do need to address seriously this situation."
"Our fish stocks are still low."
"Demand for fish is still growing and therein lies our dilemma."
"We must preserve our stocks and one way to do this is to eradicate or at least minimise the waste of unwanted by-catches and discards."
"in writing. - I was surprised to see that Amendment 9 was carried."
"This amendment means that all fishing vessels would have to have CCTV."
"There is no explanation of how this would be implemented, no impact assessment has been given to show that it works and no means to show how this would be paid for."
"Today, the European Parliament voted on the report on a policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards."
"The MEPs from the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the European People's Party (PPE) voted in favour of the final report, as it contains a number of positive points."
"For example, it recognises that some fish species are known to have a high survival rate on release and that derogations from a discard ban are possible."
"This is important in the case of juvenile sole, as this species has a very high survival rate."
"The report also emphasises positive and negative incentives to reduce discards."
"This approach is more sensible than a total ban on discards. In the view of the CDA/PPE delegation, a total ban on discards is unrealistic."
"in writing. - I support the call for a ban on discards, in line with my party's policy, but I am unable to vote for the resolution as a whole as it includes the establishment of instruments at EU level."
"Specifically regarding Amendment 14, whilst I commend the efforts of Scottish fishermen, who have taken a lead in voluntarily reducing the catch of immature fish, I cannot support the implementation of a compensation scheme that is administered by the EU institutions."
"in writing. - I and my British Conservative colleagues completely and unreservedly condemn all forms of racism and xenophobia and fully support the Roma people in their fight against the discrimination which they face."
"Nevertheless, this should occur within the mainstream of political policy within each Member State."
"We are unable to support this resolution because it increases the possibility of isolating and marginalising the Roma by 'pigeon-holing' them into a separate category and it calls on the Commission to come up with various strategies and action plans which should remain the competence of Member States."
"in writing. - (SV) Social exclusion, poverty and discrimination are problems which the Member States must do their utmost to combat."
"The Roma minority has been particularly badly affected by these injustices."
"Nevertheless, we consider that integration policy is best regulated at Member State level."
"in writing. - (SV) We voted in favour of this resolution in the final vote."
"However, we wish to point out that it is first and foremost the political responsibility of each Member State to resolve problems of ethnic discrimination and questions of social justice within the territory of their respective countries."
"There is a hint of bias in a number of the amendments to the resolution tabled by the UEN Group."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the amendments of the UEN Group."
"The task of the European Union in this context is to highlight the principles of a union of values."
"Racism and ethnic discrimination in the EU and Europe must be combated."
"But this must come about through educative and opinion-forming action on the part of each Member State to instil in each new generation an appreciation of the equal value of all human beings."
"in writing. - (PT) Citizens of Roma origin are often victims of discrimination in the various EU countries; since it can take many different forms - affecting their political, economic, social or cultural rights - it fosters poverty, social exclusion and disintegration."
"Indeed, violation of or the non-exercise of fundamental rights such as the right to health, housing, education, employment with rights and social security, fuels situations of social inequality, marginalisation and ghettoisation, illiteracy, incorporation into the informal economy, and social and political non-participation that many citizens of Roma origin also face."
"We therefore need effective policies to combat social inequality, exploitation and the concentration of wealth, create jobs with rights, ensure access to and exercise of the most fundamental rights for the promotion of public services, and eradicate poverty and social exclusion."
"Basically, policies that force a break with the policies and directions of the European Union, a central issue that the resolution omits."
"We do not believe that the solution to the problems that many citizens of Roma origin face lies in adopting 'common policies' at EU level, as the resolution advocates."
"Hence our abstention."
"in writing. - (HU) In April 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution to improve the situation of the Roma, in which it called upon the European Commission to prepare a Roma action plan."
"Since then, nothing has happened, apart from promises and high-sounding words."
"The majority of the 12-15 million Roma living in Europe, 10 million of whom have lived in the Union since the 2004 accession, are fighting the same problems, and in poor social conditions, as they have done for years: poverty, exclusion, the problem of integration, the lack of employment, and multiple discrimination against Roma women and children."
"The majority of Member States do not regard the Roma as a national minority because of their lack of a mother country, and do not make any substantial changes to their situation."
"In fact, the experiences of recent years have instead shown that radicalism is growing stronger in both the old and the new Member States."
"I therefore feel that the time has come for substantial changes."
"The European Socialist Group has already initiated its action plan, the first stage of which was to produce a resolution with eminent experts from the other parties."
"I therefore call on my fellow Members to face this European challenge and to initiate a European Roma Strategy together, with our vote."
"in writing. - (EL) The Roma are almost invariably victims of racial discrimination."
"The non-acceptance of their traditions and culture, and their marginalisation, force them into social exclusion. They fall easy prey to capitalism."
"Indeed, they are often used as scapegoats and are collectively blamed, as happened recently with the deportations from Italy."
"The national governments and the EU restrict themselves to high-sounding declarations, while avoiding concrete measures."
"In Greece, as in other countries, the majority of Roma live in wretched conditions, in encampments, without water or drainage."
"Many are unemployed and have no social security or rights to healthcare."
"Their children face ever greater problems: child mortality is high, hardly any vaccinations are available and a low percentage of children regularly attend school."
"Eighty per cent of the Roma community is still illiterate."
"Governments must take measures to ensure that the Roma participate as equals in society, and that their cultural traditions are respected."
"In Greece, we are calling for the establishment of a Centre for Romani and Gypsy Studies, with special emphasis on culture."
"Immediate measures must be taken to ensure that they have decent living conditions and inalienable rights to employment, a pension, health and medical care, as well as education."
"Like all workers, they are struggling against monopoly interests and the exploitative system."
"in writing. - The implementation of a strategy on the Roma is something that I am in favour of."
"I see that the EU urgently needs a strategy to aid in the Roma's inclusion in society."
"They are one of the continent's largest minority groups and deserve to be recognised as so through a European plan to engage with the issues they are faced with."
"in writing. - (RO) This resolution is a strategy for the coordination and promotion of European efforts with a view to improving the condition of the Roma population, who are facing a series of difficulties related to discrimination, marginalization, social exclusion and severe poverty."
"The EU's concern with minorities, including disadvantaged social groups, is also an answer to enlargement including former communist countries with a significant Roma population."
"Thus the problem takes on a European dimension, no longer being limited to Central and Eastern-European countries."
"I voted for this resolution because it brings to the attention of the Member States and European institutions the necessity of taking measures for creating an adequate social and political milieu for the social inclusion of the Roma."
"Discrimination against the Roma is widespread in public and private life, including access to public office, education, the labour market, healthcare and housing."
"Member State governments should undertake to reduce the unacceptable rifts between the Roma population and the rest of society, so as to ensure full compliance with the principles underlying the European Union, the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and liberties."

"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Kosovo Parliament declared Kosovo's independence yesterday."
"This decision was expected and reflects the will of the citizens in Kosovo to take their political fate and institutional shaping of independence peacefully into their own hands."
"About a year ago, the European Parliament, as a consequence of the Ahtisaari report, agreed on the supervised sovereignty of Kosovo."
"The negotiations between Belgrade and Priština were extremely difficult and regrettably did not lead to a solution which was acceptable politically to all participants."
"As so often in politics, there was no magic formula."
"The heavy burden of recent history contributed to this situation."
"However, the case of Kosovo is not a precedent."
"The situation of Kosovo as a UN protectorate is unique and is a special case which cannot be compared with others."
"I would like to call upon all those involved and appeal to them for reason and calm."
"I am sure that everyone in Kosovo - Serbs and Kosovans -wishes to achieve stability and prosperity in their region."
"Indeed, that is the primary objective of the European Union and the European Parliament."
"It is our task and duty to encourage the political leaders in Kosovo to assume their responsibilities and to create democratic political institutions which respect the rights and freedoms of all citizens in the context of a multiethnic Kosovo which lives in good-neighbourly relations with its neighbours."
"In that connection, I also welcome the decision by the Council to send the EULEX Kosovo mission led by Yves de Kermabon."
"The task of the mission will be to provide assistance to the Kosovans in the field of policing and the rule of law to ensure a smooth transition."
"I also welcome the appointment of Pieter Feith as EU Special Representative in Kosovo."
"This demonstrates the European Union's clear and resolute commitment and our will to do something practical for lasting stability in the Balkans."
"I trust in the wisdom of the decision to be made by the General Affairs Council at its meeting this afternoon."
"The countries of the Western Balkans have European prospects."
"Their accession will not be able to take place in the near future, but each of these countries has this prospect."
"In light of that, we should help the people in Serbia and in Kosovo to overcome their differences from the point of view of European integration, as has already happened in other parts of Europe."
"The debate scheduled for Wednesday will be an initial opportunity to do this."

"The final version of the draft agenda for the current part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 14 February 2008, pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Monday/Tuesday:"
"No amendments."
"Wednesday:"
"The IND/DEM Group has requested that the vote on the report by Mr Corbett and Mr Méndez de Vigo on the Lisbon Treaty be adjourned to a subsequent part-session."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, it is your task to give this Parliament a good image as a serious scrutiniser of European affairs."
"I would therefore ask you to reschedule the vote on the Treaty."
"The deadline for amendments to the report was set before we received the Treaty from the committee."
"We have still not received the consolidated version you promised."
"That runs contrary to a unanimous decision adopted in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"I started asking questions on the basis of a private consolidated version and have already found misleading mistakes in the translations."
"For 29 years you and I have disagreed on constitutional matters, except for transparency."
"Our disagreements have always been dealt with in a serious way, after proper scrutiny in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"I fight for transferring competences from the non-elected Commission to this directly-elected Parliament."
"We have proposed that no EU law should be passed without the approval of this House."
"How can we defend this report to the European Parliament when you close our decision-making process before anyone in this House has read a readable version of the Treaty?"
"The last IGC represents the most secretive negotiations on a treaty we have ever seen."
"I urge you to keep the debate on Wednesday, but to move the vote so that we can be seen to be a serious parliament by all the citizens of Europe."
"We are not part of the executive."
"We represent the voters."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, what we are voting on is not the Consolidated Treaty, but the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That was published in the Official Journal on 17 December 2007."
"I have it here."
"We have all had it."
"Admittedly, that is a text that amends the existing Treaties, and to work on it you need to look at the amendments contained in the Lisbon Treaty and also at the original Treaties."
"But that is exactly what we, as elected representatives, are paid to do: to look at the details, and to take the trouble to compare the texts and see what changes have been made."
"It is true that it would also be helpful to have a consolidated treaty that shows what the Treaties will look like when this Treaty is ratified - I say 'when' it is ratified, because I am sure it will be - and which citizens will find much easier to read."
"However, almost all our national governments have already published consolidated versions of the Treaty in their own language."
"I have here the English version of the consolidated Treaties, as they will look once the Lisbon Treaty has been adopted."
"I understand, furthermore, that one of the first governments to publish a consolidated version was the Danish Government - in Danish."
"So I am sure Mr Bonde has had no difficulty in finding a consolidated, readable version of the Treaties to help him in his work in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I will keep this very brief."
"I must say, I am rather surprised why, for weeks and months, there has been such active, massive and, in part, aggressive opposition to a Treaty when the Members opposing it do not even know which Treaty we are talking about."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Corbett has made the essential point: this is not about the Consolidated Treaty, it is about the contents of the Reform Treaty."
"There are different opinions."
"That is quite normal in a democracy; indeed, it is a good thing that opinions differ and that there is a lively debate."
"However, everyone should also take note of others' opinions and allow a vote to take place."
"We have been discussing this Treaty very earnestly for weeks and months and it is now time to send out a clear signal as to whether the majority of this House is in favour or against it."
"Outbursts and attempts to prevent others from speaking, which is what we have witnessed here, could give the wrong message to the public."
"Please, let the majority of this House decide this week whether it is for or against the Treaty."
"That is what democracy is all about."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, in response to Mr Corbett, who says that a consolidated version is available in Danish, I can confirm that there is a version based on a draft from October 2007, but that no consolidated version is yet available based on what was approved in Lisbon on 13 December 2007."
"There are 7 000 more words in the new edition, and I would like Mr Swoboda - who seems to be the expert - to explain what the content of those 7 000 new words is."
"(Laughter)"
"(Parliament rejected the request by roll-call vote)"
"Thursday:"
"No amendments."
"(The agenda was therefore adopted)"
"One-minute speeches (Rule 144)"
"We now come to the one-minute speeches on important political issues."
"(EL) Mr President, it is no secret that the declared target for biofuels has been set at 10% of renewable energy sources."
"I have the impression that the Commissioners for energy, the environment, industry and agriculture have different views."
"In the interests of saving time I will not refer to private communications."
"Nevertheless, how is it that there are four Commissioners and four different views?"
"What message, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, can I pass on to Greek farmers who have converted or wish to convert their crops to produce first-generation biofuels following the restructuring of the CMO in sugar?"
"(RO) For the near festival organized by the European Parliament as part of the intercultural dialogue, each country was requested to produce a film on this theme."
"From what I understand, Romania's initial proposal was not accepted for the reason of not answering to the theme, but the production replacing it, namely the film California Dreaming, has even bigger shortcomings."
"The first one is that it answers even less to the theme, despite its opening night at Cannes, mystifying the reality and altering my country's image."
"While all the other films transpose the intercultural dialogue at a personal, human level, the film California Dreaming relates an imaginary case of an American transport through Romania, which is stopped by the local authorities and ends in a civil war."
"Moreover, the film is pigmented with obscene language, and scenes of explicit sex and violence, a unique case in the festival."
"I don't believe all these are virtues of the intercultural dialogue."
"But the biggest shortcoming is that, apparently, this film was not selected by the Romanian party, but by the European Parliament public servants."
"If this is true, the situation is serious, because an apolitical concept, such as the intercultural dialogue, is consciously politicized for obscure reasons, thus damaging the image of a European Union Member State."
"Consequently, I request the European Parliament to examine this matter."
"(ES) Mr President, transparency must be one of the cornerstones of EU institutions: for this Parliament too, and even more so for the European Commission, where senior officials have immense power, but hardly any political control at all."
"Thus I wish to denounce in this House the Commission's practice of replying to political resolutions of this House through mechanisms similar to the times of the 'Politburo' or 'Kremlinologists' who analysed documents."
"I refer, for instance, although this is only one example, to the Minutes of the sitting of 13 December 2007, under the heading 'Action taken on Parliament's resolutions', where it is stated that a Commission communication on the action taken on a resolution adopted by Parliament had been distributed."
"This text, Mr President, is published in English and French, not in all the official Community languages, as SP/207/5401, on a web page it took me three weeks to find with the assistance of secretarial staff and other House officials."
"Without transparency there can be no democracy; what we have here is hypocrisy in the Commission's discourse, claiming it has consulted Parliament and subsequently burying its documents and replies on the web without publicising them in any way."
"(PL) Mr President, the debate on genetically modified organisms has come to the fore again in recent weeks."
"Polish farmers could reduce production costs by introducing GMOs, but do not wish to do so."
"This is because they want to protect European consumers and ensure that Polish agri-food products remain both healthy and good to eat."
"Unfortunately, however, Polish farmers are bound by Union provisions."
"Each Member State of the Union ought to be able to decide for itself whether or not to introduce genetically modified organisms on its territory."
"Given that European taxpayers are already making a substantial contribution to supporting agriculture, agricultural products ought at least to be healthy, good to eat, and not contain any surprises."
"Mr President, on Wednesday this week, Parliament will discuss the Lisbon Treaty, and citizens will watch this House on these institutional questions."
"But citizens are even more interested to see European institutions tackle the practical question of European policy-making."
"One of the most important issues is transparency and lobbying."
"The EU Commission was well-advised, three years ago, to launch a so-called transparency initiative, but now we hear that the Commission wants to present a register in which no names of lobbyists would appear and no meaningful information on how much money is spent on lobbying would be available."
"I warn the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and I also warn Mr Kallas not to undermine the credibility you have in Europe on the transparency initiative, but to come up with a meaningful register."
"This is what citizens need, to believe in fair policy-making and decision-making in Brussels."
"(CS) My original intention was to address an entirely different topic."
"Circumstances however, have forced me to express my opinion on a particularly serious matter, the proclamation of independence of Kosovo by Albanian separatists."
"I am convinced that this development, which is contrary to international law, will have tragic consequences and repercussions for all of Europe."
"It is particularly tragic that the EU intends to endorse this act of separatism carried out at the expense of Serbia, an already heavily tried sovereign state."
"This is fundamentally unacceptable."
"The whole scenario of this separatist act reminds me vividly of events that took place in 1938 in my own home country of Czechoslovakia."
"At the time an act of separatism carried out by German nationalists and also supported at the time by the Western powers was followed by the most terrible war in history."
"It is well known that history either repeats itself as a farce or as a tragedy."
"We must not allow either of these situations to arise."
"I call on this House to oppose this separatist act and infringement of Serbian sovereignty."
"(BG) Mr. Chairman, Dear colleagues, I am taking the floor, urged by a huge social, economic, environmental and moral problem which has been eroding the Bulgarian society for 18 years now."
"Instead of being resolved, it continues to grow like a malignant tumour with unpredictable consequences."
"I am talking about Kremikovtzi Metallurgical Works, which is supposed to play a strategic role in the Bulgarian economy."
"Unfortunately, over the last decade and a half, instead of generating revenues to the treasury, it has turned into a canker for the whole society."
"It is used only for the private gain of certain mafia groups and as a source to fill the coffers of political parties."
"And all this has been going on under the protection of several governments in a row, including the incumbent one."
"It is particularly alarming that the current crisis of Kremikovtzi, faced with the real threat of closing down and depriving ten thousand workers and their families of livelihood, is the direct result of the actions of people linked to both the criminal underworld and the top establishment."
"These are the former CEO Valentin Zakhariev, the former Prosecutor General Nikola Filchev, and the former head of the specialised police task forces (""the berrets”) Filko Slavov."
"Their names are associated not only with the management of Kremikovtzi but also with the darkest sides of Bulgagria's transition to democracy, including the assassination of the military prosecutor Nikolay Kolev."
"As it turns out these people have enjoyed and continue to enjoy protection by the judiciary and the government."
"They continue to feel above the laws."
"I am confident that it is inconceivable for a member state to..."
"(The Chairman interrupts the speaker)"
"(RO) Mr. President, dear colleagues, at the beginning of February, the European Commission published the Interim Report on Progress in Romania with Judiciary Reform."
"This year's Final Report is prepared for June and will decide whether the safeguard clause will be applied or not."
"I believe this will not be the case, since the institutions criticized for staying behind can solve their problems in the four monitored fields during this period."
"The enforcement of the safeguard clause would mean non-recognition of the court orders in the Member States, which would affect the citizens and parties to proceedings who are not to blame for the fact that the relevant institutions, the Government and the Parliament, fail to fulfil their obligations."
"The enforcement of the safeguard clause should be considered as not to be directed against the Romanian citizens because it is normal for those who are guilty of not meeting their obligations to answer for it, and not the Romanian citizens."
"(HU) Mr President, on 13 February Australia's Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a formal apology on behalf of the Australian government for the indignities inflicted on the indigenous Aboriginal population over two centuries."
"This gesture speaks for itself, and it is especially topical for us here in Europe."
"More than 60 years on from the tragic events that occurred during and after the second World War, there is a country in Europe where three million people - your people, Mr President - were driven into exile, while another half a million citizens were deprived of their citizenship, their human rights and their property."
"To this date, no apology has been made."
"Europe is built not on nationalism and confrontation, but on apologies and forgiveness, on the politics of reconciliation."
"Instead of focusing on collective guilt and scapegoat-seeking, it would be good if the leaders of every Member State in the European Union and in Europe were guided by a commitment to adhere unconditionally to fundamental European values, to respect each other, to apologise, and to protect human and minority rights. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, next Sunday, on 24 February, Estonians will celebrate the 90th anniversary of the birth of their independent statehood."
"In spite of being a relatively young state, Estonia has been part of European cultural heritage and shared values since the 13th century."
"However, a special feature of the 90 years since the proclamation of independence that we share with our neighbours - Latvians and Lithuanians - is that we have enjoyed freedom for only 39 years, because of foreign occupations."
"Therefore, I would like to recall one important fact: exactly 25 years ago, the European Parliament, as the first European institution to do so, reacted to the appeal of 45 freedom fighters from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and adopted a resolution supporting the idea of restoring sovereignty to the three occupied Baltic nations."
"I would like to thank all previous and current Members of the European Parliament who courageously expressed solidarity with the three Baltic nations."
"Mr President, in the lead-up to the Beijing Olympics, the focus of the international community is on China's record for violations of human rights."
"However, we must not forget that other species, primarily the tigers, are suffering too."
"Their numbers are being devastated due to huge demand - largely from China - for tiger-related products."
"The cause of their looming extinction is the illegal poaching of tigers in India."
"Even in reserves, keepers have been shot to get at the tigers."
"These are then illegally transported across the border to China."
"It is estimated that one tiger is killed every day."
"At this rate the tiger will be virtually extinct within the next five years."
"I welcome the news last week that the Indian Government plans to create eight new reserves to protect their dwindling population of tigers."
"Nevertheless, it will take five years to set up new reserves, and in the last five years the population of tigers has already dropped by over 50%."
"Therefore, unless the European Union and international community take urgent action in curbing demand and tackling illegal poaching and trafficking, and changing attitudes in China on tiger-related products, the new reserves will be too little too late."
"Finally, I hope you will support me on Tiger Protection Awareness Day."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the blatantly racist comments made by Mr Silvio Berlusconi last week, in which he called for zero tolerance towards Roma, illegal immigrants and criminals, are shocking and unacceptable."
"In a statement yesterday, Mr Francesco Storace, who is running for mayor of the Italian capital, spoke of 'denomadising' Rome, thereby making it clear that Roma have no place in the eternal city."
"Can these statements be happening just 18 days after the European Parliament adopted a resolution on a European Strategy on the Roma?"
"I would ask my fellow Members from Italy to explain to their colleagues at home why it was that we supported this resolution, the objectives it contains that we formulated together, and why abusing Gypsies is inappropriate in the 21st century."
"The open letter published by me in connection with these anti-Romani statements was signed by a total of 72 Roma non-governmental organisations including 33 in Italy, 12 in Hungary, 9 in Macedonia, 4 in Romania, 3 in Turkey, 2 in Moldova, 5 in Bulgaria, and 2 in France. Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Alexander Milinkiewicz, the leader of the opposition in Belarus, has been detained once again in Minsk today."
"Mr Milinkiewicz is a Sakharov laureate. The European Parliament awarded him this prize in 2006."
"Mrs Olga Kazulin has also been detained."
"She is the wife of Mr Alexander Kazulin, a prominent opponent of Mr Lukaszenko."
"Mr Milinkiewicz took part in a demonstration organised by private entrepreneurs, whose freedom of action has been restricted by new provisions increasing their tax burden and restricting their freedom to employ workers."
"It was not the first demonstration in which this social group had expressed its discontent."
"The march organisers were also detained and interrogated along with Mr Milinkiewicz and Mrs Kazulin, who had not participated in the march."
"How many times has Europe watched passively whilst the one of its own laureates was detained?"
"How many times have human rights been violated with impunity just beyond the Union's eastern border?"
"(PL) Mr President, last week the Polish media reported the story of Karolina, a young girl whose life has been ruined by her former boyfriend."
"Without her knowledge or consent, the boyfriend recorded their shared private experiences and posted the recordings on the Internet after the end of their relationship."
"Karolina's family and friends received e-mails containing pornographic material."
"As she is not a minor, Karolina is not protected under Polish law and the perpetrator of this action remains unpunished."
"The Polish authorities have undertaken to change the law at the earliest opportunity, so as to protect individuals whose privacy and dignity have been violated in this way."
"The Internet transcends national borders, however, and there is no common Union legislation to deter potential perpetrators and penalise those who commit actions of this kind."
"I appeal to the Commission and to the Member States to combat such behaviour, which could be described as rape over the Internet."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, too many animal sanctuaries in Europe basically serve only one purpose, and that is to dispose of stray cats and dogs."
"This sounds cruel in itself, but the real cruelty is only revealed in the methods deployed for this purpose, which entail every conceivable form of barbarity, from poisoning to starvation and clubbing to death."
"The worst aspect of this scenario, however, is that these cruel acts are not taking place far away in distant countries; no, as committed activists from Austria have told me, they are happening right on our doorsteps."
"Cases of animal cruelty only recently came to light in the Czech Republic, for example."
"What is also worrying is the Commission's brief and pithy statement that the protection of domestic animals still falls within the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"It seems that the Commission very often acts when it is not supposed to, and takes far too little action when it ought to."
"This situation must change, for a national competence does not mean that the EU should distance itself from an issue entirely."
"I therefore appeal to all Members not to kill off the issue of animal killing stations in their own countries by remaining silent."
"I also appeal to the Commission and the Council to condemn these cruel acts."
"Mr President, I am seriously concerned by the misconception that a colleague of mine, Sahra Wagenknecht, spread in an interview with the Russian news agency 'Regnum' on 7 February this year."
"She accused the Estonian Government of disregarding human rights, and the European Union of conducting a silent cover-up with regard to the 'Bronze Night' and the trials that followed in Estonia."
"I can assure you that the ongoing trials of the people accused of organising the riots are being carried out in accordance with the rule of law and with respect for human rights."
"I would also like to remind my colleague that one of the purposes of the state is to guard the sanctity of private property."
"The marauding in Tallinn last year had nothing to do with freedom of expression or the right to demonstrate."
"Criminal acts were committed, and that is why the state was obliged to intervene."
"Justification of crime is no ennoblement to a politician and, fortunately, the views of Sahra Wagenknecht cannot to be said to extend to all the political left."
"(PL) Mr President, the Parliament in Kosovo declared independence yesterday."
"Serbia has therefore lost the cradle of its nationhood for the second time in history."
"I would remind the House that the Turks first seized this province from Serbia in the Middle Ages."
"In our times, supported by Member States of the Union and by our own silence, Serbia has once again suffered the loss of this territory, which is so precious to it."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Kosovo's declaration of independence constitutes a violation of international law on the inviolability and integrity of borders and countries."
"Kosovo's declaration of independence also amounts to opening Pandora's box, because it will foster extremism and nationalism and may fuel extremism of all kinds within Europe and beyond."
"We already have to deal, amongst other things, with similar claims in Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh and the Basque Country."
"This is a very ill-judged move as far as one particular Member State is concerned, namely Cyprus."
"How is that country supposed to respond? Cyprus is striving for reunification at the same time as we are supporting separatist movements."
"We should not accept the independence of Kosovo, because it poses a threat to the security of Europe and above all to the internal security of Serbia."
"(DE) Mr President, Russia will be holding presidential elections at the beginning of March, but there are few signs of a positive outcome being likely."
"What has happened in the run-up to these elections?"
"The opposition has been systematically obstructed and silenced, press freedom comprehensively curtailed, and the arrangements for the elections disrupted."
"Let me give you just one example: the Russian opposition politician Garry Kasparov, who is highly critical of the Kremlin, was arrested again by the police last week on completely spurious grounds."
"What will happen during the election?"
"There will be no transparency in these elections, for Russia has put obstacles in the way of election monitoring by the OSCE."
"What will happen after the election?"
"It is highly unlikely that the human rights situation will improve under a President Dmitry Medvedev enthroned by Putin."
"The EU must take action here."
"The Russian population should not be left to cope on its own."
"(Applause)"
"(HU) Mr President, Kosovo's independence signifies a major change in the Balkans."
"This step, albeit painful, seems to be another inevitable rung on the ladder towards settlement in the Balkans."
"As far as Kosovo's future is concerned, we need a solution that will secure the collective and individual rights of an indigenous minority, the Serbs, and ensure that they can continue to live as a community in their historic birthplace."
"If some of them nevertheless wish to leave Kosovo, however, we must prevent them from going to areas of Serbia inhabited by other ethnic groups, such as the Albanian-populated southern areas or the Hungarian-populated northern regions."
"A mass influx of this sort would simply create new tensions between the Serbs, who are understandably irritated at present, and these minorities."
"By averting this risk we could facilitate another settlement that would include the long-term, and not merely superficial, regulation of relations between Belgrade and Novi Sad, and between the indigenous minorities in Vojvodina and the state; it could also help to break the deadlock and enable a functioning state to be established in Bosnia."
"Desirable developments such as these would be fostered by the system of ethnic rights and tolerance that is now to be put in place in Kosovo. Thank you, Mr President."
"Mr President, I wish to point out that there are genuine concerns amongst trade unions in many Member States about the recent European Court judgment on the Laval issue."
"The Commission must urgently publish its view on how this decision impacts on the labour relations systems and, indeed, the collective bargaining systems of each of our Member States."
"I know the impact in Sweden is significant, and it is much less so in Ireland."
"Nevertheless, action is needed to make clear that the EU does not sanction social dumping anywhere."
"It is particularly important that the Commission and the Member States take steps to prevent the catastrophist predictions of the Euro-sceptics becoming the common view of the issue."
"Genuine concerns need to be addressed and any loopholes for the unscrupulous to exploit must be closed off in European and legislative initiatives by European and national parliaments."
"I urge you, Mr President, to convey this matter to Commissioner Špidla and Commissioner McCreevy, both of whom have a role in this matter."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"In my earlier intervention I mentioned that I am able to speak in my mother tongue here, but am not able to do so at home."
"By 'here' of course I was referring to the European Parliament, and 'at home', obviously enough, refers to the Slovak national parliament."
"Outside parliament we can of course use our mother tongue; we can even use it in some higher education institutions, albeit to a much lesser extent than is warranted in view of the proportion of Hungarian speakers in the population."
"Of the 6.4% ethnic Hungarians in the population, barely 4% are represented in higher education and only 1.6% are studying in their mother tongue."
"For the first time in around 50 years, Hungarian-speaking Csángó children in eastern parts of Romania are able to learn Hungarian again, although in some villages this only takes place outside of school, if at all."
"In spite of this, the statement made by Commissioner Orban on the so-called 'second mother tongue' was encouraging."
"We are sure that from now on the majority ethnic groups in European countries will place importance not only on the acquisition of the official language of the state, but also on ensuring that other groups living alongside them are able to preserve their mother tongue and learn it at every level in their own education institutions, and that they are able to use their mother tongue in the public administration, in the courts and in the legislature."
"2008 is the Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"May it live up to its name. Thank you."
"(BG) Mr. Chairman, All countries are affected by the problem of raising children in a disadvantaged position."
"Children's rights and their protection call for an integrated policy."
"The reduction of the number of institutionalised children is a wonderful goal but, in all countries, there will always be children in need of care by society because they have no parents or they are socially disadvantaged for other reasons."
"What we need is solidarity with these children and these countries rather than ostentatious clout that degrades their dignity."
"I call upon the European Commission to undertake the development of special programmes for children in disadvantaged position, taking into account what the Member States have achieved and preventing any attempts at tarnishing their good name."
"The dissemination of biased information, as is the case with a home in Bulgaria, should not be encouraged."
"This affects the image of my country. It does not contribute positively to the common European policy."
"We need programmes for productive education of socially disadvantaged children, regardless of the manner and place in which they are raised; prevention of the exploitation of child labour and the involvement of children in various activities which affect their behaviour negatively."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to remind you that on 13 December 2006 the United Nations plenary session ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."
"The ratification of this convention has been ongoing since March 2007, but only 16 countries, two of which are EU Member States, have ratified it."
"I think that since the EU has promoted a policy supporting the rights of the disabled in culture and human dignity, all Member States should ratify this convention."
"Its 50 articles describe in detail the rights of persons with special needs in every area of human activity (health, justice, family) and call for them to participate in decision making."
"(RO) The European nationality offers a series of rights and freedoms on the entire EU territory."
"For this reason, by signing the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Member States undertook the obligation to prohibit any discrimination."
"Nevertheless, a few days ago, I was informed about the case of a Romanian citizen who was not allowed to rent a car in Brussels for the reason of having Romanian nationality."
"The employee's refusal was merely based on an internal rule of the given car rental office."
"In recent days, I have found out from various citizens of my country of many other cases of discrimination on the criterion of Romanian nationality."
"Dear colleagues, it is our duty, as representatives of over 490,000,000 Europeans, to raise an alarm."
"Through an active dialogue with our fellow citizens, we can contribute so that such incidents would be avoided in the future."
"I consider it to be the European Union's duty, as a democratic entity, to promote respect for the rights of all the Union's citizens by initiating European programmes of education and information against discrimination."
"I also request the European Commission to verify whether the Member States comply with the obligations they undertook via treaties, regarding discrimination based on nationality."
"(CS) In your contribution you spoke about the importance of ensuring that the International Protectorate in Kosovo remains part of Serbia in conformity with Resolution 1244 and international law."
"I am not sure what relation this has with the proclamation of independence of Kosovo, with which you seem to agree."
"You are certainly right in saying that it is our duty to ensure that Kosovo become once more multiethnic and democratic."
"This unilateral proclamation of independence is an unprecedented breach of international law."
"Several hundred thousand inhabitants of this territory, who belong to eight different ethnic groups, were banned from their homes with the silent consent of the occupation forces."
"It is difficult to believe that these forces have not been able to create conditions for their return."
"Today, instead of helping to create such conditions, you agree with the unilateral proclamation of a second Albanian state."
"Mr President, does it not matter to you that the economy of this state seems to be dependant on opium trade in Europe?"
"The Parliament of the Czech Republic as well as Parliaments of other countries has demanded a solution to this issue through international negotiations."
"Let us realise that one-off solutions, as mentioned in your contribution, do not exist."
"Any solution sets a precedent."
"Let us not allow the breach of the Serbian sovereignty."
"Mr Kohlíček, may I recommend that you read my statement through again."
"I think that might clear up any misunderstandings."
"(HU) Mr President, I would like to offer my congratulations to the Albanian people of Kosovo on achieving independence, and to pay tribute to the memory of Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova."
"Every settlement plan put forward in the past decade and a half of the Yugoslav region's tragic history has been conceived in terms of peoples' self-regulation, of autonomies, and of power-sharing."
"The realisation of the Ahtisaari plan, the latest in a series that includes the Carrington Plan, the Dayton Agreement, the Rambouillet negotiations, and the Ohrid Agreement, also demonstrates that there is still a long way to go before we can consider relations among the different ethnic groups and national communities in our region to have been settled."
"It also shows, however, that in future a solution to every crisis can be found by means of international cooperation."
"In this sense the Kosovo settlement sets an example and a precedent for us."
"We are confident that a successful outcome to the peaceful struggle for autonomy by ethnic Hungarians in Romania, and that of the Szekler Land for territorial autonomy, can also be achieved with the beneficial involvement of the European Union."
"(SK) On 25 February 1948 the communists carried out a coup d'état and established a totalitarian regime in our country."
"This was the result of events that had been taking place in the country since 1946."
"Czechoslovakia was gradually losing freedom within the democratic environment of the re-established state."
"This is extremely important."
"Not only the defeat of Nazism but also the defeat of Communism is part of the heritage of united and peaceful Europe."
"Thanks to this event the representatives of ten Member States are able to sit in this House today."
"I would like to draw your attention to three issues."
"There must be an equal condemnation of the rehabilitation of both the communist and nazi symbols."
"Both Communism and Nazism must be perceived as being equal, in particular because of the victims for whom they are responsible."
"Both the communist and the nazi totalitarian regimes were established in democratic states through the abuse of democracy."
"This is a reason for being vigilant even today, in the European Union."
"The victims of Communism would also deserve a minute silence observed in this House."
"(EL) Mr President, according to the provisions of the CMO in tobacco, from 2009 the resources that are now given as direct subsidies to growers from pillar 1 will be transferred to pillar 2, which deals with structural measures."
"In my country, Greece, tobacco is usually grown in semi-barren areas by poor farmers who have no other options."
"Therefore, if tobacco-growing is stopped in certain areas we will have social, economic and environmental problems."
"I have also observed that the aim is tobacco-growing rather than smoking."
"Thus if we put a stop to tobacco-growing at the same time as smoking, we should all be in agreement, and this is how things ought to be."
"This is not the case, however."
"The European cigarette industry will continue to produce cigarettes, but all the tobacco will simply be imported from third countries."
"We should therefore take the opportunity presented by the CAP review to try to remedy this wrong; we must show that the EU is a place of equality, justice and solidarity."
"This is why I ask for the present regime to be maintained after 2009 and for tobacco growers to continue..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) On 4 February 2008, the Romanian Parliament ratified the European Union Reform Treaty."
"We welcome this ratification in the Romanian Parliament."
"The Reform Treaty reaffirms the principle of equality of its citizens, gives legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, introduces the control of subsidiarity by national parliaments, recognizes universal access to the services of general economic interest, emphasizes the importance of energy security and strengthens the spirit of solidarity between Member States in this field, and imposes special measures to the fight against climate changes."
"The introduction of the territorial cohesion concept and its recognition as an objective caused the European Parliament committees, with an important role in defining the structural and cohesion policies, to have increased activity after the ratification of the treaty."
"From the point of view of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, the Reform Treaty legalizes the procedure of co-decision, which is already used in the field of maritime and air navigation and provides a legal basis for the European Parliament to be able to propose support actions for consolidating the identity of the tourism sector."
"(HU) Thank you, Mr President."
"This is the umpteenth time that I have spoken in this Parliament about the ongoing contamination of the River Raba over the past seven years."
"We have obtained several promises from the Austrian agencies concerned, and indeed the Austrian and Hungarian authorities have devised a plan of action."
"The European Union has been observing this process closely, and the river committee set up by the two countries confers regularly - most recently just this week."
"It seems that the politicians are doing their bit, but the thing is that in the meantime the river is dying."
"Now, moreover, it is dying not only on the Hungarian side, but on the Austrian side too."
"Eleven species of fish have so far died out, and 13 are seriously endangered."
"Greenpeace has carried out spot checks on water samples on several occasions, and has established that the Austrian factories are illegally contaminating the water, exceeding permitted levels many times over."
"On the river itself, meanwhile, there is more foam than ever."
"The river I am speaking of is not a sewer, Mr President, but a Natura 2000 site, a genuine river wetland."
"The people who live there feel that either the EU legislation is not good, or compliance with it is inadequate."
"I think that we in this House must keep this matter on the agenda until it has been resolved once and for all. Thank you."
"I will certainly be doing so."
"(RO) Mr. President, dear colleagues, the financial instruments related to the European Union cohesion policy have a major importance in reducing discrepancies between the regions of Europe."
"In the case of the newest European Union Member States, the funds allocated by way of the cohesion policy have a crucial contribution to ensuring the future development of the less prosperous regions in these countries."
"The absorption rate of these funds in the new Member States is continuously increasing."
"The Union has to adjust the resources allocated by the instruments of the cohesion policy to the reality of an enlarged Europe."
"Following Romania's and Bulgaria's accession, the guarantee of increasing the financial resources of the cohesion policy after 2013 has become a requirement."
"The increase of the cohesion funds is a logical consequence of the recent Union enlargement and it will prove the consistency of the Union's policy as regards the European regions that are less developed and will represent a strong political signal to the new Member States."
"(SK) Recently we have had much debate about energy efficiency."
"Practice shows that current labelling of domestic appliances that informs consumers about how energy-intensive the appliances are does not represent reliable evidence."
"Since most appliances sold in shops belong to category A, clear information about the energy savings generated from the use of the appliance is lost and the manufacturer loses the motivation to produce an energy-efficient appliance."
"If we want to motivate consumers and manufacturers, we have to ensure that domestic appliances are sorted according to new energy categories."
"The original categorisation of appliances has been in operation since 1994."
"I appeal to the European Commission to speed up both the preparation of the new system of labelling appliances and the process of including other appliances in this system that is also under way."
"Mr President, I wish to raise an issue in relation to the payment of REPS to farmers."
"Over the last 14 years, REPS have been paid at a very early stage once the documentation has been filed with the Commission or with the Department of Agriculture in Ireland."
"I now understand that the payments are going to be delayed, and that over 6 000 farmers are already behind in respect of receiving payments."
"I also understand that this figure will rise to over 60 000 in the next few months."
"The point is that farmers have planned their financial affairs for a 12-month period and have planned with their banks, and now many of them will not be able to make their repayments to the banks as a result of this change."
"I would ask for my views to be conveyed to the Commissioner and for this matter to be resolved so that the old procedure -which was in place for 14 years - can be restored."
"(FR) Mr President, international law is quite clear on this point."
"As far as Kosovo is concerned a state is said to exist when, firstly, it has a population, secondly a territory and, thirdly, public services."
"There are no public services in Kosovo, and the Commission only needs to go there to see as much."
"The only service that operates there is the mafia."
"A state is sovereign when it has full powers of authority."
"Proof, as the President of Parliament has just told us, that Kosovo's powers of authority have been in a state of supervised sovereignty."
"A state is sovereign when its authority is independent, autonomos in Greek, that is to say when it can decide for itself what it does."
"In Kosovo it is NATO and the United States that decide."
"A state is sovereign when its authority is exclusive."
"Within the territory of Kosovo, however, there are several forces at work, not just a single one."
"A state is sovereign when it respects the principle of uti possidetis, the inviolability of borders."
"In other words, Kosovo does not meet any of the criteria required of a sovereign state under international law."
"And why?"
"Because after setting up delinquent states and gangster states we are now inventing laboratory states where the European Commission tests and invents federalism by breaking-up countries."
"(SK) Kosovo's declaration of independence yesterday probably is, and will be, a dangerous precedent for the development of various countries and regions of the world."
"The fact that this act has enjoyed significant political and diplomatic support of the US and of the majority of the large states of the European Union makes it even more questionable, as it has been clear since the beginning that this is a violation of international law."
"A much better solution for the Balkans would be for the European Union to contribute to greater democratisation in Serbia."
"This would in turn create a more positive atmosphere in the process of consolidation of relations between the Serbs and the Albanian minority in their common territory."
"Of course this would clearly be a long-term affair."
"It is also naive to think that the calls for the rights of minorities to territorial autonomy, boosted by this precedent, will not become an irresolvable problem even for the Member States of the European Union themselves in the near future."
"Mr President, could I support my colleague and urge the Commission not to keep picking rows with different sections of the Irish authorities for the next few months, because we have a rather important job on hand?"
"Need I spell out exactly what will be required of the Irish in relation to the Lisbon Treaty?"
"I rise particularly to complain about the way the officials have picked on the REPS payment system in Ireland."
"For over 14 years the Department of Agriculture authorities in Ireland - with the acquiescence of the Commission - had a scheduled payment of the Rural Environment Protection Scheme payments to thousands of farmers and their families."
"Now this year, in the last month, the Commission have decided that it cannot be paid now, it must be paid at the end of the year."
"Please do not pick rows with Irish farmers or any section in Ireland this year above all years, and let them have the monies they are entitled to have, in the way they have been paid for over 14 years now."
"Now is not the time to pick rows."
"Please hear us."
"That concludes the item."
"Request for defence of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Witold Tomczak (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Sakalas, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the request for defence of the immunity and privileges of Witold Tomczak."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, in April 2005 Mr Tomczak requested that the European Parliament defend his immunity in criminal proceedings, but Parliament decided, a year later, not to defend his immunity."
"On 21 May 2007, Mr Tomczak again requested that the European Parliament defend his immunity."
"In the new request, Mr Tomczak presented three new arguments concerning the same case."
"The first argument: Mr Tomczak complains that the Court of Ostrów did not grant him access to the files of the case."
"However, after examination of his complaint, it was found that Mr Tomczak was granted access to the files when he visited the court himself."
"He even photographed at least one of the documents."
"The second argument: Mr Tomczak claims that the proceedings are not objective, as the supervisory judge made a request to the judge presiding in the case to deliver the judgment as soon as possible, even without the presence of the accused."
"However, this request was issued after Mr Tomczak had failed to appear at the court hearings on as many as 12 occasions."
"The third argument: Mr Tomczak alleges that the Court of Ostrów is prejudiced against his person."
"However, the fact, declared by Mr Tomczak, that the judge presiding in the case lives in the same town as the prosecutor against whom Mr Tomczak had previously filed charges does not in itself prevent that judge from acting objectively."
"In addition, Mr Tomczak has the opportunity to appeal to a higher court and to make a cassation complaint to the Polish Supreme Court."
"The argument put forward by Mr Tomczak, who was a member of the Polish Parliament in 1999, that his national parliamentary immunity remained a formal obstacle to the criminal proceedings should be duly considered by the Polish judicial authorities."
"The problematic legal consequence that, according to Polish law, Mr Tomczak might lose his seat in this Parliament has been noted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, and its chairman put an oral question to the Commission."
"It was answered on 14 January 2008 by Commissioner Frattini, who promised to address the Polish authorities, with the aim of ensuring that Polish law does not discriminate between Members of the European Parliament and national parliamentarians."
"After the debate with the Commission, the Committee on Legal Affairs took a decision not to recommend the defence of Mr Tomczak's parliamentary immunity on the above grounds."
"It is clear that Articles 8 and 9 of the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of the European Communities are not applicable in the case of Mr Tomczak."
"His request should be treated as a request for a decision of the European Parliament to ask for suspension of the proceedings against him, as, for example, is possible under Article 105 of the Polish constitution."
"Following its established practice, Parliament could decide to defend the immunity of one of its Members if a suspicion existed that the prosecution was based on an intention to prejudice a member's political activities (fumus persecutionis)."
"There is no clear evidence of this kind in the case of Mr Tomczak."
"In the light of the above considerations, I recommend that the immunity of Mr Tomczak should not be defended."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the main purpose of parliamentary immunity is to protect Parliament itself as a democratically elected representative body."
"It ensures the collective independence of this institution against external pressure and guarantees Members freedom of speech and action whilst undertaking their parliamentary duties."
"The legal basis of the immunity of Members of the European Parliament is laid down in the 1965 Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Communities."
"Article 8 of the Protocol states that Members of the European Parliament shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties."
"Similarly, Article 9 states that during sessions of the European Parliament, its Members shall enjoy in the territory of their own State, the immunities accorded to members of their parliament, and in the territory of any other Member State, immunity from any measure of detention and from legal proceedings."
"This immunity also applies to Members while they are travelling to and from the place of meeting of the European Parliament."
"Pursuant to the above, it should be noted that the charge against Mr Tomczak does not relate to opinions expressed or votes cast by him in the course of his official duties, because he was not a Member of the European Parliament at the time of the events in question."
"In view of the circumstances, therefore, there is no legal basis for granting Mr Tomczak parliamentary immunity."
"Mr Tomczak's case has, however, highlighted the lack of consistency between arrangements for election to the Polish Sejm and the European Parliament in Poland regarding conditions to be met by candidates for election, and the circumstances in which after being elected individuals may be deprived of their seat."
"This matter was debated at a special sitting and when Poland joined the Union it undertook to comply with the EU legislation in force, notably regarding its direct implications for the internal legislation of a Member State."
"I would like to take this opportunity to call for legislation relating to the status of Members of the Polish Sejm and European Parliament to be harmonised at the earliest opportunity."
"As things stand at present, a Member of the European Parliament may automatically lose his or her seat as a result of certain actions, whilst a Member of the Polish Sejm may not be penalised in any way for the same actions."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Tomczak's case is an example of the Polish judicial system's failure to recognise that when Poland became a Member of the European Union it undertook to comply with the legal system in force in the latter."
"The European Parliament has not yet taken a decision on Mr Tomczak's immunity, but the competent court nonetheless set 15 February, last week, as the date for a sitting."
"Not only does such action by the court amount to contempt of the European Parliament, but it also fails to comply with the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure and with the Polish Penal Code, pursuant to which no penal proceedings may be brought against a Member until the European Parliament has ruled on the issue of immunity."
"The situation I have outlined leads to the conclusion that in Mr Tomczak's case we are dealing either with an exceptionally incompetent court or, alternatively, with a court intent on convicting Mr Tomczak for a minor incident, which in his case would result in him losing his seat in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I urge all Members to vote against the lifting of immunity in the Tomczak case."
"We have had a very good debate in the Chamber."
"Everyone has agreed that we cannot allow Poland to set double standards: one for MPs at home and another, much stricter one, for MEPs here."
"The responsible Commissioner, Mr Frattini, promised to send a letter to the Polish Minister for Justice to insist on identical rules for waiving immunity."
"I talked with Commissioner Frattini after the meeting on 14 January, and met with him again two weeks ago, when he said that he had instructed the services to send the letter."
"Last week I was in contact with his office."
"It confirmed that the letter had been sent, and that I would receive a copy of the letter the same day."
"Then somebody suddenly called from Commissioner Frattini's office telling me a different story, saying that the letter was still pending."
"So here we are, with no letter and no answer from the Polish Government."
"Our rules are very clear: we have to have a vote."
"I would therefore ask you to vote against the waiving of immunity, and request that the case be referred back to the committee for a possible new decision once we have received the letter from Commissioner Frattini and the answer from Poland."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I think that the consequences of the issue of waiving immunity are not the same as waiving immunity."
"Mr Tomczak was expected and summoned to appear before a court 12 times, but he did not appear at court."
"All the procedural and substantive questions raised in connection with Mr Tomczak's case, and especially the question of the alleged insulting language used against the police officers, should be resolved objectively by the Polish judicial authorities."
"Therefore, I would like to stress two points."
"The question of whether the immunity of Mr Tomczak was properly waived at the beginning of the proceedings, when he was a member of the Polish Parliament, is a question that can be verified only by the appropriate judicial authority in Poland, in this case the District Court in Ostrów Wielkopolski. There is always the possibility of appeal."
"Secondly, the possibility of Mr Tomczak's losing his seat in this Parliament cannot be considered as a motive for the prosecution, as, at the time of the incident of 19 June 2004, Mr Tomczak was not a Member of the European Parliament, and the law applicable to national parliamentarians does not contain provisions for such consequences."
"On the basis of the above considerations, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should not defend the parliamentary immunity of Mr Tomczak."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Transparency in financial matters (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Pomés Ruiz, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on transparency in financial matters."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, our European Parliament has always wished to implement a policy of transparency with regard to our funds, the EU's funds."
"Such was the case when, perhaps through mismanagement, problems arose that forced the Commission headed by Mr Santer to resign."
"Since then it must be said that things have improved considerably; this Parliament has propelled a policy of transparency, and the Commission has supported the Parliament."
"The result of this interest on the part of the Barroso Commission is the creation of nothing less than a Vice-Presidency to achieve this objective, represented here by Vice-President Siim Kallas, whom I welcome."
"European citizens must know what we do with the very small amount of money they pay to the EU, what we do with that scant 1%; we must have more control over Community funds through visibility."
"Visibility is no longer just a notice hung up in a town hall or on a building site financed with regional funds or the Cohesion Fund; we have to go much further, and it must be possible to determine the whereabouts of that small amount of money provided by European taxpayers through Member States."
"That is the Transparency Initiative, which this Parliament supports wholeheartedly. This own-initiative report we are submitting says two things."
"The first is that a little more must be done."
"In the text we have chosen to say that transparency must be manifested by the publication of black lists and information as to which tenderers have been accepted and which have been excluded, and OLAF must have a code to guarantee the presumption of innocence, which has not been the case on many occasions."
"In other words, within the EU, the European Parliament already has its own code of ethics."
"We are not officials, we are politicians; we must be transparent too, and we already are."
"Thus in Amendment 2 to paragraph 22, I request that the list proposed by the Transparency Initiative be removed, in the main not only because this Parliament has already taken decisions on our financial interests, missions and travel, but because we also feel there must be rules for the entire European Union."
"This Parliament has its own rules, but they will have to improve and perhaps go even further."
"There is another amendment where I remove the reference to MEPs as holding public posts; we do not hold public posts, we are politicians."
"This confusion could lead to problems in some national legislation."
"Through this idea of increasing transparency, which we support, we also wish to draw attention to the fact that Member States share the management of 80% of the funds, and so we again call for Member States to submit National Declarations of Assurance."
"This is urgent and necessary, and we insist it must be done."
"We are saying that the initiative presented by Commissioner Kallas must include the recovery of Community funds."
"This cannot be excluded: when our money is misused, we must know where it is, how it is to be recovered, and when it is to be recovered."
"We have made many improvements in terms of transparency, Commissioner, but this Parliament will strive to make many more."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased to be here today to speak on behalf of the Commission on this key issue of transparency."
"I must thank Mr Pomés Ruiz for this own-initiative report and the Committee on Budgetary Control for its valuable contribution."
"The report addresses five main issues."
"First, the report gives guidance on the publication of information about those receiving EU funds through grants and contracts."
"We are working to implement the terms of the modified Financial Regulation on transparency."
"These terms were included through Parliament's efforts and came into force in May 2007."
"With regard to direct management, the Commission launched a website last year, with a single portal giving access to all relevant sites in the various directorates-general."
"Although we continue to update these sites, the portal still seems a rather confusing and complicated entry point."
"The Commission services are working to improve this."
"Regarding shared management, the role of the Commission is to 'finalise and agree with Member States on the common standards of these sets of information before April 2008'."
"I am quoting here from the draft discharge report by Mr Jørgensen."
"The Member States will remain responsible for the data."
"The Commission assumes responsibility for the standards applicable and checking that Member States respect the terms of the Financial Regulation."
"The second issue in Mr Pomés Ruiz's report is the issue of recoveries."
"I clearly said in the Committee on Budgetary Control in January 2008 that 'the Commission has so far been unable to give Parliament a comprehensive picture of all our recovery efforts'."
"I gave an estimate for the recoveries made in 2006 and announced improvements to our own systems, so that, this year, the ABAC accounting system will include more detailed and complete data on recoveries."
"We are discussing the methodology for doing so with the European Court of Auditors."
"Information about recoveries would be incomplete without reliable input from the Member States."
"For agriculture, the picture is encouraging."
"Tomorrow, the Commission will adopt an action plan to strengthen our supervisory role regarding the Structural Funds, addressing this issue among other things."
"The third issue in the report relates to the declaration of financial interests and, in particular, to the results of an independent comparative study launched in July 2006, in the context of the European Transparency Initiative, and published in 2007."
"The study concluded that most of the European institutions are regulated more intensively than institutions at national level."
"The Commission and the European Investment Bank have the most comprehensive ethical rules of the EU institutions."
"While the study noted that the Commission has a relatively well developed system for notification of conflicts of interests, it suggests that consideration be given to enlarging the mandate of our ad hoc Ethical Committee to include a broader advisory role."
"I invite you to examine the study and draw whatever conclusions you think are relevant for the European Parliament."
"The fourth issue raised by Mr Pomés Ruiz concerns the composition of experts groups advising the Commission."
"I would like to thank Mr Pomés Ruiz for recognising the value of the work done so far."
"We will study the recommendations you make for further improvements."
"The fifth and final main issue concerns governance within the institutions."
"Last Friday, 15 February 2008, was the deadline for Member States to send in 'annual summaries'."
"As of noon today, we had received 22 replies from the Member States."
"We are assessing the compliance of these reports with the obligations under the Financial Regulation, and we will report to you as soon as we have a clear picture of this, including with regard to the quality of these reports."
"In conclusion, I can declare that we are taking transparency very seriously and that the European Transparency Initiative is delivering on many points raised in the report."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the transparency initiative is probably the greatest success achieved by the Barroso Commission."
"I am grateful to you, Commissioner, for your words and for the fact that you want harmonisation of the publication of information on beneficiaries of subsidies."
"This was a major point of discussion between Parliament and the Commission last year."
"As you know, this House and the PPE-DE Group have always stood by you on the issue of transparency because we want to know whether we are meeting our political objectives via the beneficiaries of the subsidies, in other words, the recipients of the funding."
"This is about meeting our political objectives, nothing else, and we need to know more than we do at present."
"Commissioner, you are working on new ethical rules."
"We believe that the institutions need these rules and the Commissioners themselves need a new code of conduct."
"However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, may I remind you that it is not up to the Commission to lay down rules for Parliament."
"We make our rules ourselves."
"We are not public officials, unlike the members of other EU institutions, although imprecise use of language could create this impression."
"We have an amendment to paragraph 22, and I would like to ask you very warmly for your support."
"We want to replace the list with a reference to the existing rules."
"Lists are all very well, but we want an open form of words which allows us to decide whether we want so many, or perhaps more - or, indeed, fewer - criteria."
"We are not satisfied - and this is part of the report - with the difficult question of the recovery of funds which have been paid out incorrectly."
"Commissioner, I think this is going to be the major issue for us this year and the main point of conflict between Parliament and the Commission."
"This is an area which is anything but transparent."
"I would ask you to tackle this problem vigorously."
"Recoveries cannot continue in the same random fashion as in the past."
"We welcome this week's action plan for the Structural Funds, but this needs to be underpinned with credibility, both for Parliament and for the discharge of the Commission."
"Our rapporteur, Javier Pomés Ruiz, has drafted a good and interesting report, and I am sure that with this report as the opinion of Parliament, we will help the Commission to make further progress."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Mr President, there is no doubt that the public debate in Europe has focused a great deal on the fact that there is a democratic deficit in the EU and that this deficit is due to not least the lack of sufficient transparency."
"In particular it may be due to the fact that there has been too little transparency concerning how the funds that the EU manages - that is, the funds that the EU pays to individual countries for good, well-intentioned projects - are used; and it is a problem!"
"It is fortunately a problem that is now being resolved."
"It is fortunately a problem that the Commission has long recognised and is actually doing something to resolve, and the Commission deserves much praise for this."
"Mr Kallas, you personally deserve much praise for the enormous contribution that you have made in connection with this."
"There are of course some matters that need to be addressed."
"This is the reason why Mr Pomés Ruiz has produced a report."
"I support his report, which highlights many points of criticism that naturally must be tackled."
"It is clear that the data available should be comparable etc., but this is a minor matter, as we have now taken the key decision that there should of course be transparency."
"Another very important decision for which the Commission deserves praise is the decision to establish greater transparency in connection with the 'expert groups'."
"It is simply not acceptable that a 'democratic' system has people in office whose names are unknown."
"There are all kinds of democratic arguments for why you cannot operate in such a way, and it is of course unacceptable from a financial perspective too."
"I can well imagine, Commissioner, that you could confirm a statement that you made in the recently completed hearing in the Committee on Budgetary Control in connection with discharge."
"In this statement, you assured us that this would naturally also apply to the groups that fall within the comitology procedure."
"There are of course many different types of expert groups."
"Some of the most important groups are actually those that fall within the comitology procedure."
"In addition, you gave this approval on several occasions in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Commissioner, could you not repeat this here in front of the entire assembly?"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, I would like to thank Mr Pomés Ruiz for a very good report which I support in its entirety."
"Transparency must be a fundamental principle of the functioning of the European Union."
"I should like to begin by saying that I consider the sections of the report concerning better information on the beneficiaries of Union funds and more transparent information on the Commission's web pages to be particularly valuable. These are important issues."
"I would also like to state that those parts of the report underlining the importance of divulging and providing information on the financial interests of holders of public office in the European institutions are equally important."
"European Union citizens need to be certain that those who handle Union funds and those who oversee their allocation act impartially and not with a view furthering their private interests."
"I believe it was right and proper for this issue to be dealt with so extensively in the report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this debate is really a warm-up act for the discharge procedure currently taking place in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and for the extraordinary hearing that we are to have next week with Commissioners Špidla and Hübner."
"A key issue in that debate is paragraph 41 of Mr Pomés Ruiz's report, in which the Commission is urged to support the issuing of National Declarations of Assurance."
"Commissioner, if you pledge to support this, the struggle we are waging in the discharge procedure will not be a struggle of Parliament against the Commission but a joint struggle: the Commission and Parliament against the Member States."
"This is the best strategy, for the internal cohesion of the Commission too."
"Transparency does indeed ensure credibility and accountability; everyone agrees on that."
"One aspect of this is indeed the publication of information about the ultimate beneficiaries of EU funds."
"It is compulsory under the Financial Regulation to provide information on this, but this information must be made accessible, it must be reliable and it must be suitable for further research."
"With all due respect, Commissioner, attempts are being made on your website but there is a long way to go."
"Some private initiatives really are doing this better."
"This report by Mr Pomés Ruiz also sets out very clearly what needs to be improved: the presentation, the content and the organisation of the information."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control is asking for this to be completed before 2009."
"I want to submit an amendment to bring this forward by one year."
"If we manage to do that, then the new Commission and the new Parliament will be able to start with a clean slate in 2009."
"I ask my fellow Members to support that amendment."
"Commissioner, I have another question to put to you: what is the state of affairs regarding the undertaking on your part set out in paragraph 34 to publish the names of all members of formal and informal groups from 2008?"
"I also endorse the question put by Dan Jørgensen on this topic."
"Finally, Mr President, I have a question for you: when will Parliament's Secretariat decide to opt for complete transparency and publish the names of all members of Parliament's voluntary pension fund?"
"After all, these people are also beneficiaries of substantial European funds."
"I ask you to convey this message to the Secretariat."
"With regard to the question asked by Mr Staes, this has of course been discussed in the Bureau and a solution will be found."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Pomés Ruiz's report is a comprehensive one."
"The problem areas are set out well and await the necessary measures."
"In this connection I would like to say to the Commission Vice-President, Mr Kallas, that during his term there have been major improvements generally to the Union's openness and transparency and he has been extremely active in this area."
"Evidence of this are the many new databases on the internet, but the problem, which the report also mentions is - and this needs to be put right - that the search procedures are still unsatisfactory. This being the case, the material on the search engines ought to be standardised."
"In other words, if there is no proper search procedure there is a danger that a lot of information will be obtained but that its very abundance will harm the quality."
"The question of the 'blacklist' of proven fraudulent actions needs to be considered."
"In principle our group approves of and is in favour of this list, but we need to ensure in particular that the data protection of individuals is guaranteed and that no one will be blacklisted this way for no good reason or because mistaken procedures were carried out."
"Then there is the question of the Advisory Committee on Standards in Public Life."
"For the Members of the European Parliament, who are directly elected by the people, it is obviously good to have a procedure which is different from that for civil servants, as Mrs Grässle has already said here."
"The procedure for elected Members must also be at least as strict, however, because there can be no grounds for asserting that ethical requirements should be relaxed as far as Members of Parliament are concerned."
"In many countries money used to finance the election of Members of Parliament is public knowledge, and it might be in order for Parliament to move in that direction, so that national declarations on election funding, on the campaign publicity of candidates and on its financing are included in Parliament's databases, making them visible at European Union level too."
"Finally I wish to say that political parties and foundations at European level cannot be made exempt from the general obligation to declare interests and sources of finance."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, it is very unusual for me to be able to respond favourably to the reports that come before us here."
"What the rapporteur has argued for here is greater transparency, and I warmly support that."
"But I would remind the House that, as long as we have such things as the agricultural policy and the structural funds, our task of scrutiny will be an entirely superhuman one."
"What we are forced to do is constantly introduce new rules, more monitoring, and we end up with a bureaucracy beyond all reason."
"The solution, as we all know, is to let the richer countries in the EU give money to the poorer countries without discussing in detail what it is to be used for."
"The major part of the scrutiny process will disappear, and that must be the long-term aim."
"We should not have to count cows and set-aside fields and all that kind of thing."
"We should concentrate on what the EU is there for - the internal market."
"- (NL) Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and I would like to mention a couple of points before making an appeal to the Council and the Commission."
"The first point is that we need to publish the recipients of financial support from the European Union."
"This concerns the agricultural sector in particular."
"We should treat this information with caution and fairness."
"We cannot have a situation where some Member States comply with the disclosure requirement and others do not."
"There are links on the Commission website to 14 national websites concerning the recipients of agricultural support, which means that there are another 13 missing."
"Perhaps the Commission could explain why that is."
"Is this information not available in electronic format or have the Member States still not supplied the figures?"
"In addition to this, the Commission should think about the protection of those recipients whose details are to be published: protection from radical animal rights activists, for instance, a problem that several Member States, including my own, are having to deal with at the moment."
"Finally, the fact is that the data are difficult to compare and so more direction from the Commission is needed."
"I understand from the Commissioner that he will take the initiative on this tomorrow in relation to the Structural Funds and I am pleased to hear that."
"My second point concerns the annual reports on the activities of the institutions, where there has been some improvement, but this is a sensitive topic."
"Now to my appeal, which is related to the fact that 80% of the funds in Europe are not managed centrally but through the Member States or in collaboration with the Member States."
"We could improve and tighten up transparency and control at European level for all eternity but as long as the Member States do not take responsibility by means of the National Declarations of Assurance, ensuring balanced control will remain difficult."
"It takes two to tango."
"We can dance the most brilliant spirited dance through the field of budgetary control at European level, but as long as the Member States do not dance along it will never be a prize-winning performance."
"I therefore call on the Member States to accept their responsibilities and I call on the Commission to support this process in connection with the national declarations, like a good conductor, shall we say, or like a dance teacher: you should know that yourself, Commissioner."
"We on this side would like to count on your support."
"(PT) Mr President, I must congratulate our rapporteur and also Mr Kallas on this initiative."
"However, in the same breath, I must tell Mr Kallas that I would be much happier if he had taken the steps needed to ensure that the European Commission was complying with the Financial Regulation rules which entered into force on 1 January 2007, particularly on the designation of end beneficiaries of the various Community funds."
"It is really a matter of great concern that the European Commission's answer to the question of whether the IMG has been lawfully and properly designated as an international organisation is wholly unsatisfactory."
"I would like to know, Commissioner, whether, in addition to this new international organisation, the European Commission has also decided to meet with others, so that we can find out who has access to Community funds without having to go through the tender procedure."
"(PL) Mr President, the allocation of funds from the various budget lines always awakens the strongest emotions and debate."
"It is entirely understandable that those who are awarded funding should rejoice, and that those who are not awarded any despite their merits should voice their criticism."
"If, however, as in the recent notorious Polish case, an entity obtains funding from one government only to have it taken away by another, a number of concerns emerge."
"What principles determine the allocation of funds, and what procedures apply? Are decisions made on the basis of facts or of base politics?"
"That is why, pursuant to the report by Mr Pomés Ruiz, we should focus not only on the clarity and transparency of procedures, but also enable society to assess the actions involved in awarding funding."
"Publishing information on beneficiaries of Union funding is a fundamental condition of the transparency of the intentions of the European Commission and the government."
"Why then are certain countries so opposed to publication?"
"Do they have something to hide?"
"This also involves information on individuals holding public office and experts at the European institutions."
"Our Union would benefit greatly from the creation of a common ethical space."
"Mr President, let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Pomés Ruiz."
"I am not doing it only because he is standing next to me and kicking me in the ankle, but because I think his report is very good indeed."
"I would like to make three points, if you would allow me."
"Firstly, I think that the aim of this report is basically to improve transparency and improve controls."
"Usually you do that three ways."
"One is to have transparency in terms of documentation: that is quite well provided for under Article 255 of the EC Treaty; secondly, transparency of finances, which is what we are doing in this report; and thirdly, of course, transparency of meetings."
"The sad thing I find in this debate - not so much inside but outside this Chamber - is that there are a lot of anti-Europeans that are using transparency in a very populist way, in the sense that, on one hand, they call for transparency, then when transparency is given, they start attacking people for it."
"I find this debate, in that sense, a little bit sad, and I think that, when we go transparent, we should be honest and straightforward about it."
"Point number two is on national declarations."
"I would like to second what Ms De Lange said about those."
"We should always stress that."
"I think Mr Kallas is doing a very good job."
"The Commission is doing a good job."
"But 80% of all the funds are actually spent by the Member States."
"That is where we need a little bit more in the financial declarations."
"I am sure, Mr Mulder, if he was here, would agree with me."
"The final point I have is on the famous, or perhaps infamous, paragraph 22 of this report."
"I see where it is coming from, but I think we should not throw the baby out with the bath-water."
"Therefore, I would recommend that we get rid of paragraph 22, so that all of us can easily vote for this report, because, after all, being against transparency is a little bit like being against peace and motherhood."
"(ES) Mr President, I wish to add my congratulations to the rapporteur, who has produced an extremely interesting report, and of course also thank the Commission, represented by its Vice-President Kallas, for all its work, positive dialogue and cooperation with the House."
"Here I simply wish to expand a little on the comments already made, most of which I agree with, and say, beyond the actual need for this information and for transparency, that it must be easily accessible, reliable and comparison-friendly; the information should be organised and classified and be of real practical use, not only for the greatest experts, but for the public at large."
"As regards shared management funds, in addition to what has already been said, we need to put pressure on the Member States in this regard, and in particular try to find instruments that improve the situation with international organisations, which often seem opaque."
"I certainly welcome the idea of creating a common ethical space."
"This is a luxury the Commission can certainly afford, and it could be exported or proposed in certain global negotiations as an example of good practice."
"I therefore particularly welcome the study being carried out by the Commission on the ethical codes and standards that may subsequently be applied to each institution."
"Finally, I congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for accepting my request concerning a code of ethics for OLAF, which is absolutely essential: on one side we have those responsible and the guilty parties, and on the other the innocent parties, whom we must protect by all means."
"(FI) Mr President, first I want to join those who have congratulated and thanked the rapporteur, Mr Pomés Ruiz, for an absolutely splendid report."
"At the same time I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Kallas, who over the years has worked very hard to promote these issues."
"The idea behind this report is such that hardly anyone here can disagree with its objectives."
"Any form of openness and transparency regarding the misuse of EU funds can only be for the good."
"In general the use of appropriations financed though tax revenues must be open."
"The taxpayer must always have accurate and proper knowledge of what their money is being spent on."
"The public must always be able to tell who is spending the money, and on what, and how much is being spent."
"We must in particular adhere to the principle of right of access and transparency when these funds are being misused."
"In my opinion, publishing the 'blacklist' of fraudulent uses of EU funds would also pre-empt possible cases of abuse and so promote openness and transparency in the use of EU resources."
"This kind of monitoring is obviously made challenging by the fact that the systems in different countries vary greatly, and for that reason it is difficult."
"I believe the report is an important step forward, and we need to find a common compromise so that the report can be adopted here and not thrown out because of a few small details."
"(DE) Mr President, I think this is a particularly good debate."
"However, I would like to warn about the abuse of transparency."
"Some populists - although they are not here in this chamber today - abuse this debate in the public arena, but in doing so, make no distinction between the private sphere and what is appropriate in the public interest."
"We must not lose sight of this privacy debate."
"We are aware that there is also justification for data protection."
"Finding a balance here is the right response from the European Parliament for the future."
"(DA) Mr President, it is a pleasure to attend the debate today."
"I recall a few years back that there were a few idiots who were demanding transparency, but now Parliament consists of nothing but idiots who are insisting upon transparency regarding the presentation of accounts."
"In addition, we have a commissioner whom we cannot criticise; instead we must also praise him for his personal contribution towards including the more sluggish parts of the Commission within the transparency reforms."
"However, I have not been elected to offer praise; I have been elected to highlight the more thorny aspects of the debate."
"Therefore, I would like to ask Mr Kallas whether next year there will be exceptions within the area of agriculture for which there will not be a full presentation of accounts on the Internet, and for which we will not be able to see who receives what and the corresponding amounts in other areas."
"Will there be exceptions, or will every expense be accounted for on the Internet?"
"And what about the working groups: will the names of all the experts be given?"
"Finally, now that we have progressed so far with transparency, would it not also be a good idea to send an apology to the heroes Dorte Schmidt-Brown, Hans-Martin Tillack, Marta Andreasen and all those who have been badmouthed over the years, but who were the reason that you, Mr Kallas, have been able to achieve such success with your reforms?"
"(PL) Mr President, clarity and transparency are fundamental principles of life in society."
"Particular responsibility for the challenges involved rests with us parliamentarians."
"We are the ones who meet the voters and it falls to us to explain the current situation in the Union and its administration to them."
"We cannot say: 'It is not us, it is the Commission'."
"European citizens look to their Members of Parliament for answers."
"All too often, on the pretext of creating transparency, we complicate procedures and impose too many requirements regarding beneficiaries. For example, we insist on documents that are often unnecessary."
"As we build transparency, we must define roles clearly and distribute them."
"I repeat, we must distribute roles and tasks between the Member States and the European Union."
"Mr President, I want to make two points."
"First of all, if we want to follow the Lisbon Strategy we have to know who in the field of science gets the money and what for."
"Is it really the best, or are there some divisions between the more privileged Western countries and the other, new ones?"
"I, as an academic, would claim that there has to be more justice and evenness."
"My second point is that, when we give money - with a pretty generous heart - to third countries, to those that are underdeveloped and less privileged, I would like to get some feedback on how that money is used, in particular under those soft programmes like democratisation or similar, which do not produce tangible things but change minds, or entrepreneurship."
"We know little of how that money is used in Africa, and in all ACP countries."
"I would really claim that we have to have some more knowledge about it."
"Mr President, I want to take issue with three of the speakers."
"Firstly, Mr Seppänen, I would like to congratulate him on his speech, because it was extremely moderate, and he is slowly moving - almost - towards the pro-European camp."
"Secondly, Mr Bonde: the way in which he talks about transparency makes me believe that he is a federalist."
"So, in that sense, I think that he is also moving in exactly the right direction - even if the request to publish all the people who sit on comitology committees is, perhaps, pushing it a little bit!"
"My final comment concerns Mr Rübig."
"I agree with him 100%: the type of populism that we see in the Austrian media from the anti-European side is simply abominable, and I really would not like to see any more of that."
"I have one more question for the rapporteur, Mr Pomés Ruiz: if there was one thing he would like to take out of this report, what would it be?"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank honourable Members very much for their support for this transparency action, which has been a common action: in all issues, the Commission has always felt it had strong support from Parliament."
"There are two things I want to say."
"The first concerns the information available on end beneficiaries."
"I consider this to be an amazing change."
"When, together with some Members of Parliament, we started to initiate this at the beginning of 2004, there was no great hope that it would be implemented."
"But the political decision has now been taken, and the year 2009 is the final year by which the information on end beneficiaries of 2008 will and must be published."
"So, politically the decision has been taken."
"This is a great step forward."
"Now the technicalities remain to be solved."
"That is not easy at all, because guidelines have now been issued on what this information on end beneficiaries should look like."
"But of course many of you raised the issue of workable search engines, and this is really not an easy task."
"Of course, we will have a portal via which it will be possible to access the information in the Member States, and access information about end beneficiaries."
"I foresee a lot of technical problems, but those technical problems - nothing is perfect, and everything takes a little time - definitely should not undermine the importance of this great change."
"Concerning the famous national declarations, I must again say that the situation has completely changed in these three years."
"When I first appeared in Council to discuss these issues, these were completely out of the question."
"Today you have the annual summaries - we had already received 22 so far, and perhaps even more now."
"We will assess the quality together, and there definitely will be an improvement."
"So the understanding is that we have shared management problems, and we must also share information about the work - how we manage the Structural Funds."
"That understanding has increased tremendously in Member States too."
"We will also try to fill out the idea of more comprehensive national declarations with specific substance."
"You know as well as I do that there are certain Member States that are still very reluctant to have this greater involvement, but we already have a certain degree of involvement."
"As concerns international money, that is a something of a different issue."
"The issue of how this information should be made available will probably also be discussed within the framework of COCOBU."
"However, we are partners in international agreements and do not manage them directly."
"Information on what we manage directly must be made available, but we are partners in very big international poolings."
"That is a little different."
"Concerning expert groups, as I said in COCOBU, I can repeat here that we have a commitment to publish the list of permanent experts."
"This is really a question of definition: what kind of experts should be included on this list."
"This is a debate, and some experts who fulfil certain confidential tasks of assessing projects and people should not be so transparent, probably."
"There are some nuances."
"However, the commitment exists and I have been informed that we are ready to publish a long list of permanent experts."
"There is the question of all those national experts sent by Member States participating in certain bodies, whose names will be sent afterwards, not before, but there is at least the commitment that there should be no big secret as to who is advising us."
"My last point, in response to an issue which was raised, is that the Commission has no intention to propose how Parliament should deal with its own rules, and what the declarations of economic interest should consist of."
"I can say only two things: this ethical space is a common space - if something happens in one institution, it definitely has an immediate effect on other institutions."
"We must, of course, address all these questions on the basis of common sense, and not go to absurd lengths and into unnecessary details, but only into the relevant issues, in order to avoid a real conflict of interests."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Mr Kallas can feel pleased with himself because he realises the transparency initiative is one which is much appreciated and dear to the hearts of the entire House, and because he has now experienced the support that can be found here."
"Mr Kallas, we wish to go further with regard to transparency, and in the report we outlined some of the areas in which progress ought to be made: recoveries, expert groups or the presumption of innocence."
"Nevertheless, I urge you: this must remain within the confines of common sense, with no consideration for the populism of certain elements of the gutter press that seems to devote itself to earning money through its populist exaggerations of serious topics in the European Union."
"I wish to thank Inés Ayala for her suggestion that OLAF should concern itself with these matters too, and Mr Jørgensen, Paulo Casaca, Mr Bösch, who is present, and my colleagues Ingeborg Grässle, Alex Stubb, etc."
"I would like to say that Alex Stubb also asked me what I would take out, and I must say that, for instance, I would remove the reference to a spouse's activity."
"I remember that the greatest problem in the European Union was caused not by a spouse, but something similar: I refer to the case of Edith Cresson."
"By this I mean that we should not be placing such restrictions on ourselves, and we should do what is logical, not what is illogical."
"Indeed, even Members of this House also have a right to family life and private life."
"I also wish to say that we will continue to set an example for many Member States of how the EU is spending its funds better and more efficiently, with low administrative costs and much more effectively than certain Member States."
"In this preliminary mission on which we all agree, several Member States - those that refuse to give explain how they spend 80% of Community funds and then seem to be all smiles when we refuse to approve the EU accounts - use this to justify giving less money to the common fund, limiting EU activity, abusing our accusations that it is the Member States that do not spend correctly and using this argument to refuse to give this House more than 1%."
"Thank you, Mr President, and may I also wish Mr Kallas well in securing an objective so warmly supported by Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written Statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) The Pomés Ruiz report, on the other hand, quite rightly takes the view that major efforts still have to be made before we achieve transparency in financial matters."
"An analysis of the 2006 Annual Activity Report of the Budget DG has in effect identified what still needs to be done before achieving transparency in the EU's accounts."
"An examination of the funds allocated to the common agricultural policy, for example, shows that the instruments available to the Commission do not always allow it to guarantee the accuracy of the data supplied by the Member States."
"If we are to prevent the budgetary slides of the past the Commission needs to improve the quality of the information supplied to the public concerning the beneficiaries of Community funds and must do this without delay by taking a number of concrete measures: rationalisation of published information on those receiving Community funding, creation of an overall search-engine, publication of a 'blacklist' of fraudsters, and so on."
"Protection of the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual reports 2005 and 2006 (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Musotto, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on protection of the Communities' financial interests - Fight against fraud - Annual reports 2005 and 2006."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking Mr Kallas for his valuable cooperation with Parliament during its work."
"I am likewise grateful to OLAF, in the person of the Director, Franz-Hermann Brüner, for its unstinting support and for the vital work it does, which is far from easy."
"Finally, I would thank all my colleagues for their helpful contributions, as well as all the national bodies and institutions that have cooperated with us in this arduous task, especially - if I may - the Italian Guardia di finanza, whose approach in this field has been highly professional."
"Protection of the Communities' financial interests is a subject of capital importance which affects us directly as States and as citizens; it must therefore be tackled with all due rigour and determination."
"Today's resolution is intended as a practical response to the alarming phenomenon of Community fraud."
"The data gathered..."
"(The President interrupted the speaker to reprimand some Members who were causing a disturbance)"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"We are talking about transparency and there is also a need for common courtesy."
"Today's resolution is intended as a practical response to the alarming phenomenon of Community fraud."
"The data gathered are worrying: in the areas of own resources, agricultural expenditure and structural actions, irregularities notified in 2006 totalled EUR 1 143 million, compared to EUR 1 024 million in the previous year."
"The statistics reveal an ever-increasing number of irregularities."
"I would however point out that a large number of irregularities does not necessarily imply a high level of fraud; it may also demonstrate that the supervisory arrangements in place are effective and that there is close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission."
"In its annual report for 2006, the Commission rightly emphasised the importance of such cooperation for prevention purposes and for recovery work."
"So far, the statistics have relied on very diverse national structures with different administrative, judicial, supervisory and inspection systems."
"In particular, we consider it unacceptable that Spain and Germany have not been forwarding information on irregularities to the Commission in electronic form, despite an obligation on all Member States to do so."
"The Community rules and the obligations arising from the fight against fraud must be implemented in the same way by all countries."
"To this end, closer cooperation between Member States and the Commission is vital to protect the Community's financial interests, which must be perceived as common interests going beyond those of individual states."
"Greater synergy is required between the supervisory authorities and local administrations in terms of coordinating and exchanging information."
"Keeping the organisation and disbursement of funds at central level necessitates complex implementation arrangements and increases distances between the financial authorities and the final beneficiaries."
"Simplification of the rules is another fundamental point touched upon in the report."
"The 2000-2006 programming period in fact proved that overly complicated rules contributed to the irregularities detected."
"Finally, despite a slight improvement in recovery activity, recovery is still a problem which causes immense damage to the Community budget."
"In particular, a period of 39 months between the time when an irregularity is committed and the time when it is notified to the Commission is unacceptable, as such a delay makes recovery more difficult if not impossible."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, Mr Musotto's report covers two years of efforts to improve the protection of the financial interests of the European Union."
"A sound system of financial management needs to focus on expenditure and the control and fighting of irregularities, and especially those committed with fraudulent intent."
"The report contains many of the same preoccupations as the discharge report, with the protection of financial interests being viewed, of course, as a core element of sound financial management, but the focus is different."
"I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Mr Musotto, for a very focused report, which concentrates on the main issues and makes many calls on the Commission to strengthen efforts."
"Allow me to comment on four of them."
"Firstly, the role of Member States: the report makes use of the wealth of figures and statistics on irregularities by Member States, and their financial impact."
"It does not hesitate to point out that some Member States perform better than others."
"I would stress once again that a high number of irregularities does not necessarily mean a high level of fraud, but it can be a good indicator of effective and thorough controls."
"When I presented the Commission report in July, I emphasised the need for Member States to ensure a correct, complete and timely communication of data on irregularities."
"A good flow of information between the Member States and the Commission is essential for effective recovery and joint action against fraudsters."
"Many of them are doing this, but for some there is still room for improvement."
"The Commission, with the support of the European Parliament, will not shy away from reminding them of their responsibility."
"I fully agree with the invitation expressed in the report for the Council to take up the annual reports and consider them at ministerial level."
"The EU's financial management system is complex, because responsibility is shared with the Member States."
"The increased focus on the national declarations, placing responsibility for spending with the Member States, should go hand in hand with cooperation over tackling irregularities and fighting fraud."
"I very much welcome the report's focus on systemic and general issues rather than on individual cases, for which, as you know, OLAF is independent in its investigations."
"The Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament on the need to analyse in greater depth the structures existing in Member States in charge of combating irregularities, to support them and facilitate cooperation and the exchange of information."
"This will be taken up in the 2008 report."
"This year's Commission report highlights the topics of risk analysis and risk management, exclusion databases and early-warning/whistleblower tools."
"In addition, the report examines the steps taken by Member States to improve recovery of amounts not collected or wrongly paid, as well as the mechanisms under national law for recovery by offsetting."
"The report also contains information on amounts recovered and the financial corrections, in particular when a payment has not been made in conformity with Community rules."
"The role of organised crime, such as the Mafia, in undermining the EU's financial interests is a subject close to the heart of the rapporteur."
"OLAF has contributed to the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA) produced by Europol."
"I am happy to report that I have asked both bodies to continue to cooperate on the matter."
"Value added tax and customs fraud is where the big money is."
"Sadly, it is an area where cooperation with Member States is often difficult."
"I will be very brief, and refer to what I will say on the Newton Dunn report, and thank the European Parliament for its ongoing support in underlining the useful role that cooperation at EU level can bring in this area."
"My fourth and last comment will be on the revision of the OLAF regulation."
"The Commission tabled a proposal in this regard in May 2006."
"I remain convinced that it raises the main important issues relating to the effective functioning of the anti-fraud office, namely the flow of information, procedural rights and the complaints mechanism, the role of the supervisory committee and, more generally, governance and accountability."
"I very much hope that we can enter into interinstitutional discussions on finding solutions in the very near future and make progress on these important points."
"The Musotto report reiterates the desire to group together anti-fraud legislation."
"From a political viewpoint I fully support this, but technically it will be a challenging task."
"The Commission will be ready to forward the requested analysis to the European Parliament by May this year."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a report on the protection of the financial interests of the EU with the somewhat equivocal subheading: 'Fight against fraud'."
"The actual focus of the report is not fraud as such, but rather irregularities."
"While fraud presupposes malicious intent, an irregularity can result from negligence or incorrect accounting procedures."
"In delicate areas such as financial relations within the EU such terminology, should be used circumspectly."
"As the rapporteur for the Committee on Regional Development, I regret the increase in the number of irregularities detected in projects financed from Structural Funds."
"This reflects negatively on some Member States and their internal control mechanisms."
"Difficulties on the part of these countries should not, however, become a reason to re-evaluate the existing system of decentralised controls governing the use of Structural Funds."
"The responsibility is evident; it is individual and as such it also has to be enforceable."
"Attaining an appropriate level in financial control mechanisms in individual Member States is the first necessary step."
"The following step is to ensure the recovery of sums unduly paid."
"A possible approach to this could be the suspension of regular payments to those Member States procrastinating over returning amounts paid under irregular circumstances."
"The existence of imperfect control mechanisms has the potential to undermine confidence in the Structural Funds system and could cast a negative light on the EU as a whole."
"Furthermore, we need controls with greater openness and transparency."
"I would therefore like to express my support for the European Transparency Initiative, according to which information on beneficiaries of assistance from Structural Funds would be published."
"As we are talking about managing public funds, certain demands should be placed on the beneficiaries of such assistance."
"A prerequisite of a better assessment of control systems is closer collaboration with the Court of Auditors, which has to date been lacking."
"Whilst it is true that reports from the Court of Auditors make for tedious reading for the European institutions, this should be all the more reason to devote more attention to them, and is certainly preferable to burying one's head in the sand and avoiding responsibility."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - (FI) Mr President, Francesco Musotto has produced an excellent report on the annual reports of the European Anti-Fraud Office 2005-2006, and I want to express my sincerest thanks for that."
"The number of irregularities notified by the Member States rose in 2006 to the equivalent of EUR 1 143 million."
"Of this, the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund accounts for an amount of EUR 87 million."
"Although this is just 0.17% of the total for agricultural expenditure, EUR 49.7 billion, it nonetheless has to be viewed seriously."
"Approximately a third of these irregularities were cases of direct fraud."
"With the new Regulation the Member States will be able to recover unjustified payments of aid more easily than before."
"That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgetary Control consider it regrettable that the level of recovery of this aid remains low."
"The Commission should speed up the recovery process and if necessary apply corrective measures."
"Both committees also assure the Commission of their full support in rigorously applying the option of suspension of payments if the Commission does not have absolute guarantees that the Member State which is the beneficiary of funds has a reliable management and control system."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EPP-ED Group is responsible for the report on the fight against fraud for the first time and we are very grateful to Mr Musotto for making OLAF's work and the cooperation with the Member States the focus of his report."
"He had to work very hard, having to contend with 630 pages of statistical material from 2005 and 2006 on the fight against fraud."
"His review reveals a very mixed picture and I believe that we really need to take action here."
"Uncovering irregularities does not appear to be a very important issue for the Member States."
"This is apparent from the fact that, yet again, the Council is absent from this very important debate, despite the fact that as the second arm of the budgetary authority, it should be concerned about what is happening to the taxpayers' money, which it is responsible for managing and disbursing."
"The rapporteur proposes taking formal steps against Germany and Spain for their violations of EU law."
"Spain is only providing paper information about irregularities."
"Moreover, this information is extremely sketchy, as is apparent from the 18th Structural Funds report."
"Germany is a very specific case."
"It takes longer to provide the information than the other Member States, and it is the only country which does not disclose names."
"How can OLAF do its job without names?"
"The fraudsters are hiding behind data protection here, for the fact is, Mr Březina, that between 15% and 20% of the irregularities have some kind of fraudulent background."
"Germany is also putting obstacles in the way of OLAF's investigative work at local level, notably in cases of customs offences and export refunds."
"We are calling on the Commission to report on every Member State and its willingness or lack of willingness to cooperate, and to do so by the time the next OLAF report is due."
"From our Group's perspective, the forthcoming reform of OLAF's legal basis must be utilised, first and foremost, to improve the working conditions in OLAF's cooperation with the Member States."
"I would like to express my warm thanks to OLAF itself and to the staff who are working in a very difficult area."
"I think that the outcomes really do stand up to scrutiny."
"However, I am also convinced that these outcomes could be improved through better cooperation with the Member States."
"on behalf of the PSE group. - (HU) Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament considers protection of the European Union's financial interests to be one of its most important tasks since, like all parliaments, it has the right and the duty to monitor expenditure."
"Moreover, the view that EU funds are inadequately looked after is increasingly widespread in Europe, so we also have a political debt to the public, to our constituents and to our taxpayers in this regard."
"We put this legislative and political obligation into practice primarily by means of the discharge procedure, but in addition to this we have been producing regular reports on the protection of EU financial interests and the fight against fraud."
"Our aim in doing so is not to create a sensation or cause a scandal, but to expose the situation objectively and resolve any problems."
"I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my fellow Member, Mr Musotto, for this excellent report, and to express my gratitude to the Commission Vice-President, Mr Kallas, and OLAF Director-General, Mr Brüner, for the constructive cooperation they have demonstrated in this area too."
"Despite the fact that these high-level reports are greeted with much appreciation year on year, we in the European institutions sometimes feel as if we are tilting at windmills, since the findings of the reports encounter resistance on the part of the Council, with the result that the Commission has not been able to put the necessary measures in place for years."
"We believe that the weakest link is the attitude of Member States, since in some Member States - our fellow Member Mrs Grässle spoke just now about Germany in this connection - there is a failure to recognise how very important it is to ensure that EU funds are spent in accordance with the rules, that expenditures are subject to scrutiny, and that any amounts unduly paid are recovered."
"We consider it particularly lamentable that VAT fraud in the form of 'carousel' transactions is becoming increasingly widespread throughout Europe, to the extent that we have no global figures on the amount involved, although some estimates suggest that it may be around 35-40% of the EU budget."
"It is time to take resolute action in this regard too, both in the interests of managing European affairs and in the interests of public opinion. Thank you very much."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group regarding protection of the Communities' financial interests, I should like to draw attention to the following issues. Firstly, there has been a significant increase in the sums affected by irregularities in the area of own resources, EUR 328 million in 2005 and EUR 353 million in 2006, compared with EUR 212 million in 2004."
"I should also mention the increase in irregularities in the area of structural actions: EUR 703 million in 2006 compared with EUR 601 million in 2005."
"Secondly, there has been a marked reduction in the sums affected by irregularities in the area of agriculture. In 2006 the figure was EUR 82 million, compared with EUR 102 million in 2005."
"This reduction is worthy of particular note because very often expenditure on agriculture involves huge numbers of beneficiaries - farmers - who often have to cope on their own with the complicated procedure of accounting for the funding received."
"Thirdly, I would like to highlight the statement in the report that some of the main reasons for the emergence of irregularities in budgetary expenditure are the complicated programming principles and ineffective monitoring and control methods."
"Fourthly, the call for greater transparency when awarding resources should also be noted."
"An important feature of this transparency is a commitment by the Member States to publish information on projects and beneficiaries of resources originating in all Community funds."
"Mr President, the Commissioner said the same thing: the report does indeed overlap with the discharge procedure."
"In this sense, too, this debate is a warm-up act for the hearing next week with Commissioners Špidla and Hübner."
"We know the figures for reported irregularities."
"They do not tell the whole story, of course, but they do tell us a lot about the problems reported in the policy areas of own resources, agriculture and the Structural Funds."
"The report mentions a total of EUR 1.1 billion worth of reported irregularities and the trend is upward."
"We are back to the level of 2002, following better figures in 2003, 2004 and 2005."
"Agriculture is doing relatively well."
"The problem sectors are clearly own resources and the Structural Funds: own resources accounted for EUR 325 million of reported irregularities and the Structural Funds accounted for EUR 700 million."
"Within the Structural Funds, five Member States accounted for 84% of the reported irregularities."
"Anyone who is interested can read which countries they are in Mr Musotto's report."
"It really is quite remarkable."
"It also has to be remembered that in the period before 2006, another EUR 1 billion of resources had yet to be recovered and that the Court of Auditors says that 12% of the Structural Funds in 2006 could not be paid out."
"This is the context in which the present discharge procedure is taking place and it is a cause of great concern to us."
"We will come back to this."
"As far as own resources are concerned, the problem of cigarette fraud is being tackled properly."
"We had the agreement with Philip Morris."
"There is a new agreement with Japan Tobacco, which should deliver a lot of money and will also bring about a reduction in smuggling."
"The main problem area in own resources is the VAT 'carrousel' transactions."
"The figures are quoted: enormous amounts are involved, running into billions of euros."
"An investigation by the British House of Lords highlights this further."
"I am pleased that Parliament is tackling this."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has already organised a hearing and the Committee on Budgetary Control will do the same on 4 or 5 May."
"I hope that I, as rapporteur, will be able to produce as good a report on the VAT carrousels as my report on cigarette fraud."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, this report is a long catalogue of failure."
"It graphically illustrates how the amount of fraud, described as 'irregularities', is steadily rising and that attempts to deal with it are failing."
"It openly admits that fraud in 2006 in the areas of own resources - agricultural expenditure and Member States' structural actions - totalled EUR 1 143 million."
"It was EUR 922 million in 2003, so in just four years fraud has risen by over EUR 200 million."
"I would remind everyone in this institution that these are not meaningless sums of money, but taxpayers' money."
"The EU is funded by its citizens, including hard-pressed taxpayers in the UK."
"They deserve better than this for their money."
"Governments of all Member States should be saying 'enough' already, and these appalling figures provide all the more reason why the government of my country should honour its manifesto commitment to give the British people a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty."
"(DE) Mr President, it is no secret that the European Union has been battling for years to get its finances under control."
"We fund major companies which then relocate from one Member State to another, while small and medium-sized enterprises go away empty-handed."
"Indeed, the EU often does not appear to know who it is actually funding and who is pulling its strings."
"In my view, a register of lobbyists is long overdue."
"The numerous irregularities also leave a bitter aftertaste, especially when they have a direct connection to the EU's institutions."
"In this context, freezing the EU funding for Bulgaria until the cases of corruption have been cleared up sends out an important signal."
"There is also the fact that some Member States apparently have little interest in recovering funds that have been paid out incorrectly."
"If cases from the 1990s are only now being closed, then obviously things are moving far too slowly in the EU."
"(FI) Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Musotto."
"He has done a very thorough and excellent job."
"This report is crucially important, and the fight against fraud is something over which the confidence of the public is either won or lost."
"I think there are three very important problems contained in this report which need to be put right."
"First of all, it is intolerable that some countries do not even provide information on agricultural expenditure."
"Germany and Spain are prime examples of this, and Germany does not even provide details of the individuals and companies which the European Anti-Fraud Office would definitely need in order to be able to address these matters."
"This is obviously something we cannot allow: all Member States must obey the rules."
"If a few big countries set a bad example, the situation does not look very good."
"The second issue is that notification of irregularities can take up to 39 months - more than three years."
"That is far too long and does not inspire trust in the notion that the Member States are acting with sufficient vigilance."
"The third issue, which is very interesting and important, is that specialised and organised crime is also occurring in this area."
"This is now so serious that all measures need to be taken to cut this sort of crime."
"This is a very important report and every effort needs to be made to improve the situation in order to gain public confidence."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur."
"It is not an easy task, coming in new to such a comprehensive dossier, and I think we can be proud that Mr Musotto has done such a magnificent job."
"I think we can say this with confidence today, given that there are no amendments to this report for tomorrow."
"That, too, is a tribute to the rapporteur."
"Secondly, it is apparently of no interest whatsoever to one of the budgetary authorities to find out what is happening to the taxpayers' money."
"Once again, the Council is shirking its responsibility."
"Whenever we talk about how European taxpayers' money is being spent and try to seek solutions to difficult issues, the Council simply absents itself."
"However, we have seen - and this brings me to the issue of what will happen with the discharges in our committee - that for years in the field of agricultural policy, where we have been resolute in our action and developed systems to control direct payments, irregularities have decreased."
"In structural policy, on the other hand, where nothing has been done and where we have sat back and watched events unfold for years, the figures have gone up and up."
"This has been apparent for years, and has repeatedly featured in the fraud reports for years. Commissioner Kallas will see in the 2006 discharge that this is a problem and we will expect him to take action and not just sit back and watch."
"That is why I would like you, Commissioner, to say this to those Member States which behave as if the rules that we have all devised do not apply to them, and this is also what the rapporteur says, with the full support of all the previous speakers: we want you to say, 'okay, we will put 10% of your funding on ice."
"It will form a reserve, and you can have the money once you have taken appropriate action'."
"That is a very practical demand from Parliament."
"It is not a plan of action; it is practical action."
"This is what we expect from the Commission, and then we will be very satisfied."
"Once again, congratulations to the rapporteur."
"Mr President, like the other speakers, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on what is a very important report."
"I am prompted to take part in this debate because of the focus on agriculture."
"Other speakers have said that there has been an improvement in terms of the controls and inspections, particularly when it comes to money given to farmers, and there is now the transparency initiative to publish what farmers are getting."
"One of the difficulties for those in the farming community is that they believe very often they are guilty until proven innocent."
"Obviously, none of us can or will condone fraud, and because there is fraud in the EU budget there is a very poor public perception of the European Union and how it accounts for the money collected."
"If the public understood the European budget better, they might clamour a little louder for us to be harder on fraud."
"It is important to stress the difference between fraud and irregularities, of which many are discovered, because they are very different."
"We cannot punish ourselves for irregularities, but we should punish fraud against the Community budget."
"This is an issue involving the Member States - as the last speaker said - because all the Member States signed up to the European Union in good faith and have pooled resources in certain policies, and it is up to us to ensure that the money we have pooled is well spent and that there is no fraud against the public purse."
"Member States which are light on fraud, and take a light-touch approach, need to be punished in some way, but it is very important that Member States that perform well in this area are not penalised."
"It is therefore important for the Commission to take action at Member State level."
"I shall finish by reiterating the very important point that, on the farming side, there is now a very strong feeling among those who farm that they are sometimes guilty until proven innocent."
"That is unacceptable, and we therefore need to be careful to get the balance right."
"- (NL) Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak again."
"Anyone who follows me in my political office and my statements knows that I am a critical politician and that I am also highly critical of the European Union but that I am still very strongly pro-European."
"I cannot therefore ignore the words of Mr Clark, who has meanwhile left the room."
"Like all Eurosceptics, Mr Clark uses half truths, complete lies and lots of oversimplifications on a frequent basis."
"He talked in his speech, for instance, of several million euros worth of fraud, while the report clearly states that we are dealing with irregularities."
"He invariably substitutes 'fraud' for the word 'irregularities'."
"That is crass, because that is not what it says in the report."
"Secondly, he talks as if every disaster that befalls us comes from the European Union."
"I would just like to ask Mr Clark to read the report of the British House of Lords on VAT carrousels."
"Then he will see that his own authorities have not managed to put a stop to this VAT fraud."
"We are talking about GBP 3.5 to 4.5 billion of fraud a year."
"That is more than GBP 10 million a day!"
"That is significantly more ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) Congratulations on Mr. Musotto's report."
"I consider that many irregularities from 2003-2006 would have the support of changing the rule of presentation of the Framework Programme 6, for instance, as compared to Framework 5."
"In Framework 5, the B party was anonymous and any reference to the country and to the person behind the project was penalized."
"In Frameworks 6 and 7, the anonymity disappeared."
"In Framework 8 is it possible to no longer resort to this system of advanced submission of projects?"
"(DE) Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak again."
"I would like to thank Mr Bösch, not only for his praise of our rapporteur, but also for his fairness and help."
"Mr Bösch has been dealing with the fraud report for many years."
"Now we have this honour, and I think it is a great sign of strength in the Committee on Budgetary Control that we are in agreement here."
"We have focused our full attention on the Member States."
"The Commission should also take with it the message that we want to help to bring this lack of clarity to an end."
"If we look at the figures on the recovery of funds, we see that we are dealing with a very wide range of opinions."
"That is why we are having this discussion as part of the current discharge procedure."
"Consequently, I really must ask the Commission to have the courage to say if it does not know certain things, so that we can help."
"I think that if we tackle the issue together, then together, we will be successful."
"Once again, very many thanks to Mr Bösch."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments on this report."
"We consider the report to be very focused and constructive."
"I have just two remarks on an issue raised by very many of you - namely, what is irregularity, what is fraud, and how should one approach recovery?"
"I can say that we have had one preliminary meeting with the relevant people at the Court of Auditors, and tried to harmonise the understanding of what is what."
"That will probably also help in all our future debates on discharge, and of course all the three reports - including the next one - are all very closely interrelated."
"Secondly, I have raised this issue with the Council Presidency, and asked it to consider this parliamentary report during its proceedings, by which I mean to discuss this document within the framework of Ecofin."
"I hope it will do that."
"We will definitely, after the vote on this report, when it becomes an official document, also try to initiate this discussion in the Council, including at the level of the relevant subcommittees."
"rapporteur. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me firstly to thank all my colleagues for their kind words, and especially Mr Bösch whose earlier work laid the foundations for my own report."
"I should like to emphasise a few points, the main one being the meeting of minds with Commissioner Kallas, particularly as concerns the nature of the regulatory mechanisms governing the disbursement of funds."
"The Commission has made an undertaking here. One important aspect underscored by Mr Kallas is that the more difficulties and complications there are, the harder it becomes to understand the rules and the easier it becomes for organised crime above all and for all forms of unlawful activity to move into these grey areas."
"Therefore simplification and, even more, a closing of the gap between those disbursing the sums of money and the beneficiaries is another means of achieving clarity, transparency and ease of understanding of the whole system."
"The problem of recovery is a very real one."
"The procedures are too lengthy, and the capacity to punish those who defraud the European Community must be ensured by some kind of security or guarantee, to be applied through the banks."
"It is essential to devise methods of ensuring disbursement and, especially, of making it possible to recover these sums and hence assisting, improving and facilitating the speed of recovery."
"I believe that, thanks to the cooperation, good will and political commitment of all of my colleagues, we have done a crucial job of work."
"There can be no doubt that this cooperation, this willingness and desire to stamp out a phenomenon that does enormous damage to the European Community is motivated solely by political concerns."
"Of course, the absence of the Council has not made matters any easier; the presence of a representative would have enabled us to find out what the Council thinks."
"But Parliament is absolutely united and unanimous on these principles, and we therefore believe that we have done something positive which gives us hope for the future."
"in writing. - (HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations on this report, which highlights not only the successes of the recent past, but also some lamentable shortcomings and long-standing debts."
"For me this report is very topical because in Hungary a decision has been made to establish a national anti-counterfeiting body."
"This body will primarily have a coordinating function linking the Hungarian Patent Office, other government agencies and actors in the economy, including functions connected with European Union-related data services."
"We need to prepare ourselves for a long and futile battle."
"Knowledge - whether protected or in the public domain - is becoming increasingly widely accessible."
"A car on display in one room can be copied in the space of 5 minutes in the room next door."
"The result will not be any worse, just cheaper: it is up to us to decide whether to go ahead and buy the more expensive item anyway."
"We have to decide whether we are willing to pay for the intellectual achievement, the innovation, even if we have the option of choosing the secondary product or service that has no value added."
"To do this requires considerable awareness and commitment."
"We cannot expect individual citizens to recognise these connections and make decisions based on values if our legislators or governments are unable to do so."
"It is particularly important to reduce the number of irregularities relating to use of EU funds to below the tolerable error rate: fraud of this sort makes the European Union as a whole look ridiculous when it involves EU funds being used in a manner that contradicts the declared aims of the EU."
"Application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Bill Newton Dunn, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters - C6-0033/2007 -."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, this third report is very much linked to the two previous ones."
"Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters is a very important piece of legislation dating back to 1997, when we had 15 Member States."
"It was essential to propose an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 515/97 in the light of developments in the last decade, technological progress, successful experience with joint customs operations coordinated in Brussels, and the enlargement of the Union to 27 Members."
"I would like to pay tribute to the rapporteur, Mr Newton-Dunn, for the way he has guided this proposal through Parliament."
"I would also like to thank Mr Audy, who drafted the opinion."
"The two committees, IMCO and COCOBU, worked closely together using the enhanced cooperation mechanism."
"Their excellent work has enabled a compromise to be brokered between the various political actors."
"Thanks to the constructive approach of Parliament, a first-reading adoption of this legislation can now be achieved."
"Customs authorities apply controls on goods entering and exiting the Community based upon a common risk management framework, including the use of random checks."
"In this context, their task is generally not limited to the enforcement of customs legislation: they also apply Community law in the fields of VAT, excise and agricultural legislation."
"I also note that the issue of the fight against VAT fraud and the need for closer cooperation between the Member States and the Commission is strongly emphasised in the Musotto report which we have just discussed."
"For this reason, it is crucial that customs authorities and the Commission are allowed to exchange VAT information."
"In the case of certain types of data, the new Article 2a makes such an exchange of information possible."
"The Commission regards this as the first step in the direction of closer cooperation in the field of the protection of the Community's financial interests against VAT fraud."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I thank the Commissioner."
"I believe this should be a very uncontroversial proposal by the Commission."
"As the Commissioner said: enlargement, more Member States, new technology, new equipment, computers."
"We need updated Commission legislation to allow good cooperation across internal borders in the Union against the bad guys - the organised criminals and so on."
"I talked to the director of a major Anglo-Dutch company last week and he says that he finds organised crime is increasing and - I use the word which he used - 'exponentially', increasing incredibly fast, and yet the Member State governments do nothing about it, because the public does not know the full picture and does not push the governments, so they say, 'Well, don't worry, everything is okay'."
"We have a serious problem."
"So we need this proposal from the Commission, and everybody should agree and it should go through."
"There should be nothing more for me to say, but actually there is a whole story to tell you, Mr President, which I would now like to do."
"To my amazement, my own Member State, the UK, threw in a veto in the Council of Ministers, saying that they would not agree to this."
"They did not tell me, though I am British, and from the same Member State."
"Not a single Labour MEP from the Labour Government in London tabled an amendment to anything, but they chose my good Conservative friend, Christopher Heaton-Harris, a very honourable man, who is going to speak, to pick up the Labour Government's objection and he tabled an amendment, which is slightly weird, but I wish Chris good luck; he is entitled to do that."
"But what was the Labour Party doing in all this?"
"So, I thought, this is very strange, and there are a lot of other British objections and vetoes and opt-outs going on in lots of different policy areas, so I thought I would investigate what the overall UK policy was on all these directives that they are opting out of, what was going on?"
"I went to OLAF, which deals with fraud in the EU, as we know."
"OLAF tells me that the UK refuses to cooperate with it, even though the UK loses billions on VAT carousel fraud."
"London says, 'If we give OLAF a finger, they will take our whole arm, so we are afraid, and we will not cooperate'."
"This is very weird, so I made further enquiries in London."
"How does this work?"
"And I am told this is what happens: the Commission makes a proposal, then a junior official in the appropriate government department in London has to write a briefing paper to recommend what the Government should do about it."
"He is very careful; he is a bit nervous; he does not know what to do, so he says, 'We must not do anything about this."
"I recommend great caution."
"I do not think we should approve."
"Perhaps we should even opt out'."
"And his careful paper - because he wants to be promoted and not sacked - goes up the tree in his department, and officials who are busy doing other things say 'okay' and tick it."
"Other government departments asked for their opinion do not know either, so they say, 'It seems okay to us'."
"It goes finally to a cabinet committee chaired by our Foreign Secretary - and he has a million other things to think about - and so it gets rubber-stamped."
"So, suddenly, the Government's position in London is negative, cautious, in favour of an opt-out: 'We do not understand."
"We do not really know what is going on'."
"Very strange indeed!"
"So what happens next?"
"Well, back to the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in the Parliament."
"The blockage in the Council has meant that I have attended several informal tripartite conciliations with the Council, first of all led by the Portuguese, now led by the Slovenes, in both cases excellently."
"And, although no UK official has ever briefed me about anything, and I was therefore the only British person present at the conciliation, even though the British Government apparently has a veto situation on this, it went through."
"Finally, the Commission and the Council have found a form of words which has enabled the British objection to be got round, or overcome, or whatever words you like to use."
"So the amendments before the Parliament, for voting tomorrow, were all approved by the IMCO Committee and I hope very much that Parliament will vote for them tomorrow."
"But what is going on in London, Mr President, I just do not understand."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my colleague Mr Audy, who is draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control, has been delayed at the last minute and so I am speaking on his behalf."
"The correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters plays a decisive role in ensuring that the internal market functions properly."
"It is also essential for protecting the financial interests of the Community and, more generally, those of European economic operators and citizens."
"The customs files identification database will allow the different services of the Member States and the Commission to cooperate more effectively."
"Some of the amendments are aimed at implementing the Court of Auditors' proposals with a view to making the database more useful."
"The draftsman shares the Court's concerns about the integrated approach to managing the various databases relating to the fight against fraud, but considers this to be a discussion going beyond the bounds of this Regulation and therefore one which should be conducted in a different context."
"The draftsman, Mr Audy, supports the Commission's proposals aiming to promote the added value of cooperation at European level, in particular the European data directory and the platform of services."
"In the absence of a more uniform legal framework, an exchange of best practice will ensure an increasingly coherent approach in the medium term."
"On the question of financing, the draftsman emphasises that expenses must be clearly identified so as to avoid an overlap between this proposal and other instruments, such as the Hercule II programme."
"Finally, the draftsman would like to keep the legislative procedure for the decision on other communication and information exchange systems, including the mandatory opinion of the Court of Auditors, rather than apply the 'comitology' procedure."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr Newton Dunn, another honourable Member of this institution, for eloquently painting the picture of how EU matters are dealt with - or how he believes they are dealt with - in London."
"Perhaps I can explain what was going on in London and why they came to a Conservative Member of the European Parliament rather than go to a Labour MEP, or indeed to himself."
"Actually, I think they should have gone to him, and I cannot believe they did not."
"He might not believe me, but I had more contact with the current Presidency-in-Office than I did with anybody from London or the British civil service."
"But perhaps it was just the fact that this young civil servant he described had forgotten to read the newspapers and believed that the general election had been called in October, that my party had won it and that the Prime Minister had not dithered, and that, therefore, he was dealing with a member of the Government party."
"Alas, that is not the case."
"But I do understand what he says about London being concerned about giving OLAF a finger and it taking an arm."
"This actually goes back to the structure of OLAF itself, to the wise men's paper back in 1999, and the fact that OLAF is simply not independent of the Commission - something that will be addressed in the future."
"There were other problems with this particular dossier: the fact that VAT was being dragged between pillars, possibly - and we needed to get legal advice on that - and the fact that much of this information is already exchanged electronically."
"The British Government did believe - and I can see from reading between the lines how it came to that conclusion - that it would need a permanent coordination unit and would need to second people to this, therefore having lots of people in a place rather than just exchanging information electronically."
"However, there is no problem with the amendments."
"There is no problem with the debate."
"This should go through very quickly, and I hope it does."
"Thank you, Mr Heaton-Harris."
"Now that all is clear in London, Europe too feels more at ease."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for having produced an excellent piece of work and for having collaborated so well on what is a particularly sensitive issue."
"At a time of increasing trade not only within the Union but also with third countries, the opening-up of markets and expanding commercial activity are set to represent key development factors for Europe for years to come."
"However, the gradual removal of the barriers that define the European Economic Area also opens the door to a host of fraudulent activities that threaten the viability of the internal market, with Community producers, and by extension European consumers, counting among the first victims."
"This problem is especially prominent in the agricultural sector, where the crucial measures that have been put in place to provide farmers with financial aid and solidarity have attracted the greedy eyes of international crime on both a small and large scale."
"In this context, and given the shortcomings of the present controls, Europe is preparing to arm itself with a new regulation that will permit a better distribution of data among the Member States with regard to the movement of goods and the various investigations that are being carried out in the different countries of the Union."
"I welcome the compromise that has been found with the Council, which now gives us a more balanced document, the details of which are to be voted on tomorrow by the Members of this Parliament."
"While continuing to protect the various aspects of private life, the agreement should help improve the effectiveness of surveillance procedures and lead to better coordination of actions undertaken between each of the Member States."
"In the area of customs controls, as elsewhere, I am convinced that Europe can only develop through greater combination of effort and by the pooling of our respective resources so that we can give our citizens the level of protection they desire."
"In this respect, any improvement in the measures we have for combating fraud cannot be achieved without also maintaining a consistent level of regulation, for this is essential if we are to retain sound and effective control from above of the commercial activities under way both within the Union and with third countries."
"Mr President, I rather enjoyed the remarks by my eminent colleagues from the UK and their storytelling about how things are done in the UK."
"I think we should write that down and translate that into many languages, because I think it happens in many Member States that junior officials have a dossier and prepare various reports on it."
"I think we should not point the finger at the junior official but rather at the department that allows that to happen."
"I would just like to put to the House that there are concerns about the UK and Ireland - and maybe the Commission can update me, if there is an update about this particular issue - because, while there is support for the principle of mutual assistance between the customs authorities, I think that both Member States, Ireland and the UK, have reservations on the exchange of information between these authorities on the use of VAT numbers in Article 2a(f) and contend that the exchange of information using VAT numbers is de facto, the exchange of fiscal information falling outside the scope of the proposed legal base."
"So perhaps there could be a comment on that."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I also enjoy seeing how things are debated in the UK."
"However, I can assure you, with regard to what had just been said, that this does not happen only in the UK."
"I have met several chiefs of finance, and several ministers, and promoted the idea of mutual administrative assistance, and can state that this reluctance is not just limited to the United Kingdom."
"It has been viewed as a suspicious matter, but I can assure you that there are no grounds for this kind of suspicion."
"As an investigative body within the Commission, OLAF can only provide a platform for cooperation, and it is absolutely clear that value added tax fraud can only be fought in cooperation between Member States and the European Commission, because, basically, major fraud can only happen cross-border."
"So there is a real need for better cooperation, and to exchange information."
"I cannot comment on the last question, as to the substance of the information."
"We are only talking about smoothing the fight against value added tax fraud, which is a major type of fraud."
"That would indeed be the case, and I am very happy to hear the opinion being clearly expressed that Parliament would support this legislative proposal in the form proposed."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I should like to thank everybody who spoke in the debate."
"To the very perceptive comment from Ms McGuinness, representing Dublin, I would say: when she said this is widespread and should be written down, she probably is aware that there was a very famous TV programme about 15, or even 20, years ago in the UK called Yes, Minister, in which the minister, who was a bumbling idiot, imagined he was in full control and was eventually promoted to Prime Minister."
"But the words 'Yes, Minister' were actually the words of his civil servants, who were telling him what to say and what to do - 'Yes, Minister."
"No, Minister."
"Of course, you are all-powerful, Minister.'"
"But it was the civil servants who were in control."
"This was happening 20 years ago and, clearly, it is still happening today."
"And it is happening all over Europe, which is very interesting."
"So perhaps we need an updated European programme - Ja, Herr Minister or Sí, Señor Ministro."
"But perhaps scriptwriters could actually entertain us with a new programme on the same theme, because the old truths remain as true as ever."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on 19 February 2008."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) The latest two enlargements have resulted in a significant increase in the length of the European Union's land and sea borders."
"This calls for closer cooperation between Member States and between Member States and the Commission. It also requires coordination and cohesion of actions aimed at combating international economic and financial crime."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the role of third countries should not be overlooked in relation to these activities. I fully support authorising the Commission as appropriate, so it can provide technical aid and training to liaison officials from third countries and from European and international agencies and organisations."
"I welcome the proposal to improve the procedures for transferring data obtained from another Member State to third countries."
"I am confident that the proposed changes will have a positive impact on limiting financial irregularities."
"I should like to highlight the text of Article 18a regarding the creation and management by the Commission of a directory to help detect consignments that may not comply with legal provisions in the areas of customs and agriculture."
"In this connection, I believe specific provision should be made in the text to enable every Member State to access the aforementioned database if it submits a request to the Commission to that effect."
"As it currently stands, the text refers to assistance to the relevant authorities."
"Community Customs Code (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, on the Common Position adopted by the Council on 15 October 2007 with a view to the adoption of a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernized Customs Code) (11272/6/2007 - C6-0354/2007 - (Rapporteur: Janelly Fourtou)."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have come to the end of three years of hard work I am delighted at what has been achieved in respect of the key points in this document."
"The customs union is one of the pillars of the European Union and an essential element in the functioning of the internal market."
"The present Community Customs Code, which was drawn up in the 1980s and adopted in the 1990s, is now outdated."
"Our customs services are faced with new challenges."
"In 2007 world trade totalled nearly 16 billion dollars, or 31% of global GDP, and the European Union alone accounted for 20% of the total volume of global imports and exports."
"The customs services are therefore responsible for maintaining the smooth flow of trade and the controls that are needed to provide for this, while at the same time ensuring that the safety and security of EU citizens is protected."
"If a satisfactory balance is to be reached the control methods used have to be modernised and the level of cooperation strengthened between the different services and economic operators."
"The Code also has to be adapted to other radical changes that have occurred in the international commercial environment, mainly resulting from the growing and irreversible recourse to IT and electronic data exchange technologies."
"This particular subject was also the focus of a report that was drawn up by my colleague Mr Heaton-Harris and adopted by Parliament last December."
"The first reading of the modernised customs code was adopted on 12 December 2006 and the German Presidency managed to secure a political agreement on 25 June 2007."
"Parliament adopted 51 amendments to the proposal at first reading, 34 of which, mostly of a substantive nature, were taken over fully or in part in the Council common position."
"The main subjects of disagreement were the status of authorised economic operator, the right to act as a customs representative, centralised customs clearance and comitology."
"The status of authorised economic operator, which is directly related to the events of 11 September, was introduced by the so-called 'security amendment' Regulation, whose aim was to offer greater facilities to operators and hence offset the new burdens they had to shoulder in order to cope with security-related aspects."
"Your rapporteur is satisfied that the concept developed by Parliament at first reading has been taken over; this involves drawing a distinction between two types of authorisation, namely 'customs simplification', on one hand, and 'safety and security', on the other."
"This pragmatic solution allows for the different needs of the economic operators."
"Turning to the subject of customs representatives, emotions have been running fairly high in those countries which have had a long history of this profession."
"While the Council has not adopted Parliament's proposals to the letter, it has nevertheless proceeded from the premise that customs representatives and authorised economic operators should interact along the lines we desired."
"Your rapporteur believes that the Council has arrived at a good compromise."
"Moreover, this solution has been accepted by customs representatives associations, even though they have lost their monopoly in certain Member States."
"As far as centralised customs clearance is concerned, we have another novelty in that the Council has introduced a new Article 106, taking the view that it is more logical and transparent for all of the provisions of the Code related to this concept to be encompassed within a single article."
"Henceforth all economic operators may benefit from centralised clearance on the territory of any one Member State."
"In cases involving several Member States they have to satisfy the eligibility criteria for authorised economic operator status."
"Finally, of all the areas in which this document has made significant progress we can also be very pleased that we have broadened out the comitology process to cover 44 provisions of the modernised customs code."
"For this reason I am calling on Parliament to support the Council common position without amendment."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, after more than two years of active interinstitutional work, we are now very close to the completion of the codecision procedure on this proposal, thanks in particular to the commitment of Ms Fourtou and the support of the members of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection."
"I am very pleased that the legal framework for a future-oriented reform of European customs will - hopefully - be in place this year, which marks the 40th anniversary of our Customs Union."
"That will provide encouraging impetus for the work that still lies ahead of us."
"The customs union is usually presented as an 'old' pillar of the Community."
"It cannot, however, be reduced to a simple legacy of the past."
"It is in operation today - and not just to ensure the collection of own resources."
"More and more, customs administrations, legislation and procedures will secure the internal market, contribute to consumer protection, support the external aspects of common policies and, at the same time, contribute to the facilitation of our international trade."
"To this end, customs legislation will evolve to respond to major changes and challenges, inside and outside the Union, and resort to the most effective rules and efficient techniques."
"What will modernisation of the Community Customs Code actually mean?"
"First, better customs regulations, including simpler and streamlined rules and procedures, clarifying the rights and obligations of economic operators and guaranteeing their more uniform treatment, while providing for an equivalent level of security and safety."
"Second, a progressive computerisation of all customs formalities, with a view to a completely 'paperless' environment for customs and trade, whose development will be supported and framed by the e-customs Decision (No 70/2008/EC) of the Parliament and of the Council, adopted on 15 January 2008."
"These changes include interoperability between national computerised customs systems."
"They will allow, in particular, customs clearance of goods at the place of establishment of the declarant, irrespective of the place of entry into, exit from or supply within the Community of those goods - so-called 'centralised clearance'."
"They will also permit an exchange of data elements, in real time, between customs authorities, in order to perform risk analysis and improve controls within the framework of common risk management."
"By supporting the Commission's proposal at first reading, Parliament has acknowledged the essential contribution of this legislative initiative to the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs."
"The Council common position of October 2007, which incorporates most of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, is considered by the Commission to be a well balanced compromise."
"The Commission therefore welcomes Ms Fourtou's report recommending approval of the common position without amendment."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank Ms Fourtou."
"I am always in awe of her grasp of the detail in this very complex matter."
"The Modernised Customs Code, as the Commissioner has heard me say before, is an amazingly boring but ever so important piece of law from the Commission."
"In 1975, when the United Kingdom voted in a referendum that we should actually be having now (a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty) - a referendum to come into this club - we thought we were voting to come into a free-trade area."
"What people got was, in fact, a customs union, and since I have been here I have been working hard on this particular report, because getting this Customs Code right and modernising it correctly is possibly the most important thing we can do until the whole thing is rejuvenated, as the Commissioner said, within the system of e-customs, making trade much more easy and duty collection much more simple across the Union."
"However, as with all things European, we do not move forward as quickly as some of us would like - if we move forward at all."
"There are still barriers that are contained within this text."
"Some are pretty much built-in, until there is a complete wipe-clean of the slate and we start all over."
"What is an Authorised Economic Operator?"
"What qualification should customs representatives - or AEOs, as they are known - have?"
"Could these be used in the future as barriers to stop people coming into the business as start-ups, or indeed existing businesses running in Europe spreading across the rest of it?"
"This Modernised Customs Code is actually a very good document, on balance, but it could have been very much better as well."
"Alas, we have to compromise in this House a little too often, but I hope that, on balance, this will be good for the continent of Europe."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, in my opinion, the Community Customs Code as presented by the Commission and debated by Parliament and the Council has proved an exemplary procedure."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Fourtou, has put in an enormous amount of work on this and in the end, as is almost always the case, Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed on the final text we will be adopting."
"I think that, as Mr Heaton-Harris has already mentioned, the European Union is above all a customs union, and so the customs code is an important component to allow it to function."
"However, the customs service as such does not function as a totally free operation: the authorities are involved to a great extent, since certain goods and values affect us all."
"What we are talking about here is smuggling and some of its more dangerous varieties, such as arms and drug smuggling, and controls of capital outflows."
"It is therefore logical that the Community Customs Code should include the normal restrictions operated by each of the Member States, and make an attempt at harmonisation."
"I feel the points of debate we had here were satisfactorily resolved by the dual concept of customs representation rights and the Authorised Economic Operator: the idea of two concepts that are theoretically different but can find common ground for harmonisation."
"I think the solution adopted is quite a good and proper solution."
"Commissioner Kovács insisted on the concept of centralised customs clearance insofar as the customs union constitutes a single unit."
"It does not, of course, make sense for there to be differences between the various customs facilities."
"I feel this is a good and practical solution that will allow us to operate in the appropriate fashion."
"The last aspect to be mentioned is the comitology procedure."
"Both the Commission and the Council have now acknowledged the importance of Parliament's involvement in the procedure."
"The agreement reached means that the 28 provisions with respect to which this procedure was applied with the involvement of Parliament have now increased to 44, i.e. Parliament may intervene in an increasingly effective fashion in the creation of provisions for the customs code."
"Finally, Mr President, I wish to thank Mrs Fourtou for her work and the Commissioner for his efforts to encompass the proposals of this House."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is undoubtedly much more than just a customs union."
"We will not reduce it to a customs union in today's debate and in the decision we take tomorrow."
"Nonetheless, the customs policy at the EU's external borders is an important element of the European Union's activities and a functioning internal market."
"The ÖVP Europe Club in the European Parliament welcomes the proposal for a regulation on a modernised Community Customs Code."
"Why?"
"Because it streamlines customs procedures, because it establishes the basis for simpler, speedier common customs procedures at the external borders, because it means that the radical changes in the international trade environment - for example, in relation to information technology, electronic data, etc. - will now be taken into account, and because customs representatives will now be subject to clearly defined common criteria, which will result in greater reliability and professionalism."
"This regulation strengthens cooperation between the Member States and the European Union."
"It creates a stronger Community, which is also reflected in the fact that all the amendments tabled by Parliament have been taken over by the Council."
"From my perspective, it means simpler, speedier common customs clearance, and that is good for business and for the European Union as a whole."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur and, of course, to our shadow rapporteur, both of whom have done valuable work on a highly technical dossier."
"With the new customs code the aim is to replace the existing code and the related regulations with a modernised code, streamline current customs procedures and create the bases for accessible interoperable customs systems across the European Union."
"This is something which we greatly welcome, for it will mean that companies will benefit from the adaptation to current developments in information technology and faster and more secure processing of the increasing volumes of goods passing the EU's borders."
"Business associations and chambers of trade have rightly warned from the outset about the excessive red tape being generated by the EU's security initiatives which have spilled over from the US. Through our deliberations in Parliament and intensive contact with the Commission's offices, we have finally achieved a relatively sound and unbureaucratic solution, for which I am grateful."
"A key point for companies that is now being implemented is centralised customs clearance through a single point of contact."
"We have also been able to push through our demand - and I am very proud of this - for privileged status for those businesses which fulfil the requisite criteria."
"As a Member from South Baden, I must point out, however, that the customs code could cause considerable problems at the EU's external borders with countries which are not EU Member States, unless precautionary measures are taken in time."
"I know that the Commission wishes to take these precautions - I am talking about Switzerland here - and I hope that the Member States in the EU-Swiss Joint Committee will also play their part."
"Switzerland is one of the most important markets for EU goods."
"Switzerland's four immediate neighbours in the EU account for 41% of its total exports and 59% of its total imports, which is why there is a need for action here."
"We cannot allow kilometre-long queues to form at the Swiss borders as a result of the introduction of the customs code, simply because the Swiss system of customs clearance differs slightly from that of the EU."
"Commissioner Kovács, I would ask you to look at this problem and draw it to the attention of the Member States concerned as a matter of urgency."
"We are talking about an economic centre in the heart of Europe which must not be cut off from the international flow of goods as a result of our activities."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I trust that tomorrow we will approve at second reading the Council's common position on the customs code."
"It is a successful modernisation of European customs legislation."
"It is a true gateway to an electronic, centralised, interoperable and automated customs system."
"All EU bodies will be able to avail of a single management point - a one-stop-shop - for their operations, making the much-needed controls more effective."
"Thanks to a unified customs information portal - single window - entrepreneurs will be able to communicate with only one customs office in the EU at the place of their establishment."
"This rule simplifies and unifies terminology and definitions, as well as making them more user-friendly."
"It is a good example of the ability, even in an enlarged EU, to simplify bureaucracy and improve the legal environment for entrepreneurs and citizens."
"Moreover, the project will reportedly have paid for itself by 2010."
"I thank the rapporteurs, Mrs Fourtou and Mr Newton Dunn, the Commission and the Council for the excellent work carried out over the last three years."
"Mr President, I would just like to make one comment in response to Mr Heaton-Harris saying that he thought that Britain in 1975 was joining a free-trade area."
"I am very worried about his memory, or perhaps it is his education."
"Britain was leaving a European free-trade area - it was called EFTA."
"We chose to leave it to join the European Community, and Mrs Thatcher, who was the Conservative leader at the time of the 1975 referendum in the UK, said that it was 'more than a free-trade area'."
"Very simple, very clear, on the record."
"Now, since Mr Heaton-Harris wants a referendum today on the Lisbon Treaty in the UK, he is clearly confident that the British public would read all the documents to make up their minds how to vote."
"And that must have been true in 1975."
"The British public in 1975 will have read in the documents that this is about an ever closer union and not a free-trade area."
"The European Union is about an ever closer union."
"So please, Mr President, can we get a pill for Mr Heaton-Harris's memory?"
"Thank you, Mr Newton Dunn."
"How gloomy our evenings in the European Parliament would be without these interesting British discussions."
"Mr President, I will resist the temptation to join in."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the detailed work on this report."
"Let us be honest, this is not the stuff that people talk about in public houses and on social occasions."
"But getting our customs laws right is very important for business and for jobs, and that is why we are doing it."
"So the idea of centralised clearance makes good sense, if it works - and let us hope that it does, under these new rules."
"Also, the idea of a single window has potential to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy."
"But can I make just one point: let us take feedback, when this all is up and running, from the economic operators, and be willing to adjust it where we see problems which have been identified by other speakers this evening."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, my point of departure is that I am not only pleased but also very proud that we have reached this point, because I agree with all those speakers who consider it a very great achievement for the Union as a whole."
"First of all, I would like to express my thanks for your support for the Modernised Customs Code and for your interest in future developments."
"As you have recalled, the adoption and subsequent entry into force of the Code will not be the end of the story, since its application will depend on the finalisation and application of its implementing provisions."
"The new regulatory procedure with scrutiny will be used for the adoption of these provisions."
"It will give Parliament the possibility to check the way the Commission intends to implement in detail, with the assistance of the Customs Code Committee, the general provisions resulting from the Code."
"Besides this procedural requirement, the Commission intends to keep Parliament, through its Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, properly informed about the state of preparation of the draft implementing measures and the time-schedule envisaged for the application of the Modernised Customs Code."
"Concerning the problem of Switzerland and the European Union, which Mr Schwab raised, on 1 July 2009 the security amendment to the Community Customs Code will be fully implemented."
"This means that all goods entering or leaving the Community shall be the subject of a pre-arrival or pre-departure declaration."
"The Authorised Economic Operator will benefit from the facilitations envisaged in the Code."
"As with other third countries, we are currently negotiating with Switzerland on the mutual recognition of control centres, the results of controls and the status of Authorised Economic Operator."
"The negotiations are ongoing, and we are looking for a mutually satisfactory solution to be in place by 1 July 2009."
"Now let me finish by inviting you to join the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union on 1 July 2008."
"The Customs Union was the first cornerstone in building the internal market and remains one of its essential components."
"I am looking forward to continuing our discussion about the future role of customs in the context of the celebrations."
"Thank you very much, once again, for your support."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to thank all those who have spoken and all those who have contributed to the drafting of this report."
"Since Mr Medina Ortega has spoken about smuggling I cannot resist the urge to bring up the subject of counterfeiting."
"Between 1998 and 2004 the number of arrests for counterfeiting rose by 1 000%."
"This just goes to show that the controls currently in place need to be updated and a new approach adopted as far as the duties of customs officials are concerned."
"I also wish to pay tribute to the professionals themselves, who have displayed a real openness of mind, and I would like to say to them that I still feel a debt of gratitude towards them."
"This will no doubt answer the concerns voiced by Mrs McGuinness."
"As far as the implementing measures are concerned, I will do my best to encourage dialogue between the customs authorities and the Community institutions, including the Commission, with which there has always been a good measure of close and productive cooperation."
"I therefore call on you to support the common position and would conclude by thanking you all for your attention."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on 19 February 2008."
"The factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Gérard Deprez, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with a proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on the factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the report that I have the honour of presenting to you today on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has its beginnings in a proposal that was tabled at the end of 2005 by our colleague Mr Duquesne, to whom I now pay tribute."
"I also wish to point out that the bulk of the work relating to this report was carried out by our colleague Mr Mayor Oreja, who for reasons that I cannot comment on here decided to withdraw his name following the vote that was held in committee."
"As regards the content of the report that has been presented to Parliament, I believe that it can be summarised by structuring the numerous elements it contains around four main themes."
"Theme one is the gravity and permanence of the threat."
"It is an undeniable fact that terrorism in general, and Jihadist terrorism in particular, is now one of the most serious threats to the security of the citizens of the European Union."
"The bloody attacks on Madrid in 2004 and on London in 2005, and let us also not forget all the other attempts that have been foiled since then, all testify to the permanent and serious nature of this threat."
"From this it follows - and the report is fairly emphatic on this point - that the fight against terrorism must remain one of the priorities of the European Union and its Member States."
"However, and this is the report's second theme, this determined fight against terrorism has to be waged in a certain way."
"There are fundamental principles to be respected; otherwise, we shall distort the basic values that govern our societies."
"The fight against terrorism has to be carried out on the basis of scrupulous respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, especially freedom of religion and the right to a fair trial."
"At the same time, and especially where Jihadist terrorism is concerned, it is important to draw a distinction between cultures and religions, on the one hand, and terrorism, on the other."
"The vast majority of Muslims, and here it must not be forgotten that it is they who have been the main victims of terrorism in Iraq, in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, have nothing whatsoever to do with the extremists; it is these groups, who distort the religion they claim to follow, that we have to combat."
"Finally, setting out from the principle that hatred and frustration are two of the factors that drive radicalisation, the report reminds the Member States that combating all forms of discrimination, and in particular those measures that seek to integrate minority groups, are priority policies to be implemented in order to promote calm, tolerance and good relations in our society."
"The third theme relates to the measures specifically aimed at preventing terrorist activities."
"While there is a long list of recommendations for Member States in this area, the report emphasises the need for greater vigilance against propaganda sites, especially via the Internet, places where preaching sessions are held and the audiovisual media in general."
"The fourth theme concerns repressive measures."
"Here there is obviously one action that needs to be highlighted above all others, for it will certainly cause no shortage of controversy."
"It is presented in paragraph 10 of the report and proposes extending the scope of the definition for acts of terrorism to the justification of terrorism."
"Now while I am not sure whether the term 'justification' is adequate here - and personally I think that in French it would have been preferable to use the term 'praise' or 'apologia' for terrorism - and whether it would not have been better to change it, I will be interested to see how this House reacts tomorrow to this somewhat delicate point, which goes to the very heart of the debate, namely where to draw the line between security, fundamental rights and freedom of expression."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, addressing radicalisation into violence is at the core of the Commission's counter-terrorism policy, and I therefore welcome the report being discussed today and the very vital issues it tackles."
"I also welcome the progress in interinstitutional cooperation in the area of recognition of the enormous challenge we face in developing a coherent EU policy that prevents, interrupts or reverses radicalisation processes."
"After a series of initiatives in recent years, since my first communication on the subject in September 2005, a communication will be presented to the Council and Parliament in July this year, identifying good practices in the Member States and making concrete recommendations for the way forward."
"I notice that the report makes a recommendation to the Commission in this regard."
"We have devoted time and resources in the last three years to better understanding this phenomenon, its trends, its manifestations and its dynamics."
"We have commissioned four separate comparative studies which are now being completed."
"We have sent a questionnaire to all the Member States and are currently analysing the answers received."
"We have organised a conference on the role of education in preventing radicalisation, which brought together educators, religious leaders and policy-makers to brainstorm new ideas."
"We are working on drafting the communication at the moment."
"The first three studies - on trigger factors, narrative and mobilisation tactics - are to be approved in the coming month."
"A fourth study on civil society engagement (best practices) is likely to be published around the time of the communication's adoption in July."
"Its main results will by that stage already have been incorporated into the communication."
"Analysis of the questionnaire sent to the Member States is ongoing and will also feed into the reflection on the communication."
"We can therefore now formulate our policy with much deeper insight into the problem."
"Our communication will deal with important issues like the narrative used by violent radicals and radicalisation in prisons and in other places of vulnerability."
"We will also be talking about the role of education, and civil society engagement in countering radicalisation."
"Members will be aware that, in relation to incitement, we have presented a proposal for the amendment of the Framework Decision on combating terrorism that is one part of the 'terrorism package' introduced last November."
"That instrument aims to introduce into the Framework Decision offences parallel to those covered in the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism: public provocation, recruitment and training for terrorism - including via the internet - and in particular internet instructions on how to produce home-made bombs."
"The Commission is strongly committed to supporting the victims of terrorism."
"We have, since 2004, demonstrated our support through financial assistance to numerous projects intended to help associations of victims of terrorism and to promote solidarity among European citizens."
"We envisage creating, in 2008, a European Network of Associations of Victims of Terrorism, in order to represent victims' interests at European level and to strengthen European citizens' solidarity with victims of terrorism."
"In conclusion, in order to tackle the terrorist threat at European level, it is absolutely necessary to implement a global prevention policy on the factors leading to radicalisation and recruitment, in order to explore its deep roots, while never justifying terrorist behaviour."
"Jihadist terrorism remains the biggest threat to democratic societies, including thousands of millions of honest Muslim people in the EU and in many other parts of the world."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is sad that we have to hold yet another debate about terrorism."
"Radicalisation and terrorism do not fit with Europe."
"The Europe which we are building is a Europe of tolerance, so it is always sad when we have to discuss this issue."
"There is a great deal that unites us."
"Terrorism is recognised as a major threat."
"Recruitment must be stopped."
"We must respect fundamental rights."
"Dialogue is the key to tolerance."
"We must be particularly aware of the Internet, particularly its significance in communication."
"In our foreign policy we view anti-terrorism as being particularly important."
"In Europe we need better networking of services to ensure that we can combat radicalisation and terrorism."
"I would particularly like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission for his suggestions here and for his summary."
"For my group, therefore, it is a great pity that the outstretched hand of our own rapporteur, Mr Mayor Oreja, was not taken and that we could not reach a compromise at the end of the process."
"The EPP-ED therefore has a number of key points which we have defined for tomorrow's vote: for example, when there are motions for deletions which state that the violation of individual rights and the rule of law lead to terrorism; when there are motions for deletions which put school and religious centres under special surveillance; and when there are motions to delete references to Jihadist terror."
"If we want to combat a threat, we need to know where the threat comes from."
"That is why we must identify Jihadist terror as the key challenge and state this in the report."
"If it is deleted, we will not be able to vote in favour of the report."
"We will not support any further watering-down of the report."
"I therefore hope that we can achieve a good result in tomorrow's vote."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank my colleagues and say immediately that we were, quite frankly, obliged to work on a report that got off to a bad start, sent out mixed messages and contained shaky proposals."
"I believe that the Committee on Civil Liberties did a remarkable job of restoring a meaningful, tangible political profile to this report."
"The basic premise was of course shared by us all."
"The violent radicalisation of individuals and groups in recent years has shown up one of the greatest weaknesses in our legal system and represented one of the greatest onslaughts on our democratic institutions."
"It is essential to combat this phenomenon."
"In this sense, European Union action offers added value since it provides harmonisation, because if we pool our instruments we shall have a sum of instruments, each of which will have its own intrinsic weakness."
"However, this is a new challenge which calls for well-balanced efforts without giving way to the natural human temptation - inevitable, given the attacks we have suffered in the years since 11 September - to generalise or to build a Fortress Europe, or to sideline a priority that is central to the process of EU integration, namely the safeguarding of fundamental rights."
"That is why we believe it is essential to move in the three directions set out by this report."
"The first step is to uphold fundamental rights and the rule of law, particularly - as Mr Frattini said - religious freedom and freedom of expression."
"Unless these rights are guaranteed, the very idea of Europe will be a failure, as will an integration process predicated above all else on the fundamental rights of European citizens."
"We need to strengthen judicial cooperation so as to strike at radical, violent, organised fringe groups."
"We need full harmonisation of terrorist crimes at European Union level, and that of condoning criminal activity should be added to the proposal of the Committee on Civil Liberties."
"Of course we also need careful prevention work: we must attack the causes and factors - which are numerous, and it is pointless to pretend otherwise - leading to the radicalisation of various population groups within our societies."
"This entails expanding the rights of citizenship, active citizenship, in other words a form of citizenship comprising responsibilities and participation in political life, as well as dialogue with religious movements."
"As the Vice-President has said, we must also fight in favour of, and protect, the millions - tens of millions - of European citizens who profess a religion different from our own, as well as the Muslim non-Community citizens who have always lived by the rules of our democracy and complied with our laws, which makes them worthy of our full respect."
"Lastly, we need to build a dialogue which genuinely represents an alliance of civilisations and not a clash of civilisations."
"'Alliance of civilisations' - I am concluding now, Mr President - Is not a term we have borrowed from a political polemic; it is the term coined by the United Nations Security Council."
"It expresses a major responsibility and a strong commitment for this House and our communities."
"I believe it is vital to keep this term in tomorrow's resolution."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (ES) I feel, Mr President, that beyond its actual format the report is balanced, extremely important, and deals with an issue that is all too familiar to us nowadays."
"There can be no doubt that terrorism is a policing phenomenon and we are all aware that it has a policing dimension."
"Nevertheless, the reasons behind terrorism, or rather the reasons that lead certain people to become terrorists, lie well beyond this."
"Jaime Mayor Oreja set this out in his first report, in an extremely debatable fashion at the outset, but after many meetings and many amendments he produced a result that was fully acceptable, including to his own Group."
"I wish to testify before this House, as one might testify in court, that it is not true that Jaime Mayor Oreja's outstretched hand was rejected."
"I would testify to this under oath if it were the practice of Parliament."
"This is not true."
"The reasons why stumbling blocks are now being produced for this report are best known to the European People's Party and the Group."
"I can testify to meetings in Mr Mayor Oreja's office at which we accepted 99% of what is to be put to the vote tomorrow."
"They cannot tell us that certain items have been rejected or that the offer has been rejected, since this is purely and simply their misrepresentation of the truth."
"The position to be adopted by the Partido Popular tomorrow, therefore, remains a mystery, and doubtless this will serve to weaken the joint political message we wish to convey. I therefore wish to express my regret at this attitude."
"I feel that to say the problem is that the word 'Jihad' must disappear in one section, when it subsequently appears in three sections, and again in recital H that Jihadism is doubtless the main focus of the type of terrorism we are dealing with, is looking for excuses that do not hold water."
"In any case, this report talks of freedom, religious freedom, freedom of thought and even freedom to reject a social model, but makes it clear that Europe cannot accept incitement to violence, incitement to hatred or the destruction of the very pillars of society under the cloak of religion."
"The State is entitled to instruments to be used in its own defence, instruments to defend its citizens."
"It may, in fact, fully implement this right in terms of the police and the judiciary, while simultaneously maintaining dialogue, participation, and working towards the full integration of people who may one day become such fanatics that they could attack their own society, the society into which they have integrated, or simply their own society, since in many cases these people were actually born among us."
"It is debatable, and my Group has debated this, to what extent current legislation is or is not sufficient; concepts such as apology and justification for terrorist acts are necessary for some, while they are rejected by others as potential excessive curtailment of freedom of expression."
"This, then, is the position of my Group: to go no further in modifying the law and to reject the concept of apologia."
"At any rate, and I am finishing up now, Mr President, I welcome this report."
"I hope that the European People's Party reconsiders and reflects on the support it could lend to the contents."
"As a guideline towards a global policy, I welcome a Commission policy whereby police forces act in close cooperation throughout Europe and measures are adopted that, beyond the polish, produce a result which respects the rights of one and all."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, paraphrasing Ernest Hemingway I would say: 'Do not ask for whom the terrorist bell tolls, it tolls for thee'."
"Following the attacks in Spain four years ago and those in England three years ago, this is a very relevant message."
"If Oriana Fallaci, a fellow-countryman of Commissioner Frattini, could read the document we are debating, she would most probably be shocked."
"Mrs Fallaci was a distinguished Italian intellectual renowned for being uncompromising and controversial She believed Islamic terrorists essentially represent Islam in a nutshell, and are the quintessence of Islam."
"Clearly, the European Parliament may have a different view on the matter."
"It is worth considering, however, why Muslim terrorists are able to garner so much support amongst young people of Arab descent born in Member States of the European Union."
"I fully support the statements that the war on terror will remain a priority for the European Union."
"It is very important for us to focus on terrorist propaganda conducted over the Internet."
"I would add that satellite television broadcasts in Arabic can also be used to promote radical Islam."
"Mr President, I represent Northern Ireland in this House, a region which, as everyone will know, has suffered decades of vicious terrorism."
"And from that experience, I have two points to make in this debate."
"Firstly, terrorism should never be appeased; it has to be defeated."
"Start treating with terrorism, giving its prisoners special status and, ultimately, early release, and soon you will end up like Northern Ireland has ended up: with unrepentant terrorists at the heart of our Government."
"Appeasement only whets the appetite - the insatiable appetite - of terrorists."
"The second point I want to make is this: whereas state abuse is wrong, the naive belief, such as I find in this report, that lavishing so-called 'human rights' on terrorists will neutralise them will, in fact, only strengthen their cause as they expertly exploit and misuse every such right to their own advantage, while they go on denying their victims the most basic right of them all: the right to life."
"Because of the excesses of their murderous strategy, sometimes the defence of society requires a choice between the uninhibited rights of terrorists and the rights of the innocent."
"In such circumstances, I have no difficulty in choosing the right of society to defend itself over the supposed human rights of the terrorist."
"The battle against terrorism is a battle of good against evil, and, if needs be, the right of the terrorist is secondary to that of society."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I must start by reiterating that the unrelenting fight against terrorism must be pursued within the law, with respect for the rule of law and without infringing fundamental rights."
"I am not sure whether terrorism is, as the report states, the main threat to the security of the citizens of the Union, but I agree with Mr Deprez that it is definitely one of the main threats."
"I believe that underestimating this threat will prevent us from fighting it effectively and increasing the security of our citizens."
"I will therefore vote against the proposed amendments."
"Terrorism does not just affect the citizens of those countries which have suffered attacks; it also threatens the security of everyone else. It spreads the fear and threat of terror."
"Terrorism is an irrational manifestation of fanaticism which disregards the value of life and the dignity of human beings."
"The Union and also Commissioner Frattini have placed the fight against terrorism at the top of their priorities."
"We need a global strategy that can dismantle the terrorist networks."
"This strategy must recognise the value of prevention, including the fight against the recruitment of terrorists and all factors favouring violent radicalisation."
"It is important to analyse and understand the reasons, grounds and processes leading to radicalisation and terrorism, particularly among young people living in our Member States."
"There have definitely been failures in the integration processes."
"I agree that, within the law and with respect for the freedom of expression, the terrorist propaganda aimed at encouraging terrorist acts must be prevented."
"To end, I must agree with Mr Mayor that a European initiative, particularly in this area, cannot and must not be used as a platform for the promotion of national electoral strategies."
"(SV) Mr President, let me begin by thanking Mr Deprez for the report and the much needed discussion on terrorism."
"I also think that it has come at the right time, as we are now in the European Year for Intercultural Dialogue."
"What I do not think the report conveys sufficiently well is the reason why people, mainly young men, become or are lured into becoming terrorists and place themselves outside democratic society."
"If we look around us, we cannot ignore the poverty that is there and injustices that are manifest."
"There are many young people to whom we cannot offer training, jobs, housing or hope for the future."
"This is a breeding ground for fanaticism and the conditioning of young people into acting to secure more rights for their group or people."
"An analysis of this is lacking in the report."
"I urge you especially to vote for Amendment 12, since terrorist propaganda today is usually spread on the internet, something which too few of us here see or can control."
"It is a generation question, and we must increase and improve our knowledge of recruitment and become better at preventing it."
"Otherwise I support the amendments of the PSE Group."
"(DE) Mr President, many thanks to Mr Deprez and Mr Guardans Cambó for their comments."
"I think they are very much in line with our group's position."
"The report is entitled 'The factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists'."
"Other speakers have welcomed the fact that we are talking about this issue, and they are right to do so."
"However, we are not discussing it for the first time."
"The European Parliament and the Union as a whole have talked about the preachers of hate and have taken preventive measures to cut off the flow of funds to terrorist organisations."
"These are certainly useful measures."
"In that respect, I think that the report largely hits the right note."
"I think it would be slightly overstating the case to view the Internet as the root of all evil or as a safe haven."
"It is undoubtedly a space which reflects social trends just as much as real life does, and I do not believe that we should be focusing all our efforts on quelling it once and for all."
"We simply will not manage it."
"The question, then, is what can we do instead?"
"We have talked about audiovisual services, and the question which arises here is: why does the European Union not take action if certain channels are broadcasting hate programmes on EU territory that are aimed directly at children?"
"In one of Hezbollah's programmes, for example, a figure disguised as Mickey Mouse - in whatever form - attacks Jewish settlers."
"This is intended to teach small Palestinian children about their history."
"It is not the case that a Member State intervened to put an end to this problem."
"Instead, the Walt Disney company asserted its rights over Mickey Mouse, and at the end of the series, Mickey Mouse was killed off by a Jewish settler."
"This was broadcast on European territory!"
"Why is Hezbollah still not on the EU's list of terrorist organisations?"
"We have just had an interesting discussion with Dick Marty on this issue."
"I believe that, in general, more building blocks are needed to curb terrorism as a whole."
"This must certainly include tackling the roots of terrorism in the countries concerned, for example by creating healthcare systems, infrastructure and education systems."
"We should not leave it to terrorist organisations like Hamas in the Gaza Strip or Hezbollah to provide these services, for these havens within society are the very places where these organisations recruit their supporters."
"- (ES) Mr President, our proposal for a recommendation to the Council and the Commission today wishes to make a contribution to the efforts of the institutions and civil society to eliminate the factors encourage support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists."
"Mr Frattini, the process to bring this to the House has been long and laborious, but there can be no doubt it will be well worth voting for the final result tomorrow."
"The proposal focuses on the fight against Islamist extremism, a new phenomenon within the EU that requires a certain amount of reflection and the means to oppose it."
"It may, however, be easily extrapolated to any other terrorist cause that may be invoked amid patriotism and flags."
"We therefore wish to ask the Council to consider apologia as such as a crime in the framework decision against terrorism."
"It would be desirable to extend harmonisation of this crime to the 27 Member States, although always, I repeat, always, with the most scrupulous respect for freedom of expression."
"Repression and prevention of radicalisation must act in parallel."
"If we wish to prevent radicalisation, we must provide education and integration for the 13 million Muslims living in the EU, and refrain from stigmatising this 3.5% of the population."
"In terms of the EU's external relations, we call for dialogue and not a clash between civilisations."
"It is for this reason that we refer to the 'alliance of civilisations' adopted by the UN, and we fail to understand the gut rejection of certain Members."
"This is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue."
"We have no wish to assist in the perversion of religion: we must encourage social participation and dialogue."
"These are some of the achievements of the recommendation."
"Are its suggestions so destructive that the speaker simply could not face them?"
"Mr Weber, I must say that Mr Mayor Oreja showed a lack of parliamentary courtesy by not explaining to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs why he voted against and subsequently rejected the report."
"His obsession with conveying to Parliament the systematic opposition at national level says a great deal about the previous speaker's democratic stance."
"This kind of attitude will be of little use to us if we wish to make progress in terms of democracy, and this House operates with consensus, not blinkered postures."
"Mr President, I believe that this is a good report and I subscribe almost entirely to the remarks of my chairman and political colleague, Mr Deprez."
"But I disagree with him and others on the proper scope of the anti-terrorist laws."
"I do not believe it is helpful to criminalise glorification of, or apologia for, terrorism."
"I think the term 'justification' is also problematic."
"As many of us were earlier discussing with Dick Marty on the subject of terrorist blacklists and asset freezing, the law needs to be both just and effective if it is to remain credible and sustainable and have public support."
"There is a profound risk that extending the criminal law as proposed, beyond actions and intentions and into the realm of opinion, commentary, and even fantasy, carries the danger of creating thought-crimes."
"This would have a potentially chilling effect on free speech."
"If I say I understand that the Kurds in Turkey have felt anger and disaffection at the suppression of their culture, language and identity and denial of their political aspirations, am I justifying PKK bombs?"
"There is hardly a person in the House - unfortunately, there are maybe a few - who would not glorify Nelson Mandela."
"But the ANC committed terrorist acts in fighting the utterly repressive apartheid state."
"There are people, now statesmen, who have been honoured guests in this Chamber, who have a past as freedom fighters."
"So am I just a woolly liberal, concerned only with free speech?"
"No, because the law has to be effective."
"We already properly criminalise incitement to commit terrorism."
"And that gives wide scope to target behaviour and speech that has, as its purpose, the instigation of a terrorist offence."
"Last week, the UK's second highest court, the Court of Appeal, quashed the convictions of five men for possession of jihadist material precisely because there was no evidence of intention to encourage terrorism."
"The original convictions in this case created resentment among those - mainly young Muslims - who wanted to discuss, debate and criticise the foreign policies of Europe and the United States."
"That does not help combat radicalism."
"But these cases have also, by their collapse, left the law in a state of confusion and disarray, and that is good for terrorists."
"Let us stick to getting convictions on the basis of incitement."
"Let us not stray into glorification and apologia."
"- (NL) Mr President, I would also like to express my appreciation of the report now before us and also of the Commissioner's words and of what he wants to do."
"In my country too, the Netherlands, a lot of attention is being given to radicalisation and its tragic consequences."
"We ourselves in the Netherlands were faced with a horrific murder of a Dutch TV producer committed by young people who came from these radicalised circles."
"We are only talking about a small group, but what they do can have major consequences."
"It is very important that we work together and that every effort is made to track down and isolate groups and individual young people who may turn to terrorist attacks."
"However, as others here have said already, the prevention of radicalisation is also vitally important."
"The point is to keep the group who may turn to violence as small as possible."
"Nor does radicalisation always end in violence."
"It is a bad thing in any case if young people feel totally isolated from society and do not want to have anything more to do with it."
"In our experience it also comes down to the fact that the policy on tackling radicalisation is directed at local authorities."
"Of course it is important to look at what you can do in the prisons and, more generally, in the area of education to look at what you can do to prevent misuse of the Internet."
"However, it is still mainly the local authorities who are able to be active in the communities to tackle the causes of radicalisation and to trace the youngsters who are susceptible to it."
"I think that the European Union, and the Commissioner in particular, can play an important role in bringing together the experience we have gained in various cities."
"Last week our group made a working visit to Rotterdam, a city where a great deal is being done to tackle and prevent radicalisation and to reach groups that are susceptible to it."
"It is also important to engage in a broader dialogue with the Muslim communities in our countries."
"Some of the young people involved come from those larger communities and if we isolate that large group we will never be able to reach that small group."
"It is important, therefore, to enter into the dialogue with the assumption that the vast majority of the Muslim communities who live in our society want nothing to do with what is a perverse interpretation of their faith, and that we invest a great deal in that broad dialogue of my group, this year too, the year of cultural dialogue."
"(SV) Thank you Mr President, Commissioner."
"The EU needs to show clearly that the fight against terrorism is, both symbolically and practically, a demonstration of solidarity."
"More resources are needed to enable Europol to cooperate with our national security services and achieve results."
"This is shown, in particular, by the recent unrest following the rekindling of antagonism over the Muhammad cartoons."
"As has been said here, the fight against terrorism must always be waged by legal and proportionate means."
"The CIA flights in Europe, the use of torture, mock executions and waterboarding, which the CIA now acknowledges did happen, and the establishment of special secret jails must be vigorously condemned."
"In these cases, Mr Frattini, the EU should have acted much more firmly than it did."
"It is good that the report adopts a broader approach and addresses the factors which contribute to increased support for and renewed recruitment to groups which reject our models of society in favour of violence and sectarianism."
"The fact that the perpetrators of the terrible outrages we have witnessed in recent years were born or grew up in Europe is a shrill wake-up call urging us also to look at our own societies with more critical eyes."
"We need a dialogue and an honest discussion on our integration and visa policy."
"Here we cannot and must not avoid difficult questions."
"But, to me, one thing is self-evident."
"It is our thinking on what should be the basis of our common legislation."
"The current debate on sharia law in Britain shows that good intentions can often be more of a hindrance than a help."
"We must also ensure that Community legislation does not jeopardise or set aside important constitutional principles, such as those governing freedom of expression."
"The report speaks of introducing a new concept in the Framework Decision: 'justification of terrorism'."
"I believe that this is unfortunate."
"Not because it is not a good idea to ensure that all Member States have good laws against incitement but because it is difficult, if not impossible, to arrive at a definition which could be applied uniformly and which would not lead to thorny problems of interpretation."
"On the one hand, there is the important task of devising ways of combating terrorism and saving lives."
"On the other hand, there is the principle of freedom of expression and the concern to maintain a high level of legal certainty in Europe."
"It is a question of finding the right balance."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, by the time the fanatics have snuffed out innocent lives and carried out bomb attacks on democratic societies, it is already too late."
"For that reason, no effort must be spared, especially - as Commissioner Frattini says - when it comes to prevention."
"Dialogue, as the key to tolerance, must be at the forefront of our attention."
"However, we also need better police cooperation and exchange of data; indeed, all the tools which can be used both within and beyond the European Union should be reinforced."
"I particularly welcome the fact that the Commissioner has drawn attention to the importance of helping victims."
"It is not just about tolerance, it is also about practical measures."
"Let me stress that there must be surveillance of the preachers of hate: that is a necessity."
"However, the information must then be acted on."
"Glorification of terrorism is never acceptable, so we need a zero-tolerance strategy towards crimes against our society."
"I think it is most regrettable that on an issue which has always been a very serious topic of discussion in this House, the national polemic has once again loomed so large in relation to this report."
"(DE) Mr President, I have been asked by fellow Members from the ALDE group how the PPE-DE intends to vote."
"Let me say again that the PPE-DE Group supports 95% of what is in the report."
"I would also like to underscore that I think it is very sad that both the ALDE representative and the PSE representative, Spanish colleagues, have attacked the PPE-DE today."
"I think it is a great pity that domestic issues are preventing us from finding common ground in this Parliament."
"Anyone who wants this House as a whole to achieve a major decision tomorrow should please vote for the PPE-DE amendments."
"We are not changing anything of the substance of the motion, but we are removing the domestic policy aspect."
"Anyone who wants to grasp the outstretched hand of the PPE-DE Group can do so tomorrow."
"(DE) Mr President, I am delighted that you have given us leave to speak again, as that has been handled differently in another debate."
"Nonetheless, although Mr Pirker and I may not always see eye to eye - we often argue, and do so with great enjoyment and fervour - he is quite right to say that such debates should not be abused for national purposes."
"It disrupts everything and it simply leads to false compromises."
"I am sure that the Spanish colleagues here in the House will give a different answer."
"I simply know from my own experience that this type of thing is very often dragged into the national debate."
"I am also getting rather tired of the fact that - not for the first time - we are being used as a ping pong ball between the PPE-DE and the PSE on these matters."
"However, I am glad that the Liberals have been able to mediate and are still up to the challenge."
"Our colleague from Northern Ireland is unfortunately no longer present."
"I find that rather galling because he said something that I view as quite incredible: he said that terrorists do not have the same basic human rights as everyone else."
"However, that is precisely what distinguishes us from terrorists: the fact that we regard human rights as universal."
"We should never give the impression that this House could ever take a different view."
"Mr President, owing to the importance of this debate, I have a question for the PPE-DE Group."
"The issue was raised that if the PPE-DE Group was to support the report, it would withdraw, and ask the other groups to withdraw, any element relating to internal Spanish politics."
"I would ask the PPE-DE Group's representative which amendment tabled by that group is linked to Spanish politics."
"It would be very interesting to know, and then it could be made public which of the amendments of the PPE-DE Group concern internal politics."
"Is it the reference to the United Nations in Amendment 1 which they want to delete?"
"Do they want to delete a reference to the United Nations?"
"Is that Spanish internal politics?"
"One has to be coherent."
"The only person who is trying to introduce internal politics is Mr Mayor Oreja, who did not even have the courtesy to attend this part-session."
"Mr President, I would be extremely grateful if anyone who is supporting the amendments to criminalise glorification could be so kind as to try and answer the points that I raised, which are, first of all, that I fear a chilling effect on free speech and, secondly, that I do not know how they can be made operational."
"What is the connection between glorifying an act of terrorism and another terrorist act being committed?"
"It seems to me that there are legal problems, as was found in the UK Court of Appeal last week, because there is no direct connection between glorification and a new terrorist act, which there obviously is when there is incitement, or encouragement at least."
"If you just 'glorify' a terrorist act, then what is the straight-line connection between that and another act being committed?"
"If you cannot establish that connection, you risk being undercut in the courts and then end up in a much worse position than before you started. I would be very grateful if anyone who actually supports the criminalisation of glorification or apologia could perhaps educate me, because this is something I do not quite understand."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too believe that this evening's debate has been of considerable political significance."
"I also believe that we must jointly come up with a widely shared political solution that will form the subject of a report acceptable to all of humanity or, if not, to a large majority of parliamentary groups."
"I have no doubt that today's terrorists are seeking to establish a new form of global dictatorship."
"We experienced powerful dictatorships in the last century, but this one is a dictatorship based on violating the primary fundamental right, namely the right to life."
"It is clear, in addition, that this strategy, along with violence and hatred, has regrettably become a global strategy."
"That is why our reaction must consist not merely of cooperation among police forces and information services, but of a political response to avert and remove the causes that lead to terrorism."
"I believe, and many of you have emphasised, that prevention means eradicating hatred and eliminating the reasons for hatred, without ever justifying violence, since the gravest risk we run is to begin justifying violence."
"We must eradicate hatred without justifying violence."
"Someone spoke of a conflict of civilisations."
"In my view, that theory leaves a lot to be desired."
"Personally I am not convinced that a clash of civilisations is underway."
"I am convinced that an internal conflict is going on within the Islamic world, that is, a conflict between a minority which misappropriates the religious message and the vast majority of Muslims who, I believe, are absolutely peace-loving and want to live in a spirit of peace and tolerance."
"If we are to provide a political response, ladies and gentlemen, I think the only option is to strengthen reformist, peace-loving Islam against that minority which is neither reformist nor peace-loving."
"All of these are political measures; they are not police or security measures."
"I have referred to the rights of victims and I believe that more work is needed in this area."
"Victims' rights must be given greater consideration than in the past, so as to offer them practical help which - believe me, I am convinced of this - means not just financial help but in many cases assistance for them or their survivors, for the relatives of victims of attacks and murders, to help them reintegrate into society after the terrible trauma they have suffered."
"Another right of victims is not to be left alone after having survived an attack or having lost a relative or loved one."
"Someone said that we need to understand the causes of terrorism."
"I agree, and have said so myself, but I believe that terrorist groups, organisations and methods must not be given legitimacy by our attempt to understand them."
"Understanding is one thing; lending legitimacy is another: there is a fundamental difference."
"I should like to recall one last point."
"The European Union would play a significant political role in the world, in my opinion, if it could achieve something that has not yet been achieved."
"That something is to encourage the United Nations to adopt at long last the international convention on the definition of terrorism."
"That definition still does not exist, which causes us a number of difficulties outside Europe."
"Europe has its own definition of terrorism, but as you know some member countries of the UN General Assembly have still not endorsed either the substance or the procedure of a UN convention on terrorism."
"I believe that if Europe really is united in this area, it could do something akin to what we did concerning the moratorium on the death penalty: make the United Nations take a stance on an important, consolidated European position, thereby giving global legitimacy to the response to terrorism."
"If terrorism is global, our response must be absolutely firm but likewise global."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would like to make three comments at the conclusion of this debate."
"The first is that if we listen to the Commissioner and then listen to most of the contributors the first thing that really strikes us is that - as regards the analysis of the phenomenon, the seriousness of the threat and the balance that has to be drawn between measures aimed at prevention and those aimed at suppression - there is a great deal of common ground between us all once we start to discuss the operational side of things: what we need to analyse, what we need to prevent and what we need to suppress."
"Secondly, and regrettably, I have the feeling that when it comes to certain elements that are more symbolic than anything else we shall not be able tomorrow to reach the consensus that is needed and I would regret this because after having examined the list of amendments it seems to me that most of the differences are symbolic rather than substantive in nature."
"The problem is that these symbolic conflicts of interest could be alleviated if the parties decided to make a gesture, something that is not always a defining characteristic of the political groups that make up this Parliament."
"Thirdly, there are several comments that I would like to direct at some of those present in this House, especially - and Mr Alvaro feels the same way - with regard to my fellow Member from Ireland, who considers that respect for human rights is not needed in the fight against terrorism."
"I find that this attitude poses a risk, and a serious one at that, to the values on which our society is based."
"There is a certain Head of State, and I heard him talk on the television one day, a European Head of State who said that he would take a knife to the terrorists and do for every last one of them."
"Well that particular regime is now one that poisons its opponents, allows its journalists to be murdered and holds elections that may be free but may also be fraudulent."
"To play with human rights in the fight against terrorism is to run the risk of an unacceptable slide in our democratic societies."
"We have also been questioned directly by Mrs Ludford on the problem of apologia for terrorism."
"I am unable to respond to her in any great depth but would simply say that I am the rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the terms of which are known to her, and that when I presented my views just now I was basing them on paragraph 10 of the report that was adopted by the committee, which states quite clearly, Mrs Ludford, that the committee, and hence Parliament, calls for open discussions on amending Framework Decision such and such in order to include the justification of terrorism within its scope, and so on."
"I was not therefore making any kind of plea, I was simply expressing what had been agreed by the Committee on Civil Liberties; nevertheless, I will respond to her directly."
"When I speak of apologia for terrorism, apologia means incitement and I believe that incitement is a criminal offence."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 19 February 2008."
"Written Statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (SV) The fight against terrorism must only be fought in a way which is appropriate to an open, democratic and just society."
"It is absolutely essential that threats to an open society are countered by the methods of an open society."
"We must balance our action and the measures we take by safeguarding human rights and the rule of law and must not resort to measures which jeopardise personal integrity."
"I have therefore decided to vote against Mr Deprez's proposal for a recommendation to the Council on the factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists."
", in writing. - (RO) The cooperation between the EU institutions on the fight against terrorism should be perfected, taking into consideration that this phenomenon has increased."
"I believe terrorism has become the main enemy of European values, global stability and peace."
"If we remember the events of 11 September 2001 or those in Madrid a few years ago, we have the perfect configuration of a picture expressing horror, fear and suffering."
"The European institutions should have developed a strategy for becoming acquainted with, reducing and eliminating this phenomenon ever since that time."
"It is necessary for us to start a study as thorough as possible in this regard: to show its causes, what keeps the terrorists so fierce and capable of giving up their lives in order to become martyrs, whose martyrs they are, how the recruitment is done, who finances it and how we can intervene in any way to discourage this phenomenon."
"Therefore, in order to find out all these things and to control them in the EU's interest, the European institutions should be concerned with drawing up this strategy."
"In this way, the EU will give a signal of unity and strength to the entire world."
"EU Market access for European Companies (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mr Guardans Cambó, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on the EU's strategy to deliver market access for European companies."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, during discussions on the Lisbon Strategy and all it meant for growth and competitiveness in Europe, unfortunately the issue of external trade did not receive the attention it deserved as a substantial part of a strategy for competitiveness, growth and employment within the European Union."
"We have now moved on and the European Commission has corrected this situation, it has set things straight and it has clearly positioned external trade, access to foreign markets, as yet another pillar of the structure that must lead to growth and welfare in the European Union."
"The export of goods and services is a basic component of competitiveness in our economies, and is thus a factor of employment and wealth in the European Union."
"The main export access difficulties arise from non-tariff barriers in particular, rather than from generally recognised tariffs."
"The Commission has already carried out a wide-ranging consultation, thereby demonstrating its intentions within the context of its broader strategy for a global Europe, intentions that we support."
"This report, in fact, covers a good many of the replies received during the consultation, or some of them at any rate, which the Commission decided not to include at the time."
"Globalisation is not an external threat from which we need to be protected. In my view, it is a huge opportunity to achieve what we could not achieve before, and a larger market is one way of creating wealth, in other words, creating employment and improve the citizens' welfare."
"Clearly, and here I am speaking to a certain section of the House, that what this report is calling for is market access, market access that must be enhanced, a strategy that can and must respect the circumstances prevailing in each country."
"European leadership in this area respect the legitimate concerns of emerging economies, and must continue to do so."
"One of the world's most open economies, however, such as the European model, cannot allow itself to be carried away by certain dogmatisms."
"The export of goods and services cannot be subject to unjustifiable barriers, nor can public contracts, and the Commission can and must do more in both these areas."
"It can and must improve its instruments in Brussels, in the framework of the EU, through better coordination with the trade promotion bodies in Member States and regions, and with the actual businesses involved."
"It is here, Commissioner, that the word subsidiarity ought to be understood in its broadest sense."
"It is here that the Commission has a role to play that cannot be played by any other entity, a role that elbows no one out of the way and enhances every one of us, coordinating the work that others already do, perhaps less effectively than the Commission might."
"Thus the report sets out a number of specific points, some very specific indeed, which the Commission can improve within the context of its market access strategy."
"I do not intend to read them out here, but they are extremely clear and precise, and may be assessed with the same kind of precision."
"We are also making an extremely specific request for the Commission to define ad hoc courses of action to defend and improve the presence of SME products in third country markets, since it is these products that encounter most difficulties when they have no protection."
"The Commission also can, and must, secure better coordination of resources on the ground without offending sensibilities or excluding anyone."
"Each state, each export support body, each trade delegation from a Member State: without offending anyone, the EU trade delegations can strengthen their role in third countries."
"There can be no justification for the lack of communication between certain foreign trade actors, whom anyone who has made a visit will know."
"Nor can we discard, whenever possible, a genuine multilateral approach with a view to improving standardisation, and the need to improve mechanisms within the WTO framework; all this will prove extremely useful."
"I therefore feel that we can all welcome the adoption of this report, presumably by a large majority."
"I particularly wish to thank the secretariat of the Committee on International Trade, which helped with the drafting of the report, and the shadow rapporteurs in the various parliamentary groups who tabled amendments and improved the text."
"This signals the start of a new political impetus."
"It is not just a piece of paper to be approved, framed and hung on the wall."
"This is the beginning of a strategy, as the name suggests, and a strategy requires a whole range of measures: these measures must be implemented and we must be able to ask the Commission at a later date to come back to Parliament and explain to us how they have been implemented."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Guardans Cambó, and the Committee on International Trade very much indeed for this very constructive report."
"It confirms that we share a common vision, both on the importance of a proactive market access strategy for European businesses and workers, and on the basic principles that should underlie this strategy."
"The priorities that are set out here - SMEs, barriers to services and investment, public procurement and IPR - are very much my priorities."
"That is the same message that the European Council sent last June, and again in response to our progress report last month."
"We have built a strong new consensus on the importance of this work."
"At the heart of the global Europe strategy that we launched in 2006 was the commitment both to keeping our own markets in Europe open, and also to refocusing our resources on creating new opportunities for European workers and companies in the markets of our main trading partners."
"We can do that above all through a successful WTO trade deal, but we can also do it through a new generation of free-trade agreements."
"It also means taking a more hard-headed approach to modern trade barriers, and especially non-tariff barriers which operate not at the border, but behind the border."
"Europe's workers and companies can compete almost anywhere if they are given a fair opportunity and a level playing field on which to compete."
"Our job is to support them and provide them with a platform to do that, which means focusing on the barriers, conditions and discriminatory regulatory practices that operate against them and deny them that fair opportunity to compete and to trade."
"The challenge in 2007 has been to put this policy into practice."
"In particular, we have focused on strengthening our resources on the ground in our most important markets by creating market access teams that bring together a business, a Member State and Commission staff and experts."
"These are the people who really know the markets and who have a feel for the local politics and a clear sense of both what is necessary and what is possible."
"This has produced good results."
"In the last six months we have scored important successes in South America, Central Asia, South Asia, Japan and Russia."
"We have also stepped up our cooperation with the United States on market access issues, which has been instrumental in some of these successes."
"We have also introduced an on-line complaint register for EU companies and launched real-time and monthly reporting on market access work."
"I therefore mildly disagree with the suggestion in the report that the Commission has not done enough to bring out the full potential of this partnership during the launch phase."
"That does not mean either that I consider the collaboration to be perfect or that I feel in the least bit complacent about what we could do differently, and even better, than we are at the moment."
"I agree that this new strategy is a dynamic process which requires constant vigilance and constant commitment."
"Frankly, it also needs some more high-profile advocates of what we are doing and how we are setting about pursuing our objectives, both in this House and also among the Member States - people who believe in economic openness, but who are also not afraid to speak up for reciprocal market opening, especially amongst those emerging economies whose own growth is being driven by their access to our markets."
"That is right, that is fair and that is the principle of international trade that we believe in - that whilst we remain open to others they too should progressively open their markets to us if the principle of international trade is going to be well and properly served."
"I agree with the rapporteur when he calls on all stakeholders to participate actively in this partnership."
"We are continuing to improve our coordination work on the ground with Member States and industry, but we need these experts to step up as well if we are to achieve our potential."
"On the question of resources, I am grateful for the additional staff that the budgetary authorities have allocated to DG Trade."
"We will continue to push for more resources for the most important markets in Asia and, for example, in Brazil."
"In the mean time we have strengthened our staffing on market access activities in Brussels."
"Finally, I also take note of your request to receive an annual report from the Commission."
"Along with the regular reporting, I would be pleased to discuss the annual activity report with Parliament."
"So, my thanks again to the rapporteur and to Parliament for its engagement in this very important work."
"It is vital that we maintain our energy and engagement in 2008 and beyond."
"This priority means a lot to me and to my services; it means a lot to our businesses in Europe and for the employment they are able to create for our workers, flowing from increased market access and from the strengthening of world trade that is at the heart of our trade policy strategy for a global Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Rapporteur for approval Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (RO) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the European Union's Market Access Strategy was initiated in 1996."
"The Commission developed a free service that provides the European exporters with an electronic, public, updated register regarding the market access conditions in approximately 100 countries."
"In 2007, in the euro zone, trade recorded a surplus of 28.3 billion euros, as compared to a deficit of 9.3 billion euros in 2006."
"In 2007, the EU-27 recorded a deficit of 185.7 billion euros, as compared to a deficit of 192.1 billion euros in 2006."
"Therefore, at Community level, actions should be taken so that the Member States outside the euro zone would become more competitive."
"We consider that the market access will be facilitated by promoting the European Union's values and principles to third countries by promoting open markets, by approaching social standards and environmental standards and by ensuring the protection of intellectual rights."
"Investments in research, promotional campaigns to make the available services and information public, improving the Community computer system regarding market access, interconnecting the specific databases and training specialists who would support the European companies should be part of the Commission's partnership with the Member States and the European companies."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, the new market access strategy of the Commission should really help to remove barriers in third countries."
"It is, therefore, as the Commissioner says, an appropriate addition to the WTO and an important addition to free trade agreements."
"I am very pleased with the positive report from Parliament, and would like to thank our rapporteur, Ignasi Guardans Cambó, who also managed to set out such clear priorities: better cooperation with European businesses and more support for small and medium-sized enterprises; the help-desk at the Commission but also on the ground in the third countries."
"I think that the European Institute in China for small and medium-sized European companies is an excellent Commission initiative."
"It is a matter of reciprocity."
"We open up our market to third countries and then the markets in those third countries should also be opened up to our European companies, especially in the emerging economies of China, India, Brazil and Russia."
"We should therefore give this priority in the market access strategy, with market access teams that will assist European companies in those countries."
"This means that we have to put in sufficient personnel to do this, including in those European embassies, as you already said."
"European business is the biggest exporter in the world and we have to compete constantly against protectionist measures, even in those third countries."
"Set your priorities for the areas that are important: services, public procurement, investments, intellectual property and customs procedures."
"I am pleased that you have announced that you will report to us annually and it would be good to discuss the priorities once a year."
"You have demonstrated ambition here and that is a precious thing to us."
"I really hope that you also show ambition when it comes to adapting the trade defence instruments, the same ambition as you have shown in this strategy."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I wish to begin my speech by congratulating the rapporteur on his important work in terms of proposals and analysis."
"This Parliament does not vote on explanatory statements, but if it did so on this report, I would vote in favour because it certainly justifies the main proposals for provisions."
"Thus I feel able to announce the support of the Socialist Group, with a request that the rapporteur take into account some of the main amendments we have tabled, in due accordance with the ideals of a left-wing group."
"Europe certainly is the world's largest goods exporter and its leading service provider."
"Moreover, in a globalised context we have a legitimate right to market as many of our products and services as possible, in the markets of emerging countries in this case."
"Why not?"
"It is logical and normal, and it is what our citizens would want."
"Thus the proposals put forward in the report and set out in the Commission communication are correct, starting with the prevention of non-tariff barriers, a 'Hydra', as the rapporteur so rightly calls them: a Hydra working behind the scenes, not only preventing European products and services from reaching markets, but also preventing balanced development in those countries and markets."
"I am therefore of the opinion that this report is on the right path, for what we must do is secure our Lisbon agenda and strengthen our social model. We also need to ensure that this model can penetrate the emerging countries with which we wish to trade."
"We place a considerable emphasis on working conditions, security, protection of the environment and, above all, human rights."
"Those are our principal amendments."
"I must repeat our request that the rapporteur take account of these. Indeed, how do we actually achieve these goals?"
"We achieve them through much more intense cooperation - I do not know if it can be called 'enhanced' cooperation, since that creates confusion with institutional provisions in the new Treaty - between the EU, Member States and businesses, starting with support for SMEs. Congratulations, therefore, and good night."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the sensitivity of this matter and how much attention is paid to it in our respective countries."
"The UEN Group is very satisfied with the proposal put forward by Mr Guardans Cambó and the additional work done by the Committee on International Trade."
"I would compliment the rapporteur on his analysis and European focus, and consequently his emphasis on the difficulties often caused by the unwarranted obstacles confronting European industry on international markets."
"Improving competitiveness means doing whatever is necessary to ensure the success of the Lisbon strategy."
"If we are able to give European industry better access to international markets, we will enable companies to grow, invest in know-how and technology, and create more jobs."
"This is what many economic sectors in our countries are asking of us."
"Various kinds of obstacles impede access to foreign markets by European industry."
"These barriers consist of a number of different measures ranging from confused regulations and disincentives to investment or market access, to unfair trading practices, scant regard for intellectual property rights and widespread counterfeiting, which is detrimental to European goods, and, more generally, serious and systematic violations of the WTO rules and other rules governing international trade."
"The Commission's communication goes in the right direction and Parliament wishes to support the initiatives it sets out, aimed at improving access to foreign markets."
"These include the formation of a stronger strategic partnership between the Commission, maintaining its coordinating role, the Member States, and European Union businesses, with a view to supporting economic operators and especially SMEs wishing to make contact with or export to third countries."
"The Commission delegations in certain key countries need a stronger presence."
"This should form part of a broader strategy carried out in conjunction with our main trading partners, such as the United States, Japan and Canada; they have the same concerns as ourselves internationally and could join the Union in promoting a multilateral agreement in this field, backing WTO mechanisms that ensure a faster response to any new non-tariff barriers."
"Multilateral action, the most effective type of action owing to the number of countries involved but also the most difficult, therefore needs to be accompanied by agreements identifying and resolving the inconsistencies connected with the existence of unwarranted obstacles in third countries."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Mr President, when one reads the Commission Communication and, in particular, Parliament's report, one might think that the poor little EU is being discriminated against by malign foreign forces."
"This emerges especially from paragraph 4 of the report, which says that we urge the Commission to ensure that the European Union's trade interests are defended against the abusive or unfair trade practices of third countries."
"And again: 'when third countries unjustifiably restrict access to their markets by European Union companies, the European Union should react rapidly and firmly'."
"We should be careful when using that kind of language to former colonies."
"They remember when Europe last acted firmly to defend its interests."
"That kind of talk can damage us more than any trade restrictions."
"Certainly the Commission has a point in that there are technical barriers to trade and unfair rules."
"Of course we must discuss them with our partners calmly and reasonably and solve any problems there may be."
"But invite, not only businesses, but also voluntary organisations, including those from third countries."
"Then perhaps we can understand how the rules came about and understand whether they are reasonable or not."
"I am uneasy about the ten-point list."
"Restrictive export procedures for raw materials, a ceiling on foreign ownership in the services sector, restrictions on foreign direct investment, state procurement procedures and the application of state aid must be seen as barriers to trade which have their justification; they arise from legitimate legislation and are administrative measures from public authorities."
"They cannot be removed without public consultation and deliberation, if stability in those countries is not to be compromised."
"Countries must have the right to protect health and the environment and have procurement procedures which ensure that their local businesses are not completely excluded from international competition, thereby creating mass unemployment."
"Also we cannot be so unreasonable as to expect countries to protect our intangible property rights when they hardly have the resources to protect human rights."
"We should promote freedom rather than set traps."
"We must come down on those rules which seek to favour businesses in their countries which have foreign operations and which act against other foreign players."
"That is where we can remove rules."
"We should be able to turn a blind eye to rules which are directly or indirectly intended to protect the population or businesses active locally."
"We ourselves protected our industries until they were strong enough to compete internationally."
"Others must be allowed to do the same."
"(SV) To create market access means abolishing tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade around the world."
"It is an immensely important priority for the Union's trade policy."
"It creates not only business opportunities for European companies but also gives them access to better and cheaper products in other parts of the world."
"It creates prosperity across the world."
"It is also a matter on which I feel there is unaccustomed agreement in the European Parliament."
"It is gratifying at a time when protectionism is on the march all around the world."
"I therefore also think that the Commission Communication and Mr Guardans Cambó's report are more welcome than at any other time."
"They are really very good."
"In this discussion I would like to draw attention to another question which we must not ignore - the other side of openness."
"I think that they belong together."
"European firms also need openness within Europe in order to be competitive on a global basis and make use of the market access which we can create in other countries."
"In our globalised world, with ever more companies having global supply chains, our own tariffs can be just as damaging to our successful businesses as those tariffs we oppose in other countries."
"I have a concrete proposal for the Commissioner, a proposal which may help a little in resolving this question."
"When firms have problems trading within the EU they report them to Solvit, which is an excellent tool for increasing mobility on the internal market."
"If a firm has a problem exporting to a country outside the EU, it refers it to the Market Access Database."
"That too is immensely important."
"Both of these systems provide a basis for negotiations on how trade can be facilitated."
"Let us hope that we can also develop either the Market Access Database or Solvit in order to deal with problems which importing firms in the EU may experience."
"If we do that, both we ourselves and the rest of the world can continue to move in a direction which is more conducive to free trade."
"Then we can show that Europe is taking the lead in opening up markets, both abroad and at home."
"(PL) Mr President, the report by Mr Guardans Cambó deals with all the areas involved in strengthening partnership to allow European exporters easier access to third country markets."
"Protectionist practices, unfair competition and the erection of bureaucratic barriers often restrict access to those markets."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises create the most jobs in Europe but experience particular problems exporting."
"Their opportunities are limited due to lack of resources needed for research, new technology, to gain a foothold in those markets and adjust their products and services to consumers."
"The report rightly emphasises the need for European, governmental and diplomatic sources to offer meaningful assistance to SMEs."
"The European Union should increase its logistic action and offer proper support to make it easier for these entrepreneurs to be active on third country markets."
"(EL) Like you, Commissioner, we are particularly concerned about the lack of reciprocal terms of access to the market and the unequal treatment of European products encountered by many partners."
"In the textile industry and clothing sector, for instance, the EU applies an average tariff of 9%, which is one of the lowest in the world."
"On the other hand, many competitors impose tariffs of up to and above 30% together with a host of non-tariff barriers."
"Thus the emerging economies also need to accept, to a certain extent, the principle of reciprocity in concessions in line with their level of development and their competitiveness in a given sector."
"The protection of intellectual property rights and geographical indications at global level remains fairly inadequate; it neutralises the competitive advantage of the high added value of European industrial and agricultural products."
"The harmonisation of international regulatory models and rules facilitates access to foreign markets and must not render the European regulatory framework of environmental, social, public health and consumer protection more flexible."
"Quite the reverse: the object is convergence, but in an upward direction."
"Of special importance is the classification of imports according to the relevant specifications and requirements, as well as the search for successful methods for tackling environmental and social dumping."
"Finally, I should like to stress that small and medium-sized enterprises must be at the heart of the new market access strategy."
"I congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur as well the Commissioner."
"We welcome the Commission's initiative on the new market access strategy."
"(CS) Commissioner, I, too, am convinced that the Commission delegations and the new market access teams operating in third countries require a considerably stronger mandate."
"The Commission should, in my view, reconsider its priorities in the allocation of human resources in the EU delegations and increase the number of delegation staff, especially those operating in China, India, Russia and Brazil."
"The Member States should play a more substantial part in contributing to the human and financial resources of these delegations, proportional to their trade interests."
"Moreover, the Commission and the Member States should improve cooperation with European chambers of commerce, trade associations and Member State agencies in third countries."
"This is fundamental for the exchange of information among delegations, diplomatic missions and European business associations."
"This would benefit SMEs in particular."
"The main objective of our strategy, however, has to be reciprocity of trade relations, especially for example in China, and more rigorous enforcement of international trade legislation, rather than labelling this enforcement as protectionism."
"Mr President, I was interested that the Commissioner was the only one who mentioned the World Trade talks."
"Perhaps this is an opportunity to get some information referring to the new opportunities in the markets of our main trading partners that a successful WTO deal would give us."
"But you also said, Commissioner, that perhaps a new generation of free-trade agreements might do it."
"Are you conceding defeat at the WTO?"
"Perhaps you could give us some up-to-date information on that, because I think that is a crucial part of this debate."
"Could I ask you, also, to clarify some concerns in relation to the current situation on the agriculture part of the WTO?"
"There are concerns about further concessions being made by the EU on import tariffs on sensitive products, and some large tariff-rate quota increases as being part of the agenda, because there is also the issue of what progress you are making at the WTO on access for non-agricultural goods and services."
"I think we need an update, if you can give us that, as part of this debate."
"(PL) Mr President, as we take the floor in this debate we wish to draw attention to three issues."
"Firstly, it is essential for the European Union to adopt a firm and unambiguous stance in every situation in which the export interests of a Member State are threatened as a result of unfair practices by third countries."
"In this connection, we should recognise the stance adopted by the European Union in the case of the embargo preventing Polish meat and agricultural products from accessing the Russian market."
"Unfortunately, this stance towards Russia was only adopted after more than a year of restrictions by Russia on Polish exports, and after Poland used its veto to hold up preparations for the EU-Russia agreement."
"Secondly, opening up the Union's markets to goods and services from third countries should be governed by the principle of reciprocity. The Union as a whole should therefore monitor whether exporters from third countries include in their manufacturing costs the contributions to be made to provide for compliance with environmental standards and social security for workers in their countries."
"European products will always be beaten by their competitors on the world's markets if the aforementioned costs are not taken into account."
"Thirdly, great caution should be exercised when opening up the Union's market for access of agricultural products from third countries."
"If the market is opened up fully many sectors of European agriculture will simply disappear, which would threaten Europe's food security."
"(PL) Mr President, open economies and markets are features of the contemporary market economy, the economy of the 21st century."
"This is a first for the global economy. Not all economic entities are in a position to deal with competition, however, especially when competition is not always fair, and is dominated by the great and powerful."
"Both large and small firms can import, but large firms have more opportunities to develop export."
"This is because entering new markets requires substantial investment in promotion and in setting up the whole logistical system."
"It therefore seems appropriate for SMEs to organise joint action to develop exports, especially to promote the latter."
"A certain degree of aid and State support for companies in the area of export promotion should be allowed, notably in the area of know-how."
"At WTO level, too, agreement should be reached on the development of trade between SMEs."
"Accessibility of information on entities active on the global market is particularly important."
"The quality of trade should be improved and priority given to creating equal opportunities for market access."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I wish to thank you and the honourable Members for what has been a very constructive and useful debate on this excellent report."
"I am particularly grateful to the Member who intervened to urge a reassessment of the staffing allocations of Commission delegations in key economies."
"I thought this was an excellent proposal, and one that I will have no hesitation at all in communicating to my colleagues."
"I could rehearse for you the details of the small number of delegation staff working, for example, on trade matters in China compared to the considerably larger numbers of staff working on what is a very small amount of development aid and cooperation in that country, set alongside the billions that are at stake for Europe in trade."
"But I will not;"
"I will simply pocket the suggestion and pass it on."
"It is certainly not the case that I am advocating free-trade agreements at the expense of the world trade talks."
"Anyone who is familiar with the global Europe trade strategy that we presented in November 2006 will realise that my advocacy of deep, comprehensive free-trade agreements that really contribute to increasing the sum total of world trade, and not simply divert it, has been a feature of our approach alongside our commitment to the WTO talks - the Doha Round."
"I can assure the honourable Member that I am continuing to work for their success rather than their failure."
"Rumours about further unacceptable or inappropriate concessions on agriculture are unfounded."
"Indeed, the only rumours that I have picked up about such unwarranted concessions actually came from the Irish Foreign Minister in the General Affairs Council today."
"These rumours seem to be circulating within a relatively small community of interest."
"The fact is that on agriculture - and other areas of the Doha talks - we will move as far as it is prudent for us to go in order to contribute to the success of the world trade talks, but ultimately this must be within the limits of the mandate we have been given on the basis of the 2003 CAP reform."
"It is true that we have two new negotiating texts that have been presented by negotiating group chairs in recent weeks."
"On agriculture, we have a text in which not everything is to our liking, but there is nothing that we cannot handle in that agriculture text or that will push us beyond our mandate."
"In the case of non-agricultural market access - industrial goods - the situation, in my view, is not so satisfactory."
"There, the new text presented by the chairman has created a greater fluidity in the negotiations, rather than more concrete foundations."
"I regret that, but again it is something that we have to work with and negotiate our way through."
"These debates would not be so enjoyable if it were not for Mr Schlyter's contributions."
"Whenever he intervenes I always feel reinforced in my personal commitment and conviction concerning free trade."
"His interventions always reassure me that we are indeed on the right track."
"It is not a question of the poor little European Union struggling against the mighty titans amongst the emerging economies, nor is it about a sort of fit of aggressive bullying that has taken over the Commission in the area of trade, in which we seek without consultation or consideration to impose our interests on others."
"The fact is that those of us who believe in international trade are seeking balance and we are seeking reciprocity, but we are also seeking mutual advantage."
"When we seek openings in the economies of others, we are not doing that in order simply to satisfy ourselves, or to serve our own interests and our own needs."
"We are also contributing to the welfare and growth of the economies whose greater opening we are trying to bring about."
"Of course, the liberalisation of economies is something that has to be achieved progressively."
"It is an incremental process, rather than a big bang or a sudden shock."
"The fact is that emerging economies benefit from greater opening."
"This means useful competition to stimulate innovation and to spur productivity in those economies, it means lowering the costs of inputs to local industry, it means lower-priced goods for consumers in those emerging economies, and it means bringing capital, technologies, creativity and modern management skills to those emerging economies."
"The fact is that this process of opening and integration to the global economy secures the growth and strengthening of those emerging economies to enable their businesses to grow, to create much-needed employment for their workers in these economies, and to generate products and services for export so that they can create and secure a growing share of international trade."
"In other words, opening begets opening; trade begets trade."
"Our prosperity and our opportunities beget opportunities for those who live and work in those emerging economies."
"It is, in other words, a virtuous process that we are talking about, and that is what the market access strategy which our rapporteur has presented such an excellent report on is all about."
"In concluding, I would say that when it comes to local procurement it is indeed important to support and encourage the capacity of emerging economies and developing countries to supply their local procurement markets."
"However, if this means higher costs for public procurement in those economies, if it means inefficiencies, if it means a lack of transparency, and indeed in some cases corruption in the operation of public procurement, who shoulders the costs of that?"
"The answer is the very local people, the very local workers and the very local taxpayers in emerging economies and developing countries who can ill afford to shoulder those costs."
"That is why it is important to bring openness and transparency to public procurement policies and behaviour in emerging economies."
"It is not simply to please and to satisfy the 'poor little' European Union."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, there is not much more to say."
"First of all, let me thank again all those who have enriched this debate, not just today but ever since the debate started, through their contributions, amendments and even the informal conversations we have had, which has resulted in a final text which is not the work of one rapporteur but of everyone involved."
"We mostly shared the diagnosis, and I was very surprised at the tone of some of the comments from the Green corner of this House."
"It would be interesting to have the colleague in question go and see the results and consequences of free trade in situ and also to go and explain to a medium-sized enterprise, say near Barcelona where I live, that this was a 'colonial approach'."
"I could quote so many companies who are fighting to export, with a great part of their activities depending on exports."
"He might like to tell the employees of those factories that they are just acting as European colonisers in trying to enlarge the export market share of the product they are manufacturing, when if China introduces barriers which prevent them from exporting what they are manufacturing it is their jobs which are at stake."
"This is not just about big words on big European companies being colonial, it is about something much more real."
"Although everyone has the right to portray things as they wish, I must say that the idea of this being a 'colonialist' report really surprised me and might be even be viewed as comic by a lot of exporters in my country."
"It is clear, though, that we do, in general, agree on the diagnosis, and as the Commission has said it is something that was started by the Council, was followed up by the Commission and is today being supported by Parliament, which of course puts a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, Commissioner, because we do have a common approach."
"Again, let me underline that this is a dynamic process and a fresh strategy, and some elements are indeed new and need to be followed up."
"May I quote a point in the report which was underlined by our colleague and which you liked so much: 'We call on the Commission to reprioritise the deployment and eventually to increase the human resources available for European Union delegations, so that more staff are available to start up and ensure the successful functioning of market access teams'."
"The same is true, inter alia, of what the report says on SMEs."
"There are a lot of new things in this report, and we wish you all the best in implementing them."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday, 19 February 2008."
"Written Statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (FR) The competitiveness of European industry needs to be placed at the heart of the Community agenda, for this alone will allow us to create skilled jobs, secure Europe's economic growth, guarantee the survival of the European welfare system and ensure that the EU can remain a major trading power in the 21st century."
"To ensure that this competitiveness is maintained we need to establish market access conditions that are fair, equitable and reciprocal."
"In fact, the European market is one of the most open and competitive in the world, thanks mainly to the right of free competition, which guarantees open and fair trading within the EU."
"Nevertheless, the European Union is still faced with numerous commercial obstacles when it comes to foreign trade, for the markets of Europe's main trading partners do not present the same degree of openness and transparency as the Community market."
"We therefore need to take urgent steps to re-establish reciprocal conditions for market access to third countries and, more particularly, to emerging countries, and to combat restrictive commercial practices."
"We need to act quickly and firmly to ensure that our SMEs have full and unrestricted access to all markets, especially in the public procurement sector."
"Reform of trade protection instruments (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on reform of trade protection instruments."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, it is my good fortune to be able to respond happily to two subjects in Parliament this evening."
"I am very pleased that I made it all the way back from Kiev in order to do so."
"So let me start by thanking Parliament for the invitation and the opportunity to make this statement on trade defence."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its close interest in this dossier, evidenced by our discussions both in plenary and in the Committee on International Trade."
"In 2006, the Commission and the Council agreed on the need for a review of Europe's trade defence instruments."
"The intention of this review was to ensure that Europe's vital tools were defending its workers and businesses against unfair trade and were continuing to work as effectively as possible, especially taking into account the dramatic changes in the global economy, where European businesses operate global supply chains, and where the mix of economic interests amongst European businesses is inevitably becoming more and more complex and difficult to judge and to call."
"Following our review and public consultation, and with the backing of the College, I worked with my officials on a set of proposals for adjustments to the EU's trade defence rules that would offer real improvements in accessibility, transparency and speed and clarity for businesses."
"They would include, for example, greater access to documents, greater assistance for small businesses using the trade defence system and faster provisional measures."
"We would also propose to clarify, through the drafting of guidelines, the application of EU rules in two important areas."
"First, the considerations for determining what degree of production outside of Europe disqualifies a company from being treated as European for the purposes of our investigations and trade defence assessments."
"Second, regarding the considerations that should be used in the Community interest test, which allows us to determine that trade defence action is indeed in the wider economic interest of the European Union - something which, as I say, is becoming increasingly complex and difficult to analyse, where situations are not quite as straightforward and not quite as black and white as they perhaps might appear on the surface, or indeed as was the case in the classic operation of trade defence machinery in the past."
"The intention in both these areas is largely to codify established practice, which would create clarity and predictability for businesses and decision-making in contentious cases, which we have had experience of in recent years and which, I suggest, are going to increase, not decrease, in number in the coming years."
"Whatever your position on the merits or demerits of anti-dumping, those, I think, are useful things to improve upon and to clarify and to issue guidelines upon, in order to give greater certainty and predictability to those who are appealing for the use of these instruments."
"A set of proposals along these lines would be balanced."
"It would reflect a middle ground of the debate among all the interested parties and the Member States."
"There is no point and no advantage in trying to push the centre of gravity, in the design and operation of our trade defence instruments, to one side or the other in the range of opinions in the European Union that inhabit the subject of trade defence."
"It is necessary to devise and to identify a route that takes you, broadly speaking, down the middle."
"Although our attempts have often been portrayed by people as an attempt to go to one side or the other, these impressions can only have been formed by people who cannot have seen our preliminary conclusions and proposals, because there is nothing in such a package that weakens our ability to tackle unfair trade, and nothing which fundamentally alters the basis of the operation of our trade defence instruments."
"However, it is clear from consultation that this issue is politically sensitive and continues to attract vigorous debate and, I have to say, some disagreement."
"A package that balances the different concerns in the debate will not currently, in my view, attract the necessary support, and it is better to build on consensus than seek to reconcile presently irreconcilable viewpoints on what clarification and what reform should take place."
"The political environment in which this subject has been discussed is not easy."
"Some argue that, at a time when we are pressing partners like China to trade fairly, we must not risk even the perception that the EU will lower its guard on trade defence."
"No such motivation, no such intention is present, but, nonetheless, some have argued that even risking the perception would be unwise at this moment."
"Furthermore, the rules negotiations in the Doha Round, in particular the chairs' text, have also put the international TDI environment into considerable flux, because of the text's surprising and, frankly, unacceptable content."
"I do not think there has been a chairs' text in the history of chairs' texts in the Doha Round that has attracted less support from right across the membership of the WTO than the current chairs' text on rules."
"But, above all, our objective has been to strengthen unity on the operation of trade defence instruments in order to make them more workable, and it is not my job as Commissioner to weaken that unity."
"The reality is that, as of today, this unity that I would like to see is not sufficiently in evidence amongst our Member States."
"That does not mean one side of this debate is right and that the other is wrong, just that both sides need to continue working towards a greater consensus and, frankly, a greater sense of solidarity in the operation of these instruments."
"That is what I propose to encourage."
"We will continue to consult on the ideas that we have floated and to build agreement by drawing on our experience."
"I would finish by making this observation. The pressures that global economic change is exerting on our trade defence system are here to stay."
"They are not going to go away; they are actually going to grow."
"The pressures are going to become greater."
"Our ability to operate the traditional consensus and solidarity is going to become harder, not easier, which makes it all the more important that the role of the Commission grows in navigating our way through the different and competing interests and views that businesses and Member States have on this subject."
"I believe that future cases will demonstrate the need for clarity and will demonstrate the need for the sort of guidelines that we have originally drafted."
"The questions with which we started this review will still be present in six months, in a year and in two years, and I firmly believe that, in due course, they are going to have to be addressed."
"Our challenge is together to find economically and politically credible answers, and the Commission will continue to work with that in mind."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (SV) Thank you, Mr Mandelson."
"When you stood here last, you spoke about the need for a reform of the trade protection instruments."
"You spoke with conviction on how globalisation and global supply chains had changed the preconditions for the trade protection instruments and that they therefore needed to be updated in order to remain effective and take account of Community interests."
"Everything you said then is still true."
"We need a reform of the instruments."
"Since then, however, it has proved tremendously difficult to bring about a reform."
"The conflicts between European companies and between the Member States are considerable."
"But that does not diminish the need for reform, on the contrary."
"The fact that everything is so infected and that, in example after example, we see the same battle formations drawn up on the same predictable lines in my opinion shows that we need change."
"We need a new focus on the instrument and a consensus which unites us."
"Now reform is postponed and looks quite remote."
"Certainly that is regretted by others as well as myself."
"But to argue about whose fault it was, whether it was the fault of the Member States, whether it was the Commission's fault or which Member States threw a spanner into the works, serves no purpose."
"The blame game will not do anyone any good."
"For, although the proposal has been halted for the moment, the ideas must not be buried."
"We must not forget the matter."
"We must continue to debate it and focus on what we are actually agreed on."
"I think there is quite a lot."
"It is about transparency and openness."
"It is probably also about clearer rules on how we safeguard the Community interest."
"Perhaps even about how to modernise the definition of Community industry."
"But that presupposes that we keep the debate alive and continue to debate and make compromises."
"I hope that we will do that here in the European Parliament."
"I also hope that the Member States and the Commission will keep the debate alive."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his account and also for his honesty in setting out the dilemmas with which he is confronted when he speaks to his colleagues and with the Member States about reforming the trade defence mechanism of the European Union."
"That is one thing, and I am also pleased that you are open in saying why you cannot come up with proposals right now, because it is simply very difficult to reach agreement in the European Union about what is the best way forward now."
"What the Commissioner also emphasised is that it is important to find a way to build a bridge between those countries that mainly earn their money from trade and those which have to get most of it from production."
"I myself come from a trading country, the Netherlands, but I understand very well the concerns that countries like France and Germany, which have a large production base, have about the development of global trade and protection."
"For them there is also the need to protect their own industry."
"It is thus very important to find that bridge and it is also important that the Commissioner wants to make a particular effort on this."
"I think that this is a discussion that we need to have."
"We must not be afraid to talk about the need for reform of those trade defence instruments because we are facing rapid changes in the international economy."
"What do we need to discuss then?"
"I specifically say 'discuss', because I do not have all the answers yet either."
"We need to discuss transparency in the system, the greater flexibility that is necessary, a better definition of what a European company is, and the social and environmental aspects in terms of determining the interests of the European Community."
"These are a number of points that we as Parliament should discuss and on which we should try to come to conclusions that we can then exchange again with the Commissioner."
"I think that it is too soon, even from my own group, to come up with very concrete proposals about how this should go."
"I am willing to start the discussion about the need for reform and then to think about how we can define a number of areas on which we would like to do more work."
"That will take a huge amount of discussion in my group too, just as it will in the Council and the Commission."
"Let us give it a try."
"I agree with the Commissioner."
"Whether it takes six months, twelve months or two years, let us at least get the debate going."
"We cannot simply ignore the fact that changes are afoot in the world, including in the global economy, and our trade defence system has to be adapted to meet those changes."
"That seems to me an important starting point for a discussion and I am pleased that the Commissioner has been so candid about the problems that he himself faces."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Thank you, Commissioner."
"Debates with you are always entertaining!"
"I am also comforted in my view that fair trade is better than free trade, and of course that trade on the basis of solidarity with a weaker partner is more important than formally fair and reciprocal trade."
"But now to the TDI, the Trade and Development Index."
"As for the rest, perhaps we should examine each other's bookshelves and perhaps get to understand the background over a cup of rooibos tea sometime?"
"Otherwise, you can come with me to the refuse tip where I became politically active and meet my street children in Brazil."
"But back to the TDI."
"What is a European enterprise?"
"It is difficult to define now and therefore it may also be difficult to apply the concept."
"What interest is a genuine Community interest?"
"The consumers?"
"The voluntary organisations?"
"Small businesses?"
"Large companies?"
"It is not at all easy to define, which means that it is currently difficult to apply the instrument, except in certain obvious cases."
"There is a dimension to all this which is entirely lacking, and I think it would be immensely interesting if you could return to it when you present new proposals."
"Should not ecological and social dumping be equated with direct dumping?"
"What is the difference if a firm evades environmental regulations and social provisions worth a billion euros, or gets a billion euros in state aid?"
"It would be interesting if you could have a discussion with the WTO and see whether we can move forward on that question."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, to be quite frank, I am glad that the reform of the trade defence instruments proposed by you has failed."
"You tried to push the TDI reform forward by taking up this reform in the Global Europe Strategy."
"Even if we assume that this reform would have been useful, it is quite clear that we need to strengthen these instruments where they are going to be beneficial, rather than abolishing them altogether."
"However, this latter aim was the purpose of your communication of November 2007."
"You bypassed the large majority who were in favour of retaining the existing system, with only a small minority being against its retention and in favour of progressively eroding it."
"The way in which the reform project has ground to a halt at Commission level shows that the large majority of Member States and many of your own colleagues considered these proposals to be unacceptable and that they were actually geared towards a small but very vocal lobby."
"Who would have benefited from this reform?"
"Not the European workforce, who are at risk of losing their jobs because major companies have been able to make use of your much-vaunted comparative advantages in the emerging economies. Not the workers in those countries, who have to endure unacceptable working conditions, and certainly not European businesses - and I speak as an entrepreneur - which conduct their production operations in accordance with the relevant European legislation and have no plans to send their profits soaring by exploiting poor environmental and social standards in certain third countries."
"These proposals had nothing to do with fairness and justice in global trade relations and between companies."
"In fact, the main beneficiaries would have been the major importers, who are naturally annoyed by any attempt to curb their abusive practices."
"The beneficiaries would have been the major wholesalers and distributors who ride roughshod over consumers' interests and who prefer to draw a veil over the fact that consumers are also workers, citizens and taxpayers. The beneficiaries would be those in the EU whose main concern is their profits, forgetting that the European Union is supposed to be developed, first and foremost, on mutual solidarity and support."
"The TDI system that we have in place is not perfect, but it is the one which works best compared with others around the world."
"Incidentally, that is not just my opinion; you - the Commission - undertook a study in 2006 which makes this same point."
"We should wait and see what happens in terms of developments in the World Trade Organisation before we introduce any new reforms in this area."
"Such a reform would have to consider what our trading partners are doing rather than unilaterally giving up any legal mechanisms to protect ourselves from dumping: legal mechanisms, incidentally, which are based on an internationally agreed set of rules."
"Regrettably, I must add that I cannot endorse the Commission's conduct in the application of the TDIs in 2007."
"Many Member States and other stakeholders have protested that the changes proposed by the Commission were put into effect before the Council and Parliament had the chance to reach an opinion on them."
"DG Trade has, on its own initiative, quite simply suspended some of the established principles of interinstitutional cooperation in recent months."
"As a result, absolutely no cases have been taken up."
"I can only hope, and I would ask you to ensure, that this style of cooperation between the Commission and Parliament does not continue in future."
"I would also ask you to bring your key proposals on the framework for the TDIs before the Committee on International Trade and have serious discussions with Parliament before they are put into effect."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, this issue has been too much for some people in recent days and weeks."
"In the committee, some people nearly had a heart attack when they read the first draft report."
"The Commission has halted the initiative because you, Commissioner, were apparently overwhelmed by the task of producing a reform proposal that was capable of securing a majority."
"Our parliamentary administration was overwhelmed and put today's debate on the agenda with the nonsensical title 'Commission statement - Reform of trade protection instruments', while the list of speakers says Reform of consumer protection instruments, which is not much better."
"Looking at the public gallery, it seems that the members of the public are overwhelmed as well and have taken themselves off to a restaurant or gone home."
"Perhaps somebody is at least watching on the Internet, and hopefully, we will maintain an overview here in the Chamber."
"I find it most regrettable that the Commission has not managed to produce a reform proposal which could secure a majority in the Council and Parliament."
"This is certainly not the right time for this type of reform, but no one here would have anticipated that the reform would fail so miserably."
"What is important now?"
"First of all, will the Commission inform Parliament in good time of its intentions to take up this reform again and involve us at every stage?"
"Let me draw your attention specifically to the codecision rights under the Lisbon Treaty."
"Secondly, will there now be a reform by the back door, without a decision by the Council and Parliament?"
"Or will you, Commissioner, genuinely - as has just been said - attempt to restore confidence?"
"The trade defence instruments must be applied according to the current rules and practice."
"Thirdly, why are you undertaking staff changes in the relevant department at this particular time?"
"We will be monitoring the conduct of the Commission and DG Trade very closely in the coming weeks."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, you certainly do not have an easy task."
"You have one of the most difficult portfolios to deal with."
"The area of trade/external trade is one which faces completely new challenges."
"We have been talking about globalisation for years, but I think we are only now beginning to understand what it is about."
"In your famous speech in Berlin, the Churchill Lecture, you said that Europe is exposed to new challenges and that since the end of the war, the challenges have changed because the frame of reference is no longer Berlin or Paris but Mumbai, Shanghai and the other major cities of the emerging economies."
"We share your view."
"You are absolutely right."
"We see this just as you do."
"We see the challenges which the European Union must face up to in a new international and global context."
"China is real."
"China is not just a myth or an image; China has become a reality to all of us and is a symbol of change."
"The question is, which conclusions do we draw from this?"
"You conclude that we must change the instruments."
"You conclude that we must face up to the challenges by adapting the trade defence instruments or other areas."
"My group has not found the conclusive answer, but we certainly have many more doubts."
"As you can hear, these doubts are shared in this House."
"We have doubts because these defence instruments have proved their worth."
"The defence instruments have a certain flexibility."
"They can be interpreted in different ways."
"They can take account of the different industry interests, and they can interpret the Community interest in different ways."
"The test can be applied in different ways, and no, it is not always perfect."
"Incidentally, I know that you have not made many mistakes."
"I myself can identify two points where the evaluation was wrong, but I think that will be the case with new instruments as well."
"Where are we going then?"
"You say you would like to continue down this road and you would like to continue the consultations."
"You have not yet closed the drawer."
"Where should this road take us then?"
"Where should the consultations take us?"
"How would you like to conduct the consultations with this House and with the committee responsible?"
"These are three questions which follow on from what my colleagues have asked."
"I would be most grateful for some information from you, as I am receiving e-mails every day."
"Are the changes taking place in your DG an indication that you are pursuing the restructuring with a view to your forthcoming communication?"
"Are the technical changes which are apparently under way in your DG an indicator of this?"
"Can the non-application of the trade defence instruments in 2007 also be interpreted as an indicator, or is it just coincidence, and other factors are in play?"
"(FR) Mr President, the Commission has decided to postpone the project for the reform of the trade defence instruments and, Commissioner, I welcome this wise decision, for it will help maintain the fight against unfair competition."
"These instruments are indeed an essential part of the international trading system, for they ensure that companies, and more especially SMEs, which are the prime victims of dumping, are able to operate in a fair and stable competitive environment, which in turn ensures a healthy economy."
"I would therefore repeat what Mr Verheugen said at a conference on textiles that was held in Milan at the end of last week: 'Trade defence instruments are beneficial for the competitiveness of our industries and can never be considered as instruments of protectionism.'"
"I believe indeed that this says it all."
"These instruments are not a disguised way of protecting Community industry from the free movement of international trade, but rather are intended as a way of improving its competitiveness by re-establishing normal competition conditions, as and when necessary."
"It is not therefore by weakening the implementation of these instruments that we will be better able to adapt the European Union's trade policy to a changing global economy."
"In fact, quite the contrary, for the interests of the manufacturers would have been diluted and the measures that would have been taken could have indirectly encouraged industrial relocation and the migration of our centres of research and innovation."
"Europe has to play the role of protector in today's globalised world."
"If we are to stay competitive we must not lower our guard in our dealings with partners but must respect the rules of fair and equitable international trade."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what has just been said demonstrates that your proposal was at the very least controversial."
"At the start, however there was no debate to be had."
"The Commission had launched an independent study and a public consultation, both of which indicated that there was a broad consensus on the efficiency and stability of the current system."
