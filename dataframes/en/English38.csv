"So, what do we need to do to improve tax revenue?"
"We need to prevent even more companies from going bankrupt because bankruptcies threaten to cause a huge increase in unemployment."
"This trend could be exacerbated if we do not prepare for the introduction of Basel II in good time."
"I myself am an economist, but I believe that the sixth framework programme really does need a Basle II-related research priority - creditworthiness for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I would strongly urge Mr Färm to support us on this important matter, because we need new instruments so as to continue to guarantee the stability of Europe, and what we need is a stability pact for SMEs."
"Madam President, as draftsman for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I am broadly happy with the position the Committee on Budgets has taken on our amendments."
"I should like to thank Mr Färm for his help and support."
"I am particularly glad that we have maintained my amendments on the security of our EU delegations."
"I believe that is of tremendous importance."
"I am also glad that we have managed to restore the cuts on the human rights and democracy line."
"I understand the strategy of the rapporteur in relation to Afghanistan."
"I would just like to make sure it is clear that nothing is going to undermine our commitment to reconstruction in Afghanistan."
"I am disappointed, however, that my amendment on landmines was not accepted - the EUR 3.15 million - because that would take us up to the amount to which we had originally committed ourselves."
"The line on landmines was very much a European Parliament measure."
"I would hope that we can, in our voting, consider restoring that figure because it would take us up to what we originally proposed."
"I am disappointed at the amendments whereby EUR 15 million for Palestine is put on reserve under some interesting conditions."
"I would hope that we could put all the money for Palestine above the line."
"On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I too should like to thank the rapporteurs who have worked so hard, within all the confines, to bring this budget to a successful end."
"Incidentally, we held a very extensive debate yesterday on the issue of the three percent, and Mr Prodi should, in my view, simply advise all countries to adopt the EU's budgetary system, for if they were to do this, they would never suffer any shortages again and always have surpluses."
"This is the problem we are facing: the system is such that surpluses always arise."
"Countries can easily adopt this system, but the only problem is, of course, that certain wishes cannot be met."
"The system is ruthless and we have to live with it."
"In my view, we have come up with a number of sound solutions to make the system more workable than it has been in the past."
"After all, we can protest loudly at a lack of funding, but if you consider what is returned to the Member States, then this always strikes me as a little strange."
"We should do something about this."
"This has also been laid down in the interinstitutional agreement, and this should also be taken into consideration."
"We must simply be able to manage the funding we have at the moment better and not commit everything without giving it a moment's consideration."
"We are reasonably pleased with the outcome of, and particularly with the project on, mobility for the elderly which was included in this budget at the instigation of Mr Podestà."
"I am unhappy about one point, namely the way in which foundations - and I am mainly referring to the foundation in Dublin - are being treated."
"If the costs in one country rise faster than in the rest of the EU, there is a certain rule in the Community that provides for this."
"This is the way it is."
"It is impossible for the Committee on Budgets, and especially the person responsible in the Committee on Budgets, to say in such cases: 'Oh no, this does not concern us at all; we simply do not give this money; they will have to draw on their own reserves'."
"These reserves do not exist, which is just as well."
"This is only a minor point and I do not want to spend too much time talking about it, but it is still important that we do something about it."
"Madam President, once again this year we have been struggling with the strict ceiling on category 4, given ever-increasing demands arising from growing international instability and a consequent diminution of the poverty focus of EU aid to developing countries around the world."
"But the whole Parliament - not just the Committee on Development and Cooperation - has been clear that development is a political priority overall in this year's EU budget, with support for the global fund against AIDS, TB and malaria."
"The Council in its May resolution says it is committed."
"The Commission says it wants to retain its board seat."
"Yet the EUR 120 million contribution last year is reduced to a proposal of just EUR 35 million for next."
"No, Parliament does not want the European Union to provide the minimum possible."
"It recognises that AIDS/HIV is the most serious challenge to humankind today; that the United Nations has declared at least 7 billion is needed worldwide; and that proposals amounting to 5 billion have already been tabled."
"The global fund represents a bold new approach - fast-moving, participatory and accountable."
"The European Union must demonstrate that it can achieve the same vision, imagination and commitment by significantly raising its own financial contribution and offering real European leadership in tackling the most devastating global challenge of our times."
"Mr President, I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets has endorsed so many of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, in particular budget line B7-524 - assistance in the nuclear sector."
"We call for an appropriate sum for cancer equipment in the Republic of Belarus, which is still significantly affected by the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident in adjacent Ukraine."
"Up to 23% of its territory was contaminated; about 2 million people - including 500 000 children - live in the radioactively contaminated areas."
"The sickness rate in the contaminated areas has grown dramatically."
"For instance, the number of children under the age of 18 suffering from thyroid cancer is 50 times higher now than before the accident."
"Among the adult population, the growth of the number of thyroid-gland cases has increased fivefold."
"The most effective method of controlling these tumours is high-dose-rate brachytherapy, which minimises exposure to radiation of healthy organs and tissues during radiation treatment of malignant growth."
"High-dose-rate brachytherapy requires high-tech equipment and, due to the high acquisition and maintenance costs of this equipment, Belarus needs assistance."
"We should not let our very real concerns over democracy and human rights in Belarus prevent us from helping its children."
"Madam President, I wish to speak about regional policy and transport issues, but first let me congratulate the rapporteurs and the committee chairman on their work."
"Unfortunately, my news is not good news."
"The trans-European networks, despite the commitments made by the Essen Council, are progressing at a snail's pace."
"Priority works are at a standstill and the Council's response is further cuts."
"This being so, we in the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport wish to give our unconditional support to the amendments, also backed by the Committee on Budgets, which are designed to rectify this situation somewhat. Secondly, I also wish to express our serious concern about the disbursement of funds from the Structural Funds."
"We got off to a very slow start in 2000, for which the Member States were mainly to blame and the same applied in 2001."
"We know that the Commission is trying to do something about this and that Commissioner Barnier has tried to do something about this, especially with his recent communication and the meetings he has been holding with Ministers from the Member States."
"However, the Member States must do what they can."
"Someone commented, and I entirely agree, that the situation is worse in the rich Member States than in the poor."
"So they must do what they can to ensure funds are disbursed quickly and, of course, the Commission must monitor developments closely so that we can put a stop to this problem because, if things go on as they are, I am afraid that, in the end, a big chunk of Structural Fund resources will go to waste."
"Madam President, the vast majority of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for which I am rapporteur, have been taken into account in the 2003 budgetary procedure."
"Regrettably, three of the committee's amendments that I consider to be important were rejected or altered."
"They are being put to the vote again in the plenary."
"They concern firstly cooperation with third countries on migration."
"Here we want the commitments to be increased by a further EUR 5 million."
"I am convinced that the only way to improve the situation is to step up cooperation and that means more funds from the European Union."
"Secondly, they concern the European Refugee Fund."
"I do not think that I need to dwell on this as the issues are actually already well known."
"The third point is the Celex budget."
"Although the situation has changed immeasurably since the attacks on the USA, we have done a great deal without demanding a dramatic increase in expenditure."
"I therefore think that all of our demands - these three points - are justified and would ask you to bear this in mind when you vote."
"Madam President, if you want to find out what is really important for a person, do not ask them."
"Just ask to look through the stubs on their chequebook or the entries on their credit card account and you will find out."
"This afternoon we are actually looking through the stubs of the Commission's chequebook and what do we discover? EUR 2.4 billion spent on olives but EUR 240 million on the Socrates Education Programme for the European Union."
"As budget rapporteur for the Committee on Culture, I cannot but help notice that we spend one tenth of the money on education that we spend on olives."
"On information for enlargement, the Commission proposed EUR 14 million in the budget - a good sum you might think, until you see that the subsidy proposed for bee keeping was EUR 16.5 million."
"I am not criticising support for bee-keeping, but I think that this Parliament was right to increase the amount that the Commission wanted for information on enlargement from EUR 14 million to EUR 21 million."
"If people in the candidate countries and the existing countries do not understand enlargement, then we shall only have repeats of the problems that we experienced in Ireland."
"On that EUR 21 million, the Budgets Committee accepted the proposal from the Committee on Culture that EUR 1 million should be set aside for training future MEPs from the candidate countries."
"We had the President of Hungary here this morning, which shows that clearly politicians from the candidate countries are looking forward to joining this Parliament and they need training to be able to do that properly."
"I am also pleased that we have been able, if this budget is now passed, to reinstate the amount of money for e-learning, namely EUR 17 million as opposed to the Commission's proposal of EUR 9 million."
"It is not just that our budgetary priorities are wrong, the system is also wrong."
"I will pay tribute to the support we have had from the budget rapporteur this year and from the Commission, but the Council is absent this afternoon."
"It has been absent from discussions with the committees looking at the proposed budget."
"It really should be ashamed of its position in this respect."
"I agree with Mr Perry and the other speakers who, over the afternoon, have pointed out that the Council needs to be present at this debate."
"I would like to stress this on behalf of Parliament."
"It is important that the Council takes part in our debates and gets to hear our views."
"Madam President, I would like to devote my two minutes to expressing my satisfaction at the fact that the proposal which has been put forward allows increased work on trying to prevent the spread of poverty-related diseases, primarily HIV, malaria and tuberculosis."
"We know that these diseases create enormous difficulties and problems for millions of people and that years of development work are quickly eroded due to these diseases causing so much sickness and death."
"As long ago as in the 1990s it was possible to make forecasts, particularly regarding the spread of HIV, suggesting that in certain cases up to 25% of the adult population in some countries would be infected."
"These forecasts were dismissed."
"I must say that both the international community, including donor countries and individual countries in the South, took these problems far too lightly."
"Until very recently, the Commission has also done very little within the framework of its aid."
"As we now have a new directive on how these issues are to be handled, and particularly as we are increasing the budget, there is now an opportunity for us take on much greater responsibility on this issue."
"I would particularly like to stress the importance of us ensuring that the global fund which has just been set up has enough money so that the EU and Europe are able to have a proper and stable influence on this work."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking both rapporteurs of the Committee on Budgets and the members of the Committee on Budgets for the fact that - and this is a first - the lion's share of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities have been adopted by the Committee on Budgets in the same or altered form."
"These amendments, Commissioner, pertained to three areas."
"The first group of amendments related to violence against women, including genital mutilation, rape, the stoning of women etc., in a large number of countries worldwide."
"We have for the first time included a clause in the budget that stipulates that the aid we provide to a number of countries can be suspended if they fail to respect women's rights."
"I welcome this and thank the Committee on Budgets."
"This is the first area that has been adopted."
"A second area is about women and decision-making."
"In many Member States, a great deal of progress has been made in the field of political decision-making by women."
"Trade unions and employers, however, have done very little to promote the presence of women in their organisations."
"This is nonetheless necessary, for trade unions and employers have more or less acquired the status of legislator in a large number of Member States: agreements concluded by them have the force of law."
"They have thus acquired a great deal of power but have not made as much effort to bring women to the fore as our national parliaments and our national political parties have."
"This amendment has also been adopted, for which I thank the Committee on Budgets."
"An amendment that has not been adopted - and I will call on the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou in this connection - is the amendment on more flexible standards for the financing of projects intended for women."
"The standards are very high at the moment. Many women's organisations are unable to comply with them."
"This is the only amendment that has not been adopted."
"I should nevertheless like to express my thanks on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"Thank you for this contribution."
"As a woman, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your work over so many years on women's issues."
"This work has clearly produced results this time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.40 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)"
"Question No 38 by Raimon Obiols i Germà (H-0645/02):"
"Subject: Food crisis in the Tindouf refugee camps"
"As a result of statements made by Radhouane Nouicer, UNHCR operations manager for North Africa and the Middle East, we learned in early September of the food crisis affecting the 155 000 Saharawi refugees in the Tindouf refugee camps."
"The WFP reports that if no new food aid is received, refugees will only get 11 per cent of their daily food requirements - about 231 kilocalories per person - in October, compared with the standard ration of flour, pulses, beans, vegetable oil and other products, providing a daily total of 2 100 kilocalories."
"The children are in an especially serious position, since according to UNHCR data 35% of them are suffering from chronic malnutrition and 13% from rickets."
"We are aware that the Commission has limited resources at its disposal, but is it able to make an immediate contribution in order to alleviate this impending food crisis?"
"What mechanisms could the Commission use to encourage the Member States to make fresh contributions to the WFP?"
"A major part of ECHO's strategy is dealing with forgotten crises, and this is quite important."
"This is also why we are providing continued assistance to the Saharawi refugees."
"ECHO is the largest source of aid to these refugees. Over the last three years, ECHO has more or less doubled its assistance to the Saharawi refugees from about EUR 7.5 million in 1999 to EUR 14.34 million this year."
"While the World Food Programme is responsible for the basic foodstuffs ECHO is concentrating its assistance on supplementary food products in order to ensure a more varied diet."
"However, in view of the problems the World Food Programme has had in finding the donors it needs to meet its commitments ECHO decided, in 2001, to set up a three-month buffer stock of basic products such as cereals, pulses, oil and sugar, which the WFP can use in case its supplies arrive too late for distribution to the refugees, the condition being that the World Food Programme should undertake to replenish these buffer stocks."
"This arrangement has been invaluable, with 13 such loans totalling a volume of 12 153 tonnes in the period until the end of October 2002."
"The problem is that so far only 5 589 tonnes have been replenished, leaving the buffer stocks very low, at a level of 17.24% of the full amount."
"It was against this background that, at the beginning of September 2002, the World Food Programme and the UNHCR issued a joint appeal for further international assistance to satisfy the needs for basic food items."
"While it may be correct that the WFP could cover only 11% of needs in October, it must be said that this figure relates only to deliveries from WFP and does not take account of deliveries from other donors."
"ECHO financed 300 tonnes of rice, delivered in October, and the use of the ECHO buffer stock I mentioned has made an important contribution, enabling us to satisfy the total needs for basic food products in October."
"So it is not the case that in October they only received 11%."
"As I have explained, the situation is much better."
"Let me say a few words about the ECHO global plan for these refugees, which was adopted by the Commission this year."
"This plan, involving an amount of EUR 14.34 million, should reduce the full impact of the crisis."
"Over 80% of the ECHO 2002 global plan consists of food products."
"Under this plan, a further 5 000+ tonnes of basic foodstuffs are due to arrive in the coming weeks."
"In addition, over 3 000 tonnes of ECHO-financed supplementary food products will be supplied in the next few months."
"The WFP has also announced that it is sending over 4 000 tonnes of basic foodstuffs."
"This is the good news."
"Nevertheless, there is still cause for concern, particularly as regards the January and February distributions, owing to the possible lack of foodstuffs to satisfy total needs in that period."
"There is some donor fatigue. This is the background."
"I agree with the question in this respect. This is also why ECHO is involved in different ways in raising donor awareness about this conflict and these people."
"I have just one supplementary remark."
"Tomorrow, in Copenhagen, there is a conference on Forgotten Humanitarian Crises."
"This reflects a very deliberate and systematic effort by the Commission, through the humanitarian office ECHO, to work out a methodology to identify what could be called 'forgotten crises' - ones where the CNN factor does not draw attention to the people in need."
"This falls into that category, so I definitely welcome the question and the opportunity to answer it and to highlight problems."
"That makes the dialogue with Parliament meaningful and useful."
"Question No 39 by Lennart Sacrédeus (H-0630/02):"
"Subject: Allegations concerning use of EU aid to finance terrorist activities in Palestine"
"Allegations have been made on a number of occasions in recent years that EU aid to the Palestinian Authority has been used to finance terrorist activities."
"In May this year, the Israeli Government handed over a report to the Commission which it claimed proved that the Palestinian Authority had enabled part of the EU aid received to go to terrorists or even terrorist activities by, for example, inflating the cost of the civil service."
"What possibilities does the Commission actually have of monitoring how the aid is used?"
"In what way has the Commission made use of the information provided by the Israeli Government?"
"There have been several allegations about alleged misuse of European Union monies by the Palestinian Authority."
"Some time ago, part of the Israeli Government prepared a dossier claiming to show that President Arafat and the Palestinian Authority used funds provided by the European Union, along with Norway and some other countries, to finance supporters of terrorism or even directly underwrite acts of terrorism."
"These are most serious allegations."
"They have been carefully examined by the Commission. I should stress, as I have already done before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets, on 19 June, that, on the basis of all the documents made available by the Israeli Government, the Commission has not found evidence of European Union funds being used for purposes other than those agreed between the European Union and the Palestinian Authority."
"The Commission provides EUR 10 million a month to the Palestinian Authority in budgetary support."
"This constitutes 10% of their overall budget."
"European Union support has helped prevent the total collapse of Palestinian institutions and, therefore, preserved one of the interlocutors in the peace process."
"At the same time, it has provided the necessary pressure and guidance for serious reform, particularly in public finances."
"Let me remind the House that, ultimately, the European Union provides budgetary support to mitigate the effects of the freeze of revenue transfers totalling over USD 680 million by the Government of Israel over the last couple of years."
"Budgetary assistance is subject to a number of conditions relating to administrative and judicial reform, financial control and so on, which are reviewed and strengthened on a regular basis."
"Disbursement of budgetary support is monitored on the ground by the Commission and the International Monetary Fund, which reports on a monthly basis on economic and fiscal developments and provides information covering revenue developments, evolution of employment, wage bill and non-wage current outlays, developments of capital expenditure and so on. The merits of our budgetary assistance have been widely recognised, not only by the Council of Ministers, but also by the international community."
"The United States and the other members of the quartet - the UN and the Russian Federation - have recognised the progress which has been made in the management of the Palestinian Authority's financial affairs, thanks to our aid."
"Achievements in reform, which have been made largely thanks to our budgetary support, include the establishment of a single treasury account, the consolidation of all the Authority's public finances and progress towards a modern system of financial control."
"Next comes the imposition of an austerity budget, then the containment of arrears and, finally and very importantly, the adoption or entry into force of key legal acts, such as the judicial independence law and the basic law."
"It is also worth remembering that, in recent weeks, Israel has paid over USD 45 million to the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Finance, which is a small but still positive step."
"This money has been transferred into the same treasury account as the EU budgetary support and is subject to the same European Union and IMF monitoring mechanisms I have just described."
"I hope some Members will reflect on that sentence."
"Israel has therefore recognised that progress has been made in the financial domain, and that is in no small part due to our policy-based financial assistance and budgetary support."
"Ultimately, Israel should resume regular transfers and in that respect I welcome the constructive discussions held recently between Prime Minister Sharon and President Bush."
"Finally, it is our firm view that financial support should be continued."
"Withdrawal of budgetary support will lead to collapse of the Palestinian Authority, further chaos and a more desperate humanitarian crisis."
"The Commission will continue to monitor the use of budgetary support and compliance with all the conditions attached to it."
"We will, as always, investigate all allegations of the misuse of funds as a matter of the utmost priority."
"I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for his response and for his involvement in this issue."
"When the Israeli Government publishes these details, we as members of the European Parliament naturally wish to get to the bottom of the matter."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner the following questions:"
"Do you feel that relations with the Israeli Government are good and that the Israeli Government believes that the report submitted to the Commission and to the European Parliament can be removed from the agenda?"
"Or do the Israelis maintain the accusations contained in the report?"
"I also wonder whether you believe that the aid which the EU is giving to the Middle East is sufficiently well controlled in general rather than just in this case."
"I am afraid that, unusually, the honourable Member's information is slightly out of date."
"I am not aware of the Israeli Government insisting that the facts they presented before are accurate and, indeed, were they to do so, I cannot quite understand why they should have resumed transfers to the Palestinian Authority using exactly the same mechanisms that we ourselves use."
"It would be a very curious thing for them to do."
"This is a story that keeps coming back, whatever facts are produced to refute it."
"However, it is not irrelevant to note that the other members of the quartet - that includes, as I said, the United States and the United Nations - not only support what we are doing but believe that we have been in the lead in promoting reform, not least of the Palestinian Authority's finances."
"Commissioner, I have listened to you answer this question on a number of occasions."
"I have known you for some 20 years now and I know you to be a man of honour who has always been opposed to terrorism."
"Let me ask you two questions: do you not get frustrated that, when you give such a clear and unequivocal answer, Members do not accept your word?"
"Secondly, would you not also agree that our aid to Palestine in fact contributes to eliminating the sort of conditions in which terrorism thrives?"
"I am grateful to the honourable Member for what he said initially."
"Who would not be? He knows that I am a man of legendary generosity of spirit, so perhaps I just have to take it as a fact of political life that however much you tell some people the truth, they prefer to ignore it."
"It would be helpful if some of those who keep making these accusations would sometimes turn up in the Chamber or at the committee meetings where I have been refuting the allegations."
"It might also help if they would occasionally read the newspapers and see what is being said and done about the reform of the Palestinian Authority."
"But I suspect that one or two of them have their own games to play, games that owe very little to fact but a good deal to prejudice and malevolent whimsy."
"Secondly, with regard to the impact on conditions on the ground, the situation on the ground - and this is not easy to dispute - is appalling."
"We have recently had the report by the UN Secretary-General's special envoy, Catherine Bertini, followed up by a further study."
"The private remarks of the British Ambassador in Tel Aviv have been reported in the Israeli media."
"I do not believe for one moment that impoverishment, degradation or hunger - all of which have existed in some form in Palestine - are conducive to Israel's long-term security."
"Are you more or less likely to encourage lack of moderation or extremism in the conditions that exist in the West Bank and Gaza?"
"I hope that the points that Mr Pérez made to us during the EU-Israel Association Council yesterday about the humanitarian situation on the ground will lead to some improvement. I hope that the increase in our assistance to UNWRA will help improve the situation and I hope that the Israeli Government will listen to some of the things we are saying, for instance about the blocking of 500 containers of World Food Programme assistance in Ashdod Port at the moment."
"What does that have to do with the security of Israel?"
"So, I totally sympathise with the argument that Israel should have assurances about its security, but I do not think that making life intolerable for Palestinians is the right way of achieving that."
"I would remind you that two questions can be asked and I give the floor in chronological order;"
"Mr Tannock has the floor."
"If Commissioner Patten or his office take this view, then why have they so strongly resisted the initiative by myself and Members from other political groups to raise signatures in this House to request that Parliament set up a committee of inquiry into these very grave allegations?"
"If what he says is correct, surely such a body would vindicate his position, clear the air and reject these ongoing allegations of funding of terrorist activities by the PLO, but also, perhaps more insidiously, the funding of race hatred and the brainwashing of young Palestinians in their schools, which furthers long-term animosity and potentially creates future suicide bombers?"
"The honourable Member has added to the first part of his question allegations about Palestinian textbooks being funded by the European Union."
"Again and again, in this Chamber and in committees, we have pointed out that these allegations are totally without foundation."
"We have made available to Members of this House the report by heads of mission in Jerusalem, which again exposes the extent to which this is a simple, straightforward fabrication."
"So when the honourable Member asks me: why do I not welcome a committee of inquiry into a previous set of fabrications?"
"Setting up such an inquiry - and I do not for one moment think that this House would vote for it - would make it look as though there were some legitimacy in these allegations."
"Furthermore, if you set up an inquiry like this, just think of the impact on everybody in my services who ever has to sign a cheque for UNWRA or for anything to do with the Palestinian Authority."
"It would have the effect of drying up assistance to the Palestinian Authority and to UN and humanitarian organisations because of the psychological effect, and this at a moment when we are preparing for the ad hoc liaison committee donors' meeting in early December, when the European Union - and my thanks to the budgetary authority and my colleague, the Commissioner for the budget - will be expected to take a lead in providing more humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians."
"Who will expect us to do that?"
"The Americans will, the UN will and the Israelis will - not to mention the rest of the international community."
"So I say to the honourable Member, and I am sure that his question is not prompted by any malign motives, that the notion that this proposal to set up an inquiry is somehow helpful to me and to the cause of humanitarian relief in Palestine and to finding a political accommodation to save us from this blood feud, is about as far from reality as it is possible to go."
"I would like a committee of inquiry on these issues like a 'hole in the head'!"
"Question No 40 by José María Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado (H-0688/02):"
"Subject: Russian Federation - expulsion of Catholic priests"
"It is well known that in the Soviet era many Catholics were displaced from the Baltic States, Poland and Germany into the Russian heartland."
"The pastoral care of these people is being frustrated by recent expulsions of five Catholic priests."
"Are these expulsions by the Russian authorities compatible with the international obligations of the Russian Federation in respect of human rights and freedom of religion?"
"The Commission actively promotes the principle of religious freedom as part of our dialogue on human rights with the Russian authorities."
"We fully share the concern of the honourable Member over recent expulsions of Catholic priests and, as the honourable Member will know, other Christian denominations have been affected recently as well."
"This practice is not compatible with Russian commitments on human rights."
"In particular, the joint statement of the last European Union-Russia Summit in Moscow states our common aim of strengthening society, based on respect for democratic principles and human rights."
"The Commission will continue to impress the message upon the Russian authorities that the effective partnership that the Union and Russia are trying to establish necessarily has to be based on a series of fundamental core values, among which is full respect for human rights, including freedom of religion."
"Within the framework of our intensive political dialogue with Russia, the European Union has repeatedly raised its concerns regarding freedom of religion in Russia."
"The Commission continues to raise these and other related human rights issues with the Russian authorities."
"In parallel, the promotion of human rights in Russia will continue to be a priority in the framework of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights."
"As Parliament will know, Russia is a core country under this programme."
"I repeat to the honourable Member my personal concern about this issue and my determination that we should raise it whenever we need to with the Russian authorities."
"As the honourable Member and I have both noted, other churches have been involved."
"For example, there was the case of a Swedish Protestant pastor."
"A number of Protestant missionaries were similarly expelled, and last year the Moscow branch of the Salvation Army was disbanded."
"So this is an issue of general concern."
"Whenever Christian pastors or missionaries are treated in this way, it should be a matter of considerable concern."
"Having spent Good Friday this year in Shanghai Cathedral where the Veneration of the Cross was celebrated by the Bishop of Shanghai, who spent about 20 years of his life in solitary confinement in prison, I am aware - as are we all - of the remarkable sacrifices made by Christian missionaries, priests and bishops in countries where, alas, freedom of religion is not enjoyed as it is by and large in the European Union."
"This reply from Commissioner Patten concludes the first part of Questions to the Commission."
"Part II"
"Questions to Commissioner Schreyer"
"Question No 41 by Erik Meijer (H-0707/02):"
"Subject: Preparing, buying and using a special bookkeeping system by the European Commission"
"With regard to the matter referred to in written questions E-2557/02, E-2558/02 and E-2559/02:"
"Can the Commission confirm that around 1995 the Commission had planned to use 4000 licences from the German software enterprise SAP, specially developed for its purposes?"
"Can the Commission confirm that it finally bought 700 licences from SAP and that only 300 or 400 of these licences were really used?"
"What is the number of licences currently in use?"
"How are those licences actually used?"
"Mr President, as you know, the SAP R/3 accounting system is used both by the financial control services and by the accounting, or bookkeeping, department."
"I would, however, be quite happy to answer your question in more detail in writing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for answering the question."
"I would be interested to know how the system has actually been prepared for the enlargement of the European Union."
"This will of course present particular challenges in terms of bookkeeping."
"We are also aware of the accusations that have appeared in the media."
"What precautions will you take in the future to ensure that the existing system will guarantee, even after enlargement, that financial management is tailored to future requirements and that the European taxpayer is protected?"
"Mr Rübig, the accounting system that we have does not only consist of the SAP R/3 software that has just been mentioned; the SINCOM 2 system is also available for services that manage funds."
"All of the Commission's services and all offices that manage funds are linked up to this."
"As far as enlargement is concerned, the number of services linked up will not actually be increased immediately now."
"Pre-accession aid is also managed using this system."
"Preparations for enlargement obviously require the candidate countries and new Member States to take certain measures."
"Accounts for the Commission will of course have to be opened in the central banks or national treasuries."
"Very intensive preparatory discussions are underway between the Budget Directorate-General and the individual accession countries about the whole business of collecting own resources and using the national treasuries."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Questions to Commissioner Vitorino"
"Question No 42 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0654/02):"
"Subject: Discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the granting of visas"
"On 27 July 2002 the Spanish-Argentinian couple Juan Carlos Manteca Cendrero and Carlos Daniel Bettio submitted an application for a residence visa on the grounds of family reunification to the Spanish Consulate-General in Buenos Aires (Argentina) so that Daniel Bettio, an Argentinian citizen, would be able to reside legally in Spain."
"They attached the required documents, having been informed by the Consulate that visas had been granted in the past to people in the same situation, i.e. same-sex couples."
"On 13 August 2002 they received notification that the visa had been refused 'because they did not meet the conditions laid down in RD 864/2001'."
"The section where an indication must be made as to which specific condition has not been fulfilled states 'negative report of the government or labour authority'."
"Taking account of the specific circumstances of this case and the widely-held suspicion that same-sex couples are being refused visas, which would be a violation of equal rights, and bearing in mind that this would also be in breach of rights enshrined in the Spanish Constitution and EU law, in particular the Treaty of Amsterdam, which lays down that everyone enjoys equal rights regardless of their sex or sexual orientation, can the Commission say whether it might be proposed that the burden of proof be reversed in view of such incidences of sexual discrimination (refusal to grant a visa to Carlos Daniel Bettio)?"
"Is it aware that this type of discrimination in the granting of visas is occurring in the EU?"
"What steps can be taken to prevent it?"
"What measures are available to us to avert or take action in such cases"
"Question No 43 by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou (H-0659/02):"
"Subject: Combating paedophilia"
"The lenient sentences recently given to people charged with taking part in a major paedophile network in France frustrated public opinion."
"In view of the fact that none of the existing programmes on combating organised crime or on police and judicial cooperation is directly concerned with paedophilia, will the Commission take practical steps to draw up a proposal for the harmonisation of Member States' legislation in regard to the definition of the offence, penalties, the age of the victims and their care, and draw up a programme to combat the phenomenon?"
"Does the Commission have comparative data on the legislative and judicial means of combating this tragic phenomenon in the various Member States?"
"Does the Commission believe that Europol and Eurojust have the appropriate infrastructure to track down and crack down on such networks?"
"As Parliament knows, in December 2000 the Commission proposed the framework decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography."
"I am very happy to tell you that, on 14 October, the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached political agreement on the Commission's proposal."
"This framework decision is one of the most far-reaching instruments so far when it comes to the approximation of criminal law."
"It addresses various forms of sexual exploitation of children, such as coercing a child into prostitution, pornographic performances and abuse of a recognised position of trust."
"Child pornography, both on- and offline, is also covered."
"As regards penalties, the Council has taken steps to establish a general approach to the approximation of penalties."
"This is also the main reason why the Council took so long to adopt this framework decision."
"Now, the framework decision stipulates levels of penalties ranging from between one and three years for basic offences to between five and ten years in circumstances that aggravate the offence."
"The framework decision does not approximate the age of sexual consent."
"The Commission believes that this is an issue for the Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The age of sexual consent, as defined by national law, is, however, used as a dividing line for different levels of penalties."
"The idea is to reflect the principle that the younger the victim the worse the offence."
"In terms of final assistance, the STOP programme is a very valuable tool in combating paedophilia."
"The DAPHNE programme also specifically refers to paedophilia."
"The Commission will continue to support projects in this field through the new AGIS programme for law enforcement and judicial cooperation."
"Turning to the final part of the question, the Commission can confirm that it has comparative information on the legislative and judicial means to combat this tragic phenomenon."
"Europol has produced a report on this subject, demonstrating that it is very active in combating child pornography."
"Europol has recently been involved in several successful large-scale operations."
"The Commission is convinced that once Eurojust is fully operational, it will encourage and improve cooperation between the Member States in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children, by facilitating mutual legal assistance and the implementation of extradition requests."
"I share your view that we need to give priority to actions of this kind as far as candidate countries are concerned."
"I guarantee that the commitment of candidate countries has already been taken into consideration in the latest generation of Daphne and STOP programmes, and they are already being involved in concrete action."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the framework decision just adopted by the Council will be part of the acquis."
"That means that candidate countries will have to incorporate this new framework decision into their own national criminal law by1 January 2004."
"The Commissioner will be interested to know that I had the honour of chairing a meeting last week on the issue of child pornography, organised by the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children."
"We had an excellent presentation from the officer from Europol, Mr Morgan, and I also had the pleasure of announcing the agreement that I think had just been published in the papers that day."
"But I would like to ask how you think extradition requests will work when, for instance, material originates in third countries, where perhaps the same kind of basic legislation does not exist?"
"Secondly, what should be our approach to this kind of material arriving from outside the Community?"
"This is clearly going to be the route taken in future to circumvent legislation both here and in the United States."
"There are specific provisions in these proposals to deal with the problem of paedophilia on line on the Internet."
"We need to guarantee that judicial cooperation, above all mutual legal assistance with third countries, takes into consideration the need to consolidate the evidence needed for adequate criminal prosecution."
"We can only seize the material at the last station in the territory of the Member States."
"For instance, in the case of material that comes from third countries, we need to use the common cooperation agreements on mutual legal assistance to request the authorities of those Member States to act against those who produce such material."
"I would like to add also that, in this general framework, we must make the best possible use of the Council of Europe convention on cybercrime throughout the Internet."
"It is quite clear that producing illicit material concerning paedophile pornography is a criminal activity."
"Therefore, the Council of Europe convention would be fully applicable."
"Question No 44 by Ioannis Marinos (H-0664/02):"
"Subject: Designation of terrorists as 'political prisoners'"
"Following the recent arrest of terrorists in Greece, most of those arrested have admitted belonging to the terrorist organisation 'November 17'."
"However, over the last few days the Greek press has reported - on the basis of information from the above persons or their lawyers - that 'some of them intend to alter their confessions with the aim of securing their release in 10-12 years' time'and have invoked the status of 'political prisoner' on the basis of 'similar instances in other European countries', as press publications and TV analyses have reported."
"Is the Commission aware of the existence of any legal arrangements governing political prisoners in the democracies of the European Union, given that after the recent changes in Community legislation terrorists face tougher treatment, even if it is assumed that the murders and robberies they commit are inspired by 'noble' ideological motives?"
"The European Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States."
"They have been recognised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Commission is therefore unaware of any legal arrangements governing political prisoners in the democracies of the European Union, since the mere notion of political prisoners, that is, people who have been in prison or prosecuted only for political reasons or opinions, would be against those founding principles of the Union."
"As regards extradition between Member States, therefore, mutual confidence in the national judicial systems has resulted in revision of the political offence derogation in relation to terrorist crimes."
"Article 5(1) of the 1996 Convention relating to extradition between the Member States of the European Union, which supplements the European Convention on Extradition of 13 December 1957 thus states: 'For the purposes of applying this Convention, no offence may be regarded by the requested Member State as a political offence, as an offence connected with a political offence or an offence inspired by political motives.'"
"This statement covers the terrorist offences referred to in the first and second articles of the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, to which all Member States of the Union are party."
"The Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant, which will soon replace the previous extradition system, includes terrorism among the offences that will give rise to surrender, pursuant to a European arrest warrant, provided the offence is punishable in the issuing Member State by a custodial sentence or detention order for a maximum period of at least three years."
"The political nature of the offence cannot be put forward as grounds for non-execution."
"Finally, the Council framework decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism establishes a common definition of terrorist offences. It lists serious crimes deemed to be terrorist offences, when committed with the aim of seriously intimidating a population and unduly compelling a government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act, or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation."
"In this definition, reference to ideological motives is therefore irrelevant, both for defining a terrorist offence or avoiding considering it as such."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I shall inform my honourable friend, who is unable to be here today to discuss this with you, that there can be no remission of sin for any crime committed, as he points out, on the grounds of ideological motive."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, fighting terrorism is surely the most important objective in the world today."
"That is why I would be interested to know what initiatives the Commission plans to take on judicial matters in the light of the most recent developments."
"First of all, I think that we need to pursue our important achievements since 11 September 2001, mainly the transposition into the national legal systems of the framework decision on the definition of terrorism, and the transposition into national law of the framework decision concerning the European arrest warrant."
"Secondly, I would like to emphasise the role of police cooperation and the exchange of information between intelligence services on terrorist activities, based in particular on Europol's anti-terrorist unit and the special team of anti-terrorist magistrates in Eurojust."
"New initiatives relate, in particular, to ongoing negotiations with the United States on a mutual legal assistance agreement, including extradition, and the conclusion of the agreement on exchanges of information between Europol and the law enforcement agencies of the United States."
"Finally, as regards legislative initiatives for the year 2003, we are giving priority to the financing of terrorism, but it is still a little too soon to disclose the concrete initiatives that we will be putting forward to Parliament and Council next year."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"We will take each question in order until 7.30 p.m."
"Questions to Commissioner Byrne"
"Question No 45 by Richard Corbett (H-0613/02):"
"Subject: Livestock markets"
"In the light of increasing public concerns about the treatment of animals at livestock markets and at slaughter houses, is the Commission now willing to consider proposing a Directive laying down minimum standards for the protection of animals at such markets?"
"As rightly pointed out by the honourable Member, there are increasing concerns about the treatment of animals at livestock markets."
"It is the Commission's intention to cover this area when proposing new legislation on the protection of animals during transport before the end of this year."
"Practical experience and scientific knowledge are today available to help the Commission in doing this."
"In particular, the Commission's objective is to ensure that Member States ensure that animal welfare considerations are an integral part of the operation of livestock markets."
"Acts of cruelty or negligence observed in some markets are the result of operators' ignorance and insufficient supervision by the competent authorities."
"Therefore, the Commission believes that it is necessary to increase the training of personnel handling animals at markets."
"The Commission also considers that market operators should be primarily responsible for securing respect of welfare rules."
"They should be accountable for welfare rules as they already are for animal health rules."
"However, it should be remembered that day-to-day enforcement is the responsibility of the Member States."
"Substantial improvements can already be achieved under the current national provisions."
"It is not the role of the Commission to supervise livestock market operations but to ensure that Member States respect the EU provisions in this regard."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for that answer and to encourage him, when preparing that draft legislation, to examine whether or not there is a case for phasing out livestock markets entirely."
"I believe that in certain countries they have virtually ceased to exist."
"After all, it is not just a question of animal welfare, it is also a question of the spread of disease."
"Perhaps in the modern age such markets are no longer the best way of dealing with the trade in animals."
"If the Commission concludes that they must remain, then they should be properly regulated."
"I welcome what the Commissioner has just said, but does he agree that it should apply not just to the transport of animals that fall to some degree under the existing directive but to the protection of all animals that pass through such livestock markets?"
"Concerning the first part of your supplementary question as to whether it might be appropriate to phase out the livestock markets altogether, the position is that for some farm species this is a necessary marketing tool."
"There are long traditions in relation to the sale and marketing of animals in this way."
"Their use derives from historic and socio-economic reasons that cannot be ignored by a simple ban."
"However, I agree that in addressing this issue in the context of Community legislation, we are looking at it in connection with the animal transport legislation we are working on at the moment."
"I fully agree that this issue is not just relevant to animals under transport, but to all animals."
"Nonetheless, it is in the context of that legislation that we are looking at the issue."
"As I indicated a moment ago, it is important to ensure that there is proper training of staff who handle animals, not only in the context of transport but generally."
"This is one of the objectives that will be contained in the legislation currently being drafted."
"Question No 46 by Philip Bushill-Matthews (H-0633/02):"
"Subject: Food safety"
"Would the Commission reveal what immediate action it proposes to take, and how such action will be effective, in dealing with recurrent problems of the non-removal of spinal cord in meat processed by abattoirs in Germany and France?"
"The Commission attaches great importance to the correct removal of specified risk material, since it is one of the most important ways of protecting the health of consumers against the related risk of BSE."
"In addition to being an unacceptable threat to health, these incidents also serve to undermine consumer confidence in the effectiveness of the Community measures relating to BSE."
"According to Regulation 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain BSEs, specified risk material must be removed at the slaughterhouse or, in case of the vertebral column of bovine animals, at the cutting plant."
"Carcasses, half-carcasses and quarter-carcasses containing no specified risk material other than the vertebral column may be dispatched to another Member State."
"In the latter case, the removal of the vertebral column should take place at the cutting plant in the Member State of destination."
"Shortcomings in the proper implementation of the removal of specified risk material, in particular spinal cord, have been reported in carcasses produced in different Member States: Germany, Spain, France, the UK, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and Italy."
"The Commission has on several occasions reminded the Member States of the importance of properly implementing the removal of specified risk material."
"In the case of recurrence, the Commission has requested strong action, such as suspending the licences of the plants responsible or introducing corrective measures."
"The Commission has requested that it be informed of the corrective measures taken."
"In subsequent inspections carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office on BSE and BSE-related matters in the Member States, the removal of SRMs has been found to be reasonably satisfactory, with minor deficiencies relating mainly to technical and operational difficulties."
"The Commission is also funding a research project to find alternative and more effective ways to remove the spinal cord."
"This project is nearly finished."
"The Commission is closely following the situation and will, if necessary, remind all the Member States of the obligation to remove the spinal cord of bovine animals aged over 12 months."
"Implementation of the corrective measures notified by the Member States to remedy the situation will be further assessed by the Food and Veterinary Office."
"Finally, it should be borne in mind that the vertebral column is currently defined as specified risk material in carcasses from bovine animals aged over 12 months in all Member States except Portugal and the United Kingdom."
"Any remnants of spinal cord in the vertebral column should therefore already have been automatically removed as specified risk material at the place of destination before sale to the consumer."
"I note your remarks with interest, Commissioner, and am delighted to hear that the Commission takes this issue seriously, but your role as I see it seems to be confined to reminding Member States, requesting strong action and then requesting to be informed."
"With respect, do you feel that is satisfactory or do you feel that the public will find that satisfactory, because these are problems that are recurring?"
"Since I tabled this question, literally in the last couple of weeks, we have had an example in the UK of Germany once again breaking the rules by sending no less than its 13th consignment of meat containing banned spinal cord to the UK."
"Has the Commission no powers to do anything more than request or remind?"
"If it does not, should it not have such powers?"
"How much longer will it go on requesting and reminding before some action is taken by somebody?"
"This issue has been closely monitored and, based on the preliminary results in 2002, the actions taken by the Member States have resulted in a decrease in the number of infractions concerning remnants of spinal cord."
"Of course, the Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely, and if the problems recur, will place the matter on the agenda of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health to emphasise the importance of the proper removal of specified waste material, in other words, spinal cord, at slaughterhouse level, and to require strong corrective actions."
"I have spoken directly to the competent ministers in a number of Member States about this, with the result that licences for slaughter plants have been suspended in two particular Member States for a period of time."
"These are strong sanctions which can be requested by the Commission and which have been implemented."
"To that extent, I believe that the strength of such sanctions, when imposed on food processors, is that they tend to improve standards."
"Ultimately, there is always the option of bringing infringement proceedings, but in these circumstances, given the passage of time necessary to get such proceedings into court, it does not seem to me to be the most effective method of seeking compliance."
"Finally, as you probably are aware, I am currently working on a piece of legislation on feed and food controls, which envisages imposing financial sanctions for failure to comply with this kind of legislation."
"That will hopefully be brought to the Commission in the very near future and, if adopted, will be made public and come to Parliament in due course for further discussion."
"Question No 47 by Mary Elizabeth Banotti (H-0639/02):"
"Subject: Diabetes"
"It is estimated that by 2010 there will be thirty million people in the EU with diabetes."
"What is the Commission doing to address this catastrophic rise in diabetes and is the Commission proposing any research action or information campaigns to address this issue?"
"The Commission recognises that diabetes is a chronic disease that poses a major public health challenge to the Community."
"Its causes are closely linked to the health determinants of diet, obesity and physical activity."
"These determinants are clearly linked, and a separate approach to each is not likely to be successful."
"The Treaty limits the competence of the Community in the field of public health by stating that Community action must fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care."
"As regards diabetes, the work of the Commission has therefore concentrated on encouraging cooperation between Member States through public health programmes."
"Through these programmes the Commission has encouraged policy development and measures related to the determinants of type 2 diabetes, namely nutrition, obesity and exercise."
"In the new public health programme entering into force on 1 January 2003, attention is given to improving data collection on key health indicators such as nutrition-related mortality and morbidity."
"Emphasis is also placed on developing common strategies on health determinants such as nutrition."
"The existing health promotion, health monitoring and cancer programmes have provided concrete support to a variety of initiatives on diet, nutrition, obesity and physical activity. For example, the support given to conferences such as those held under the French and Danish Council presidencies on the issues of nutrition and obesity."
"The Eurodiet report on nutrition is now published and available on the Commission website, making it available to a wide international audience."
"The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC), financed by the cancer programme and carried out by the International Agency for Cancer Research in Lyon, is another major initiative on the links between diet and disease."
"The project, supported by the health promotion programme sli na sláinte, is an initiative to promote physical activity as part of a prevention strategy."
"All of these activities will have had an impact on the prevention of diabetes."
"A status report on the place of nutrition in all Commission policy areas, not only public health, will shortly be finalised and published."
"Taking account of the limits set out in Article 152 of the Treaty, the Commission does not intend to set up a specific priority plan related to diabetes."
"Instead, the approach followed by the new public health programme is designed to ensure a complementary and horizontal approach to prevention, rather than the old approach of looking at diseases by means of separate and individual programmes."
"The new programme is policy-driven and aims to promote policy and activities on health determinants that will have an impact on key challenges such as type 2 diabetes."
"Through its framework research programmes the Commission has supported diabetes research in the past."
"Significant financial support has been made available for this type of research."
"In the Fifth Framework Programme, diabetes research was covered under the quality of life and management of living resources programme."
"The total funding has been more than EUR 18 million."
"Diabetes research continues to be a priority in the upcoming Sixth Framework Programme under the first priority thematic area 'Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health'."
"Research funds will be distributed on a competitive basis following calls for proposals, and information will be made widely available, for example on the research website."
"In addition to support for research projects, the Sixth Framework Programme will provide funds for fellowships as well as for networking of national diabetes research activities under the chapter 'Strengthening the foundations of the European research area'."
"That aspect is considered particularly important in order to contribute to the creation of a European research area."
"Finally, it should also be mentioned that foods presented as designed to satisfy the particular nutritional requirements of people with diabetes should currently comply with the requirements of Council Directive 89/398 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses."
"The Commission intends to present a report to Parliament and the Council on the desirability of special nutritional provisions for people with diabetes."
"May I take this opportunity to wish every success to World Diabetes Day on 14 November."
"I hope to be able to join with those who are promoting this when the diabetes testing and awareness campaign is launched here in Strasbourg on 19 November."
"Commissioner, that was a very long, quite technical answer."
"I would like to raise a couple of issues with you."
"Firstly, all the best thinking on diabetes is that special food should not be targeted at diabetics."
"The best diet for people with diabetes or those at risk of developing diabetes is good, plain, fresh food, not processed foods."
"It was only with great difficulty that diabetes was mentioned in the Sixth Framework Programme."
"I hope that when you are considering it, the provision of a chair for diabetes nurses in one of the Community universities will be one of the priorities for support."
"The cost to the health services within the Community of a condition which, as I mentioned in my question, will affect approximately 30 million people by the year 2010, has to some extent to be taken into consideration."
"In the light of what is coming down the line, I would be interested to know whether the Commission proposes to take a more proactive approach to this."
"It is certainly true that the costs related to any health care are increasing day by day and year by year in the Member States."
"The fact of the matter is that public health professionals and, indeed, some governments are now giving more attention to investing more in health promotion and disease prevention."
"The emphasis in the past has all too often been on spending large sums of money on health care."
"If this change takes place, as your question implies, that will greatly affect the issue of diabetes, on which you focus particularly in in your question, but also other diseases."
"I firmly believe that, when the public health programme is up and running under the three-stranded approach from January 2003, valuable information and data will be gathered under the first strand."
"Then, under the strand of health determinants, we will be able to promote the healthy lifestyle and balanced food intake that you mentioned in your supplementary question."
"I am looking into the correlation between, for instance, diseases like obesity and food, and I hope to report the results between now and the end of the year."
"As the parent of a diabetic daughter, can I support the honourable Member in her plea for Commission action and particularly congratulate her on the initiative that she and Mr Bovis are taking to bring this to the attention of Parliament."
"Because of the rise in the number of sufferers from this disease, there is often conflicting advice about the various treatments."
"Yet we hear almost daily of new research developments, both palliative and surgical."
"Does the Commissioner not agree with me that we need to to be able to offer the citizens of the European Union clear guidance about the progress of research?"
"The Commission and the European Union could play a significant part in ensuring that the rise of this disease is matched only by the information about how to treat it and how to avoid it in the first place?"
"Once again, I refer you to the first strand of the public health programme that will be in operation from 1 January 2003."
"The information that will be gathered and the data that will be made available will assist considerably in coming up with solutions and in the dissemination of valuable information, not only in the Commission and the other institutions of the European Union but also, obviously, in the Member States."
"In addition to what I said earlier about the various programmes and the work and investment that has been undertaken already in this area, I forgot to mention that a project, supported by the health promotion programme, to create a masters degree course in nutrition is on the way."
"That answers the earlier question by Mrs Banotti which I forgot to reply to."
"I can only refer to the answer to the earlier questions, that a great deal of work has already been undertaken on this and much more is in the pipeline."
"I mentioned earlier the work that I am currently undertaking on the connection between nutrition and, for instance, obesity and the question of good health generally."
"I think that the major leap forward will take place when the public health programme is up and running."
"I have high hopes for that programme."
"There are high expectations in Member States, and I also believe that there is a substantial degree of support from Member States' health ministers."
"I would just like to tell the Commissioner that I was not referring to a masters degree in nutrition."
"I was referring to the chair for specialist nurses in diabetes, for which there is an application before the Commission."
"I just want to clarify that."
"I am concerned about the frequent incidence of salmonella in meat preparations imported into Sweden and about your worry that this could affect the salmonella status of Sweden."
"As you are aware, Finland and Sweden were granted additional salmonella guarantees in the context of their accession to the European Union."
"These additional guarantees cover the trade of certain live animals, eggs, fresh fish and mincemeat to Finland and Sweden."
"You propose that the Commission should extend the additional salmonella guarantees to meat preparations."
"The only way to do so would be to amend the Community legislation on meat preparations."
"However, the directive on mincemeat and meat preparations already lays down a salmonella criterion for meat preparations."
"Any meat preparation produced within the Community must meet that criterion."
"It is good that the Commissioner is concerned over the high incidence of salmonella in meat preparations imported into Sweden."
"We now know that there was an oversight in our accession negotiations."
"What we are now discussing is not related to heat-treated products."
"We know that salmonella disappears in such products and only new contamination will reintroduce salmonella into them."
"In this case, it is about the fact that anyone can put a chicken in a bag with a few grams of salt and claim that it is a preparation."
"That is the main problem."
"It is slightly absurd that I am Parliament's rapporteur in the case of a directive aimed at creating salmonella controls across the whole of the EU which look very much like the Scandinavian controls."
"As such, it is a little odd that a quick decision cannot be taken on having a salmonella guarantee for preparations which are not heat treated."
"If we are to achieve salmonella control across the whole of Europe, we need salmonella-free areas, wherever they may be, to be able to protect themselves while others catch up."
"The extension of the additional salmonella guarantees to cover mincemeat was not proposed by the Commission."
"The reason why the additional guarantees should not cover meat preparations, the existence of the salmonella criterion, applies also to mincemeat."
"However, it has to be noted that it is probably easier to control salmonella in meat preparations than in mincemeat."
"Therefore the salmonella criteria are more effective for meat preparations than for mincemeat and this can be used to justify the application of additional guarantees to mincemeat and not to meat preparations."
"I am sure that Mrs Paulsen is aware of the legislation that is going through the Council at the moment which was discussed at the last meeting of the Agriculture Council."
"It ran into the buffers to some extent and now has been put back for discussion at the next Agriculture Council. This issue will be discussed on that occasion."
"Meat preparations in general are being looked at, but not just for Sweden and Finland."
"We want to improve standards for the EU as a whole and that is reflected in this legislation, which I hope will get through the Agriculture Council in December."
"As I said earlier, the Commission is well aware of the dangers of salmonella."
"In fact, approximately 200 people a year die in the European Union from contracting the disease of salmonella."
"In this context, it is my intention to propose improved sampling rules and a stricter limit for salmonella in meat preparations."
"This should contribute to decreasing the salmonella contamination in meat preparations throughout the whole Community."
"In addition, the ongoing revisions of Community legislation on food hygiene and, as I said earlier, on zoonosis, will strengthen the controls on salmonella along the whole food chain, from farm to table."
"This will obviously have a positive impact on the situation as regards salmonella in foodstuffs throughout the entire European Union and not just in individual Member States."
"Question No 50 by Joachim Wuermeling (H-0673/02):"
"Subject: Export ban on cigarettes - WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control"
"Last year the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2001/37/EC"
"The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is at the moment holding its fifth meeting in Geneva."
"Concerning the regulation of contents of tobacco products, the text released by the chair for further discussion does not set harmonised standards but provides for each party to adopt and implement standards as recommended by the Conference of the Parties, including standards and best practices for testing and measuring the content and emissions of such products."
"The final text of the Convention is expected to be ready in March 2003."
"Should this provision become a part of the final text of the Framework Convention, and considering the timetable foreseen for the establishment of the Conference of the Parties, it is indeed possible that such recommendations could be produced by 2007."
"The Commission believes that the adoption of common standards for the regulation of the content of tobacco products and emissions and the adoption of common rules for measurement methods are essential measures to be taken by all parties to the Convention."
"Recommendations made by the Conference of the Parties can be a very important instrument for harmonising standards, and parties should therefore be called upon to duly consider them."
"However, as such harmonisation could lead to a lowering of the level of public health protection, the Community's position is that such recommendations should not be binding. That is to say, their adoption should be left to the discretion of the parties."
"This would allow parties, such as the Community, to keep their already existing strong legislation in this field."
"In this context, I would like to draw to Mr Wuermeling's attention the fact that, according to the negotiating directives provided by the Council, the negotiations must aim to base the operative provisions of the Framework Convention on existing Community legislation."
"Finally, concerning the very last part of Mr Wuermeling's question, the Commission firmly believes that the negotiations on the Framework Convention will be successful and is doing its utmost to ensure that an efficient instrument with the maximum impact on tobacco consumption will be agreed upon."
"However, in the extremely unlikely event that the negotiations should fail, the Commission would not see this as a reason to propose modifying the provisions of Directive 2001/37 on exports."
"Mr President, I should like firstly to thank you very much for the information and to present Mr Würmeling's apologies, as he had to leave for Berlin at very short notice to attend an important meeting."
"I should then like to add two short questions, which the Commissioner may be able to answer briefly together."
"Might it not be the case that the Commission's negotiating position would possibly be improved if it reserved the right in the negotiations to amend the directive in respect of the export ban if necessary, because it could then exert pressure on the other countries to go along with such a recommendation?"
"Secondly, if the negotiations fail do you expect production to shift significantly from the European Union to third countries?"
"Does the Commission know, or does it have any estimates of, how many jobs might be lost in the European Union as a result?"
"The negotiating position of the Commission is that we want to achieve the best possible outcome for public health."
"That is the overriding consideration. It will be the motivation for me and my staff in negotiating on behalf of the EU, where the issue is within Community competence."
"The question whether production will shift to third countries is often raised."
"In other words, are jobs going to be affected by this?"
"I have two answers to that question."
"First of all, public health cannot take second place to job considerations."
"That is fundamental as far as I am concerned. I have already said that on a number of occasions."
"Even if there were concern about jobs, some work was undertaken on this when the legislation we now have before Parliament was being considered."
"There was certainly some evidence available to us in those Member States that introduced, for instance, strict legislation banning the advertising of tobacco products."
"Unemployment did not increase as a result."
"There was a shift in other directions. Therefore, I have never seen any convincing evidence that introducing legislation of this type would have adverse effects on employment."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"As the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 51 to 108 will be replied to in writing."
"On behalf of myself and the Members of the European Parliament, it is a great pleasure to welcome you, Mr President, to our House today."
"It is an especially great pleasure for me, as an Irish European, in a week when the people have spoken and told the leaders of the fifteen states of the Union that the time for enlargement has come."
"Tomorrow you will be back in Hungary to commemorate and celebrate your nation's national day, and to recall the brave Hungarian uprising of 1956 and the proclamation of the republic in 1989."
"On the floor of our House today stands a very special symbol of that moment - the Hungarian flag raised during that period in 1956."
"(Applause)"
"The martyrs of that 1956 revolution in a way died for Europe and for the values that today, through the enlargement of the European Union, we are now anticipating and creating."
"And so those people did not die in vain, Mr President, and your being here today is a mark of their contribution to Europe."
"The values they died for are the values that now unite us across our continent."
"Mr President, I have no doubt that your country will be one of our new Member States in 2004."
"This Parliament was the first of the European institutions to set a clear timetable for enlargement."
"We want Hungary in the Union and we want your representatives in our Parliament, directly elected by the people of Hungary, for the session starting in the summer of 2004."
"(Applause)"
"What we are now poised to achieve is the direct result of the events of 1989 in which Hungary, once again, played a decisive role."
"It was Hungary that first agreed to open the iron curtain for people from the former German Democratic Republic waiting in the German Embassy in Budapest for passage to West Germany."
"One of my own treasured possessions at home in Ireland is a piece of wire cut in August that year on the Hungarian/Austrian border."
"It symbolises for me the night that Europe has lived through."
"Enlargement symbolises for me the day ahead of us."
"Mr President, I want you to feel at home here."
"I want you, as the President of your republic, to understand that in being here today on the eve of your national day you are coming home."
"For the first time on our continent we are creating something powerful and new, through the free will of free and sovereign peoples and on the basis of shared values, not this time at the point of a sword, or at the barrel of a gun."
"As a young man you studied in Strasbourg; it gives me great pleasure, on behalf of the European Parliament, to ask a man who studied at a student's desk now to speak at a rostrum before the largest directly elected transnational parliament in the world and to share with us our common sense of the Europe in the making."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, first of all I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the European Parliament for commemorating the Hungarian revolution of 1956."
"I stand here to address you for the first time at the Plenary in Hungarian."
"Hopefully, it will very soon be one of the official languages of the European Union."
"With your permission, however, I would anticipate this possibility now and will continue my address in Hungarian."
"You will have the opportunity to listen to it in English, hopefully with a good interpretation"
"Mr President, thank you for those remarks and for the reminder that the spirit of 1956, of which you spoke so eloquently, lives on through our Europe of values today."
"(The formal sitting was closed at 12.34 p.m.)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0329/2002) by Mr Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on an Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament and the Council concerning access by the European Parliament to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy and on amendments to the Rules of Procedure [2002/2130(ACI)]."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report, should it be adopted, will take us into uncharted territory."
"Why uncharted territory?"
"Because it will give us the opportunity, on the basis of an interinstitutional agreement with the Council, to examine secret military documents and be party to certain information and will therefore enable us to develop a means of extending parliamentary scrutiny to these areas."
"This has been under negotiation for years and I should like in particular to thank the Swedish Presidency, now a distant memory, and the Spanish Presidency for their help, which has made it possible for us to negotiate here today."
"Of course this paper is not perfect."
"We are entering new territory here and that is why learning is also the order of the day."
"We must not, however, go too far at the outset, because this is a very sensitive area and at stake are the security interests of the Member States of the European Union and all of our fellow citizens."
"That is why everyone, both the Council and Parliament, first needs to learn how to work together and to build confidence, so that the necessary information and control processes can then be set in motion on this basis."
"That is why we have also made it clear that either of the two sides can terminate the agreement after two years, so as to draft a new agreement on the basis of the experience acquired, and that this is therefore not a permanent arrangement but just a first step on this sensitive issue of internal security."
"It has also been explicitly stated that this agreement in the field of foreign, security and defence policy is without prejudice to future agreements on the transparency of internal documents for internal policies."
"As has been said, agreements also need to be reached in these areas."
"I will make it quite clear that in my opinion it is quite conceivable, if not a necessity, that measures will be adopted in internal policy areas, where there are particular sensitivities due to the possible participation of third countries, and that these might go very much further even at the first attempt than is the case in this document."
"I believe that we have achieved something here that certainly bears comparison with the standards in national parliaments and that the security standards, which we ourselves need to develop in this House, will also certainly have their part to play in enabling us to meet the requirements, just as the five Members of the special committee will have to undergo security checks by their respective Member States."
"As you can see, there are no separate rules here either; the situation is comparable to that of national Members of Parliament."
"On this basis we can find solutions that will help us to make further progress."
"I should like to ask you to support both of these papers on amending the Rules of Procedure and on the agreement itself."
"I would also ask you to reject one of the amendments, because it concerns the extreme case of criminal offences being committed, by whichever side."
"This is something that could arise whenever the handling of public funds and public documents is involved."
"It is regulated elsewhere - not in the Rules of Procedure - and does not need to be regulated here."
"It is far more appropriate here to proceed in accordance with the traditional principle that action will be taken against anyone committing a criminal offence."
"Ultimately, of course, we rely on the consciences of those who know of any such criminal offences to speak out, so that action can be taken against their perpetrators."
"I think that this marks a step towards greater transparency and control of our foreign, security and defence policy, and if someone had said five or ten years ago that we would be negotiating the establishment of a committee of this kind in the European Parliament, I would not have thought it possible."
"This shows how far the European Union as a whole has come since the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Cologne Summit on security and defence policy."
"However, it also shows a commensurate need for parliamentary scrutiny."
"That is why I would urge the House to support this initiative."
"Mr President of the European Parliament ... no, EB of the EB, Mr President of the European Parliament ... no, EB, EB."
"What is all this about?"
"You can either present and justify all of this as being in the interests of the State, just as Elmar Brok, whom I personally hold in high esteem both here and in other professional contexts, has done, or you can comment a little on the procedure and how this agreement has come about and consider why someone behind me always says, 'EB, EB' when I say, 'EP'."
"We certainly need to be a little wary here."
"I welcome the fact that this agreement will give Parliament a bit more power and that there is also going to be the opportunity to examine certain documents."
"I do not wish to run the risk of the little man behind me, who always says 'EB, EB', being proved right by people confusing the European Parliament, 'EP', with EB, 'Elmar Brok'."
"Why am I saying this, and why, strange as it may seem, are they seen as one and the same thing?"
"Because I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that the way in which this has been negotiated is not exactly exemplary, and that the fact is that, in the final analysis, we are faced with a take it or leave it situation."
"Many Members hardly had the chance to be involved in the negotiating process and above all it is now once again EB who has access to internal documents and, as he himself also said, he is pleased that only Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy are involved while the EP, the European Parliament, is left out in the cold."
"We can, indeed we must, live with these objections, because obviously this can be seen as a foot in the door, but as I see it - and I am not the only one - the report does contain some reassurance. It says in the explanatory statement: 'It is ... crucial that the Agreement includes a provision that it will be reviewed after two years at the request of either of the two institutions in the light of the experience acquired in implementing it.'"
"I very much hope that those who are involved now, that is the two EBs and their friends, will not act in such a way that the agreement is unilaterally terminated by the Council or whoever it may be, so that the EP then has an opportunity to have more of a say when the text is redrafted and actually to become what someone previously called a fully-fledged parliament. Each of the individual committees should be able to have their say and fair account should be taken of the very diverse views represented in this House, so that this clash is avoided, and also so that we prove that what was mentioned earlier is true; that we are in agreement here that there can be no democracy without transparency, and that includes within this House."
"Mr President, on very solemn occasions, those of us in Parliament and in the other institutions of the EU talk about how we should go about bringing the EU closer to the people."
"One of the ways of doing this would be to give people an opportunity to participate, play their parts and be partners in the whole of the decision-making process taking place in and between the institutions of the EU."
"The prerequisite of people's being able to take on that role is that they be able to obtain a feeling for what goes on before the decisions are taken."
"That is why the principle of access to documents is so important."
"As my fellow MEP, Mrs Malmström, said, we are all of us aware of there being confidential documents that are difficult to make available."
"The European Parliament has, in my view, embarked upon a slippery slope, however."
"We find ourselves in a position which we should not have occupied."
"As the people's guarantors, as the custodians of democracy and as the institution that should be the democratic guarantor of this project, we have now moved into an area in which we consent to people's not being given access to documents, with only ourselves or a small group of us having such access."
"In this way, we are complicit in considering our own interests or, more accurately, those of a small group of MEPs at the expense of the interests of European citizens and their opportunity to be players in the democratic process."
"As my other fellow MEP from the Group of the Party of European Socialists put it, the whole process involving public access to, and scrutiny of, documents has taken place behind closed doors."
"That is in itself a problem when we specifically talk about transparency and public access to, and scrutiny of, documents."
"That is why I do not warm to this document."
"Mr President, the PPE's Congress in Estoril has now advocated complete transparency in the legislative process in the Council."
"All the important political forces therefore support the transparency placed on the agenda when the Danes voted against the Treaty of Maastricht on 2 June 1992."
"We have seen progress in a number of areas, but we also have a number of things to look forward to."
"The Commission now publishes its agendas and the minutes of the meetings at which decisions are taken."
"It is important to know who said what and how they voted."
"The Commissioners must be accountable to the public."
"The Council has issued minutes relating to the working party's discussions on transparency."
"We must have similar access to other working parties' working documents and minutes, and we must have access immediately so that we can follow developments before the laws are adopted."
"We are currently debating a proposal for a compromise on Parliament's access to confidential information, but the new rules would limit that access to which all MEPs are entitled under the Treaty."
"I believe we could make more progress by going to the Court of Justice, as has been done with great success in connection with proper agreements."
"I shall not therefore vote in favour of the compromise."
"If truth be told, the European Parliament has never negotiated anything in the way of progress."
"There have been individual MEPs who have exerted pressure, together with the Ombudsman and active citizens who have won one legal case after another."
"It is before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg that we have achieved most progress, not in negotiations between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"That is the sad fact."
"The European Parliament is always ready to make demands, but it becomes silent whenever, as now, there is the possibility of a framework agreement's being entered into or a regulation on transparency's being negotiated, entailing the danger of documents at present publicly available in Denmark and Sweden being regarded as secret as soon as they are forwarded to the EU."
"Nor am I happy with the new agreement, and I would call upon the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy to go to the Court of Justice in connection with those documents we cannot obtain, such as the screening reports on the candidate countries' adjustments to EU legislation."
"The screening reports are very good examples of documents it should be possible for everyone here in the Chamber and in the candidate countries' parliaments to read."
"I doubt if we should be able to obtain them under the new rules."
"I cannot imagine the Court of Justice preventing us from obtaining documents that are a clear part of the legislative process."
"I believe we can obtain more progress by putting up a fight than by entering now into a poor compromise."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Brok very much for having taken the initiative, together with the President of the European Parliament, of producing a clearer, more detailed framework regulating Parliament's access to sensitive Council documents."
"Although there are gaps in the agreement, as the rapporteur himself points out when he says that Parliament has had to make concessions to the Council, it is, at least, a step towards greater democratic control."
"In my capacity as a member of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I find it absolutely inconceivable that Parliament should be blatantly denied access to documents in the field of justice and home affairs, the very area in which rules have a direct impact on the citizens' rights and freedoms."
"The Justice and Home Affairs Council of 14 and 15 October discussed the framework decision on drugs, but the most recent document available on the register dates back to June."
"A number of documents have been circulated since then but the European Parliament has not seen any of them."
"Why is it that the citizens are being prevented from knowing what compromise the Danish Presidency has proposed?"
"Maybe it is fear that people will find out that the ministers do not respect the mandates of their governments, parliaments and citizens behind the closed doors of the Council and that they are therefore doing at European level what they lack the courage to do at national level."
"Even the Danish Minister, Mrs Lene Espersen, lacked the courage to describe the contents of this compromise to the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights today."
"One last example: at least 20 of the 39 documents discussed at the meeting of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs of 14 and 15 October were not published on the register."
"We believe that there must be an end to this way of treating the European Parliament and the citizens who elected it, who continue to be disgracefully humiliated by the Council."
"Mr President, despite attempts to make them otherwise, security and defence are matters for the European Council."
"This Parliament has no competence in that area, either legislative or budgetary."
"Furthermore, it has to be said that, within the context of the Treaties, the function of this Parliament is to scrutinise the Commission."
"Its responsibility does not extend to the scrutiny or review of Council activities."
"Scrutiny of Council members remains the responsibility of individual national parliaments."
"It is to them that their individual ministers are responsible."
"Only those parliaments can hold ministers to account."
"On that basis, it seems to be a measure of the self-importance of the Members of this Parliament that they are seeking information that is not in the public domain."
"I would say that it is none of their business."
"Parliament should not be asking for it, and the Council should not give it."
"This also has wider implications."
"The information is not to be given to all Members but to a select and privileged cartel within this Parliament."
"Furthermore, those who receive that information are to be sworn to secrecy and can be disciplined for breaches of confidence."
"There cannot be a better way of muzzling representatives of the public."
"The central point is that, if the primary role of Parliament is scrutinising the Commission, then that is exactly what it should be doing."
"Time allocated for debates on these matters is already ridiculously short, and scrutiny is therefore minimal."
"It would be far better if the House concentrated on its statutory duties, rather than poking its nose into areas which are none of its business."
"In pursuit of more information, therefore, it would be much better if it devoted its energies to pressing for more transparency and openness from the Commission."
"Mr President, I hope you will allow a point of order."
"During the debate I became aware that, according to tomorrow's voting list, we are also going to vote on a Bureau proposal concerning the security rules, which are a precondition for adopting the interinstitutional agreement."
"I would like to know why there has been no mention of these security rules on our agenda."
"Would it not be appropriate for the House to discuss those security rules, which are being put to the vote tomorrow in the context of the interinstitutional agreement and the amendments to the Rules of Procedure?"
"I consider this procedure to be most insulting to the House."
"Thank you for your comment, Mrs Hautala. However, I think you ought to make it again before the start of the votes tomorrow."
"In my opinion, it would be a good idea for you to make the comment again so that you can receive a response from those who planned the voting schedule."
"Mr President, these security rules were submitted and discussed in the Committee competent to deal with them."
"This agreement can also be adopted or rejected regardless of them, but it cannot yet enter into force, as the security rules have not yet been adopted."
"The Interinstitutional Agreement can therefore be adopted tomorrow in any case."
"Please permit me to address a brief comment to the Members."
"We are dealing here solely with foreign, security and defence policy, none of which form part of the legislation."
"That, Mr Bonde, is why this committee does not deal with any papers that have to do with legislation, in which area Mr Turco is talking about justice and internal affairs."
"I have said quite clearly that the Agreement recommends that a separate agreement be negotiated for this area, and I believe that this should go much further in taking Parliament's rights into account."
"Mrs Hautala is right to say that, if this does not succeed, one of the options provided is that of an appeal."
"I would, by the way, like to tell Mrs Hautala and others that it is only when we know the documents that we can say whether their classifications are justified."
"If we see that access is not being given to papers that Parliament as a whole is actually meant to be able to see, we can say that they have been wrongly classified, and in this way bring about a change in practice at Council level."
"If, though, we know nothing about the documents, we can have no criticism to make on this score."
"Apart from that, we have to say that getting access to such documents represents a new start for the Council and the Commission as well."
"Without such a settlement, we will have difficulty in carrying on any sort of European foreign and security policy."
"In this instance, therefore, all the institutions have a shared interest in finding a point from which they can all start."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0308/2002) by Mr Hans-Peter Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of the provisions of Parliament's Rules of Procedure concerning the discharge procedure [2001/2060(REG)]."
"Mr President, although it is customary to express gratitude, please allow me to unite that with wonderment at the report that is now before us."
"The task in hand is clear indeed."
"We were asked, especially in view of the experiences of 1999, to find another, less ambiguous way whereby the Commission, and not only the Commission, was in future to be granted discharge."
"What was at stake was that there should be the minimum of room for manoeuvre where people are simply stalling, that proposals for decisions that are very clearly set out should also result in appropriate results, and that no areas of uncertainty should remain."
"If one is dealing with Parliament, one learns that this place attaches primary importance to compromises, and it is compromises that we have worked towards very intensively."
"For that, I would like to thank not only the officials of this House, who, with great commitment, kept on coming up with new formulations and proposals, and not only my own colleagues either, who had a part in this process, which - as we don't work as quickly as Elmar Brok - has in the meantime lasted nearly a year, but also the Members of this House belonging to other groups, who have made the effort to do this."
"Compromise means that there is give and take, and that is a small chance to take part in a process, if you are seated up there in the gallery or, through some other fortuity, find yourself listening to what is being said."
"I hear that amendments handed in by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control at the very last minute, which go against this great ideal of compromise, are now to be promptly withdrawn."
"If they ask how it is that a rapporteur does not know that, it has to do with another of the realities of life in this House, that is, the fact that such last-minute agreements are often reached outside the plenary and are often not completely transparent."
"But we will shortly hear whether we have pulled it off."
"There is another thing, though - I am looking around to find Mr Bourlanges, with whom I did most of the negotiations - and that is something I can do."
"(Interjection by Mr Bourlanges)"
"Perhaps Mr Bourlanges will hear it as well."
"There is another thing; that is, that I have to offer and would like to say that I withdraw the request for a split vote that we made on one point, itself very close to the heart of Mr Bourlanges and of the PPE Group that he represents, in other words that there will be no split vote on the matter that is so dear to them. It goes without saying that this is being done in the hope that we can achieve the precise result that we need, which is broad agreement to this report."
"It is the case that, without 314 votes, we will achieve no durable compromise, and we will make no progress without effort."
"My concern is not only that unambiguous rules should be created for the Commission, but also - something in Article 93a to which I would gladly return - with working out how this Parliament should at last flex its muscles a bit more at the Council in its executive capacity, and that we should make this our concern."
"I believe that to be this report's second pillar, if that is indeed the term to be used."
"It is, in this sense, my very great hope that we will now, on the one hand, hear about compromises struck outside the plenary, and, on the other hand - as Mr Bourlanges is also on the list of speakers - that we will hear him say that he agrees to it, and that we may thus bring the whole business to a satisfactory conclusion."
"Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, honourable Members, although it is for Parliament to debate its own Rules of Procedure, I would like to take the opportunity to say a few words."
"The discharge procedure is of course of very great importance to the Commission, and it is enshrined in the Treaty itself."
"Now it has a place, and is couched in even clearer terms, in the financial regulation, so that there are two existing legal bases, which of course have to be taken together in reaching decisions."
"I must therefore raise the question of whether all the amendments that have been submitted are in accordance with these legal bases."
"Over the last two years, Parliament has negotiated with the Council and the Court of Auditors and done very in-depth work on the recast financial regulation."
"A good and clear result has finally been achieved."
"Article 146 (1) states: 'The European Parliament, acting on a recommendation from the Council, which shall act by a qualified majority, shall give a discharge to the Commission before 30 April of the year n+2 in respect of the implementation of the budget of the financial year n."
"Where the European Parliament defers the grant of the discharge resolution, the Commission shall act as soon as possible to remove the causes of impediment.'"
"End of quotation from Article 146."
"I believe that the legislative authority had a clear aim in choosing this formulation."
"Where, exceptionally, the discharge resolution is deferred, the Commission is to respond very quickly in order to remove the causes of the impediment."
"Now these proposals refer to October, all of six months later."
"That is, of course, not exactly a quick response within the meaning of Article 146."
"This deferment procedure also involves three other difficulties."
"The first is that the Commission has to take care that Parliament keeps the reasons for the suspension of the discharge resolution realistic and within the bounds of feasibility."
"The second is that, if it is envisaged that action will be taken, six months is again a relatively short period."
"If the Commission is meant to come up with responses and commitments, it can - and should - do so more quickly."
"Thirdly, if these conditions are to be seen as a normal option in the Rules of Procedure themselves, there is of course the risk of suspension being regarded as a regular course of action."
"I would like to point out that Parliament already, of course, has instruments available, by which it can impose further tasks and actions on the Commission, and, indeed, it has done so in recent years."
"The resolution on the discharge procedure was combined with quite unambiguous demands, concerning which the Commission is drawing up a follow-up report - not as a matter of choice, but because it is obliged to - and has to set out in clear terms what measures it has submitted in accordance with the motion for a resolution."
"Yesterday evening, amendments were tabled on what I would like to call the 'October option' question, and these now raise further issues."
"The Commission would therefore welcome it if these could be further clarified."
"Mr President, as we are political anoraks in the Committee on Budgetary Control and there are a lot more people listening to us tonight, I will try and explain to them what is going on because budgetary control and discharge are really not terms that normal people understand."
"One of the primary tasks of the European Parliament is to assess the way the Commission is functioning."
"We are here to make sure that the Commission carries out its work properly."
"Therefore when people say that the Commission is unelected, we can tell them that we keep the Commission under control and hold them to account."
"One of our formal responsibilities is to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget."
"We have to be able to account to the people who elect us and explain to them how their money is spent."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control is the principal committee responsible for leading this task on behalf of the European Parliament: we scrutinise budget lines, follow up potential scandals, we see how the money is being misspent and we try and find out why processes are so complex and cumbersome."
"It was the discharge procedure that ultimately led to the forced resignation of the Commission back in 1999."
"That is what started the whole process."
"However, there is a danger - we must not be naive about what is going on - that the whole process could be hijacked for more sinister and for more political motives."
"It has become almost established practice within the Committee on Budgetary Control to postpone the discharge and to ask for more information."
"That means that there are now three options."
"In the past there were two options: we could give or refuse discharge."
"Now, as Mr Bourlanges has explained, we can give, refuse or postpone discharge."
"It is much easier if we have only two options and that is what is being put to us today."
"The Commissioner has a point when she says that the Commission could probably comply more quickly."
"I do not see this October part-session as the date by which we have to have the answer."
"That is the latest point at which Parliament gives its decision."
"We do not have to stick to October, but we have to do it by October."
"That is a slightly different interpretation."
"It is clear that we all want to complete it before the summer."
"It is also right that the Commission should have this additional breathing space, because if Members refuse discharge and want to criticise the Commission, then it needs time to try to put things right."
"The new process will also ensure that the process does not go on and on."
"That is what has happened in the past. It is what happened in the 1996 discharge - it just carried on."
"We are giving you an end date, we are telling Parliament that by this time it has to decide one way or the other."
"That is why this system is much better."
"The situation is clearer and the process will not be hijacked for political aims."
"Mr President, the discharge procedure is one of the most important rights and duties of the European Parliament."
"Parliament must acquaint itself with how finances are being managed and establish whether the Commission has been doing its job properly."
"Parliament cannot therefore grant discharge without justification."
"Granting discharge means that the information received and obtained by Parliament indicates that the Commission has functioned properly."
"If there are points that need clarification that emerge later on, we can always return to them, even if discharge has been granted."
"The report proposes that a deadline be given for discharge."
"This is a good thing."
"A situation where discharge is still pending from one year to the next, as has been the case here in recent years, does not show a businesslike or responsible approach to administration."
"One problem is refusal to grant discharge."
"If discharge is not granted and a decision is taken on this, the reason is either malpractice or political distrust."
"Malpractice necessitates bringing charges against the authority or authorities concerned."
"If malpractice is not indicated, the accounts must be closed."
"If the reason for refusal of discharge is political, I think the Commission in that case should be forced to resign."
"The system that has now been outlined, according to which refusal of discharge would be followed by a vote on a motion for censure, is good but unclear."
"If there is a motion for censure against the Commission or a Commissioner but discharge is not granted, there is a contradiction in the system."
"The contradiction may be due to the fact that discharge can be refused by a simple majority but a motion for censure only by a qualified majority."
"For that reason this conflict should not in any sense be made possible."
"Mr President, Mr Martin has invested a great deal of time and effort in this report, for which I wish to express my utmost appreciation."
"The rapporteur and I also had some good discussions."
"The granting of discharge is Parliament's most important prerogative as a monitoring body when it comes to the assessment of how the budget has been managed by the executive - that is, primarily, by the Commission."
"This is a political act and not only the closure of the accounts, important as that is."
"Using the reports of the Court of Auditors and other information, some, incidentally, from the Commission itself, we look to see if the objectives set have been met with proper and economic use of the funds allocated."
"We highlight weak points in order that they may be rectified and also avoided in the forthcoming budget."
"Where the three discharge options, which the rapporteur has elucidated - grant, deferment, and refusal - are concerned, I think it right to specify time periods, so that there will not be two discharge procedures running in parallel, as often happened in the past, but so that one procedure is concluded before the beginning of the next, and so that the two stages can function."
"Mrs Schreyer, I believe that the timeframe is indeed sufficient - if the time taken up by the summer recess is included - for constructive solutions to be arrived at in due time."
"I have to tell the rapporteur that I cannot, however, accept that discharge should be deemed to have been granted if, in April, the plenary rejects a proposal from the Committee on Budgetary Control that it be deferred."
"Such a refusal may have contradictory motives behind it and does not express Parliament's unambiguous will."
"I might add that the Legal Service's opinion says the same thing."
"Granting discharge would be the wrong answer to the question put, and, for those to be given discharge, it would be a second-class discharge, being granted en passant."
"I would therefore have liked the proposal, in its three parts, to be sent back to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"Should the discrepancies between the resolution and the result of the vote, as described in paragraph 3 of the new Article 5a, occur, the Committee on Budgetary Control should be given the task of removing them and submitting the resolution to the plenary for a second time."
"However, as has already been mentioned, my group's amendments have been withdrawn."
"I must therefore rely on my own experience when I say, as I have done before, that, although there is in the report much that I can accept, I do not feel able to vote in favour of it if no other way is found of dealing with the issue of suspension and hence of the grant of discharge."
"Mr President, we have already had the opportunity to hear many of our fellow Members emphasise the importance of the discharge device in the context of the budgetary procedure and the powers of this Parliament, and so I shall refrain from repeating these words, but I should also like to say that great power must be matched by serious consideration and great moderation in its use."
"This is precisely the concern that brings us here and which led our rapporteur to find a way of setting a time limit for our examination of the Commission's financial management."
"I would say that, from this point of view, this is a legitimate concern and that the wording chosen is perfectly reasonable."
"In this debate, however, we cannot forget the fact that underlying the discharge procedure are aims that are very clearly expressed in Article 276 and, specifically, that the European Parliament is examining the accounts and the balance-sheet setting out the Community's assets and liabilities."
"And, in this context, we must bear in mind that the accounting and financial control systems of the European institutions, on the basis of which these accounts and balance-sheets are drawn up, must be totally exemplary and must strictly, fully and unequivocally comply with the highest international quality standards."
"This is one observation that we must take into account for the financial year that we are about to begin."
"Another observation to be emphasised is closely connected to the way in which the discharge has been undertaken in previous years, particularly the discharge for 1999, and concerns outsourcing."
"Mr Bourlanges is, as a matter of fact, the author of many of our references."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to stress the importance of this aspect."
"Mr President, at the Laeken Summit, the Heads of State or Government called for greater transparency, simplicity and comprehensibility in the European regulatory system."
"The Convention has tried to live up to this task, and has, among other things, set up a working group on the simplification of procedures."
"Today's report by Mr Martin again makes it abundantly clear just how urgently necessary it is that this group should exist and that it should produce a result."
"In 1999, as one of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I experienced first-hand the dilemma into which we were all plunged by the Rules of Procedure - or, as one should perhaps say, the Rules of Disorderly Business."
"At the time, the conduct of a number of Commissioners was unacceptable, discharge ought really not to have been granted, but, reasonably enough, we neither wanted nor were permitted to make scapegoats of the Commission as a whole."
"The problems of those days have been resolved by history - or probably, only by the honourable attitude of our present colleague Jacques Santer."
"It is evident, though, that we have not learned much from this."
"The system now proposed is no less complex than its predecessor."
"The present system is just as opaque as that which went before it, and if there were any need of proof of this, it has been provided by the events surrounding the efforts towards a compromise on this proposal."
"Goethe, that prince among poets, has his Faust say that he is driven mad by thoughts that seem to revolve in his head like a millstone: 'Mir wird von alledem so dumm, als ginge ein Mühlstein mir im Kopf herum'."
"I do not believe that we should inflict such headaches on our citizens in Europe - at any rate, not in the long term."
"All we can do, then, is to take on ourselves the task, here today, tomorrow and the day after, of finding a compromise and, in the Convention on the Future of Europe, to work out a model in accordance with which the public and their representatives understand what the political implications of discharge resolutions are and are meant to be."
"Mr President, it is indeed a fine thing to read out allegories and then say that the report is too complicated, moreover referring, as Mr Rack did, to the fact that one has seen the amendments."
"Of course, details are deceptive - as you, being an outstanding representative of the legal profession, will be well aware."
"It was in precisely such a decisive situation as this in which we found ourselves."
"Let us move more towards clarity, or towards what one might term the absence of intellectual doubt."
"Absurd though it might sound, I was wholeheartedly on Mrs Theato's side, and said that it really should be worked out with absolute clarity and utterly unambiguously, and that the third variant was to be left open."
"But that, Mr Rack, would have meant that the amendments would have been far more extensive, far more complex and much harder to understand."
"Hearing what we have heard from the Netherlands, and other positions, makes it possible, however, to live with a fellow-countryman saying that sort of thing."
"Please allow me to enlarge on two points, those made by Mrs Theato and by Commissioner Schreyer."
"Both refer to legal bases and to the Legal Service, both of which are sources of doubt."
"Of course we had to give ourselves safeguards on that, in order to have any chance of reaching a compromise, as we eventually did when we negotiated one with Mr Bourlanges and the Liberals' Mr Duff."
"One legal opinion is now being pitted against another, and that is something we will have to live with."
"I do think though that, as a whole, what we have worked out reflects this House's thinking, and it goes without saying, Mrs Theato, that I respect your attitude."
"I only hope there will not be too many who think as you do, as otherwise we will be back to the beginning."
"Those who want everything sorted out in the Convention will perhaps be happy with that."
"There is no more simple way, though, for us to put this together."
"We have to make a political statement - that is our task as MEPs, but the Rules of Procedure are not designed for that purpose."
"With that in mind, then, thank you again for your cooperation and support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report (A5-0310/2002) by Mr Stephen Hughes, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication: Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006 [COM(2002) 118 - C5-0261/2002 - 2002/2124(COS)]."
"Mr President, while my report welcomes the Commission's communication, it is also constructively critical in a number of important respects."
"The report emphasises three horizontal issues of great importance to the success of the strategy."
"First, the lack of an action plan."
"The strategy suffers from an unacceptable imbalance and a lack of strategic vision for follow-through."
"The initial analysis is basically good but the proposals for action are often little more than a description of an issue."
"Where they propose action, they are often vague, and there is virtually no indication of resources or the timing of the strategy's implementation."
"For example, the communication presents a good analysis of the changes being brought about by the increasing feminisation of society and the impact of an ageing population, but then proposes virtually nothing by way of action."
"The report therefore calls for an action plan with timing commitments against each major proposal, for such a plan to be endorsed by Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in time for the spring 2003 European Council and for it then to be subject to annual monitoring through the Social Agenda scoreboard, as advocated by the Council."
"Parliament and the advisory committees would also need to be involved in this monitoring process."
"This is a serious point and I know the Commissioner will be listening to it."
"I call upon her to give a clear indication tonight that there will be a positive response to this call."
"If not, I have a clear mandate to ask for this report to be referred back to committee, where it will be reformulated to reject the Commission's strategy."
"The second major horizontal issue is a lack of resources."
"In 1992, some 130 officials were working on occupational health and safety within the European Commission."
"Today, that number is down to around 24."
"We might disagree over the precise numbers but the Commissioner would agree there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of staff working in this area."
"This is not a basis for the kind of dynamic and proactive administration that would be required to implement the strategy, capable of responding to a changing policy environment while continuing to monitor and scrutinise the implementation of existing legislation and policy measures."
"It is essential that this trend is reversed and that adequate resources are allocated to this policy area within the Commission."
"The third major horizontal issue in the report highlights a lack of balance between legislative and non-legislative instruments."
"I am concerned that the development of non-legislative instruments should in no way be seen as an alternative to maintaining and improving Community legislation on occupational health and safety."
"Specific instances are given where the gaps and deficiencies in the existing legal framework need to be addressed and where comprehensive approaches to legislation, rather than ad hoc tinkering, will be important for both established and new risks."
"Turning to the specifics of the report, there is clearly not enough time to deal with them all, so I shall highlight only a few."
"First, the report makes the point that, given how much more problematic health and safety are in small and medium-sized enterprises, it is regrettable that the Commission has still not launched a multiannual SME programme based on the two years' preparatory action undertaken by the Bilbao Agency on the initiative of the European Parliament."
"Such a programme was supported by the Commission in the European Social Agenda endorsed at Nice."
"It would facilitate the testing, analysis and dissemination of successful measures in this critical sector."
"I very much hope the Commission will respond positively now."
"Second, in terms of emerging risks, I hope the Commission will look at the need for new laws in areas such as harassment at work, recently called for by Parliament."
"Equally, in relation to repetitive strain injuries, I hope it will revisit the display screen directive - the directive does not even mention the computer mouse - and the directive on manual handling."
"I hope it will go further and accept our call for a comprehensive directive on workplace ergonomics."
"The report also highlights a number of existing directives that are in need of revision."
"The Commission needs both commitment and resources to tackle that work."
"Reflecting the helpful opinion we received from the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, the report advocates the integration of a gender dimension throughout the strategy and highlights a number of specific strands of work to be tackled."
"The report also welcomes benchmarking, but it takes the view that a successful benchmarking approach will need not just more comparable and reliable data but also a harmonised system of definitions, recording and reporting of occupational injuries and diseases."
"My final point is that the report also welcomes the proposal to codify and simplify existing Community legislation in this field, so long as that is not coded language for deregulation for deregulation's sake."
"I am not accusing the Employment and Social Affairs Directorate-General of that, but there are forces elsewhere in the Commission that have that tendency."
"In committee I even went as far as to propose a joint amendment with Mr Bushill-Matthews saying that the review of the legislation should be used as an opportunity to promote the simplification of legislation and its repeal when it is redundant."
"None of us here should have an interest in maintaining redundant legislation, nor in making legislation complicated rather than as easy as possible to understand and implement."
"I hope the Commissioner can give us the assurance we need on this action plan."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Hughes and particularly the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their close cooperation."
"The communication entitled 'Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work for 2002-2006' is a strategy on health and safety for the period in question."
"It is a new strategy which includes some key new elements."
"These elements concern the quality of work and the need to combine a variety of different political instruments such as legislation, social dialogue, progressive measures and best practices, corporate social responsibility and economic incentives."
"Of course, the basis of the analysis is that health and safety issues are related to competitiveness and there is always a cost when we neglect social policies."
"The main points in this communication are as follows."
"Firstly, and I think this must be very clear, it is not just a proposal from the Commission, it is also a Community strategy, so there is a need to include all the European partners including, at political level, the European, national and regional authorities."
"At operational level, it concerns the social partners and, at the level of services, it concerns all institutions dealing with health, prevention services and insurance organisations."
"A very interesting point in this communication is the question how we can develop the prevention culture."
"There are, of course, a number of priorities concerning the need to reinforce our capacity for risk surveillance and the need for better legislation."
"I totally agree with the need for simplification and codification, which is one of the commitments in the Commission strategy."
"There is also a need for cooperation between the Commission and the national authorities as far as the implementation of the strategies is concerned and, at the same time, for cooperation at international level."
"I have tried to outline in a few words the main points of the communication, because I believe that responding to Mr Hughes' specific remarks will make for a more interactive debate."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs made some specific proposals, many of which the Commission has worked on and taken into account."
"Some of the proposals could perhaps be examined in greater depth."
"We could be more precise in terms of the timetables and description of the activities that must be carried out, and could do this in a meeting with the Committee on Employment, when we can discuss the activities and proposals of the strategy individually, particularly the five points referred to by Mr Hughes."
"Firstly, there is the issue of SMEs, which was raised in the report."
"You are aware of the problems we have with the SAFE programme."
"Thanks to Parliament we now have a specific budget in Bilbao for SMEs and we can discuss the details for implementing this project as well as the timetable."
"Regarding legislation on stress, an analysis has been undertaken."
"We have launched the first stage of consultation."
"Again, we can be more definite."
"The same applies to the proposal for a directive on workplace ergonomics and issues concerning the manual-handling directive."
"The analysis is under way."
"We can be specific about the timetables for the study and can make specific commitments on when and how we are going to launch the first stage of consultation."
"Next there is the issue of women: on that there is total agreement."
"Gender mainstreaming is a general principle in all actions in our strategy paper."
"As regards benchmarking, you are right that perhaps we could find a better way to enforce the procedure."
"The report specifically refers to the need to encourage Member States to use benchmarking in this area, but maybe we can discuss this together to see how it can be made more concrete."
"Perhaps we can discuss this with Member States and ask them to set firm objectives."
"Then we could have a report seeing what progress they are making."
"It cannot be an obligation - we cannot oblige Member States to do it - but maybe we could present it in a more organised way to see how benchmarking can move forward."
"Finally, I shall comment on simplification and codification."
"We are working on a total evaluation of health and safety legislation. This is one of the main commitments in the strategy."
"It is not an easy task but our final goal is to simplify the provisions, see whether they are consistent and then codify them."
"One commitment is to codify the health and safety directive."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I welcome the communication on this strategy for health and safety at work."
"I would particularly like to congratulate Mr Hughes on his report."
"As he said, I have been very pleased with the way that our committees have worked together on this issue and, in particular, the cooperation with the rapporteur which has ensured that the points made by the Committee on Women's Rights have been fully taken on board."
"This is important because, while men are more often the victims of serious accidents at work, women tend to suffer for longer periods of time from work-related illnesses."
"Adult women receive less vocational training and education than their male colleagues."
"That is why it is so important that we have a gender breakdown of statistics on work-related ill health and accidents for full-time, part-time and temporary employment."
"The Commissioner agreed that gender must be mainstreamed throughout this strategy so that issues such as the effect of the double workload of paid employment and personal responsibilities and issues such as harassment in the workplace are properly addressed."
"If risk assessment and workplace design fail to take gender into account, women will continue to be prevented from entering certain professions and sectors."
"An evaluation of current health and safety law is needed so that we can identify problem areas to make future legislation more effective."
"For example, domestic workers and home workers, many of whom are women, must be protected, as well as women in agriculture and spouses in family-run small businesses."
"I totally support the rapporteur in his comments on the lack of resources in the Commission to deal with health and safety policy and, in particular, the need for a detailed and costed action plan and a very strict timetable for improving legislation in this very important area."
"I support the report."
"Mr President, as is apparent from what the Commissioner said this evening, we rarely disagree with the Commission on the direction we should all take when we talk about the working environment."
"We are all of us concerned about the fact that far too many people receive lasting physical injuries in the course of their work."
"What perhaps is worse is that, in a long list of areas, there has in actual fact been no improvement in the working environment in the EU."
"It is against that background, Commissioner, that we had hoped that the Commission might have been more ambitious in its working environment strategy and, in any case, when it came to following this up."
"I had hoped that we might today have been able to obtain a promise of more than just timetables for the various activities."
"As the rapporteurs have emphasised, the situation in the area of the working environment is such that, since 1992, there have been swingeing cutbacks in the resources available to the Commission in this field."
"I am aware that there are different ways of doing the calculations, but the fact is that the money is not enough."
"We are concerned here with cutbacks at a time when problems in the working environment have become more complicated and extensive and when, as a matter of fact, we face new working environment problems."
"We must work with different tools, we must look into prevention and we must help the national authorities."
"There are many very complicated tasks that have to be carried out, and the challenges we face in terms of directives cannot adequately be described in a three-minute speech."
"As Mrs Evans has also pointed out, we know that working environment problems may be in danger of becoming problems for women."
"We know that small and medium-sized enterprises require special attention."
"There is an urgent need for a directive on the whole range of muscle and bone problems."
"Stress and harassment require concerted action, and we are also aware of the possible need for a general recognition of occupational illnesses in a minimum directive."
"In the light of all the initiatives we all consider necessary, what is probably our greatest disappointment is that the Commission does not intend to follow up this strategy with a proper action plan."
"When the Commission says that it would like to be involved in timetabling, our answer must be that timetables should be made still more binding, and we must propose that a proper action plan in actual fact be prepared."
"If the Commission agrees that we must have timetables and that we must make them more binding, it will hopefully - at the end of this debate in which there will presumably be more people demanding an action plan - explain to us why it does not go the whole hog, pursue this strategy further and draw up a proper action plan."
"We know, of course, that this would be more binding upon the European Parliament, the Commission and, especially, the Member States."
"I hope that we can make progress."
"We need an action plan covering the working environment."
"Mr President, although I welcome some of the points in Mr Hughes' report, especially the simplification of existing Community legislation and better monitoring, I am very unhappy that my amendments on comprehensive impact assessments did not pass in committee."
"My group agreed that I should table the amendments again in plenary but, unfortunately, no other group was prepared to open up the process."
"Legislation should only be brought forward when we demonstrate that there is a clear need for it, rather than best practice or the exchange of best practice."
"We must first make sure that existing legislation in the same field is being implemented across the European Union."
"Secondly, as I have already said regarding comprehensive impact assessments, we must have an impact assessment for each Member State, taking into account the impact on industry, on business and on the workforce."
"Unfortunately, quite often the impact assessments coming forward from the Commission look more like explanatory statements to me rather than comprehensive impact assessments."
"Above all, in health and safety we need to have up-to-date scientific and medical evidence to demonstrate the need for such legislation."
"Take the example of the vibrations directive."
"I was given a lot of documents by the Commission."
"The ISO standards report, the only one that was really up to date, actually said that there was no quantitative link between whole body vibration and lower back pain, but still we brought legislation forward."
"I am pro-European but we bring forward more and more legislation without demonstrating the actual need for it."
"This brings the European Union into disrepute."
"Although we may need some of the legislation Mr Hughes has proposed in his report and which the Commission has proposed, without a guarantee of a proper comprehensive and independent impact assessment, the ELDR Group will have to abstain on the vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, I am highly sympathetic to the content of Mr Hughes' report."
"The text is very clear."
"He is extremely worried that so little is happening, and he puts forward a long list of proposals of a legislative and non-legislative nature which could improve the situation."
"I am sure that he will gain the support of the whole Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left for all this."
"At the same time, he also addresses implementation and the difficulties of getting it all to work in reality."
"I believe we should speak more plainly in this context."
"This is in fact a dispute."
"We talk about dialogue and cooperation, but it is actually a dispute."
"Companies are required to put pressure on costs and profit margins in competition with other companies."
"The cutbacks have to be made somewhere."
"Health and safety cost money."
"We cannot achieve proper health and safety at work if the unions are not strong enough to put pressure on companies."
"These are the circumstances of the dispute, which are inherent in our system."
"We should recognise this in some way if we want better health and safety at work."
"Legislative and non-legislative methods work where there are employee organisations able to use the laws, recommendations and guidelines which we draw up."
"That is the reality of the situation."
"Perhaps we should discuss whether we need to strengthen employee organisations, for example by strengthening union rights."
"It may be that the opportunities for legal assistance in disputes should be increased."
"Increased expert assistance might be considered."
"In the nineteenth century, when there were no strong unions, factory inspectors helped workers."
"In Eastern Europe we might need work and factory inspectors of the type found in the UK in the nineteenth century."
"We should perhaps make it clearer to the candidate countries that the right to strike is part of the body of law, or acquis communautaire, which they are expected to introduce."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Hughes, the fact that sound reports are being produced is excellent, in my view."
"I particularly endorse Mr Hughes' report."
"I have heard him say once that in his opinion the analysis in the Commission communication was solid, but the actual detailing of it left something to be desired."
"I think I saw this in the EU reports today."
"In my view, the analysis is satisfactory, but certainly not solid, for the simple reason that there are far better practices in Europe than those described in this document."
"I am particularly concerned with the element of well-being at work."
"After all, legislation on health and safety at work is solid legislation."
"It is about vibrations, noise, and so on. Extensive research has been done in the Netherlands, for example, as to how well-being at work should be interpreted."
"This covers aspects that involve organisations, and aspects that can also have repercussions at a later date in the form of repetitive strain injury, stress or numerous other forms of non-well-being."
"A number of these elements have been mentioned in the Commission's document in connection with investing in quality, but this aspect came to an abrupt end with the indicators that were developed afterwards by the Belgians."
"It is regrettable that this area is not further elaborated upon, as the proposals are actually a kind of odd collection of various points."
"The clinical pictures and problems concerning well-being have been known for a long time, and yet no date has yet been set for these proposals."
"So once again, I endorse Mr Hughes' description of the problems, and I also hope that he may have the moral fibre to withdraw his report if the Commission is not committed to solving the problems surrounding the reduction in staffing levels, the balance between legislative and non-legislative measures - which, in my view, is still wanting - and, above all, the lack of an action plan with a timeframe to back it up."
"Mr President, the Commission document on health and safety at work is a good document."
"It talks of the importance of health and safety at work, of the need to strengthen the prevention culture and to secure a better application of existing law."
"I very much agree with all of that."
"It portrays the problem as follows: the preventive culture of EU directives has not yet been fully understood, nor has it been applied effectively on the ground."
"I agree."
"It admits that people tend to see the Community legal framework as being excessively complex and unclear and proposes that it be simplified and rationalised."
"I agree with that too."
"I would have hoped that Parliament might have seen fit to endorse these Commission proposals, but the rapporteur has gone off in the opposite direction."
"He claims that, because Commission staffing has been reduced to some 40% of its 1992 levels, this indicates much lower priority within the Commission."
"This is nonsense."
"However, for some people all roads always lead to the standard socialist solution of more money, more people and more regulation."
"I note the rapporteur graciously referred to the joint amendment we tabled, which was the great highlight in committee - perhaps it could be the highlight of his report."
"Colleagues may well hope this is the start of a great new partnership, but I suspect they may have to wait a little longer for it to blossom."
"We will hope together for progress."
"Meanwhile, the rapporteur wants to extend the scope of the framework directive to propose new legislation on workplace bullying and a new directive on workplace ergonomics, strengthen the display screen equipment directive and amend the manual handling directive."
"All that appears on just the first page of his recommendations."
"We do not need more directives."
"I suggest his conclusions are wrong because his analysis is wrong."
"The UK Conservative delegation will be voting against it and we will not be alone."
"I would add that Ireland has just voted to allow the entry of applicant countries into the EU."
"If the applicant countries read the Hughes report, they may not want to join."
"Mr President, I want to thank the Commission for a sound report."
"I also want to thank Mr Hughes for emphasising the importance of focusing upon implementation of the legislation."
"Danish employers often maintain that, unlike their opposite numbers in many other countries, they have to comply with the regulations governing the working environment."
"To be frank, I am tired of having to listen to this remark without being able in all honesty to contradict it."
"I should like to be able to repudiate such assertions in the future."
"That is why it is important for us to obtain more focus on the practical implementation of working environment legislation so that a good and safe working environment really is created at all workplaces in the EU."
"That being said, we must also give careful consideration to the type of regulation with which we can best make the working environment safe."
"Legislation is not always the correct route to go down."
"Sometimes, improvements are better achieved through training, the sharing of experiences and the development of the social dialogue."
"A good example is the combating of stress and harassment as problems that can only be solved through better cooperation in the individual workplace."
"That is why I also think that the combating of stress and harassment is a matter for the two sides of industry."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there is no disputing the fact that, along with the rules on free movement, health and safety at work is one of the European Union's spheres of activity that does not lack an unambiguous legal basis."
"The enactment of minimum requirements in this area is necessary in order to prevent, in this European internal market, competitive advantages from being won as it were on the backs of the workforce."
"In this sense, it is also laudable that the Commission is thinking about the future and setting out its primary areas of concern."
"As well stated in this report, women and people with disabilities should be the main areas of concern."
"I am, though, rather wary of efforts to interpret the law broadly and make every conceivable aspect of working life subject to European regulation."
"In this area, too, there must still be room for national peculiarities and independence."
"We are indeed facing great changes in working life in Europe."
"There are fewer and fewer employees in the traditional sense of the word."
"What are termed atypical working patterns are on the increase, and I also cannot rid myself of the suspicion that, in the absence of solutions to the real problems, we are increasingly churning out papers and declarations of intent that do workers at their actual workplaces precious little good."
"It seems to me to be a fact that - be it on the grounds of the oft-cited globalisation or of general developments in society - there is less protection for workers, the value of work as a factor of production is decreasing and the worker's need for protection is falling behind, whether despite European integration or because of it."
"Greater attention therefore needs to be given to the maintenance of the status quo as regards safety in actual workplaces."
"We have to maintain the level of protection that we have achieved and made into one of Europe's common assets; it must also be introduced in the candidate countries, not only on paper, but also in reality."
"Paper can hang around a long time, even, and indeed especially in Europe - we all know that."
"But the industrial safety that we have achieved is at the heart of the social dimension of a Europe that is becoming more integrated, something that I believe workers see as a far more positive development than papers on employment and other aspects of strategy."
"Mr President, of course we all want health and safety at work, employers, workers and shareholders."
"What good is it if we have health and safety but no work?"
"There is the problem and there is the challenge."
"There is an honourable tradition in the long campaign and struggle to achieve acceptable standards of health and safety in the workplace."
"This started way back with the industrial revolution."
"It freed children from hard manual labour in the mines and the mills, and to this day it protects workers against avoidable accidents and illnesses."
"And it is not over yet."
"Still there are unacceptable accidents on the farm and on the factory floor."
"Only last month on a farm next door to mine in Scotland, the young husband and father of a family died after being caught in a potato-harvesting machine."
"We must do all we can and continue to strive to eliminate all such tragedies."
"Our work and business culture must be a safety culture, but life and work can never be devoid of risk."
"There is no way we could achieve that utopia and still have a working economy, where men and women leave home each day for their workplace and thereby support their families and our economy."
"Be in no doubt that absurdly exaggerated restrictions and red tape will only kill off enterprise and the enterprises to which our constituents resort each day to make their living and provide the prosperity on which we all depend."
"The Commission has it very nearly right."
"Apply effectively the legislation we already have and encourage health and safety actions as good for business as well as for workers."
"Mr Hughes' report goes far too far."
"Its litany of exaggerated good intentions and its demand for yet more legislation risk the future of Europe's businesses, of our prosperity and our jobs."
"Mr President, although there are different opinions on this communication, I believe we can strike a balance."
"As I have said, this health and safety at work strategy is an action plan for the European Community as whole."
"So we have to take account of the differences between the Member States, their different laws and definitions, the Treaty, the legal basis and the constraints on the Commission's human resources budget."
"Attention has been drawn to the human resources cutbacks. But we have the Bilbao Agency."
"The Commission services and the Bilbao Agency have different terms of reference, but the Bilbao Agency provides support in the form of information, campaigns, analyses and studies."
"So there is very close cooperation."
"In any case, I cannot commit myself to more human resources, since you all know how difficult an issue that is."
"What we have proposed in this strategy is realistic and the Commission is able to carry it out with the existing resources."
"Now some specific comments."
"It is always assumed that the solution for any political issue is legislation."
"We do not automatically accept or rule out the need for legislation, we are just saying that, in many cases, the situation needs to be assessed to see whether such legislation is necessary."
"Mrs Lynne questioned whether this procedure was always right and whether the existing data or studies were necessarily sufficient to demonstrate the need for legislation."
"On the specific issue of vibration, there have been many different studies."
"We have received data from all the Member States proving there was a real problem."
"We shall be analysing it and then presenting proposals for any follow-up action."
"It is not just legislation."
"There are so many different issues in the Commission's text."
"Reference was made to quality."
"We have already started working with Eurostat on the harmonisation of at least the definitions in the various Member States."
"At the moment they define accidents differently, which sometimes causes confusion."
"We are therefore working towards harmonisation of the existing definitions."
"Then we have to work on concrete indicators. These are very specific and should be submitted according to a timetable."
"Benchmarking has been referred to."
"I spoke about that earlier."
"Partnership is one of the cornerstones of the whole concept."
"Under the strategy, each of the partners involved is required to present its own action plan."
"We have already received action plans from the social partners."
"Each Member State and each partner has to submit its own specific programme."
"We have already worked through the issues with the applicant countries, and there are concrete references and commitments concerning those countries as well."
"In conclusion, we can in future work together in cooperation with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to assess the potential for more precise commitments."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pérez Álvarez, and the Members of Parliament for their report and their support."
"This is an important proposal, designed as it is to ensure that all workers are protected in the workplace because, as Mr Álvarez has explained so well, and there is no need for me to repeat what he has said, workers cannot be treated differently depending on how their work is defined."
"The purpose of this initiative is to guarantee the same level of protection for self-employed workers and employed workers and it calls on the Member States to distinguish between three types of action."
"The first is to include self-employed workers within the scope of health and safety at work regulations, assuming, of course, that their national legal systems so allow."
"Secondly, it calls on the Member States to take the necessary measures so that self-employed workers can access information, training and technical support on risk prevention."
"The third element is that the Member States are called on to provide access to suitable health monitoring systems."
"It would appear that most of your amendments address situations where employed workers and self-employed workers work alongside each other and I agree that this sort of situation needs to be defined more clearly in the recommendation."
"The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 11 and will make every effort to ensure that the Council does likewise."
"The Commission does not agree with Amendments Nos 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 15 because they are either included in other amendments or call for certain binding legal arrangements which prejudge the efficacy of the recommendation during its first four-year pilot application."
"The Commission feels that this proposal is an important step towards ensuring that legislation benefits all Europeans, irrespective of their type of work, a step towards the final objective of reducing accidents at work and occupational illnesses."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Pérez Álvarez for an incisive and thoughtful report."
"The application of health and safety legislation to self-employed workers is an important subject, not least because of the ever-growing number of self-employed, subordinated, sub-contracted or atypical workers."
"The creation of false forms of independence and self-employment can put workers who are in an employment situation beyond the framework of protection."
"That is something we need to address."
"This is something that the Commission recognises and, working together, as Mr Pérez Álvarez has said, we have tried to do something about it over the years."
"The extension of working time protection to road transport personnel in the directive, agreed at the end of last year, will cover owner-drivers, but only because parallel legal bases covering occupational health and safety on the one hand, and operational safety on the other have been used."
"As Mr Pérez Álvarez has pointed out this evening, the issue was also tackled in the framework of the directive on temporary and mobile work sites, but in a fairly limited way."
"We therefore needed a more comprehensive approach and this recommendation may prove to be a useful contribution."
"But other actions are possible, such as the more general extension of health and safety legislation to the self-employed suggested in Mr Pérez Álvarez's Amendment No 4."
"I know the Commission has difficulty with that."
"The Commissioner will say that the legal base in Article 137 will not permit this."
"But, if the recommendation does not have a positive impact, then we will all collectively need to come back together to reconsider the legal bases that are available to us and maybe take the route suggested in Mr Pérez Álvarez 's Amendments Nos 7 and 22."
"If not, imagine the sort of problems we face in relation to, for example, the proposed directive we are currently considering on protection of workers from risks related to exposure to asbestos at work."
"We have massive amounts of asbestos hidden in our workplaces, homes, schools and hospitals."
"Many people with employment contracts will handle it and, if they work for a demolition, removal or transportation company, they will be covered."
"But a whole army of self-employed workers are also exposed to asbestos, in particular the electricians, plumbers and carpenters who come across it while doing maintenance work."
"They will be predominantly self-employed."
"It is also true that, even if we had a tenfold increase in the number of inspectors, they could not inspect this whole army of self-employed people at work."
"They need to be able to take responsibility for themselves."
"They need the information, the support and training to understand the risks they run if they take short cuts."
"The recommendation is a very useful contribution in that respect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Pérez Álvarez. Thank you for this sound report."
"I should above all like to focus on one element in this report in which reference is made to the Commission's approach, which has been relatively cautious so far."
"The topic is labour relations."
"Everyone knows that they change at an incredible rate, and when I say an incredible rate, I mean an incredible rate."
"As has been mentioned by different people, these encompass non-typical work of different kinds, and include temporary staff, the self-employed, the self-employed without staff, the spurious self-employed etc., a large number of whom attend the workplace to work."
"This is not only important for the workers' own health, safety and well-being, but also for that of those indirectly involved."
"In other words, changes do need to be made, particularly if you consider current legislation in the different countries and realise that some countries include the self-employed in their occupational health and safety legislation to some extent, while other countries do not at all."
"The Commission has opted for a recommendation."
"I would have preferred a stronger instrument, with immediate effect."
"The reason is simple: we can accept the fact that a kind of evaluation is planned in four years' time and better measures will follow if need be, but on the other hand - and I should like to come back to this in connection with the previous topic - at what stage is the enforcement of this legislation monitored?"
"In the workplace and, if you are lucky, by labour inspectorates."
"This inspection is often inadequate, however."
"The most forceful impact is exercised by employers' organisations, trade unions in the workplace, works councils or other consulting organisations."
"They carry out this work, and without legislation they have no leg to stand on."
"Relations between employers and employees at the workplace are being completely overlooked here."
"This is of crucial importance, and this is why tougher legislation will be needed in this area in due course."
"Mr President, perhaps the most surprising thing about this is that in the committee vote it was only passed by 36 to 1."
"I would have thought that anything like this would automatically have got unanimity in committee."
"It is quite revealing also that it is only a recommendation."
"As the Commissioner will know from the 'falls from heights' directive, it was pretty clear that we needed a very strong political message to cover the self-employed."
"It is not only the construction industry that suffers from accidents every day of the week."
"For instance, the interpreters in the booths around us, who are often self-employed and have to work under very stressful conditions, are the very people we would expect to receive Community protection under Community law."
"You know very well that the European institutions abstain from introducing any of those laws to cover many of their staff, so we will not go down that path."
"There is no doubt that by recommending Community health and safety legislation for the self-employed we have taken a giant step forward."
"We should no longer rely on national statistics which tell us that accidents only happen to full-time employees."
"That is clearly ridiculous."
"You might - if you are a Christian - call a it sin that so many people involved in industries, just because they are considered self-employed, do not enjoy the protection they deserve."
"Mr Pérez Álvarez has spent a long time discussing health and safety in this Parliament."
"I am very pleased that he has taken on this report, because I know the commitment we need from all sides of the House."
"It is vital for the self-employed to be included in any health and safety and employment legislation that emanates from the Commission and this House."
"Everyone in Europe must enjoy the same level of protection."
"Mr President, a survey carried out by the Bilbao Institute shows in actual fact that the self-employed suffer occupational accidents, including fatal ones, more frequently than are those who are employed."
"We also know that there is very considerable under-reporting of accidents involving the self-employed."
"A survey in Britain reveals, for example, that only 5% of accidents involving the self-employed are reported, compared with half of those involving wage earners."
"It is also the case that the self-employed are more vulnerable to occupational accidents than wage earners because of their limited resources and perhaps because they do not have to comply with the health and safety provisions."
"The Commission must therefore be commended for raising the issue."
"Clearly, such non-compliance must be brought to an end."
"The self-employed must not be able to freewheel when it comes to the EU rules on the working environment."
"We should, however, have liked the Commission to have looked at some of the amendments that try to make the recommendations more binding."
"I am aware that there is no basis in the Treaty for doing this."
"If we are now all agreed that there is a problem in its not being possible for the self-employed to be covered by the legislation governing the working environment, is it not then time we tried to change the Treaties?"
"Perhaps the Commission should be called upon to table a proposal on the subject to the Convention that is currently at work."
"Mr President, Mr van Hulten, honourable Members, I would like to start by again thanking Parliament for its intensive and efficient cooperation on the recast financial regulation for the European Budget."
"It was only the degree to which all the institutions were committed to working together that made it possible for the new financial regulation to be adopted unanimously by the Council on 25 June 2002."
"The new financial regulation forms a fundamental part of the reform of the Commission, and I am proud of our having achieved this feat of strength in 2002."
"I would like to re-emphasise my most especial thanks to Mr van Hulten and Mr Dell'Alba, the latter of whom is not here, but I would like to take this opportunity to mention him again."
"One of our main concerns in the recasting of the financial regulation was that it should be simplified by incorporating the very detailed provisions in the rules for implementation, which are to be adopted even before the end of the year in order that they may enter into force on 1 January 2003, that is, at the same time as the new financial regulation."
"Together with the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr van Hulten has done very thorough work, for which I thank you most warmly."
"Speaking on behalf of the Commission, I have the following to say concerning the individual amendments."
"Firstly, many of the report's amendments are aimed at incorporating all the reports and items of information to be transmitted to the budgetary authority in an annex summarising the annual activity reports of the authorising officers whose offices administer resources."
"The Commission favours such a tightening-up of the procedures."
"It is proposed in the report, with reference to the summary of the annual activity reports of the authorising authorities, that the requirement that such a summary should be submitted to the discharge authority should apply not only to the Commission, but also to the other institutions."
"The aim underlying this is one that I share, but the wording of the financial regulation does not permit us to impose such an obligation on other institutions, which in our view would have to agree to it."
"Secondly, amendments are proposed in the report relating to the financial actors named in the financial regulation, and these amendments have two aims in view: a) that the budgetary authority be informed when the authorising authorities - at A1 level - and the accounting officer change, and b) that the posts of accounting officer and internal auditor be advertised externally."
"It therefore follows that the budgetary authority will be informed of new appointments."
"We are unable, however, to go along with the report's proposal, and, moreover, immediate external advertising would be contrary to the Statute, which expressly provides for posts to be, in the first instance, trawled within the institutions, before they can be advertised externally."
"This means that immediate external advertising would not be compatible with the Statute."
"Thirdly, as regards the amendments on the panel on financial irregularities, we can agree to the proposal that one of the panel's members should be an independent expert."
"However, we see the mandatory investigation of irregularities even in unimportant cases as going too far."
"Fourthly, as regards the directive on late payment, I note Parliament's reminder that the deadline for implementation has expired and that the institutions must, or at any rate should, abide by the rules on interest rates and deadlines applicable to late payment."
"Fifthly, I am, in addition, able to agree to several amendments on accounting practice."
"In particular, the Commission agrees to the clarification regarding the introduction of an integrated data processing system, which is entirely in line with its own earlier proposals."
"As regards the demand for the drawing up of a list of all persons with the right of access to the electronic accounting system and the creation of an audit trail clearly showing what changes have been made to the system and by whom, I am able to inform you that the Commission is already in possession of both of these."
"We welcome the incorporation of this provision into the rules for implementation, although I am at the moment unable to give you any information as to whether these conditions are already being complied with by the accounting systems of institutions other than the Commission."
"My sixth point is that, in Amendment No 17, you demand that the budgetary authority should be informed of all waivers of recovery of debt in excess of EUR 100 000."
"The Commission will take this on board as well."
"Let me conclude with another clarification relating to the final amendment in the report."
"This reads: 'The accounts for the 2002 financial year shall be drawn up and presented in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation of 1977, except for the obligation to submit these to the Financial Controller.'"
"I will point out now that it was made clear in the new financial regulation that there will be a transitional period up to the 2005 financial year for the clearance of accounts, meaning that, until 2005, the clearance of accounts shall follow the procedure laid down in the financial regulation as at present valid."
"In view of the fact that the only Member States so far to have largely gone over to accrual accounting - a system of accounting of a rather more Anglo-American stamp - is Great Britain, where it took over seven years to introduce it, the timetable for the Commission continues to be ambitious in the extreme."
"I repeat my offer to inform the Committee on Budgetary Control as soon as possible concerning the proposals that the Commission has made here."
"Mr President, if this debate was scheduled at this time because of the Conference of Presidents' suspected interest in the subject matter, they were probably right."
"It is not a very exciting topic to be discussing but, as we all know, it is very important or we would not be here."
"I have to say it is a shame that two of the three committee members who voted against the report in committee and, therefore, triggered a debate in plenary, are not here today to explain their objections to the report."
"I would like to thank the committee members who supported me in drawing up this report and giving it near unanimous backing in committee."
"Thanks are due also to the Commission for the excellent cooperation we have again had on this report."
"Many of the amendments contained in the committee's report are technical in nature. I am not going to go into that."
"I just want to mention a few substantive issues the Commissioner also raised."
"The report deals with a number of points where we feel the implementing rules could be strengthened."
"The first concerns weaknesses regarding the appointment and functioning of senior financial actors, something which has been an issue for the last few months."
"There have been several instances of transfers or terminations of duties involving directors-general and there has been the case of the accounting officer, Mrs Andreasson."
"The issues raised are being dealt with by the committee and assessed on their own merits."
"However, issues of form have also arisen concerning how such appointments, transfers and terminations are dealt with within the Commission."
"We would like to see certain safeguards built into the Financial Regulation."
"Safeguards, not in the sense that you can be sure mistakes will never be made or problems will never occur, but safeguards that introduce more transparency to ensure that the process is visible and that we are not faced with surprises and faits accomplis."
"This involves the appointment of senior officers, something to which you referred, Commissioner."
"I will request that a report be submitted to the budgetary authority and that the accounting officer and internal auditor be appointed on the basis of a vacancy notice in the Official Journal."
"They should be external candidates, where necessary on limited-term contracts."
"I realise that we cannot change the Financial Regulation but we must take the matter up in the Staff Regulations, because it is an important point."
"Secondly, there is the question of the financial irregularities panel, which is designed to fill a gap in the existing set-up and introduce new expertise."
"What we want to avoid is a system where peers are assessing peers."
"The introduction of an independent external element is, therefore, important, and I welcome the fact that you have accepted that proposal."
"Thirdly, there is the matter of improving the quality and integrity of the computerised accounting system, something you also mentioned."
"We want a single integrated computer system, with access restricted to a list of authorised persons to be kept by the institution."
"I realise that the Commission is already doing this, and it is important the other institutions should be required to follow."
"Finally, we want to see an easy-to-read audit trail maintained, to ensure adequate control of expenditure."
"The final point I want to mention is late payments and the need to bring commercial payments in line with the relevant directive."
"I am sure my colleague, Mr Casaca, who has worked hard on this, will have something more to say."
"Three amendments have been tabled in plenary in addition to the ones from the committee."
"One by the PPE-DE Group and two by the GUE/NGL Group, none of which I support."
"The PPE-DE is retabling an amendment that was rejected in committee, proposing to create a fully independent accounting officer with no lines of accountability and responsibility within the Commission."
"I cannot support that because it contradicts the Financial Regulation itself, in relation to which these are implementing rules."
"Nor is there any point in creating an isolated island within the institution, which would go against the whole principle of accountability."
"Great formal power does not necessarily mean better decision-making, as we know."
"With regard to the amendments by the GUE/NGL Group, I can agree in spirit with Amendment No 34 on the need for the accounting officer to have full information, but in practice it would lead to a huge bureaucracy, with 600 000 payments going through one single person."
"Although not the aim of the amendment, it would certainly lead to unnecessary bureaucracy."
"The second amendment concerns the proposal on the criteria to be taken into account in the event of a waiver of recovery of an established debt."
"There are two criteria: one on competition and one on economic and social damage caused by a debt if it is recovered."
"The GUE/NGL Group wants to scrap this possibility for authorising officers."
"The amendment we have introduced and which you have just accepted, introducing a reporting requirement to Parliament, offers sufficient safeguards."
"To conclude, I think these amendments strengthen the proposal and I call on the Commission to incorporate them all into the final text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what would a regulation such as the EU's Financial Regulation be without rules for its implementation?"
"Obviously, it would be worthless or impracticable and incapable of being implemented, for, in the aftermath of our sustained work, in committee and in plenary, on a recasting of the Financial Regulation, here, hot on its heels, comes the regulation on the rules for implementation."
"Why do I lay such emphasis on this?"
"I do so because I think we are giving another example of how legislation is evidently insufficient, but needs further elaboration."
"That does not help European law to be clear, simple or comprehensible."
"Perhaps, though, this wide-ranging creativity in legal matters does indeed contribute towards legal veracity, by which I mean the application of laws currently in force."
"It is with reference to this that I ask the Commissioner responsible for these matters to act in accordance with the law and not follow the example of the President of the present Commission, who simply describes current laws - such as the Stability Pact - as stupid and fails to apply them."
"The fact that the degree to which public has confidence in this Europe of ours is largely dependent on the Financial Regulation and on the rules for its implementation means that these are not in any way suited to being played about with in this way. Such confidence is damaged by the Commission's thoughtless and arrogant way of acting or failing to act; among other things, it has obviously neglected to ensure that its accounting system is reliable and proof against manipulation."
"That is also precisely why it is so important that the so-called accounting officer should be in a clearly defined and independent position."
"The Commission having, unfortunately, been so irresponsible as to abolish the independent financial controller, the accounting officer will acquire even greater importance."
"He must be able to get his hands on additional information with absolute independence, suspend payments, and criticise people in prominent positions, without being removed from office and subjected to disciplinary proceedings or something of that sort."
"I therefore ask you to support my group's Amendment No 33, and also the other two amendments tabled by Mr Blak, which are also intended to enhance the clarity and transparency of the law."
"We must not allow large margins of appreciation in budgetary law."
"Mr van Hulten, I am not surprised at your lack of support for Amendment No 33."
"The arguments you adduce here are the same as in committee, but their constant repetition does not render them any more effective."
"We must, in these matters, avoid the least suspicion of decisions being arbitrary or partisan, for only in this way can the Commission disabuse people of their impression that a more lenient standard is applied to the handling of European funds than applies to the handling of national funds."
"Incidentally, I greatly regret the fact that Parliament has needlessly allowed itself to be put under pressure of time in dealing with these rules."
"I do not know why we have not waited for the European Court of Auditors to give its opinion, but perhaps the rapporteur, in his great wisdom, will be able to give me an answer on that."
"Mr President, I should like to place this debate in a political context: ultimately, we are in the European Parliament, which is supposed to be the most representative political body, and the one in closest contact with the citizens."
"The use of the financial resources available to the European Union is probably the most complex but equally the most attractive duty that falls to the Community institutions."
"The structure of the budgetary authority as defined in the Treaties, and the still inadequate role in budgetary policy allotted to Parliament require and justify particular attention to the control and monitoring of budgetary implementation."
"The truth is that the monitoring of budgetary implementation can only be effective and useful if it is underpinned by principles of transparency and clarity and is supported by rules that are at once ambitious and simple."
"This is clearly the aim of the new financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities, which will enter into force on 1 January 2003, and, specifically, the aim of the new implementing rules proposed by the Commission."
"The wording used by Mr van Hulten for these rules, without undermining the essence of the Commission proposal, enriches the control and monitoring procedure to an extraordinary degree, making it more comprehensible and straightforward, in other words, it significantly steps up control of the efficiency of Community expenditure."
"The current budgetary framework is acknowledged to be a precarious one, which does not respond fully to the Union's political priorities."
"Consequently, and in the absence of a revision of the financial perspective that could increase the volume of resources available to the European Union, it is becoming mandatory for the European Parliament to make full use of all its competences and prerogatives."
"The European Parliament will only make full use of these prerogatives and competences if it is able to intervene politically within an administrative framework that is sufficiently dynamic and stabilising but, above all, comprehensible and effective."
"The principles of unity and universality enshrined in the rules contained in the new regulation - albeit in embryonic form - and which the rapporteur strengthens, as well as the status conferred on internal hearings at the initiative of the rapporteur for each institution are, in my opinion, extremely important and significant steps forward."
"The report by Mr van Hulten whom I welcome and congratulate personally, therefore deserves the support of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr van Hulten has done some excellent work in reforming the Financial Regulation and this report is also an excellent example of that."
"My sincerest thanks go to him accordingly."
"The reform of the Financial Regulation began with the report in 1999 by the external committee of experts commonly known as the Five Wise Men."
"The report mentioned the importance of both simplifying financial administration and clarifying personal accountability."
"Parliament and the Council approved the new Financial Regulation last spring and it comes into force from the beginning of next year."
"The reform is partly linked to the Commission's administrative reform."
"The rules for implementation now being discussed are connected with this new Financial Regulation."
"The reform would mean an end to the old ex ante control with responsibility moving away from financial administration to be borne entirely by the authorising officer."
"This change will mean an increase in their power and responsibility."
"Because authorising officers are the officials with the most important executive role they must be fully accountable for their actions, and cannot take refuge behind the backs of others."
"With accountability hopefully becoming clearer, we can also increase efficiency, as at present, for example, delays in making payments in the Commission are too long and do not in any way match the sort of efficiency we see in the world of business."
"The system now to be decided on must not be spoilt by new amendments."
"For that reason, Amendments Nos 33 and 34, for example, are not acceptable, as they would allow for responsibility for execution to be shared once again by two people, the authorising officer and the accounting officer."
"The system has to be clear and transparent."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Financial Regulation currently under discussion is likely to apply for many years to come."
"It is therefore crucial that its provisions for implementation are as clear as possible."
"The new Financial Regulation should not only lead to efficient handling but also better supervision than was previously the case."
"When supervision and operation are handed over to the various directorates-general, they must be monitored effectively."
"It is therefore vital that the accounting officer has a strong and independent position."
"We have proposed an amendment in this vein."
"The accounting officer must be able to demand and receive more information, stop payments in cases of doubt and report directly to the highest level."
"With this in mind, we would also like to express our regret that Parliament has not taken this opportunity to investigate the confusion in this area which has existed for years."
"This should have been carried out by summoning Mrs Andreasen to appear before the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The fact is that we have still not received full answers on the approval of the Commission's accounts for 2001."
"My political group has also proposed an amendment limiting the Commission's ability to write off and write down liabilities."
"There must be clear grounds for writing off liabilities so that we do not see more cases like the Flechard case, where the person responsible for a serious error is not forced to accept the full consequences of their action."
"This explains our second amendment."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Schreyer, if we are to take the Commission at its word when it makes these statements, then the new Financial Regulation is leading us into a new era of financial management, in which we will be able to resolve the problems of the past."
"We will simply have to wait and see."
"What we can, unfortunately, see at the present time is that the new era is being ushered in by the weakening of Parliament's rights."
"The new Financial Regulation's rules of implementation, should, according to previous rules, have been decided on in agreement with Parliament."
"In law, the Commission is no longer obliged even to listen to Parliament."
"Of course, Mrs Schreyer, we welcome the way that you are doing that any way, as these rules of implementation do not apply to the Commission alone, but are in future to be applicable to all the EU institutions."
"Let me pick out a number of points on which we should be asking the Commission to think again, if not to make improvements."
"Take the accounting officer: according to this proposal, the institutions have to select their accounting officers from the ranks of the civil service."
"Applications from outside will not be possible."
"This means that we are in fact spoiling our opportunities for even considering external candidates."
"You have told us, Mrs Schreyer, that the Statute prevents this."
"Let me turn to the accounting officer's functional independence, on which depends the reliability and credibility of the figures we have to present to the public in their capacity as contributors to the European Union."
"The draft has nothing to say about this."
"Why do you not give the accounting officer a right of appeal against attempts at interference in his work, as you have to the internal auditor?"
"There are other aspects that cause me concern; one example is the so-called panel on financial irregularities."
"I hope that is not meant to compete with OLAF or even interfere with its work."
"Conflicts of interest are given a comprehensive and appropriate definition in the Financial Regulation, but the rules of implementation make it look as if this can be simply evaded."
"Finally, Article 84's provisions on the waiver or claims open the door to waiving the recovery of debts."
"It will be the European taxpayer who will have to cough up for these decisions, by paying additional contributions."
"Thanks are due to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, for the speed with which he has worked under enormous pressure of time."
"Mr President, the rapporteur on the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation has presented many good proposals, but I would like to say right at the outset that we should avoid giving the impression that the last Commission's downfall was due to a bad financial regulation and the rules for its implementation."
"It is my belief, Commissioner, that such would be a false assessment and would lead us into renewed disaster."
"It was far more a matter of culture."
"If, on the one hand, you are saying that the amendment of the Financial Regulation and the rules associated with it is one of the most ambitious tasks involved in the reform of the Commission, then I have to say that you cannot be aiming very high!"
"You tell us that the reason we cannot have external candidates for the post of accounting officer is that there is a Statute that says so."
"I ask you!"
"If the Commission cannot even alter a Statute, how does it think it is going to govern the EU?"
"Surely one of the first things that the executive should be able to do is to change the rules governing its own staff!"
"That, Commissioner, is just not acceptable!"
"Perhaps you are putting the cart before the horse."
"In my judgment, this is about changing the culture."
"That was possible under the old rules, and will also be possible under the new ones."
"When, for example, I study reports, as I have done in connection with the whole Eurostat business, in which you looked on and you continued to spend European taxpayers' money on employing firms that, to your own knowledge have demonstrably deceived and cheated you, I do not know, Commissioner, whether this renewed culture, under the banner of zero tolerance, the idea with which we started out in 1999, has actually gained a foothold yet!"
"Mr President, I wish to use this minute to congratulate the rapporteur on the magnificent work he has produced to date, which leaves us an extremely positive legacy, but which also commits him to the future and requires him, in the implementation of this regulation and specifically in all aspects concerning the accounting system that will be implemented, to respond as effectively as he has done in the case of the Financial Regulation."
"I wish to say to Commissioner Schreyer that I have listened closely to everything she said, especially her approach to one of the points that I believe to be crucial: the issue of the directive on payments, which is included in this implementing regulation."
"I believe this to be an extremely positive point and I wish, therefore, to congratulate the Commission, but there is no doubting that the great challenge is to see how this regulation will be implemented, both in the accounting system and in the financial management system."
"With regard to this challenge, we will be here to assess the Commission's action."
"Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to return to some of the points that have been made."
"Let me first put something straight."
"The Court of Auditors may have had many criticisms to make of various accounting rules and of the system itself, but it always used to confirm that the completed accounts were a true and faithful record of income and expenditure."
"Turning, secondly, to the question of the accounting officer's role, I am also grateful for the clarifications that have been given today."
"The accounting officer carries out the orders of the authorising authority, and the accuracy of the accounting system is his responsibility, but he is not the financial controller."
"On the contrary, it is important that financial management and accounting should be kept as separate tasks, and that the bookkeeper should not be involved in the management of funds' resources."
"That is not his job, nor should it be; on the contrary, it is for him to keep the books properly."
"This separation of the functions is important."
"As far as the external advertisement of posts is concerned, the Statute - which, as you will be aware, is laid down by the Council - governs the sequence of events involved in recruitment."
"It does not prevent posts being externally advertised."
"It is the stages that we are dealing with here."
"I must, though, reiterate that the Financial Regulation stipulates that the accounting officer shall be an official of the Commission."
"Why is that the case?"
"It is of course because this person opens accounts for the European institutions, which means that he or she is in a position of trust."
"That being so, one cannot but wonder whether the concealment of important facts in a job application could justify this position of trust."
"It has been urged that the rules on accounting procedures should be clear."
"In the past, of course, we had very clear and simple rules, in that the entire public accounting system was based on what, in Germany, we term cameralistic accounting, in which the cash spent and the cash books - the actual outgoings and the actual receipts - are compared with what is in the budget."
"That is, of course, also the way in which the Commission and other offices administering public expenditure are accountable to the body which legislates on the budget."
"They want us to tell them how much of any given budget line they have voted has actually been spent on it."
"This accounting system will of course continue to play a part in the future, but this information is now no longer adequate for the purposes of management."
"For that, we need more information in the accounting system."
"The Commission has therefore proposed, and the legislature has so decided, that we should go further along this Anglo-American road towards a system of accrual accounting, containing more rules and information specific to management functions."
"We will, however, have another opportunity to discuss these issues."
"Let me repeat that I would be more than happy to talk about these issues in the Committee on Budgetary Control, but, at this late hour, I will just thank Mr van Hulten again for the report and congratulate him on it."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Preparatory work for the European Council in Brussels on 24-25 October"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparatory work for the European Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 October 2002."
"- (DA) Mr President, I have been asked to make a statement entitled 'Preparation for the European Council meeting in Brussels on 24-25 October 2002'."
"This meeting will play a central role in further work during the Danish Presidency."
"As we know, the agenda will be dominated by the important topic of enlargement and also, in this connection, the subject of Kaliningrad, in which the European Parliament has of course taken a great interest."
"The outcome of the meeting will be of great importance as regards the possibility of realising the common goal of concluding enlargement negotiations with up to 10 countries."
"Therefore, the important thing is for the European Council to reach as many decisions as possible, so that as little as possible remains to be done in Copenhagen."
"It is true that what remains could be really tough going."
"At the European Council meeting, the Chairman of the Convention will inform the European Council of the status of the Convention's work, and the President of the European Parliament will also speak to the European Council."
"Let me start with the latter."
"The meeting with the President of Parliament has become an established tradition which I know is valued highly by Heads of State and Government in the European Council."
"Bearing in mind the agenda before us, it will of course be particularly interesting to hear the views of the President of Parliament on the issues the Council will be discussing, that is, enlargement, and also the related subject of Kaliningrad, which I shall come back to."
"It is very convenient that the discussion with the President of Parliament is taking place immediately before the working meetings on enlargement and Kaliningrad."
"In addition to the contribution of the President of Parliament, it is of course our hope that the meeting, including the opportunity to exchange information and ideas for use in further work, will prove beneficial to the President of Parliament and Parliament as a whole."
"I now wish to say a little about enlargement."
"It is strongly to be hoped that decisions will be taken in Brussels on a number of very important subjects that could pave the way for enlargement."
"It must be decided which of the candidate countries will be able to conclude accession negotiations this year."
"The starting point will be the Commission's progress reports on the individual candidate countries and the Commission's strategy paper on enlargement as a whole, which was presented on 9 October by Commissioner Verheugen, who is also present here."
"On the basis of a comprehensive evaluation of the progress of each individual candidate country, the Commission concludes that 10 countries will be able to meet all the criteria by the start of 2004, and on that basis it is recommended that accession negotiations be concluded as planned here this year."
"At its meeting in Copenhagen, the European Council will also discuss those candidate countries which are not expected to be able to conclude negotiations this year (Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey), with a view to making decisions on the further course of the accession process for these countries."
"Decisions are also to be taken in Brussels on the outstanding issues in the accession negotiations in connection with the financial package."
"There was agreement on the institutional issues at the General Affairs Council yesterday, and the European Council will amongst other things lay down, as part of the financial package, the total amount to be allocated to enlargement, candidate countries' participation in the common agricultural policy, including their share of direct income support, and the total aid from the cohesion and structural funds to the candidate countries."
"The European Council should also take a decision on the matter of the net position of the candidate countries in relation to the EU budget, and agreement has been reached as to the basis for these calculations."
"The debate on these subjects to date has shown that it will not be easy to reach agreement."
"The European Council in Seville concluded that the EU's positions concerning the outstanding, financially onerous, chapters will be presented to the candidate countries at the beginning of November."
"That means that the Brussels European Council must take decisions on these matters if the timetable laid down in Seville is to be met."
"The Danish Presidency will insist on this, and so the meeting must go on until a solution has been found."
"As I have said, we can expect it to be very difficult."
"It will require a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone concerned, but a solution must be found."
"In addition, Kaliningrad will be discussed, and on this point, too, significant progress was made at yesterday's meeting in Luxembourg, from which both Mr Verheugen and myself have just returned."
"The matter was discussed in Seville: the Commission was asked to study the possibilities for an effective and flexible solution to the question of transit; a solution which would be in conformity with the acquis and would have the agreement of the candidate countries concerned."
"The Commission submitted its communication on 18 September."
"This has been discussed twice in the Council, and it was also discussed here in Parliament only last week, on 15 October."
"Together with the Commission, the Presidency has held a series of talks with Russia and consulted Lithuania, in particular, which is the candidate country most affected."
"Over and above the principles on which the Seville mandate was based, the EU has emphasised Lithuania's sovereign right to control its borders and to reserve the right to refuse entry."
"Furthermore, it has been laid down that a solution must not hinder or delay Lithuania's full membership of Schengen."
"The Council has agreed to give Lithuania a guarantee in that respect, and ultimately the Council agrees that Lithuania must be compensated for any additional expense arising from a solution to the transit question."
"Russia has pressed home its desire to obtain the right to visa-free transit by train through Lithuania."
"This is a solution which entails many problems of a technical, economic, legal and political nature. The EU has not, however, ruled out examining the possibility, and the Presidency will continue to work towards a solution which satisfies all parties to the greatest possible extent and can win the support of the European Council."
"The guidelines I mentioned here were followed at yesterday's General Affairs Council in Luxembourg."
"Agreement was reached yesterday on making the provision I referred to: that Lithuania must be able to become a member of Schengen at the same time as the other candidate countries if it wishes; and it does."
"This is the EU's position, and it seems to me, therefore, that the 15 governments have prepared themselves as well as possible for the discussions which are to take place at the European Council meeting in Brussels, and also for the subsequent talks with Russia which are to be conducted by the Presidency, and which will culminate in the EU-Russia Summit in Copenhagen in November."
"On the subject of the Convention, the European Council, in conformity with the Laeken Declaration, will hear a report at the Brussels meeting from the Chairman of the Convention, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, on the progress which has been made with the Convention's work."
"Helping the work of the Convention along is an important ambition of the Presidency's."
"The Convention has got off to a good start, and has now moved on to the important analysis stage."
"The number of proposals is rising, the mounds of paper are growing, and it seems to me that we have been witness to an extremely exciting debate on the future of Europe, both in and around the Convention."
"It has been a pleasure to see the firm commitment on the part of the members of the Convention, not least those members hailing from Parliament, who had been armed to the teeth, and who have made a particularly deep mark on the debate."
"In the shape of the Convention, we see for the first time - and in the full glare of publicity - something as extraordinary as a genuine debate across European borders."
"This is not something we are accustomed to. As a rule, European politicians aim their contributions to the European debate at the public in their own, rather than other, countries."
"That is not, however, the case where this debate on the future of Europe is concerned; and this, I believe, bodes well for our ambition to create European cooperation which is more democratic and has grass-roots support."
"As will have been clear from my statement, we have an extensive and ambitious agenda for the Brussels Summit."
"It is my hope and belief that all the countries will now show the necessary willingness to compromise and help to take the important decisions which I have spoken of here; and I shall not, of course, conceal the fact that the questions that remain are particularly tough nuts to crack, and here I am of course speaking of the economy."
"I would like to repeat and underline that the European Council is looking forward to hearing what the President of Parliament, Mr Cox, has to say and to exchanging views with him."
"The importance of Parliament to the enlargement process is undisputed. Speaking almost with one voice, Parliament said very early on, first in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and then in plenary, what was to be done."
"This has contributed to the momentum, the driving force, which means that the enlargement process cannot, we hope, be halted at the last minute."
"This is something for which, on behalf of the Presidency, I wish, moreover, to thank Parliament most warmly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the Irish have voted in favour of the Treaty of Nice, the last political barriers to ratification of the Treaty have been overcome and the way to enlargement is open."
"I congratulate the Irish people on their decision."
"It demonstrates their openness and sense of responsibility."
"What is true for Ireland is true for us all."
"It is in all our interests that enlargement should proceed without delay."
"The forthcoming European Council in Brussels is therefore crucial."
"The debate will focus on our proposals regarding the ten candidate countries with which we recommend winding up negotiations by the end of the year."
"The date for the accession of Bulgaria and Romania and the next stage of Turkey's candidacy will also be discussed."
"The agenda will include the issue of Kaliningrad too."
"We may have the opportunity to review the international situation, focusing particularly on how best to continue combating terrorism in the light of the recent tragic events in Bali and the Philippines."
"We will also hear what the President of the European Convention has to report and we will hold our customary exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament."
"The first item on the Council's agenda will therefore be enlargement."
"I would like to spell out once again the compelling reasons behind our recommendation to the Member States to conclude the negotiations with the ten countries."
"We have a historic and moral duty to share with our European neighbours the stability and prosperity we have built up over half a century of integration."
"Peace, stability, democracy and the rule of law are the essential ingredients for political stability."
"All this has worked very well for us in the past. It will work for the future Member States too."
"Enlargement will extend European governance and standards to the entire continent."
"We expect to see a positive impact in very many areas: more efficient public administrations, more robust judicial systems, greater protection of minorities, more effective crime prevention, especially where cross-border crime is concerned, more stringent controls on illegal migration, enhanced monitoring of products on the market and, in particular, of food safety, and, lastly, stricter environmental standards."
"The European Union's greater size will increase its political potential on the world stage."
"This will bolster our policies in the fields of trade, financial markets, the environment and security. Europe will be in a better position to defend human rights and to help reduce the North-South divide."
"If we succeed in uniting faithfully and speaking with a single voice, we will be able to make a difference in issues such as climate change and managing the impact of globalisation."
"On top of that, however, the first wave of ten new Member countries will bring enormous economic benefits for the Union as a whole - for both current and future Member States."
"The increase in the Union's population will strengthen the single market: the population will be increased by approximately 75 - 77 million, bringing the total number of citizens in the Union to 453 million."
"By way of comparison, consider that NAFTA - comprising the United States, Mexico and Canada - has a population of around 400 million."
"Some say that, after the ten candidate countries join the European Union, the Union's GDP will grow by only 4 or 5% while the population will increase by 20%. There is nothing negative in that."
"These statistics highlight the fact that we alone are achieving a process of democratic globalisation, even if only at regional level. They are by no means negative, for they are evidence of huge potential for growth, considering the trends displayed by these countries."
"Indeed, we must not forget that the ten candidate countries are already growing at a consistently higher rate than the present 15 Member States."
"Year on year, this was 2.4% in 2001 compared with 1.5% for the current European Union and a remarkable 4.1% in 2000 compared with our 3.4%."
"Most importantly, the ten candidate countries will bring highly qualified human resources to the Union."
"It is true that the enlargement countries will increase the Union's population by 20% and its income by only 5%, but the percentage of science and engineering students graduating in these countries each year corresponds to 25% of our total."
"This is a resource which will contribute greatly to the increase in development."
"Interpreting all these factors intelligently, we see that the candidate countries are our new frontier."
"European industry will have new scope for development and expansion because there will be a great need for new technologies and because the new Member States will provide a market for our goods and services."
"Ladies and gentlemen, those are the benefits enlargement will bring."
"It is now time to address the remaining problems."
"First, however, I would like to make one minor general point: we must take great care not to jeopardise the success of enlargement by wrangling over details, as often happens in political decision-making."
"The unification of Europe must always take precedence over narrow sectoral and national interests."
"We need to concentrate on the larger picture and never lose sight of the opportunities I have just described."
"The ten countries have made enormous progress in recent years."
"The Commission's Regular Reports presented recently make this abundantly clear, and I want to emphasise that these analyses were neither overindulgent nor overoptimistic."
"The Commission's confidence in the candidate countries is based on facts and thorough analysis."
"The progress already made is the guarantee that all ten countries will be ready for membership in early 2004, including in those areas where the work undertaken still - of course - needs to be completed."
"Nonetheless, despite our total confidence in the candidate countries, the Commission has undertaken to monitor their final preparations and progress even after accession."
"To this end, we have prepared safeguard clauses for the internal market and justice and home affairs, which are the areas with regard to which our citizens have the most fears and the least confidence."
"The safeguard clauses will take effect should pledges given not be respected - an extremely unlikely scenario but one which is still possible, and we must make provision for it."
"As you are aware, the key points that will be on the table in the debate between the Heads of State and Government relate to the financing of enlargement."
"These last remaining issues are nonetheless highly significant."
"The issue that meets with the broadest agreement is net transfers."
"There is clear unanimity on two principles: firstly, on accession, the ten candidate countries must not find themselves in the position of net contributors; and secondly, all expenditure commitments must fall within the strict limits set at Berlin."
"We have adhered to these two principles, and I therefore believe that it will not be difficult to reach agreement on the exact figure at Copenhagen."
"As regards the Structural Funds, too, there appears to be growing consensus on an annual figure of around EUR 25.5 billion for 2004, 2005 and 2006."
"Frankly, we can hardly offer our new fellow citizens less."
"It will mean that the per capita amount received by the cohesion countries - the existing countries - will be EUR 231 in 2006 while the citizens of the new Member States will be entitled to EUR 137 per capita."
"I do not think we can make the discrepancy any wider than this."
"Lastly, there is the issue of agricultural expenditure, with which we are all familiar."
"I know that some of the present Member States have reservations regarding the budgetary sustainability of these proposals and that they have asked for further guarantees."
"It is right to reflect on the Union's future financial system - indeed, it is our duty. The Commission stands by its position: all our proposals are in line with the financial ceilings laid down at Berlin and are without prejudice to any future decisions."
"On all the financial issues outstanding, I expect the Brussels European Council to give the Danish Presidency and the Commission a mandate to conclude the negotiations with a view to a final decision being taken at Copenhagen."
"On this I ask for your support."
"Nevertheless - and this is a final addendum - the biggest effort we need to make in this last phase of the enlargement process is in the area of information."
"The latest Eurobarometer survey, published two days ago, tells us that half the current Union citizens are in favour of enlargement while one third are against."
"The remainder is neither for nor against."
"These figures are fairly reassuring in one sense but, in another, they give cause for concern: 65% of those surveyed think that enlargement will bring an increase in drugs trafficking, international organised crime and unemployment, which is exactly the opposite of what, on the basis of analyses, I genuinely believe will happen in the future."
"Why, then, you may ask, should enlargement give rise to those fears?"
"The answer lies in the last Eurobarometer figure: those who feel that they have been properly informed about enlargement make up only 21% of the population, whereas 79% feel that they have not received sufficient information."
"We clearly, therefore, need to make an effort to provide practical, sound, detailed information."
"Those who the statistics tell us do not feel well informed are not necessarily against enlargement - they tend to be indifferent."
"That, for me, however, is perhaps the most disturbing factor."
"We must convince our fellow citizens that enlargement will bring solutions, not problems."
"That is why the Commission has launched an information campaign targeting both the present Member States and the candidate countries."
"The success of enlargement will depend on our ability to keep the public properly informed. We must not disappoint millions of Europeans in this respect."
"Indeed, the future of our Union depends on the enthusiasm, the vigour and the astuteness of our final endeavours to complete the process."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the signal we got from Luxembourg yesterday was a strong and positive one."
"The Council has accepted the Commission's recommendations that the negotiations with ten countries should be concluded."
"The Council did this because the Commission had been able to make a convincing case that our recommendations were not based on a political wish list."
"Our desire was not to take a politically desirable scenario and pronounce it realistic, but to declare what actually is realistic."
"The Commission's statement that these ten countries will have completed their preparations by the scheduled date of accession is not a rough estimate, but rather a firm prognosis, founded on knowledge, experience and the actual stage that preparations have reached, and one that we will defend fair and square."
"I think it important to note that the Commission came to this decision unanimously and that all my fellow-Commissioners, who bear responsibility for the extent to which policies work, said unequivocally that there remain within their fields of responsibility no problems that cannot be rectified by the scheduled date of accession."
"If one considers what has to be done in the remaining 12 to 15 or 18 months, as against what has already taken place over the past five years - for it is only then that the complete picture becomes apparent - it is very clear to see that we are not being over-optimistic when we say that the nature of the preparations will be such that we can tell the citizens back home that the enlargement is as well prepared as it possibly could be."
"The Council also took on board the Commission's proposals relating to monitoring and safeguard clauses."
"This is a very important point."
"This is not about any failure to trust the new members."
"This is where we need a new instrument, because we find ourselves in a completely new situation."
"The internal market and the single currency have, in the meantime made rapid progress and are almost fully developed."
"We are dealing with countries that are undergoing a process of transformation."
"Never before have we been in a situation in which we wanted to integrate ten countries at once, with a large number of them still in a process of transformation."
"This can give rise to problems that nobody can foresee."
"The Commission therefore considers it right and proper to have a very broadly framed safeguard clause, permitting us to intervene wherever unforeseen or unforeseeable problems crop up."
"There is still a difficult stretch of the road ahead of us - that much is absolutely clear."
"As again became clear yesterday, however, political momentum is strong enough to carry us onwards to Copenhagen and make Copenhagen, too, a success."
"Not one Member State couples the threat of a veto to the demands and desires that are still present in this process."
"It is important that we hold fast to the fact that, yesterday, all fifteen again committed themselves to the goal of completing the negotiations."
"I would therefore like, briefly, to set out two expectations for the Council in Brussels to consider."
"The very least that we need from the Heads of State and Government is an agreement permitting us, in the time between Brussels and Copenhagen, to get together with the candidate countries and properly sort out those financial and agricultural policy issues that are as yet unresolved."
"The Commission does not believe it to be possible to reach compromises as late as the Copenhagen stage, as we would then be putting the candidate countries in a position where they would have to 'do or die', and we have to take the democratic rights of our future Member States seriously."
"The enlargement process cannot be forced, but must be the outcome of mutual agreement and founded on mutual trust."
"Discussion of the financial problems connected with enlargement no longer focuses, essentially, on the financial issues of 2004, 2005 and 2006; we are indeed already doing the groundwork for discussion of the next financial perspective for the post-2006 period."
"Whilst this must be understood, it must also be said that the enlargement process must not be allowed to be taken hostage for positions that should be discussed only in the context of the next Financial Perspective."
"I also think we can agree that we of course have to carry on down the path on which we set off in 1999 in Berlin, which involves the requirement that the European Budget be consolidated rather than simply allowed to burst."
"I am glad that France and Germany in particular are currently making special efforts, including bilateral contacts, at coming to an understanding on this fundamental issue."
"I do not believe that Germany and France have a responsibility in this area markedly different from the responsibility shared by others, but it is certainly true that it was always good for Europe when these two countries took a common line on a great, important, and forward-looking European project."
"I would be very glad indeed if it proved possible for them to give this common line its final shape by the time the Brussels Council begins."
"I believe that everyone must take on their share of responsibility and do their share of the work involved in this."
"The Commission's work is, in essence, already done, but that does not mean that we can now sit idly twiddling our thumbs - I am not going to be out of a job for a long time yet."
"What matters now is that everyone should understand that the enlargement project is political in nature."
"Over the last few weeks, I have been in touch with a number of national parliaments and can say with all due caution that certain problems I have encountered there have something to do with a noticeable information deficit in those places."
"What President Prodi said on the subject of information is crucial."
"I draw for my concluding remarks on my experience of the Irish referendum; in Ireland, it became quite apparent that, if we are to be able to advance our European cause and gain public support for it, we have to really fight for this Europe of ours and for our European cause; we really have to be prepared to meet people halfway and tell them, in plain language, why it is right and necessary."
"It will not work if we think that it will take care of itself or that the media will do it all for us."
"Political leaders in all the European institutions, in the Member States' governments and parliaments, the economic, political and cultural elites in all our Member States - these must now take upon themselves the responsibility of engaging in dialogue with the public."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we unreservedly support the political objectives set out here both by the Council and by the Commission in the persons of President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen, but we must also point out that the European Union is in a very grave situation."
"What we have heard indicates that the prospects for the summit now being held in Brussels are not very rosy."
"On behalf of our group, I would again like to make very clear that we had always envisaged a timetable according to which negotiations would be concluded by the end of 2002, with the treaties then being signed in March or April and the accessions formalised in 2004, so that the candidate countries would be able to take part in the 2004 European elections."
"Now, Commissioner Verheugen has just made reference to Germany and France."
"I agree on the importance of these two countries coming to an understanding, but, along with our group, I consider it a serious political error now to attach new conditions to the completion of the negotiations out of the desire for a new financial framework for the post-2006 period and perhaps even sooner."
"Mr Böge, who is an expert on Budget matters, has confirmed to me, and I would like to point out, that Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that the adjustment of the Financial Perspective, and hence the allocation of the funds that enlargement will require between 2004 and 2006, can be decided on only on a proposal from the Commission and by a qualified majority in the Council as well as an absolute majority of members and three-fifths of the votes cast in Parliament."
"This, then, is where Parliament also has a part to play."
"I very much hope that an agreement can now successfully be reached in Brussels, as both Mr Haarder and Mr Verheugen have said."
"For if no success is forthcoming from Brussels, negotiations will be held up."
"I have to say, speaking for my group, that we regard delaying the negotiations in such a way as irresponsible if it means that they cannot be concluded by the end of this year."
"That is why the appearance of these new conditions at this juncture is a grave political error."
"It would have been possible to discuss them at a much earlier stage."
"It would be a tragedy if the candidate countries were to end up losing out because insufficient agreement had been reached within the European Union."
"I agree wholeheartedly with what Commissioner Verheugen said about the candidate countries having done their duty over recent years, but it is the fault of certain of our Member States that we in the European Union have failed to do what had to be done."
"We would be in breach of the trust placed in us by the candidate countries if we were to fail to come to an agreement in Brussels now."
"I call upon all the parties involved to unite in Brussels and make the task of the Danish Council Presidency easier, enabling us to conclude the negotiations in time for Copenhagen."
"Reference has been made to public information, and I can emphatically underline what both President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have had to say on the subject."
"Commissioner Verheugen, Parliament also needs to hear what is actually being done with the funds that the Commission has allocated to information work, in order to give better information on the use made of these funds to our voters, whom we of course have to take with us along this road."
"Mr Haarder also mentioned how Kaliningrad will be a topic of discussion in Brussels."
"Whatever the necessity of resolving the problems Russia has with transit - and there is no doubt that Russia has a major interest in this - it is important for us that we make sure that Lithuania does not get the impression that we in the European Union are now making decisions over its head."
"On the contrary, Lithuania must be strengthened in its sense of its own sovereignty, and whatever is eventually decided must, of course, be subject to its agreement."
"The Schengen criteria must also be adhered to."
"It is on this basis, and also in relation to security, that we of course counsel flexibility in resolving matters with Russia."
"The issue, however, is not only access to the Kaliningrad region, for beyond it, of course, lies Greater Russia."
"There are other problems with borders."
"Take, for example, the small amount of cross-border traffic between Poland and the Ukraine or that between Slovakia, Hungary and the Ukraine. I urge this House to bear in mind the need to, on the one hand, guarantee security, and, on the other, to use flexible solutions to make it possible for people on either side of the border to meet each other."
"In Brussels, you will hear a report from Valéry Giscard D'Estaing, the President of the Convention."
"Our group and also our party - the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - is, as we have now confirmed at our congress, quite clear about the timeframe involved."
"We want the Convention to produce a result by the end of June 2003, with, after that, a short Intergovernmental Conference, so that, under the Italian Presidency, we may achieve a Treaty of Rome or a constitution of Rome, a basic treaty for the European Union by the end of 2003."
"This, therefore, is our call to all the parties involved: let us be ambitious, so that we may, adhering to this timeframe, bring into being the historic project, not only of enlargement, but also of a European constitution within the time allotted us."
"This is our collective duty if our European continent is to have a good future."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching the debate on the forthcoming European Council in Brussels with a certain amount of optimism."
"The President-in-Office of the Council, the Danish Prime Minister, Mr Rasmusen, when he was kind enough to invite us to the Conference of Presidents in Copenhagen, spoke of the three stages of the Danish Presidency."
"We knew that the Irish referendum and the elections in various Member States (Sweden, France and Germany) would have to be overcome, and now the second stage is beginning."
"We need to clear up a few grey areas in Brussels and reach agreements in order, as Commissioner Verheugen has said, to be able to prepare for the Copenhagen Summit in time."
"That is very important."
"First of all, I shall address the question that I believe to be the most decisive: we must not only be able to talk about negotiations and money, which is always important, but we must also be able to provide a political impetus and vision for this entire process."
"Before a wedding, the pre-nuptial agreement can be significant."
"In Hollywood, some film stars sign pre-nuptial agreements over 100 pages long."
"It is also important to know which house the couple will live in, and that is the job of the Convention."
"Our main problem in the European Union, rather than in the candidate countries, however, is managing to muster political enthusiasm and historic vision."
"This is the responsibility of the Commission, the Council, and also our responsibility here in Parliament."
"I consider this to be the most decisive factor, and I would say that this is the weakest point at the moment."
"We have talked about the budget, which is a summary of our policies."
"In my personal experience, in the process of the integration of my country - and also of Portugal - into the European Union, budgetary issues were extremely important and defined the current framework, the 1988 Brussels Summit, the MacSharry reform and the Edinburgh Summit."
"I believe we must start with the fact that it is good to have financial perspectives - I was the rapporteur for Parliament when the first financial perspectives were proposed - but these must not be restrictive."
"They must be interpreted according to a fundamental political principle: that the budget is adopted annually."
"My group believes that we cannot wait until 2006, because there are important questions that need to be resolved."
"The first, as President Prodi has said, is that the candidate countries are not net contributors."
"This aspect is absolutely fundamental, not only in presentation, but also as a display of solidarity."
"Secondly, we need to talk about 80% of the budget."
"The Commission has put forward a proposal, which my group considers to be of interest and which we should debate, which does not refer to changing the ceiling of the common agricultural policy, but of making this a possibility in future, and, in particular, of introducing criteria of sustainable development and solidarity, which this policy is lacking."
"It is therefore our responsibility to address these problems now, without waiting until 2006."
"The same is true of the Structural Funds, which are a sign of economic and social cohesion, not total cohesion, but an important tool for the modernisation of these countries, as they have been for others such as Ireland - the country of origin of the President - Spain - my own country - Portugal, etc."
"We must make the effort to consider how we can achieve better agreements that enable us to protect our interests and, at the same time, extend them to the candidate countries."
"That is something that cannot be put off until 2006."
"We need to address it today, and it is important for agreements to be reached between France and Germany at the Brussels Summit, naturally - it is not good for one country to isolate itself from the rest of the Community - but also between all the current partners."
"This is also an extremely important signal."
"Lastly, Mr President, in this case we must also talk to the candidate countries knowing that we are on the threshold of a decision that involves a shared destiny in the future."
"And we must also make a joint effort in Parliament to be able to adhere to a complex timetable which is an obstacle course we must overcome with a common political will."
"Mr President, if the Treaty had been rejected by your countrymen, this week's Council would have been marred by recrimination and disarray."
"Due in no small part to your efforts, Ireland's 'yes' vote has put us back on track for Europe to be reunited in 2004."
"The decisions that remain will not be easy."
"As our esteemed former colleague the President-in-Office has said, decisions involving money rarely are."
"But the Heads of State and Government must not allow themselves to flunk this historic opportunity by fighting over how to pay the bill."
"My group believes that enlargement can be financed under the financial arrangements agreed in Berlin."
"Some shifting between the different headings should be possible, within the overall limits."
"The final package must guarantee that new Member States will not be net contributors before 2007."
"Otherwise we will feed resentment and face the risk of more cliff-hanger referenda in the aspirant countries."
"Inevitably, the major area of disagreement is the common agricultural policy."
"While the Liberal Group does not regards CAP reform as a precondition for enlargement, it is clear that significant reform of our farm policies is essential to the success of enlargement and also for other reasons."
"I hear that President Chirac expects the United Kingdom to bring its budget rebate into play, while he refuses to countenance reform of his farm policies before 2006."
"We support the Commission's proposals to phase in income support to farmers for the new Member States, but we also expect all existing Member States to commit themselves to far-reaching reform of the CAP, as proposed in the mid-term review."
"The second major area of concern is the readiness of the applicant states to live within the disciplines of the single market and respect the European Union's values."
"We share the concern expressed in the Commission's progress report about corruption in a number of these countries and the need for progress in implementing EU legislation, particularly in the field of justice and home affairs."
"That is why it is right that there should be a reinforced monitoring system to ensure that countries fulfil their commitments."
"The President of the Commission called for enthusiasm and intelligence."
"Commissioner Verheugen's approach has demonstrated the latter, but a touch more enthusiasm in the Council for enlargement and for the new Europe it heralds would not go amiss."
"Mr President, the candidate countries have now devoted many years' hard work to adapting themselves to the European Union."
"They have the right to expect that the EU does its share of the work and that no obstacle now arises to prevent the ten countries identified by the Commission being admitted into the European Union as planned."
"It would be an irony of fate if there were discord in the EU which ended up delaying enlargement."
"Our group does not share the opinion that the Treaty of Nice was an absolute condition for enlargement."
"Enlargement could have gone ahead all the same, based on the old treaty."
"The Treaty of Nice is, above all, about strengthening supranationality and increasing the power of the large countries within the EU system."
"In addition, there is a problem with the Treaty of Nice as regards the distribution of power to the new countries."
"The Czech Republic and Hungary are in actual fact discriminated against in terms of the number of seats in the European Parliament allocated to them."
"It is our opinion that this should be adjusted in the Treaty of Accession."
"It has to be said that the negotiations have gone well from the EU's point of view."
"The candidate countries have worked hard to take over the acquis."
"The important thing now is that they will not only take it over in theory but also in practice, and then not only as regards the internal market but also as regards the environment and social rights for workers."
"The question is whether the EU should not also adapt itself to having ten new members."
"I believe that more should have been done."
"It is our own inability to reform agricultural policy which has given rise to a situation in which the new Member States are actually going to be treated significantly worse than the previous Member States for quite some time."
"This is unacceptable."
"Any discrimination should be kept to a minimum and should be as short-lived as humanly possible."
"In other areas, too, we must be able to revise our own policies so that they are suitable for enlargement."
"The Schengen Agreement is one such area: its strict border controls are in danger of becoming a serious obstacle to cooperation for new Member States and for countries which are not in the next wave of enlargement of the European Union."
"On the subject of the Kaliningrad area, we wish to see a solution whereby Russian citizens are able to travel between different parts of their country without needing a visa."
"On the subject of the labour market, it is our opinion that everyone should be treated equally."
"It is crucial that workers' rights are respected in all countries from day one, so that a situation does not arise in which we have social dumping or in which workers from the candidate countries are discriminated against on the labour market."
"Therefore, we regret that the Commission has effectively called this into question by means of a legal case in Finland which questions the contention that Finnish agreements apply in Finland from day one."
"The important thing now is to avoid enlargement giving rise to an 'A team' and a 'B team' in the European Union."
"This would also require the ability on our part to make changes to the Union."
"Naturally, the candidate countries also have a choice."
"They can vote 'yes', or they can vote 'no'."
"If they choose to vote 'no', the alternative is close cooperation with the European Union."
"Mr President, an historic process, the opportunity for peace and stability on our continent - words do not come more impressive than these."
"I wish a bit of this historical spirit and sense of opportunity would make itself felt at the Brussels Summit, to prevent it from degenerating into the horse-traders' fair that we fear it will become."
"There must be a willingness there to solve problems rather than keep putting them off."
"The candidate countries' impressive performance will leave the Council with no option but to confirm that ten candidates are ready for membership."
"The Member States' lack of solidarity, however, and unwillingness to reform is making living together in an enlarged EU increasingly problematic."
"It is thus that we discuss - as if it were the most self-evident thing in the world - how the candidate countries will in future finance the British rebate, even though they are barred from being given one themselves."
"In terms of the history of the EU, that is a one-off; previously, all net contributors got a rebate in their first year."
"The fifteen EU members benevolently welcomed the proposal by the Commission and the Presidency that they should get one extra year's payment from the Structural Fund."
"Why is this so?"
"It is because the lack of absorption capacity means that the money ends up back in the Fifteen's treasuries."
"That is not the solidarity that the EU needs."
"We in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance unambiguously reject such a continuation of bank-driven enlargement."
"Let me say something about agricultural policy. The disinclination to make reforms in this area stinks to high heaven, and the citizens of the European Union will no longer stand for it."
"It is not only because of enlargement that reform is needed; it is in itself overdue, and it is absurd to put it off any longer."
"Unconditional direct aid payments as extensive as these have simply outlived their usefulness and an enlarged EU will mean that they will no longer be workable."
"We have to make a start on agricultural reform now and work together to develop a fair structure for the twenty-five members that the EU will have in 2007."
"The maintenance of privileges must not be allowed to become a new condition for enlargement."
"I would like to say something about the Irish yes-vote. The Irish said yes to the Treaty of Nice, thereby removing the greatest obstacle to enlargement, but the reform of the European Union's institutions is still pending."
"The Treaty of Nice has not really moved the EU any further on."
"It is first necessary to create democracy and improve decision-making, and that is in the Convention's hands."
"I therefore want to argue that the Convention's draft treaty absolutely must be capable of being adopted in 2003."
"Functionality is not a prior condition for the enlarged EU, but it will be needed."
"President Prodi referred to a lack of public approval."
"And why is that so?"
"The EU quite simply lacks transparency and democracy, and that must change!"
"Mr President, I wish the Danish presidency well in the run-up to the EU Summit this week in Brussels."
"Enlargement, being the main subject on the agenda, has been very much at the heart of the referendum campaign on the Nice Treaty in my country."
"The other issue - Kaliningrad - is also directly linked to enlargement."
"I welcome the measures proposed by the Commission to ease the direct transit of goods and people between Kaliningrad and the rest of Russia."
"All of us have benefited from the in-depth and often intense debate on enlargement that has just taken place in my own country."
"The decision taken by the people of Ireland underlines their strong commitment to European integration and enlargement of the European Union."
"I welcome the fact that their decision clears the way for the conclusion of the accession negotiations for the first new Member States."
"I support what Mr Poettering said."
"There must be no new conditions introduced or strings attached at this stage in the negotiation accessions."
"That would be a recipe for disaster."
"The lesson we can all learn from the recent debate during the Irish referendum campaign should not be taken lightly."
"I endorse very strongly what President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen have said on the need to keep people informed."
"The Irish electorate are making it clear that they will not be patronised or taken for granted by the political leaders and governments of the Member States, or by Brussels."
"It is frightening to hear President Prodi say that almost 80% of respondents in a recent poll had no idea what was going on."
"Mr Haarder said earlier that there is an exciting debate in progress in the Convention."
"It may be exciting to insiders, but outside, as he well knows, it is hardly mentioned in the newspapers."
"Remember that when we hold a referendum on this in the near future, the issues we will be asked to decide on will be of far greater complexity and importance than those related to Nice."
"And we recently had great difficulty reaching a decision on that."
"Mr President, ask a leading question, and you get the answers you are looking for."
"Ireland has won an emphatic 'yes' to more jobs, to neutrality and enlargement, but there are neither jobs nor neutrality to be had from the Treaty of Nice, and, regardless of whether the Irish had voted 'yes' or 'no', enlargement would have gone ahead anyway, by taking Declaration 20 and moving applicant countries' votes in the Council and seats in Parliament into the accession agreements."
"I will vote for this in the House, but future historians have to know that a people was harmed."
"Ireland is the most EU-friendly country there is."
"It voted 'no'."
"Instead of giving other people the chance to express their opinion, the Irish were bullied into voting 'yes' using the fabricated contention that failure to do so would block enlargement."
"Up to now I have had nothing but praise for the Danish Council Presidency."
"Today, however, I am sorry to say that the Danish President of the Council was party to the deception of the Irish voters."
"Would Mr Rasmussen have stopped enlargement following an Irish 'no'?"
"He would probably have pulled another proposal out of the hat and secured enlargement without the Treaty of Nice."
"The best that can be said about the Treaty is that it will only last for a year or two."
"Then, a new basis from the Convention of the time will be put to the vote."
"The Treaty of Nice is the worst mess to date."
"I have published it in consolidated form, but I can by no means recommend the book."
"Nice is ill-suited to secure popular support in the applicant countries."
"It takes away the countries' right to choose their own Commissioner, in favour of an EU government appointed by majority voting."
"Remove the stumbling block now and declare that there will still be a representative of each Member State on the Commission."
"The Irish voters by no means declared themselves in favour of losing their Commissioner."
"The subject of the Treaty of Nice was scarcely discussed this time and some skill went into ensuring that the Irish did not come to know about Mr Giscard d'Estaing's first draft constitution."
"This was presented at a closed meeting last Thursday."
"The copies were numbered and were collected in again afterwards."
"Mr Giscard d'Estaing has a cure for referendums: if a country votes 'no' the next time, it will be left behind."
"Countries permitting their population to vote 'no' will no longer be paid any attention."
"The EU state comes before the voters."
"In Mr Giscard d'Estaing's democracy there is a choice between voting 'yes' and 'yes, please'."
"No, thank you, Mr President."
"I will not abuse the privileges of the Chair by allowing myself the comment I would like to make, Mr Bonde."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in 1957, next to the huge Soviet bloc, the Europe of the founding fathers was, in the words of Paul Valéry 'the little peninsula at the end of Asia'."
"Less than 50 years later, the European Union has become the third greatest power in the world in terms of population, rivals the United States in terms of GDP and is the greatest trading power in the world."
"The European Union is the only example in history of a power that has grown through the voluntary accession of its neighbours."
"This extraordinary example set by Europe must be maintained when the Community is enlarged to encompass a further ten countries."
"It is not enough, however, to grow in body; one must grow in mind as well - this European mind that the German philosopher Karl Jaspers characterised as 'the meaning of History, Science and Freedom'."
"Let us add solidarity to this list."
"We must develop the European spirit and prevent this spirit from being discredited at the forthcoming Brussels Summit by ridiculous displays of haggling and national self-interest, by arguments about who should pay more and who should pay less."
"This does not mean that the financial offer to be made to the candidate countries should not be substantial and significant. Nor does this mean that the future funding of the Union should be of a redistributive nature."
"A Union in which so many inequalities remain must concern itself with this issue."
"We must not, however, confuse the matter."
"President Chirac is mistaken."
"The CAP is an unfair, imbalanced and damaging policy from the ecological point of view."
"It cannot be compared with cohesion policy, which really is a fair policy and a policy that strengthens Europe's internal unity."
"Comparing the two policies is a serious mistake."
"Lastly, Mr President, we must consider the case of Turkey: the most basic sense of loyalty obliges the European Union to set a timetable for negotiations with Turkey."
"Linguistic, cultural and religious arguments cannot be used to keep Turkey out of the European Community, when this country has been hoping for so many years to achieve this and has made considerable efforts to do so."
"This is a question of the EU's loyalty and honesty towards its partners."
"Mr President, Commissioners, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I just want to look at the problems that will arise for the people of Kaliningrad as a result of transit arrangements, and the solutions that have been proposed for them."
"The transit permit, or Kaliningrad passport, as proposed by the Commission, is in my opinion a good solution for both sides."
"It would make it easier for the Kaliningrad Russians to travel to their mother country than is the case with normal visas, but it would also safeguard Lithuania's sovereignty."
"The option of establishing a train corridor has been put forward."
"This idea, however, does not tie in with current reality."
"The point is, how many of the present Member States would agree to have a train tearing along through their own country, coming from another country that does not belong to the European Union and whose passengers could not be checked?"
"Would Belgium, Spain, Italy or France agree to this?"
"It is good that the Council since yesterday has had a common position on transit arrangements for the people of Kaliningrad."
"In examining the way opinion has been formed I have noticed that the further away from Kaliningrad a current Member State is, the more unrealistic the points it has put forward to solve the problem."
"This is, frankly speaking, go-it-alone irresponsibility."
"Russia's suggestion for visa-free travel between herself and the EU has also, unfortunately, gained the support of some Member States."
"It is regrettable to find that people are unable to view the drawbacks or dangers which that would bring realistically."
"If we want to start relaxing visa policy radically should we not start with Turkey, which at least has candidate country status?"
"Visa-free travel is not, however, today's issue."
"For that reason, it is rash for just one individual EU country, for example, to promise such a thing, and I seriously fear that merely discussing the issue would harm the favourable attitude the citizens of countries applying to join the Union have towards the EU."
"I nevertheless give my wholehearted support to policy with regard to Russia that backs that country's long-term development and makes it possible for visa-free travel to be introduced one day."
"Incidentally, I would like to suggest that it might be worth asking the Russians why, as they have renounced Lenin in Leningrad and Stalin in Stalingrad, they still sully a major area of European culture with the name of Mikhail Kalinin."
"Immanuel Kant's Königsberg should once again have the honour."
"Finally, I should like to raise the matter of the Eurobarometer."
"The Commission is quite right to say we must share this information, but 70% of our citizens expect to hear the truth and information from their national governments."
"Why do they do nothing?"
"This is hardly a speech by the opposition, as I am a member of the party in government in Finland."
"Mr President, thank you for the statements by the Council and the Commission, and also sincere congratulations and thanks to the Irish people, who removed a great obstacle to enlargement last Saturday."
"I am pleased that both President Prodi and Commissioner Verheugen concluded their inspired interventions by speaking of information based on the latest Eurobarometer surveys."
"Only one in five Europeans feels 'well' or 'very well' informed."
"This does not make pleasant reading."
"Nor does it come as much of a surprise, because we have been aware of the problem for many years."
"I have said it before in this House, and I will gladly say it again: EU information and communications policy is in need of improvement."
"We must be prepared - as Mr Poettering mentioned - to find the necessary means."
"Information forms the basis of understanding and thus of the popular grass-roots support that the EU needs."
"The enlargement negotiations have now passed the point of no return and there must be no new demands made."
"Admittedly, there is need for a radical reform of agricultural policy, but let us first put all the arrangements in place."
"I am pleased with the results from the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg over the last couple of days, and it is particularly good news that agreement has been reached on the fact that none of the new applicant countries can under any circumstances start their membership of the EU as net contributors."
"Anything else would have been unreasonable."
"I am confident that the Council, headed by the Danish Presidency, will be able to accomplish this great historic task in Copenhagen in December."
"Mr President, I am positive that the penultimate step before Copenhagen will be taken in Brussels over the next two days on this exceptional policy, the European Union's policy of admitting ten new members."
"This step needs to be taken in a decisive and realistic manner which overcomes any petty perceptions and subsequent moves need to be determined by this step, not the other way round."
"I have just two or three comments to make as time is so short."
"First, Kaliningrad."
"Obviously, this problem needs to be resolved, not with a Gordian knot but with a clean sweep, by which I mean a harmonious, rational, functional solution that respects nations and states."
"Secondly, the widely discussed issue of the budget."
"We must not be mean and tight-fisted and we must not forget that the countries about to join the European Union have manpower in abundance but, unfortunately, limited resources."
"However, abundant manpower is what determines development and development is what we need to see."
"Thirdly, in connection with other issues which may have prospects or require decisions, the European Union of the 15 or of the 25, or of however many other members there may be, must remain an area of social cohesion, development and democracy."
"Clearly, therefore, any solutions to budgetary questions need to be resolved on the basis of these priorities."
"In other words, they must be predicated on the need for the European Union to maintain the values which it has already acquired and which must continue to apply, they must be predicated on peoples' priorities and not on petty political perceptions which, in the final analysis, are short-lived and are sometimes to do with antagonism of one sort or another, which gets us nowhere."
"Having said which, I am positive that two new steps forward will be taken over the next two days and, as we continue on this course, we at the heart of the European Union, the European Parliament, must generate the political spirit and climate which, unfortunately, tend to be lacking, reducing the debate from a debate on overcoming problems to a mean, tight-fisted debate."
"The impending enlargement is one of the most important political events since the initial inception of the European Communities."
"This enlargement will heal a rift between Western, Central and Eastern Europe."
"This rift came about before the Second World War and was reinforced by an iron curtain and a wall after the Second World War."
"The healing of this rift is a jewel in the crown of the present European Union and also of the acceding countries."
"They have been adapting their democratic systems, their economies and their legislation since 1989, which has required major efforts."
"I therefore lend my wholehearted support to the ten accessions proposed by the Commission."
"A crucial debate on the topic of enlargement is taking place in the Dutch Lower House today."
"The Dutch Government is in support of enlargement despite the opposition of two coalition partners, namely the Liberals and the Fortuyn group."
"I regret this deeply, but there will still be a democratic majority in the Lower House today prior to the accessions, which means that the Netherlands will not necessarily put a spanner in the works."
"We may have our Social-Democratic friends to thank for this."
"If a number of conditions have not yet been met, however, the acceding countries will be required to make a final effort and, if necessary, introduce safeguards in areas such as food safety, the internal market and justice and home affairs."
"Incidentally, I am pleased that Mr Prodi has stated that these safeguards will actually be put in place should this prove really necessary."
"It would also be much better if a financial agreement were to be reached, so that there would be more clarity about the financial costs involved in the enlargement, as this is an area which our citizens are particularly concerned about."
"It would also be preferable if better agricultural agreements were concluded."
"These should not be a pre-condition, but I agree with those fellow MEPs who claim that they are required as a matter of urgency."
"I now have a question for Mr Haarder."
"Would it perhaps be possible for you to have a frank discussion with our Liberal colleagues in the Netherlands, who are your fellow party members, to ensure that this issue does not complicate matters at this time and that it is not misused in the Dutch elections?"
"The Netherlands has always been a pro-European country."
"The political parties that are trying to turn the Dutch into eurosceptics are taking on a major responsibility."
"The enlargement receives the support of both the Christian-Democrats here and the Christian-Democrats in the Netherlands."
"I should like to say to Mrs Maij-Weggen that I spoke in terms you would be rather pleased with regarding our Liberal friends at a Liberal congress last week."
"Mr President, there is good reason to rejoice that Ireland has now accepted the Treaty of Nice, with its specific declarations on Irish neutrality."
"This removed a serious obstacle to enlargement."
"Enlargement is a historic occurrence for which, in my opinion, both the Commission and the Danish Presidency have prepared the ground most competently."
"The applicant countries have made a tremendous effort to prepare themselves for accession to the EU."
"I sense that the remaining problems are clear."
"Now, therefore, it is up to the Heads of Government of the 15 countries to show leadership and responsibility in order that the Presidency can in the coming week obtain the required common mandate to conclude the negotiations with the ten applicant countries on the basis of the Commission's January proposal."
"No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed."
"Agricultural and funding reform should not be tied up directly with enlargement. On the other hand, of course, as we well know, the present and future members of the EU should be able to agree at the Copenhagen Summit in December on at least some of the principles for future agricultural and funding reform, which, as we know, will be necessary from 2006."
"It is also important that the outcome of negotiations we are aiming at is fair on the applicant countries, and that we bring about a fair competitive situation, possibly with slightly shorter transitional arrangements in the field of agricultural subsidies, so that referendums in the new Member States can obtain a 'yes' vote."
"With regard to the Kaliningrad issue, I also hope that a good enough solution can be found, so that the little enclave does not become a conflict region, but instead a positive player in the Baltic region; a solution which of course fully respects both Lithuania's sovereignty and its desire to become a member of Schengen."
"A 'corridor' solution, which brings back memories of earlier solutions to similar problems in Europe, must be avoided at all costs."
"We should be able to solve the transit question in a different way, possibly by means of a special passport system."
"But I extend my thanks to the Danish Presidency for its competent leadership."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission and Commissioner, the electorate has spoken in France, Germany and latterly also in Ireland."
"There are still a few countries in which they need to have their voices heard, which will cause the necessary problems, as there are still questions on this score."
"The politicians, however, must now roll up their sleeves as a matter of urgency, not as carpet dealers, as Mrs Schröder mentioned, but with the necessary vision and courage."
"I should like to ask a specific question with regard to the information which President Prodi mentioned."
"In my many dealings with the public, I have noticed that the same questions arise time and again among the people in Flanders and Belgium."
"I think that they are entitled to an answer."
"There is the answer about the vision, and you can win people over with this. However, there are other questions that keep being asked in my country."
"Will horizontal enlargement not obstruct vertical enlargement?"
"In other words, will this enlargement not spell the definitive end of our growth towards a community?"
"Will this be intergovernmentalism's final victory?"
"This question has been raised in Belgium and has, for example, prompted the Socialist Party - which is, after all, the key government partner at present - to question the meaning of this enlargement."
"I should like to ask a second question which people keep asking me - at least people in our regions."
"They naturally visit the countries that will be our future partners, and in that sense, Europe is already growing in the hearts and minds of the people, but they notice that those countries are experiencing major problems, abject poverty and problems involving minorities."
"We are also experiencing a time of economic decline and a time when the spectre of unemployment is once again looming large in the EU countries themselves."
"Then people want an answer to the question whether we will be able to fight the unemployment that is now threatening us."
"I am convinced that future enlargement will make this possible."
"I do believe, however, that we should not merely present people with a vision and good news; we should also produce specific answers to the questions that are being raised on a daily basis, questions concerning the costs and also, of course, questions that I have raised myself and that will need to be resolved in the Convention."
"Mr President, now that Mrs Maij-Weggen has made it clear that the Dutch Christian Democrats are no longer the problem, and now that it is also clear from what you have said that the Liberals are not either, the only people who seem to be left hitching a free ride and imposing special conditions are the German Social Democrats and the German Federal Government."
"I think, though, that we ought to make clear that, whatever else we might rightly or wrongly desire, no new conditions for the enlargement of the European Union must be allowed to be imposed."
"That has to be made clear and - as you, Commissioner Verheugen, know better than any of us - those things that were neglected when negotiating Agenda 2000 cannot now be put right again a quarter of a year before Copenhagen."
"We will have to do that at a later date."
"Now that Saturday's events make it possible for us to get back to discussing Nice's critical aspects, it is right and proper that we make it clear that, in structural policy for example, the Convention must accept majority decisions, thus giving us better decision-making structures for the reforms in 2006, and enabling us to implement the necessary reforms at the right point in time."
"The actual content of that can of course be prepared by the Commission and in the debates, but here too, we have to do the necessary homework if we are to make progress in 2006."
"Let me briefly address the Kaliningrad question, which, I believe, encompasses some of the political issues that remain to be dealt with."
"We have to take account both of Lithuania's sovereignty and Russian sensitivities and make clear that big countries cannot ride roughshod over small ones when they engage in negotiations."
"Part of our picture of Europe is, after all, that small countries have a value of their own."
"It is evident that any solution here has to be practicable and makes allowances for everyone's sensitivities, and I believe that what the Commission has presented and yesterday's decision by the Council of Ministers provide a basis for negotiations, one on which we can proceed. I take the view that, in today's battle order, the Commission and the Council are indeed doing their best to achieve a result in October."
"Allow me a final comment."
"Information work and information campaigns will be of great importance, both in the Member States and in the candidate countries."
"I hope they will be better organised in the latter than they currently are in the former; in my own country, they involve little more than putting the Federal States' ministers for Europe on display, and have little relevance to the actual work of informing people."
"Perhaps, Commissioner Verheugen, we could at some time discuss how we can change this."
"Mr President, yesterday's and this morning's meetings and the meeting due to be held in the coming days in Brussels are all trial runs for Copenhagen, aimed at defining the European Union's position before the last sprint to complete negotiations."
"The ten countries have made considerable progress since last year and will be ready in 2004."
"I believe that the justifications contained in the report will also be included in the report currently being drawn up by Chairman Brok, and that they will not be very different from what has already been said."
"I represent a fairly straightforward case - Slovenia - which would actually appear to be pretty representative of other small countries in the sense that, without the hard schooling from Europe, these countries would have been psychologically much, much further away from Europe than they are today."
"Economic, administrative and political problems and the desire to respect the Copenhagen criteria have placed Slovenia and other countries among those which have recently tackled the various chapters on reconstruction of the administrations and the economy most vigorously."
"Of course, they need to continue to concentrate on restructuring the economy and they need to improve their insolvency legislation, but, at the same time, I would point out that a large number of experts have been drafted in and that some banks which were completely state-owned have become 76% private in the space of a year."
"This would appear to be a great achievement."
"By agreement with the European negotiators, the country has opted to remain a single region, not least to avoid feeling, after Vienna and Belgrade, that it is under the yoke of yet another foreign power."
"There is a possibility that this may change in 2006, depending on national feeling."
"The most important thing, however, is to keep the citizens informed, something which has been the subject of much discussion today and which is poorly organised."
"I feel that more needs to be done in this respect."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking the Danish Presidency for its good work."
"It does not surprise me at all, but of course there are, and were, Members who doubted the Danish will and ability to carry out enlargement of the EU."
"This really has now come to nought."
"To listen to Mr Bonde, one wonders if he is not dreaming that he is back in the 'good old days' of the GDR."
"Last Monday I was in Bratislava, in Slovakia."
"There, it emerged that people felt very unfairly identified as an unreliable candidate country in connection with what had been said during the Dutch Government crisis."
"Other countries have also been named."
"I would like to say to Mrs Maij-Weggen that there are actually many Dutch liberals who share your opinion, as Mr Cox also quite rightly said."
"The last word has not been said on this subject."
"In order to reassure people in Bratislava, Warsaw, Riga and Vilnius, I wish to say that the President of the Council and the Commissioners confirm that there is no cause for concern."
"There is no information in the country reports to demonstrate that, in general, any countries are in a worse position than others."
"As Commissioner Verheugen emphasises, there is nothing today to show that there are any problems in any of the ten countries which cannot be solved."
"It is true that there are difficulties, but they are not insurmountable."
"I believe that it is extremely important that the Council and the Commission are clear on this subject."
"The historical and moral reunification of Europe is irrevocable."
"The EU honours its agreements."
"We stand our ground."
"I quote in Latin, which I once studied: pacta sunt servanda."
"Mr President, we are facing a very complex European Council, and I should like to wish the Danish Presidency every success in this."
"We owe it to the presidency, the European Union as it stands now, as well as the candidate countries to be able to take some serious decisions."
"Crucial decisions will need to be taken within a few months, and in my view it is especially regrettable that we are still finding out that 79% of the people in Europe are claiming to be badly informed."
"This is not only regrettable, but also very dangerous, because a huge number of people in Europe - indeed in all the Member States - feel uncertain and unsafe."
"This uncertainty and lack of information about enlargement only serves to intensify these negative feelings."
"I think it is high time we explained to people that enlargement could be a springboard for a safer Europe, a Europe that gives them greater security, and it is also high time we reassured them that Europe need not become less social, less prosperous or even less democratic as a result."
"It is high time we told them that - and started working on that."
"This is why, just as our group chairman asked the President of the Commission, I should like the Commission to tell me exactly what its information plan looks like, and I should also like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether it might not be a good idea to discuss this with the government leaders at this important European Council after all?"
"Large-scale European information campaigns with sizeable advertisements in major newspapers may help to some extent, but the euro campaign has taught us that we should make use of decentralised information methods."
"We must involve the governments and civil society in the Member States."
"If we do not, people will never be sufficiently informed."
"Are there such plans in the pipeline?"
"Are there plans afoot to quickly set up a campaign in this way?"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, taking into consideration the fact that quite a number of governments in Europe have left a great deal to be desired in this area, will you be quizzing your fellow government leaders about this?"
"Your point is worth emphasising."
"The information campaign is not only about public relations. It must have political conviction behind it."
"If there is no political conviction, no message gets through."
"In this Parliament we must understand that the time has come for the politicians to repossess the enlargement agenda following the highly complex work carried out by the Commission."
"This is the message we must deliver at the summit meeting on Friday."
"Mr President, enlargement is not just meant to bring peace, democracy and the rule of law; it is also, of course, meant to help raise the standard of living in the countries that will be joining us."
"Economic cooperation ended up being a formula for the European Union's success, and this formula is to be applied more widely to give us stability in the sense of peace - not only external, but also internal and social peace."
"Great economic insecurity lies in store for the candidate countries, and we have to get them to understand that we know what difficulties they will face."
"For example, we have been able to learn from the Economic and Monetary Committee's delegations what advances have been made, and which have proved difficult, in such areas as, for example, competition policy or the control of aid payments."
"This has also had an effect on jobs in the candidate countries and cannot be organised without it running the risk of rejection."
"We are, then, well aware of the credit that is due to the candidate countries for their efforts, but it is also evident that they, when they join, must not only be capable of functioning as market economies; they must also be able to stand the pace of competition."
"There is still room for improvement in this respect."
"I want to give just two examples of this - steelworking and shipbuilding - and propose to mention energy only in passing, even though it is equally important."
"That is why the Commission was right to insert safeguard clauses."
"I think the candidate countries will also be able to handle these, and we must see to it that these safeguard clauses are inserted in such a way that they do not affect this or that country in an arbitrary way."
"I am confident that the process of reform in the candidate countries will continue; indeed, it must continue and be a success, as it is not only the failure to inform the public in the European Union that is an issue here; it is also the lack of information in the candidate countries."
"It would be a good thing if we could help to resolve this problem."
"Mr President, this enlargement project is to the little country I hail from, Denmark, a matter of national pride."
"The criteria for the accession of new Member States were drawn up at the Copenhagen Summit in 1993, and the process is to be concluded at the Copenhagen Summit in December."
"It is irrational that this should be a matter of pride for the little nation, but it boosts our self-confidence, and that is of course always good."
"The problem is, of course, simply that so many issues are still unresolved."
"The Belgian negotiator of the Maastricht Treaty, an economist by profession, has stated that there is a long series of funding problems which have not been solved."
"Everyone wants enlargement, he says, but no one wants to pay for it."
"Why, for example, should the British keep their rebate while the much poorer candidate countries pay full price?"
"This is one problem."
"Another problem, which has been completely overlooked, and which is under the extremely roomy carpet under which problems are swept, is the question of the reliability of the progress reports."
"I cannot find a single instance in these analyses of a sober attitude to the decisive question of the last and crucial Copenhagen criterion, according to which the candidate countries not only have to comply with the acquis communautaire but must also have the administrative, legal and political structure which is a prerequisite for its effective implementation."
"A Swedish report last week pointed out that these problems are extremely serious."
"Simple mathematics demonstrate that the legal and administrative personnel simply do not have the training."
"The whole basis for actually implementing the acquis communautaire is absent."
"These problems have not been dealt with, and the question to my Danish friend and former colleague, the Danish Minister for European Affairs, is: what do you intend to do about this badly neglected problem?"
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that enlargement is proceeding relatively smoothly."
"However, when the whole of the EU institutional machinery is focused on the enlargement process, do not forget that there are other European countries with very legitimate cultural and historical links to Europe."
"They feel aggrieved that their ambitions for EU membership in the long term are being ignored and decreed unrealistic, particularly by the Commission."
"I have in mind particularly Ukraine, which is locked in a political struggle between westernisers and those who wish to see it join a reinvented economic union with Russia and the eastern republics."
"As soon as this round of enlargement is over, we must reconsider our policies to other countries in Europe."
"I am thinking here of the Balkan states in particular and neighbouring countries such as Ukraine which need anchoring in peace, prosperity and western security."
"Since the break-up of the former Soviet Union ten years ago, they have moved some way towards democracy, human rights and good government, although a great deal remains to be done."
"If Turkey has been granted candidate status, surely a country like Ukraine has just as much, if not more, of a claim to be a candidate for the European family of nations in an enlarged, wider and looser European Union."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Irish people, as well as the Danish Presidency, which has done a tremendously good job, and the Commission, which has been working on the issue for a long time."
"There is of course a large number of problems associated with enlargement."
"The opportunities outweigh the problems, however, although obviously we do need to solve the problems."
"They should not be allowed to overshadow the opportunities."
"It is a question of our children and children's children."
"It is a question of creating a Europe of peace and democracy for our children and children's children."
"It is a question of a better environment."
"Sweden shares a border with many of these countries: we have the Baltic in common, for example."
"If we wish to tackle the problems of the Baltic region for the future, we can simply do it together."
"It is also a question of workers' rights in countries bordering on ours, so that these countries cannot practise social dumping, and so that they have fairer conditions and stronger trade unions."
"All of this is our responsibility."
"The President said that we need to have information campaigns."
"Of course we do, but this is first and foremost a political responsibility."
"Now is the time for us, the politicians, to get out of the conference room and hold a dialogue with the people in our Member States, with a view to convincing them of the importance of enlargement."
"I would like to see a change in agricultural policy."
"We need a change in structural policy, but this must not be made a condition for enlargement."
"It is not the candidate countries' responsibility, but our responsibility - the responsibility of all of us - to make a change in agricultural and structural policy."
"A brief word about Kaliningrad."
"I hope that a solution can be found, particularly so that the people are able to move freely over the borders."
"We should not forget another aspect, which is that there is a risk of the gulf between Kaliningrad and Lithuania widening when Lithuania undergoes improved development as a Member State."
"This could potentially lead to tensions in the border regions."
"It is important, therefore, to make efforts in the social and economic fields for the people in the Kaliningrad area, too."
"Mr President, I wish to appeal to the Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers who are congregating in Brussels: that appeal is that they take seriously their responsibility in respect of enlargement."
"It is not possible to make everything dependent on everything else, nor is it possible to force through an agricultural reform with enlargement in the offing."
"Time must be found for that later on."
"It is not possible to be willing to pay more for enlargement and, at one and the same time, to compel others to pay less."
"I think it must be clear that the costs of enlargement, within the bounds of reasonable perspectives, should rather be planned to be below the level of Agenda 2000 as set out in Berlin."
"We should be looking seriously at proper finance for agriculture, making it possible for there to be stable conditions for farmers by 2006, but we should also be clear in our own minds that not everything has a final solution."
"There will be no pre-enlargement agricultural reform without postponing enlargement for ever and a day, and nor can we prejudice future, post-2006, Budget frameworks."
"It is with this in mind that I can say that we in the Austrian People's Party, and I as a representative of it, take the line of 100% support for enlargement."
"I know that your team in Brussels is empowered to act properly in the interests of the European Community and of Austria."
"We hope, of course, that there will be sensitivity for our concerns about transit and support for border regions, but we are all aware that enlargement is a great chance - a chance that must be made use of."
"This must be guaranteed in a policy and a procedure that means that the candidates for accession are not forced into a 'do or die' situation, about which we have heard so much."
"So I ask you this: how do you intend to go about finding a method whereby, on the one hand, the Brussels Conference is prevented from degenerating into a secretive conclave and, on the other, there is enough space left for negotiations with the candidates for enlargement?"
"I should like to thank Mrs Maij-Weggen, who congratulated us on the fact that the Social-Democrats in the Netherlands are certainly helping our country out of an awkward situation today by not raising any obstacles with regard to Copenhagen or the European Council which is to be held within the next couple of days."
"It is important for both the Greens and the Social-Democrats, who are in opposition in the Netherlands, to help the Netherlands move in the right direction."
"We are pleased that the European Union is still on schedule concerning enlargement."
"Given the years of preparation and the importance of enlargement, we hope that we can complete the process with all ten candidate countries within the next eighteen months."
"The frank Commission reports, for which my congratulations, confirm that a few things still need to be resolved."
"The European Parliament has also pointed out the weaknesses on several occasions."
"Most candidate countries are still lacking in areas such as implementation capacity and the fight against corruption."
"The further agreements concluded between the Commission and the acceding countries will therefore need to play an important role in the European Parliament's final assessment."
"It is too early to rest on our laurels, but at the same time, the European Union must remain reasonable."
"We cannot ask more from the candidates than what we can accomplish ourselves."
"All this also applies to Slovakia."
"Until 1998, Slovakia lagged behind the other countries, but has since then largely made up the difference - in fact to such an extent that it now has every right, in my view, to feature on the Commission's list."
"The rate at which reforms have taken place over the past few years gives me hope that the remaining problems can be resolved quickly."
"'Keep at it!' is the message we should like to pass on to the new Slovakian Government."
"Fortunately, it was set up promptly after the elections in September and, like the previous government, will be able to work well with the European Union."
"I should like to urge this House, but also mainly the Council, to put the Meciar era behind us."
"It is over, and it is unfair to keep reminding Slovakia of it."
"Mr President, I am concerned for the pensioners of Bulgaria, and not just because I am the representative of the Pensioners' Party and a member of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"The Bulgarian pensioners fought in the Second World War, they lived under the yoke of communism for very many years, and now that they are old, living on miserly pensions, they hope that their quality of life will improve when they too become part of the European Union in a short while."
"I therefore wonder, and I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission, whether, seeing as the Stability and Growth Pact too has to be interpreted intelligently and flexibly, is there any hope that the decision of the Community organs to defer Bulgaria's accession to the European Union until 2007 might be reviewed?"
"And, above all, is there a possibility that the decision to close units of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant within the set time frame might be reviewed, allowing Bulgaria to keep them in operation for a little longer in view of the enormous harm their closure will do to the Bulgarian economy?"
"Lastly, would it be possible to reflect on the need to proceed swiftly with and put more funding into the development of corridor 8, linking Puglia to Albania, Macedonia and Bulgaria and terminating in Varna and Burgas?"
"I was pleased with Mr Prodi's call for more political enthusiasm with regard to enlargement."
"I can inform my fellow MEPs that as a member of the Convention on the future of Europe, I have the privilege of already working very closely with our colleagues from the candidate countries and that their commitment and enthusiasm for the European project are a pleasure to behold."
"What Mr Gollnisch said, namely that nobody in this Convention has given any thought to what a Union with 25 Member States would need to do, and whether this would be different from 6 or 15 Member States, is incorrect."
"I am, however, concerned about another matter."
"If we want to make a success of this Union of 25, I do believe that the Convention members should aim a little higher in terms of a strong and democratic Europe with proactive institutions."
"It is also very important, in my view - and I am addressing a point made by Mrs Thyssen here - that our enthusiasm for this enlargement and this political European project does not remain confined to European political élites."
"The people must also be involved. I was therefore particularly pleased with Mr Prodi's call for information campaigns intended for the public at large."
"We at our end all do our utmost to explain to the citizens what enlargement is about, but we cannot do this alone."
"There are, however, sufficient arguments to suggest that enlargement will offer answers to people's questions rather than raise new problems."
"I would therefore like to join those fellow MEPs who ask how the Commission, the Member States and the Heads of Government can help us in our duty to inform."
"The issue of monitoring and safeguard clauses are of particular importance as a way of reassuring the public because it demonstrates, Commissioner Verheugen, that we take enlargement seriously."
"You spoke about monitoring in the context of police, justice and the internal market."
"I would like a guarantee from you that this monitoring procedure and the safeguard clauses also apply to social policy and environmental policy, as these are, after all, very closely connected to the internal market."
"It is particularly in these areas that you could offer reassurance to the public, in my view."
"Mr President, half the people of Ireland were induced by out-and-out brainwashing and a packet of money into saying 'yes' to the Treaty of Nice, having been given to understand that their 'no' was unacceptable to the so-called defenders of the rights of nations and man."
"And, despite all that, the shameless celebrations continue."
"The hastily convened summit in Brussels is being called on to contain the differences between the powers that be in the European Union and quell the disappointment of the citizens of the candidate countries, who can now see through the promises made to them by the propagandists of enlargement."
"The intense and exorbitantly expensive advertising campaign to sell integration cannot mask the harsh reality, which is that, even in the run-up to enlargement, these countries have given the shirt off their back to the mandarins of the European Union."
"It is now becoming clear that not only will certain candidate countries have no net income; they will be funding the budget."
"As agricultural spending is cut and subsidies are abolished in order to release funds for imperialist policies, direct farm subsidies will start to fall at something in the order of 25% to 35% per annum, with unpredictably disastrous consequences for farmers in both the Member States of the European Union and the candidate countries."
"And from what we have heard today from the members of the Council and the Commission, the people of Europe have nothing to gain from enlargement."
"The trade deficit of the candidate countries is several times larger than the funds being allocated to them from the Community budget."
"Cyprus is another issue altogether."
"The Cypriot Government is being coerced in the run-up to integration into accepting solutions which go against the interests of both communities and the Cypriot people in general."
"The way in which integration itself is being handled basically legitimises the disgraceful state of partition, never mind its drawbacks for the people of Cyprus."
"We, the Communist Party of Greece, oppose all these procedures and we shall stand with all our might shoulder to shoulder with the people fighting for their rights."
"I should actually like to congratulate your colleague Mr Pat Cox, President of this Parliament, warmly on his excellent contribution during the European Liberal Democrat Conference recently held in England."
"He made every effort to point out to his Dutch fellow party members that their attitude towards enlargement was totally untypical of true Liberals, because we know that the Liberals have always been keystones of European integration, that they are particularly kindly disposed towards extending the international rule of law and have always used this as a basis of their movement on principle."
"I am delighted that the bookkeeping obsessions that are currently doing the rounds in the Netherlands in combination with frightening scenarios in those circles have been contradicted in a way which can be described as truly impressive."
"I am indebted to him for this."
"His words will help ensure that, with the support of Her Majesty's constructive opposition, the Netherlands will certainly not be adopting a conflicting position."
"I have to say that the European Parliament, from all manner of quarters, has also done what was necessary in this matter."
"I have also listened with great interest to our good friend Mr Berthel Haarder, who spoke about Kaliningrad and said that the interests of the Lithuanians should not be trampled underfoot."
"Considering it was a speech made by the Parliament's presidency, I think it was worthy of imitation."
"After all, if we set up a joint committee together with the Duma to discuss issues surrounding Kaliningrad, the Lithuanian parliament will also need to be represented in this committee, not with a view to putting Lithuania under any pressure, but so that this representation could clearly protect Lithuania's interests."
"The way we view Lithuania and its sovereignty is a litmus test for the way the enlarged Community will deal with small Member States in future."
"This is why the speech by Mr Haarder strikes me as particularly important and I should like to thank him for it."
"My final comment is about Turkey."
"Needless to say, there is still a difficult issue to be addressed there."
"I would plead strongly in favour of Turkey being treated in the same way as the other candidate Member States."
"This means that, since Turkey is very different from the other candidates in terms of meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen, we have to put another problem to Turkey."
"If we apply the same criteria, we would need to treat Turkey in exactly the same way as we have treated Slovakia and any other country in the past."
"This may be difficult for the Turks at the moment, but in my view it is of major importance for Turkey to clearly develop in the direction of a democratic constitutional state that functions well as such, and for them to realise that they cannot participate in the game until they have reached that stage."
"It should also be a matter of honour for Turkey not to want to take part as a token member, having made half a pledge concerning the constitutional state."
"As far as I am concerned, we can look forward to the European Council with confidence."
"That brings us to the end of this stage of the proceedings."
"We shall now move on to the second round of speakers listed for the political groups."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Danish Presidency, which has guided the process from Copenhagen to Copenhagen not as a national, but as a European goal."
"The Danish Presidency has demonstrated clearly that it is Europe's servant, and that it is not pursuing specifically Danish goals."
"It is the European goal which is being pursued, and, as usual, it is the small, eager, competent countries which are pursuing it."
"No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed."
"It has been said time and time again, and our political group obviously shares this view of the matter."
"No new conditions."
"It is clear that a debate on agricultural and funding reform will follow, but, as so many have said here in the House, these must not get in the way of enlargement."
"This is something that must be solved in stages."
"We have been discussing the provision of information to our citizens on enlargement."
"Is it, however, the Commission which is going to do that?"
"In my opinion, it is all very well for the Commission to supply factual information, but in actual fact it is us, the politicians - our governments and the parties in our countries - who have to solve the problem of information."
"I think we have to realise this, because different countries see things in different ways."
"Some things are more important in the north, other things in the south, but the common thread must be that we are carrying out enlargement because we wish to have peace in our territory; peace for when our children and children's children grow up."
"It is a very simple message, and I think that it is the pivotal element in this connection."
"Many issues have been raised along the way, and one which is raised in at least some of the countries is the question of whether widespread corruption exists, which will undermine the fair distribution of EU subsidies."
"It is not an insurmountable obstacle, however."
"We must of course invite the applicant countries to participate in the existing system of subsidies on an equal footing with the present members."
"We should have faith in the applicant countries' governments, too, being minded to do their best to prevent the misuse of common funds."
"They are equal members, but if it should be established that there is any corruption or fraud involving EU funds, the Commission should, in a transitional period, step in and take over the administration of subsidies, so that the money is paid out to those for whom it is intended."
"We wish for many things, including that the democracy which we are developing, and which is developing all the time, be strengthened by the accession of the new countries."
"They bring with them a wide range of highly educated, extremely interesting people, who will enrich immeasurably the territory we are shaping together, and it is precisely their contribution to the creation of a new treaty which is absolutely crucial in ensuring that this takes into account the many cultural and national aspects which should go into building the new Europe."
"Mr President, there is a saying in the United Kingdom that you should not 'spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar'."
"I think we would all do well to remember that in the coming weeks."
"The financial arrangements are going to be difficult to agree and I do not underestimate them, but we must keep a sense of perspective."
"The money for the candidate countries up to 2006 represents one thousandth of the GDP of the EU and is 10% of what Germany has spent on its own unification."
"The costs are nothing compared to the economic benefits that will flow from enlargement."
"The costs are nothing compared to the costs of not enlarging and are nothing compared to the costs of trying to maintain the stability of the continent by other means."
"The original six Member States would do well to remember why they formed the Community in the first place and the economic benefits that flow from it."
"Those of us that joined later should remember why we joined and the efforts that other countries made to integrate us successfully into the Union."
"We should remember the economic benefits that have flowed to us from EU membership."
"We should all remember that the financial and human effort needed to construct today's Union was the most efficient investment ever made on such a scale by countries of a whole continent."
"Now is the time to bring that investment up to an entirely new level for the future."
"I am concerned that this debate seems to be taking it for granted that the ten countries are already in, when they are not."
"We in Parliament have to give our assent and we will scrutinise the final treaties very closely."
"It is vital that the candidate countries maintain their efforts to come up to the required standards."
"We welcome the three-fold safeguards set out by the Commission in the form of economic safeguards, internal market safeguards and justice and home affairs safeguards."
"But we expect Parliament to be involved if these safeguard clauses are ever invoked."
"We also welcome the Commission's proposal for a further progress report six months before accession."
"We must all be prepared, if that report is negative on any particular country, to take the appropriate action."
"The Socialist Group will also be monitoring the social component of enlargement, because we must make sure that enlargement makes things better for people and not worse."
"If I could turn to Kaliningrad, Mr Haarder mentioned negotiations with Russia."
"Could I gently remind Mr Haarder that Russia is not a Member State of the European Union, nor is it a candidate country."
"I should also remind you that many of the problems in Kaliningrad are of Russia's own making, not least the refusal to allow many countries to set up consulates there."
"They cannot have a veto on the future of the EU."
"What we must respect absolutely is Lithuania's sovereignty in this matter."
"Nor must we try to find solutions with negative historical connotations, such as train corridors."
"We must also ensure that whatever solution is reached is practical and that we are prepared to give financial and other support to enable Lithuania and Poland to enforce it."
"The Irish referendum taught us one important lesson."
"The 'no' vote actually stayed the same, the difference was in the 'yes' vote, and this was the result of the positive engagement by politicians with their people."
"In preparation for enlargement, we all have a responsibility to engage with our electorates to ensure that they welcome enlargement and recognise the benefits rather than worry about the costs."
"Mr President, the process of enlarging the European Union by ten more States is now entering its final and decisive stage."
"Our group has always followed it and played its part in shaping it; we have been active in doing this, but have kept a critical mind."
"There are real fears that the hopes enlargement has nurtured over many years - for social improvements and an economic upturn - will not be fulfilled in precisely that way."
"The stertorous political utterances, heard over and over again in this Parliament, about overcoming of the division of Europe and doing away with the inheritance of Communism, block out any more sophisticated view of Europe's post-war history and, there being so many different problems in the central and eastern European states, go over people's heads."
"People are hardly being involved in the process at all."
"The process went ahead along largely administrative and technical lines and was seen by Brussels as having to do with the acceptance of the acquis communautaire."
"The governments of the candidate countries were sometimes not allowed to say much, and their parliaments were programmed to give approval after largely uncritical debates."
"The acquis communautaire, which every country is to adopt and transpose, constitutes a paper mountain of over 80 000 pages."
"If - as is the case - officials are scarcely able to get an overview of this, how can the public be expected to?"
"Under such conditions, there was little chance of the debate on the future of Europe, which we are often told we should be having, really getting going, either in the Fifteen or in the candidate countries, and little desire that it should do so."
"That there is particularly deep-seated frustration among rural communities is no secret."
"If you examine the differentials resulting from enlargement after previous accessions, you cannot fail to see that parity is to come about only in 2003."
"Coupled with that, it is intended that the cooperative firms, alleged to be relics of the Communist command economy, should have the ground cut from under their feet by new directives designed to improve efficiency."
"Let me say in blunt terms that European integration will not be made to work well by means of a reheated anti-communism, which cannot do other than target a fair number of the leading politicians elected by the peoples of the candidate countries."
"I could name to you several good acquaintances of mine who fall into this category."
"It seems necessary, in view of the dangerous lack of information, that we ask as a matter of priority, what effect the European Union has on the public's everyday lives and how we are meant to discuss it with them."
"What is demanded of us is to talk less about transparency and democracy, and do more about them!"
"Mr President, being Dutch sometimes has its drawbacks."
"To tell you the truth, I have been rather embarrassed over the past few weeks about the attitude of the Dutch Government."
"It has wavered long, far too long, over adopting a final stance and abandoning the veto."
"As fellow MEPs have already pointed out, this was mainly due to the Liberals, who are conspicuous by their absence in this debate, and who, in my view, have adopted a small-minded bookkeeper's attitude in a bid to obtain short-term electoral victory."
"Fortunately, an attitude of this kind cannot count on much support from other European Liberals."
"Anyway, it will all be all right in the end, I think, not least because the opposition of the Social-Democrats and Greens will come to the rescue of the distressed Christian-Democrats in the debate that is being held in the Dutch parliament today."
"Another reason why it will be all right in the end - and I do want to add this - is because we have before us a sound report from the Commission which is very open and honest about the long list of shortcomings which candidate countries are still displaying - something which I think is very brave - but, crucially, which also offers solutions to all the problems that still exist."
"As has been mentioned by many fellow MEPs, the vital element needed to find those solutions is monitoring - monitoring the accession process and safeguard measures for two years."
"I should like to put a question to Commissioner Verheugen on this subject."
"Mr Verheugen, you spent the past two weeks in the Netherlands, you talked with the Dutch Government and you were undoubtedly informed of the Dutch Government's stance."
"I should like to ask you for your observations on two specific points."
"As you know, the Dutch Government proposes not to restrict those safeguard measures to two years, but possibly to extend them to three and four years."
"What is your personal opinion about this and what is the Commission's opinion about this?"
"Secondly, it has been proposed to lift these safeguard measures only in the event of unanimity in the Council."
"I should like to have your opinion about this too and, with regard to this last point, I should also like to hear the comments of your former colleague, Mr Haarder, current President-in-Office of the Council."
"Finally, a word on Turkey."
"For reasons that are incomprehensible, the Commission has not adopted a stance on this matter."
"I should again like to ask the Council, and Mr Haarder in particular: is it conceivable - and I am choosing my words carefully - that the Council could reach a different conclusion regarding the setting of an accession date for Turkey?"
"For example, because Turkey could play a very positive role in the case of Cyprus in the next few months and because it is able to prove that it is taking the reforms seriously."
"I would urge both the Commission and the Council to remain critical about Turkey, as we are doing, but also to continue to reflect on how the reform process can be promoted rather than frustrated."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened very carefully both to the Council and Commission statements and to what the House has had to say, and I have been struck, in particular, by the problem caused by enlargement."
"I am very pleased at the outcome of the Irish referendum and I am convinced that it was Parliament that established the conditions which enabled the Irish people to review their positions."
"I am particularly impressed with the work of the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, who explained to us in his report this morning that it is important and necessary that Europe improves its north-south relationship."
"Now, it is on precisely these issues that I would like to focus, particularly the question of the south."
"When I hear about the arrangements we are making for the Structural Funds, where - it would appear - we are giving EUR 231 per capita to the citizens of the current Member States and EUR 137 per capita to the citizens of the new Member States, I feel that we are disregarding the fact that there are distortions. I have already had occasion to discuss these with President Prodi, and Parliament needs to reflect on the matter."
"What will be the consequences of enlargement for southern Europe?"
"If I consider my native Italy, there is a large region in the south of Italy - Abruzzo - which is already excluded from the Commission's Objective 1."
"Would it not be appropriate, therefore - this is my question to President Prodi - to review the Objective 1 and Objective 2 parameters?"
"Is there not a need to prevent enlargement, which we all want, having a negative impact on southern Europe?"
"This position, outlined by President Prodi, needs to become a major effort to bridge the gap between northern and southern Europe."
"Mr President, enlargement by ten new members puts the EU before major difficulties."
"Many of the candidate member states still have a great deal of work to do in order to be able to join the EU by 2004 in a proper manner."
"The question also arises whether the EU would not in any case become unmanageable with so many new member states."
"The necessary amendment of agricultural policy and structural funds alone places the current Member States before well nigh insurmountable problems."
"What are the odds of the candidate member states actually complying with the EU's acquis communautaire?"
"These problems cannot simply be brushed aside."
"It is, however, surprising how often the discussion is typified by unilateral thinking."
"The argument that 'not enlarging' or 'enlarging at a later date' also carries a hefty price tag is heard very rarely."
"Or the fact that the candidate member states have already made huge sacrifices."
"Enlargement is not a matter of meeting a certain number of technical requirements."
"It is an act of solidarity, of historical awareness, of strategic and economic importance."
"It is a process that cannot be changed or broken off at this stage without major damage being done."
"It is therefore to be hoped that the Council will be able to reach a deal on the financial package, the CAP and the institutional issues without delay."
"Particularly in the institutional area, it is important to be vigilant of large Member States practising new power politics in respect of the small ones."
"Given the major achievements yet to be accomplished by the candidate member states, the safeguard clauses proposed by the Commission are unavoidable."
"The Commission must table specific and unambiguous text proposals promptly in order to make these clauses concrete."
"It has been suggested that the period of application of these safeguard clauses be extended from two to three or four years."
"The question does arise, however, whether the Commission intends to actually deploy these sensitive instruments if necessary."
"Its current stance concerning the equally 'hard' Stability Pact is not very promising in this respect."
"Needless to say, this is at present not the right signal we are giving the candidate member states."
"- (DA) Mr President, I would like to extend my warmest thanks for the presence of history which can be sensed in many of the speeches made by my former colleagues and also for the commitment evident in the speeches by Mr Prodi, as President of the Commission, and Commissioner Verheugen."
"We have been able to see how we have come closer to our goal with every passing week."
"The week before last there came the Commission's recommendation, which won the support of a substantial majority yesterday in Luxembourg."
"Last week there was the massive support for the enlargement project shown by the Irish."
"Yesterday, we achieved common positions on Kaliningrad, on the institutions, on certain calculation methods and, of course, also on the choice of countries."
"It must therefore be said that there are now extremely high expectations for the meeting in Brussels on Thursday, Friday and possibly Saturday, in which economic aspects are to be finalised, as Commissioner Verheugen so clearly put it."
"The economic position of the present Member States should be laid down in order to make time for negotiations with the new Member States."
"I would like to thank Mr Poettering, Mr Brok and many others for the unconditional support which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has given to this whole enlargement project."
"I would also like to thank Mr Watson and many others for supporting the view that there must be no new conditions imposed."
"This was echoed by Mr Lund and Mr Andersson."
"Mr Barón Crespo was quite right in saying that, just as a marriage must be built on love, so enlargement must be built on popular support."
"Many people here have spoken about this and it could be a subject for my meeting with the Conference of Presidents at lunch, as it is of course up to Parliament in particular, and naturally also the Presidency and the European affairs ministers, to now get this public debate under way and garner popular support for the project."
"On the other hand, I have to say that I was not impressed by the extremely unclear speeches made by Mr Sjöstedt, Mr Bonde and Mr Modrow."
"It was a good thing that the Irish voters did not pay any attention to this unholy alliance of old EU opponents, who have taken advantage of every single opportunity in their attempt to stall the European project."
"For that I thank the Irish voters."
"To Mr Suominen I wish to say that we are maintaining close contact with Lithuania and Russia."
"Yesterday, the Council gave us a mandate to negotiate with Russia; and this is a mandate which fully respects both Lithuania's sovereignty and its right to join cooperation on Schengen at the same time as its neighbours."
"The Presidency will do all in its power on Thursday, Friday and possibly Saturday to establish a common position on economic issues, too, which will make it possible to conclude negotiations with the new countries in Copenhagen."
"We will be sleeping with our clothes on so that we do not miss a single opportunity to reach a compromise."
"Without wanting to jump the gun, we are incredibly pleased with all the progress made, which has brought us closer to a solution with every passing week."
"We must not now let the process be taken over by cold financial calculations of microscopic significance compared with the gains to be had by us all from enlargement."
"We must not end up stalling the whole process by investing our energies in small financial details."
"Perhaps we, the parliamentarians and governments, should try a little harder to explain to our citizens how little it costs per head."
"If we have to sit there on Friday evening and night discussing whether it is 50, 35 or 75 cents per head, how long would that take?"
"One rapporteur said that the total cost of enlargement will be one tenth of the cost of German reunification."
"Another mentioned that, in total, enlargement will cost one tenth of one per cent of our GDP."
"This must not be allowed to compromise the historic task which awaits us."
"Warm thanks to the rapporteurs, the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen."
"Thank you to Parliament for today reaffirming that there is a momentum in this historic process."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I will respond briefly to certain questions which I feel are extremely important: briefly not least because I was very pleased to see the extensive support for the enlargement process, which really has united almost the whole of Parliament in the political operation which I consider to be by far the most important part of my entire mandate and the mandate of my Commission."
"I cannot think of anything else which is as valuable in both human and political terms as what we are doing."
"I will therefore start by responding briefly to Mr Modrow."
"Mr Modrow, the appeal to the will of the people for support for enlargement might not have been as successfully carried out as it could have been, as in all political processes, but what I found most remarkable, what struck me the most, was this new striving to implement the principles of democracy, solidarity and respect for minorities which has transformed Eastern Europe."
"It has been an extraordinary experience for me to witness the continuous endeavours of the parties in the parliaments of these countries, parties which might be at loggerheads over other issues but which are in agreement regarding enlargement."
"I am sorry that we are in disagreement on this very fundamental point."
"Enlargement has been treated as an ethical and political matter as well as an economic matter."
"Indeed, in many cases, although the economic dimension has been discussed, this great sense of turning over a new page in our history, this great sense of having unified Europe - not reunified but unified Europe, for Europe has never been united - is extraordinarily powerful."
"We have - I repeat this too time and time again, and I learned it in the parliament of one of the countries soon to become part of our Union - unified Europe on a different basis, which means we can attract smaller countries too, we can attract minorities as well, for ours is a Union of minorities, it is a Union where no one person or body is in command: that is the immense, unique splendour of Europe."
"Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo mentioned two important elements."
"Firstly, the need to take the final step as regards the financial framework."
"There is no alternative - we cannot jeopardise this great historic process for the sake of EUR 3 per head."
"Clearly, Parliament and we at the Commission must push for these last steps to be completed."
"Secondly, the problem raised by Mr Barón Crespo of how to avoid the candidate countries becoming net contributors."
"We should also be showing a minimum of solidarity with purely formal measures. I reiterate: let us take stock of the situation."
"As the last speaker said, it is a question merely of a few euro per inhabitant. That is not asking much."
"Just now, I read out the figure which the Member States will receive under the cohesion chapter and how that differs from the amount the new countries will receive."
"There are reasons for that discrepancy - life is complicated, we have limited budgets - but it is a discrepancy which we do not condone, which offends our sense of solidarity."
"Moreover, as Mr Bigliardo pointed out, we clearly have to behave with the same solidarity in the future towards the Objective 1 regions."
"That was our aim in not rushing into a mathematical calculation to produce a figure for the accession of the new Member States but, once again, waiting in order to be able to resolve the issue within a politically appropriate and intelligent way."
"My last comment concerns the issues of the provision of information and the citizens' appreciation - matters raised by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mrs Maes. We need to make a greater effort to reassure our citizens and the citizens of the Member States."
"Mrs Maes explored individual, specific areas such as enlargement and poverty, minorities and the economic crisis."
"I have to say that the Commission launched a communication strategy as early as the beginning of 2000: all the questions and answers which we have received today have been posted on the Internet in all the languages."
"For this campaign, for 28 countries, we set aside EUR 150 million for a period of five years."
"This is a modest affair, then - we are prevented from having recourse to the mass media by the limited size of the budget."
"This provision of information is carried out in cooperation with the Member States and, most importantly, using the structures of civil society and supporting them by using them to promote our action."
"Nevertheless, the campaign will not have the desired effects if the political leaders of the Member States do not work together with us to set up a debate on these issues, as Mr Rovsing said in his speech on this matter."
"Clearly, therefore, I am calling for Member States' campaigns to be given more support, and maybe we could use some of the resources earmarked for 2004 and 2005 in 2003, which will be the busiest year."
"I have to say, however - and I apologise to Parliament for this - that the new Eurobarometer statistics only reached me this morning because they were only published this morning, and that they are remarkably more encouraging than those I read out a few hours ago."
"People usually present statistics to Parliament which are better than the reality, but, in this case, I had come with statistics which were actually less encouraging."
"These new statistics reveal a radical change, which is due to the fact that the matter has been debated, that the press have brought the issue to the surface, with the result, for example, that 68% of German citizens are in favour and as many as 72% are in favour in France, the most Eurosceptic country."
"This shows that, when problems arise, when a clear decision has to be made - 'yes' or 'no' - it would seem that the peoples of the countries realise that they are in a situation where they are deciding the course of history and are extremely aware of the importance of European Union affairs."
"I would stress that we will analyse these statistics more thoroughly, for I only received them on a sheet of paper a few minutes ago and I would not like to mislead you."
"In any case, they reveal that the people become more aware of the importance of European Union affairs above all when they are faced with a historic event."
"Therefore, with all due reservations, considering that I am relying on a sheet of paper for information, I believe that this is a genuinely positive sign, for it means that we are working to change the course of history and we are working with the support of the citizens."
"It is for this that I want, much more deeply and much more directly, to thank Parliament, the social partners and the great politicians who, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and, in some cases, even before these events, awoke in us this dream of a unified Europe."
"In conclusion, bearing in mind the incentives we have regarding some of our neighbours such as Ukraine, it is clear that, while we now have the great task of completing this enlargement, we must also open the debate on Europe's borders, on its roots, on all these issues."
"I remember talking about this the first time I spoke before this House."
"It is not, of course, a debate which can be held today or tomorrow, but, clearly, enlargement raises the issues of our identity, our roots, our history and, by extension, our future."
"Mr President, I wish to answer briefly the questions that have been put to me directly, starting with the weaknesses to which the regular reports have drawn attention."
"I want to reiterate very clearly that we have been tasked with producing regular reports only on the future member states."
"I do not know what would emerge if we were to write regular reports on the current Member States, applying the same yardsticks and using the same instruments."
"Do you think we would come to the conclusion that there was no corruption anywhere?"
"Do you think we would come to the conclusion that privatisation was carried out in a transparent manner everywhere?"
"Do you think we would come to the conclusion that concentration in the media had no adverse effects on the free expression of opinion?"
"Or do you believe that I could not show you, in any city in any of our Member States, a district in which people live in the same degradation that one finds in a settlement of Roma in Slovakia, Bulgaria or Romania?"
"I just think that consideration of the social reality in our own societies gives us no reason to feel superior."
"The mere fact that there are no reports on progress in the Member States does not in the least mean that they must in every respect be superior to the countries that now want to join us."
"This question demands of us that we keep our feet on the ground to some degree and be fair in passing judgment."
"Nor do I believe that it might be possible for a member of the Commission to call on the head of a Member State's government to join with him in seeking out the worst civil and social blackspots and to announce to the nation's media that he is ashamed of these conditions and that he will do away with them."
"As to whether any head of a Member State's government can be found willing to do that, I have serious doubts."
"If I may turn to the monitoring of the safeguards, the monitoring instruments are many and varied, and they will all continue to be applied."
"It is of course the final monitoring report six months prior to accession that is crucial."
"The political pressure alone that this report will exert will be so strong that we really can safely assume that the remaining deficits will be dealt with by then."
"The situation as regards the safeguards is that I have told both the Council and, as recently as last week, the Dutch Government, that the new instrument on safeguards, which we are proposing, must be of limited duration."
"The point must come when, again, it is the Treaty's ordinary instruments, rather than derogations, that take effect."
"The two-year period that the Commission has proposed does not yet, however, exhaust the possibilities offered by the law."
"Perhaps I have expressed that in rather complicated terms, so, to put it another way, there is still a certain amount of room to manoeuvre as regards the timeframe, and the Commission has no objection to the Council making full use of it."
"I would, though, like to say quite definitely, that the instrument as a whole will be of no use if complicated procedures have to be involved and we need such things as unanimous Council resolutions in order for it to be applied."
"In that case, we can forget it."
"(Applause)"
"And, in that case, we will not need it."
"Putting it bluntly, this is about having something that enables us to deal with smaller problems very quickly and not always having to set in motion the big weapon of infringement proceedings."
"If, then, the products of a slaughterhouse in one of the countries are below standard, we have to be able to close the place down the next day."
"By that I mean the very next day, and not only after the Council has come up with a unanimous resolution on the subject!"
"It is simple, practical things like this that are at issue, and the European public will not be mollified if we have to tell them that such an instrument can only be applied if it has gone through a procedure lasting for months."
"Let me say this in all frankness: nothing is any use unless it can be put into action quickly and decisively."
"Passing on to the matter of scope, the concept of the internal market applies to everything that has economic effects across borders, or to everything that has an effect on competition."
"The honourable lady did indeed ask whether environmental and social matters might be included here, but I have my doubts as to how that might be justified."
"If we find somewhere where the environmental acquis is not being fully transposed, I do not know why we should have, in the candidate countries, a fast-acting instrument whilst having to use normal infringement proceedings as regards the present Member States."
"There are now thousands of infringement proceedings every year, so it is not the case that the problem of non-transposition of the acquis in the present EU does not exist."
"I think, then, that I would have difficulties with us actually restricting this instrument to the internal market."
"Apart from that, there are safeguard clauses in every imaginable policy area of the European Union, food safety being one example."
"The safeguard clauses that already exist will continue to do so, and they will, of course, be applied."
"Let me end with a brief comment on Kaliningrad."
"What very much worries me about this whole debate, is the fact that the Russians have not, to date, been prepared to talk about the real problem."
"I do not believe that the issues of access, visas and transit constitute the real problem and agree wholeheartedly with what Mr Brok and others have said. Looking at the conditions on this border, you cannot actually believe that easier access is the real issue."
"I think the real problem is how to conduct a policy that prevents Kaliningrad from remaining socially and economically backward in a region that is developing very rapidly - which this region will do. The inevitable consequence of that will be the growth of economic and, eventually, political tensions."
"Everyone in this Chamber is capable of imagining how political tensions can vent themselves in a geographical situation like this one."
"That is precisely what has to be avoided, and we will do it by engaging in a dialogue with Russia on how we can give Kaliningrad a share in the benefits that European integration offers to the Baltic region as a whole."
"I hope that, when this vexatious issue of visas and transit is sorted out - which I believe it will be in a matter of days - the way will be open for us to discuss this question, which is of such importance to the future of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that brings us to the end of this very important and interesting debate on the forthcoming European Council."
"The sitting is now suspended until voting time."
"Mr President, on a point of order, you may be aware that a number of Members were unable to take part in votes yesterday because they were delayed for seven hours at Gatwick airport."
"You yourself will have experienced some of the extreme difficulties faced by many Members in travelling to Strasbourg."
"In view of the approaching enlargement, are you satisfied that Parliament here in Strasbourg is adequately equipped for the needs of enlargement, given that Members and staff find it very difficult to get here from one of Europe's largest airports?"
"Are you confident that those coming from parts of Europe where the transport links are not so good will be able to travel to Strasbourg?"
"Is it not time you joined the growing number of people who think that Strasbourg is an inefficient and inappropriate place to host a Parliament of this size?"
"I urge you to look into this as a matter of urgency."
"(Mixed reactions)"
"I do not wish to run the risk of indigestion before lunch today."
"Yesterday I had the pleasure to welcome a group of visitors from Lapland, hosted by your colleague, Mrs Kauppi."
"The Governor of Lapland remarked how easy it was to get from Lapland to Strasbourg."
"She was very pleased to be here in such a short time."
"I, however, have experienced the difficulties which you mention."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"Yesterday I wrote yet again to the relevant airline authorities - to some effect I hope - about your predicament, and to say that this is no way to do business."
"This is especially true for connections to Strasbourg, a city with an international vocation."
"The next item is the vote."
"Colleagues, if you had seatbelts I would tell you to strap yourselves in."
"We have 517 amendments, 25 split votes and 56 roll call votes."
"Recommendation for second reading (A5-0347/2002) from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Council common position with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation (8133/1/2002 - C5-0312/2002 - 2000/0343(COD)) (Rapporteur: Gerard Collins)"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"Report (A5-0326/2002) by Manuel Pérez Álvarez, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council recommendation concerning the application of legislation governing health and safety at work to self-employed workers (COM(2002) 166 - C5-0235/2002 - 2002/0079(CNS))"
"(Parliament adopted the text)"
"Report (A5-0310/2002) by Stephen Hughes, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission communication: Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006 (COM(2002) 118 - C5-0261/2002 - 2002/2124(COS))"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, a number of members will be wondering whether, as rapporteur, I will be seeking to refer this matter back to committee."
"The committee was concerned that the Commission's strategy document was rather vague in terms of the action to be taken in the health and safety field."
"I can now tell the House that, in a meeting with Commissioner Diamantopoulou yesterday and during the debate last night, I received assurances that the Commissioner will come to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to detail the action to be taken and that a report will be presented on an annual basis to facilitate the monitoring of progress by the committee."
"On that basis, I recommended to the committee coordinators, at a meeting this morning, that we should proceed with the vote and not refer back."
"The coordinators agreed, and I therefore recommend that we proceed with the vote."
"Mr President, I wish to return to a subject I raised in the debates yesterday."
"In fact Vice-President Imbeni advised me to mention it again now while we are voting on Mr Brok's report."
"I should like to draw my fellow Members' attention to the fact that we are also voting on Parliament's right to obtain the approval of Parliament's Bureau regarding internal security measures, in connection with the agreement on secret security policy documents."
"There are some very problematic points in these security measures."
"For example, the national security services must find that Members of Parliament involved in examining secret documents are trustworthy."
"Mr President, as you are personally responsible for these arrangements, I should like to ask why no debate was organised in Parliament on these security measures in connection with Mr Brok's report and how it is intended to organise this sort of check."
"In my opinion it is something of a scandal that we are attempting to vote on this without any kind of debate, on the quiet, as it were."
"The Bureau tabled a proposal for decision to plenary."
"It is indicated in today's voting list."
"It follows on from the debate that has been ongoing for some time now in Parliament, regarding access to sensitive documents."
"It also reflects the request from the House in an earlier report asking the Bureau to draw up a proposal to bring to Plenary."
"So the Bureau tabled this proposal on the basis of debates and votes in the House."
"The proposal was discussed in the Bureau some time ago."
"On more than one occasion it was presented by the rapporteur, Mr Brok, to the Conference of Presidents."
"All the groups - including your own - participate in the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents."
"You cannot be surprised, therefore, that this was coming."
"No objections were raised when this item was included in the agenda."
"I note the point you made last night and again just now."
"I can assure you that this matter has been considered very carefully and was put to the relevant bodies in the House some time ago."
"It is not an attempt to twist colleagues' arms at the eleventh hour."
"I can assure you that there has been considerable debate and reflection in many meetings, both of the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents."
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Proposal for a decision (B5-0526/2002) tabled by the Bureau pursuant to point 1 of Annex VII to the Rules of Procedure, on the implementation of the Interinstitutional Agreement governing European Parliament access to sensitive Council information in the sphere of security and defence policy"
"(Parliament adopted the decision)"
"Report (A5-0308/2002) by Hans-Peter Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on amendment of the provisions of Parliament's Rules of Procedure concerning the discharge procedure (2001/2060/(REG))"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, in order to accommodate the strongly expressed wishes of part of the PPE-DE Group, my group withdraws its request for a separate vote on Amendment 3, which should enable you then to take all the amendments en bloc."
"Mr President, at this late stage in voting time, it is exasperating to have to point out that the House is incapable of applying the decisions that it takes."
"We decided to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights the Alpha and the Omega of our work."
"Within the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, as custodian of the Rules of Procedure, I was obliged to table a number of linguistic amendments which should have been dealt with in an erratum."
"These linguistic amendments included a number which, in my view, are not strictly linguistic, since they relate to the Portuguese, Italian, French and Greek versions."
"They are seeking to replace the expression 'human rights' with the expression 'rights of the individual'."
"To my great regret, in the erratum, this so-called linguistic amendment is not taken into account."
"I am aware that at the Conference of Presidents, you consulted the legal services to find out which expression the House should use."
"I hope that the House is capable of deciding by itself that the Charter should be applied in this Parliament."
". (PT) In line with the Community instruments adopted recently to increase safety in civil aviation, the Parliament and Council proposal for a directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation aims to guarantee the reporting of any situation specifically endangering an aircraft or its occupants."
"The data that is collected will facilitate information sharing, enabling lessons to be learnt in order to prevent accidents."
"I congratulate Mr Collins on the excellent report that he has drafted on this matter, which I fully support, in particular on the issue of confidentiality in the mandatory reporting of incidents, the only way of ensuring that human error is revealed in the potential occurrence of accidents, which rarely comes to light spontaneously, unlike technical faults, for example."
"I also wish to highlight the need to support the creation of reporting systems on a regional basis that would be linked to the integrated network of national incident reporting systems, thereby providing an entire region with information about various situations."
". (PT) The creation of information-sharing systems from various civil aviation authorities' reporting systems will enable all the actors involved to collate information about their errors and to produce a safer system for all air transport users."
"This directive is extremely important because it significantly improves the effectiveness of the occurrence reporting system."
"The fact that a large number of amendments tabled at first reading have been adopted by the Council in its common position is also to be welcomed."
"Nevertheless, differences remain on which I have supported the positions of the rapporteur, which were supported, incidentally, by the specialised committee: on the one hand, when an incident that is reported is due to gross negligence, the Member States must be able to take legal action; on the other, what was Article 9 in the version originally proposed by the Commission, dealing with confidential reporting, must be maintained because the 'disidentification ' of reporting in this area is often crucial to a better understanding of the factors that can influence the occurrence of air accidents."
". (PT) The disturbing rates of accidents at work of self-employed people and the need to ensure the right to working conditions which respect health, safety and dignity required precisely this approach, which is why I have supported the excellent report by Mr Pérez Álvarez."
"Despite being inadequate, the Commission proposal makes a major contribution to resolving the problem of protecting self-employed workers with regard to health and safety at work."
"It should be noted that it is in the sectors considered to be high-risk, such as agriculture, fishing, road haulage, the processing industry and construction, in which a high number of self-employed workers is concentrated, that a high rate of accidents at work occurs."
"It is therefore crucial that an effective prevention policy is implemented, followed up by actions for training and information and by awareness-raising campaigns."
"Against a backdrop of increasing professional mobility, it is crucial that Community measures are adopted to harmonise the various levels of protection for self-employed workers in each Member State, in addition to the recognition and implementation of legislation in this field."
"I should like to take the opportunity of this debate and the vote on the Hughes report on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006, which contains some good points, to raise the question of the Commission's negligence when it comes to applying health and safety at work regulations."
"My country, Greece, has a macabre sort of efficiency when it comes to large numbers of accidents at work and small numbers of inspections, and inefficient inspections at that."
"Despite repeated questions to the Commission from me and other honourable Members, the Commission has been waiting to examine statistics from Greece for the last five years."
"We need to put a stop to this and to provide mechanisms to monitor the application of health and safety regulations, especially in the workplace."
"We cannot monitor, issue warnings and impose sanctions for public deficits and turn a blind eye and a deaf ear to health and safety."
". (PT) Community data on health and safety at work reveal a general trend towards improvement."
"The situation remains quite critical, however, in some Member States. In this connection I would state that the situation in Portugal is cause for concern, especially in sectors such as construction, the textile industry and agriculture."
"I have voted in favour of this report, and I wish to highlight the following points:"
"The need to codify and simplify current Community legislation in this field and to encourage the Member States to apply this more rigorously;"
"The Commission must, as a matter of urgency and together with Parliament, draw up a detailed action plan, including financial commitments and timetables, incorporating the gender dimension and new types of risks and illnesses;"
"The need to encourage working within partnerships in order to facilitate better data collection and communication between the various actors involved;"
"The incorporation of the candidate countries into the institutions and bodies concerned in order to be able to provide effective technical and financial assistance;"
"Lastly, the importance of a preventive approach to the aspects of health and safety at work, targeting both workers and employers."
"This report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure, which allows for no amendments to the report."
"The British Delegation of the EPP-ED Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support."
"The new rule, however, leaves no option but to vote against certain reports."
"The British Conservatives support the Commission document on Health and Safety at Work, which talks of the importance of health and safety at work and the need to strengthen the prevention culture and secure a better application of existing law."
"The Commission admits that people tend to see the Community legal framework as being excessively complex and unclear and proposes that it be simplified."
"The British Conservatives support this."
"However, the rapporteur has gone in precisely the opposite direction, proposing extension of the scope of the framework directive, new legislation on workplace bullying, a new directive on workplace ergonomics, strengthening of the display screen equipment directive and amendment of the manual handling directive."
"A fundamental flaw in his analysis leads us to conclude that the rapporteur's conclusions are wrong."
"The British Conservatives are therefore against this report."
"The report deals with working-environment problems at workplaces in the EU and expresses concern that the situation is deteriorating instead of improving. The rapporteur proposes a long list of measures, including better application of the existing legislation in the area."
"This proposal has our full support."
"He also calls for new legislation regarding workplace harassment, on the one hand, and requirements for workplace ergonomics on the other."
"We oppose regulation by directives, both on principle and for practical reasons."
"Existing directives on the working environment are not working well, principally because employers oppose them and because trade unions are too weak, and often set minimum levels that tend to commit the social partners to agreements affording levels of protection which are far too low."
"If, on the other hand, we had strong trade unions, and national governments with social ambitions, we could bring in legislation at national level which was more precise, afforded higher levels of protection and could be implemented more effectively."
"We have voted in favour of the report, however, as we agree with its political ambition of improving working conditions in the Member States."
". (PT) This report, which we have adopted, addresses an issue of enormous importance in the European Union, both due to its importance in dignifying work and in creating better working conditions, and because of the scant attention that the Commission has paid to this issue of health and safety at work, clearly reflected in the drastic reduction in staff attending to these issues by over 40% in the last ten years, as the report states."
"The final text, which is the outcome of an extremely thorough debate to which we contributed various proposals, addresses various aspects of this issue and makes certain demands, specifically:"
"The urgent drawing up of a detailed action plan containing financial and timing commitments for each main proposal;"
"Special attention to be paid to the gender dimension, taking into consideration the discrimination still suffered by women, due both to less attention being paid to vocational training or difficulties in access to employment, and to the difficult, dangerous and poorly remunerated work that women often perform;"
"To propose a comprehensive Directive on workplace ergonomics in order to improve the existing directives and to take account of musculo-skeletal problems, which are suffered by over half the people affected by work-related complaints in the EU."
"When Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council, regarding public access to information about the EU institutions, was negotiated, it was decided that the European Parliament's access to sensitive documents should be covered by a separate Interinstitutional Agreement between Parliament and the Council to enable the European Parliament to honour its commitments under Article 21 EC of the Treaty on European Union."
"All the agreements which are made between the Council and Parliament must, however, observe the fundamental principles of loyalty and the obligation for the institutions to make information mutually available."
"In other words, it is not fair for the Council to take decisions on the internal working procedures of Parliament, thereby arranging the institutions in a clear hierarchy."
"There is also a risk of information being withheld from small countries and small political groups."
"The agreement limits the right conferred on all members - and the public - by Regulation No 1049, in that it creates a group which has special access to information."
"An interinstitutional agreement in this sensitive area should be combined with strict confidentiality rules (compatible with those of NATO)."
"Rules like these could have been drawn up for documents concerning external security without this resulting in any change in the interinstitutional structure."
". (NL) There was a time when the preparation and implementation of government policy was kept secret as far as possible, as the ordinary man in the street did not need to know how and with what arguments they were governed."
"This objective of secrecy has even survived the introduction of universal suffrage."
"These days, however, it is assumed that every individual is equal in the eyes of the law, that authorities are accountable to their electorate and that, with regard to government policy, there is public access to information."
"However, traditional secrecy strikes again in the case of public security, defence and military matters."
"This could be justified in the short term if the majority of the population is being threatened by a dangerous minority of profiteers who want to abolish their constitutional rights."
"On the other hand, secrecy can also protect powerful profiteers from popular anger."
"The solution opted for, namely a voluntary agreement between Parliament and the Council, seems more appealing than it really is."
"The public does not have a right of perusal, whilst Parliament does, albeit restricted to four members jointly appointed by the group chairmen, presided over by the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"In practice, the vast majority of MEPs, and even entire parliamentary groups, will be kept in the dark."
"Such a committee on security affairs thus only serves to protect secrecy."
". (PT) I heartily congratulate the rapporteur on his work and I also welcome the fact that rules enshrining a major advance in the functioning of the Community institutions and in their political transparency are now clearly written down, even in areas as sensitive as security and defence."
"Today's final steps are the culmination of a long, painstaking and arduous process of political weighting and interinstitutional negotiation, which has led to a very positive and balanced result."
"What was really needed was to achieve a reasonable and fair balance between on the one hand, the necessary transparency and, on the other, the essential caution required by the highly secretive nature of this type of information."
"Without this balance, no progress would be possible in this sensitive area."
"As a result of the practical solutions that have been found, of the good sense that has prevailed and of rigorous political weighting, Parliament, the citizens in general and all the Community institutions deserve our applause."
"We have today voted against the draft Interinstitutional Agreement concerning access by Parliament to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy."
"The main reason for this is that we consider the proposed committee, which is to consist of only four members, to be an overly small circle."
"The opportunity for smaller countries, or smaller political groups, to be represented would therefore be minimal."
"Their information deficit would increase."
"On order to achieve increased openness and equality, there should moreover be more permanent members on the committee, and at the same time a given number of members should be able to be elected in accordance with the procedure laid down in the draft agreement."
". (PT) I believe that we have made good progress in relation to the previous system, which created frequent problems and confusion."
"The new system, established by this revision of Annex V of the Rules of Procedure, is undoubtedly clearer and more efficient."
"Nevertheless, I regret the fact that Mrs Theato's proposals for amendments, tabled by the PPE-DE Group, have been withdrawn, because I feel that the position of the rapporteur and the majority of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs - which would ultimately prevail in plenary too - might be going rather too far by accepting, at first reading in April, the possibility that discharge might tacitly be granted simply as an indirect result of a motion for a postponement not being adopted."
"Mr President, I asked at the very last minute to give an explanation of vote on both the Müller and Grossetête reports."
"We supported Amendment 78, since it is pro-generic in principle."
"It would ideally refer to line extension rather than abridged application, but the principle allows for the sale of generics in more than one country without repeating application procedures."
"In the Grossetête report, on Amendment 63, we voted to be consistent with our approach in committee."
"On the second part of Amendment 113, it was put to us that the word advertising was open to misinterpretation."
". (PT) The definition of an internal market for medicinal products must not only achieve better standards of health in the European Union but must also stimulate scientific and technological innovation with a view to the development of new medicines and to speeding up the manufacture and commercialisation of generic products."
"On the main issues being debated at this first reading I feel that: 1- without this meaning the total elimination of the decentralised procedure (national with mutual recognition), I believe it is crucial, where the marketing authorisation is concerned, to demonstrate increasing commitment to the centralised procedure (via the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products), in particular when it comes to new active substances, in the aim of achieving more rapid access for sufferers to new medicines and in the aim of ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises are not penalised; 2- authorisation must be granted for the marketing of generic products whose reference medicine has been authorised for more than eight years in a Member State or in the Community (and not ten years, as the Commission proposes); 3- with regard to information, the Commission proposal is ambiguous, whereas it is crucial to ensure the ban on direct advertising."
". (PT) This proposal for a regulation is extremely important, because it is intended to ensure a high level of protection of human and animal health by means of more rigorous procedures for vigilance of the market and for pharmacovigilance, in order to increase the number of medicinal products available, to complete the internal market in pharmaceutical products and, lastly, to amend the aims and working methods of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in the prospect of the enlargement of the EU."
"Where I disagree is neither on these great aims nor on every patient's wish to have more rapid access, at Community level, to medicinal products containing new, safer and more effective active substances, but on certain specific details of the regulation, as demonstrated in the way I voted on this matter."
"In particular, with regard to the key issue of the extent to which the authorisation of medicinal products medicines should or should not be completely centralised in the EAEMP, I wish to state that I, like the majority established in the specialised parliamentary committee, am in favour of medicinal products for human use containing a new active substance being able to receive authorisation from the national agencies. I therefore oppose greater centralisation, which would be disastrous."
". (NL) Medicines are commodities that earn money."
"This is why the assessment of their use stirs up so much emotion."
"Competing companies and competing methods benefit from legislation that results in companies selling as many of their own products as possible, thus pushing other products out of the market."
"They want over-consumption of their own products and the exclusion of alternatives."
"Unlike the Commission, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy opposes public advertising for medicines against AIDS, asthma and diabetes, and rightly so."
"Producers and users of alternative medicines, including doctors who prefer these products, fear that the proposed rules will, above all, benefit the chemical industry to the detriment of natural products."
"Some of these natural products are centuries-old remedies that work well according to their users, but whose effectiveness has never been scientifically proven."
"As long as they are not harmful and their composition is known, they deserve to be given the benefit of the doubt."
"Harmful and improper products that are only produced to make money should be banned, but there is no reason for granting the pharmaceutical industry a monopoly position."
"I therefore vote against the industry's proposals and in favour of those that are advocated by groups of doctors and users."
"We have chosen to support the amendments which make it easier for generic medicinal products, that is to say, cheaper imitations, to be placed on the market more quickly, thus forcing down constantly rising drug expenses."
"In Sweden, for example, these rose by 10 % each year during the 1990s."
"The registration procedure for generic medicinal products needs to be simplified, so that it is possible to place generic medicinal products on the market directly upon expiry of the ten-year period following initial authorisation of the reference medicinal product."
"The manufacture of the generic medicinal products should therefore be able to begin before expiry of the above-mentioned ten-year period."
"Therefore, we also voted against the amendments which obstruct the placing on the market of generic medicinal products by protecting small changes in the original medicine."
"We are also determined in our view that the present ban on advertising of medicinal products directly to the public must be maintained."
"Patients require reliable information from an independent source."
"On behalf of the British Labour Delegation, I would like to explain that with regard to the proposals in the Grossetête report concerning veterinary medicines, we believe that the Commission should accept the current practice in the United Kingdom and Ireland."
"This allows registered personnel to administer a range of animal medicines without a veterinary prescription in cases where veterinary involvement is not considered necessary for safe and effective use."
"This has worked effectively for many years and has not led to any safety concerns in relation to consumers or users of such medicines."
"We also believe that the re-validation of all such medicines should be set at five-yearly intervals, rather than given indefinite authorisation."
"We do not support the Commission's view that all new active substances for veterinary medicinal products should be authorised under the centralised procedure."
"This would significantly impact on the development of new products for localised species/conditions and would exacerbate problems of availability of such medicines."
"Flexibility must therefore be maintained."
"Mr President, the pensioners which I have the pleasure of representing in the European Parliament tell me that they are very pleased that I have voted - as I did - for this text, for I feel it is important and am waiting impatiently for Europe to have either a Constitution or a founding Charter with the status of a Constitution to which they can all appeal in order to call for justice whenever they are the victims of an injustice."
"I am sad to say that citizens throughout the States of the world are often victims of injustices, both as young and older people, but it is particularly distressing and upsetting for the elderly citizen to feel that he is still a victim of injustice."
"The Charter states that the rights of elderly people are to be respected by Europe, and that is why pensioners and elderly people throughout Europe are waiting impatiently for the Charter to become the Constitution of the European Union."
"Mr President, I have had a dream in which Mr Fatuzzo's daughter phoned up my son, who is also studying law, and asked him whether he approved of the way I voted on Mr Duff's report."
"I am unable to give out his response to this, as I awoke with something of a shock."
"I therefore want to make it perfectly clear that we voted in favour of the report even though I see some of the problems as being the other way around."
"My primary difference of opinion with the rapporteur is that I believe that the possible problem of the supreme courts coming to divergent judgments in matters of basic rights has not been resolved."
"As a former supreme court judge, I know what I am talking about."
"Despite this, the institutionalisation of basic rights prevails, and so the vote has been in favour of the report as a whole."
"Mr President, I welcome Mr Duff's report."
"It important that we incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the existing European Union treaties, but I also hope that the European Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into the EU as an institution and not simply into the legal systems of the individual Member States."
"It is unthinkable to have a modern European Union constitution - which is what the Convention on the future of Europe is looking at - without a binding bill of rights."
"If the Convention drafts such a constitution without the Charter it will, in my view, be a disgrace."
"Far from giving more rights to the European Union institutions, the Charter limits the exercise of power by the EU institutions because they must explicitly respect human rights."
"The Charter should be legally binding and enforceable under EU law."
"It is not, as the rapporteur says, a substitute for the fundamental rights systems of the Member States but a complement to them."
"It is unthinkable that the European Union should draw up a constitution without first drawing up a bill of rights, which is why the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be given constitutional status and incorporated into the European Union's constitutional texts by revising the Treaties of the European Union before new members join."
"This will give the Charter a legal dimension, allowing it to be cited in both the European and national courts."
"I agree here with the position of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs; I do not agree with the rapporteur's view that the Charter should remain unchanged."
"On the contrary, it needs to be expanded and its scope widened, given that it is way behind almost every European constitution when it comes to supporting fundamental rights."
"Two years ago, when we debated the Charter of Fundamental Rights, we described it as useless and dangerous, pointing out that it lagged way behind international conventions and the constitutions of several Member States of the ?U. We feared that it was destined to form the core of an imminent EU constitution which would pave the way for federalism."
"Our fears are being confirmed."
"The ?U is becoming more and more autocratic, thanks in part to so-called terrorism."
"It is updating its armoury (European terrorism law, European arrest warrant, European army, European police force) so that it can deal with reactions to its policy."
"As for the so-called social model, the workers know all about that, with jobs being slashed, unemployment portioned out, the welfare and pension system dismantled and health and education privatised."
"Those who support the Charter, including the rapporteur, who feels it is in no need of correction, have totally ignored the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who have protested at every single summit against the anti-grass roots and pro-monopoly system being set up."
"All they want is to exert pressure so that the Charter is incorporated into the Treaties and made binding on the institutions of the ?U and the Member States."
"If it is, we shall have an even more conservative and autocratic institutional framework which will render the constitutionally protected rights acquired by the workers useless."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report."
"We voted in favour of the report, as we support, in principle, the incorporation of the Charter in a future treaty (constitution)."
"Our approval should be seen in the light of the following aspects, however."
"The report proposes measures to improve direct access to the Court of First Instance."
"We interpret this wording as a right for individuals to plead directly before the EU Court of First Instance on the basis of the Charter's rights."
"It would be an ill-fated measure which ran the risk of opening the floodgates to a legal review of practically all EU decisions (bearing in mind the extent of the Charter)."
"We would rather see a system like the one which characterises the current right to plead before the Court of Justice of the European Communities: the rights under the Charter are applied indirectly, via the right of the national courts to refer cases to the Court of Justice."
"The report adopts a rigid stance on changes to the Charter's horizontal clauses."
"We are of the opinion, however, that it is reasonable to accept changes even to the substance of the clauses, as we find it hard to see how the Charter could otherwise gain binding status and an application in law which works in practice."
"We share the opinion of the Convention's working group on this."
"By way of a general observation, we also wish to emphasise that a binding charter in all events must not undermine the model for collective agreements which is applied to the labour market in the Nordic countries."
". (PT) We disagree with the report due to its disproportionate ambition for an extremely poor document in the field of protecting fundamental rights."
"Examples of this are:"
"the desire to include the binding incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaties as one of the constitutional provisions of a future 'European constitution';"
"the ambition to create a legal instrument that would attempt to subordinate the national constitutions of the Member States as far as possible, however much it protests to the contrary (note its aim of increasing Community competences in various areas)."
"Upholding the content of the report will only make it more difficult to protect the binding incorporation of this Charter into a future 'constitution'. This content is characterised by a drafting of rights that represent, in practice, a step backwards in comparison with what has been achieved in national constitutions, such as that of Portugal, for example or in comparison with what has been achieved in European conventions to which EU Member States are signatories."
"Lastly, we should also disagree with its defence of the future methodology for amending the content of the Charter, enshrining, in practice, the existence of a permanent 'convention' (or of the proclaimed new institution - the 'congress') or of other mechanisms for amending supposedly 'constitutional' content, once again going beyond the current exclusive competence of the States (governments and parliaments) with regard to amending the Treaties."
". (NL) Everyone is entitled to protection against administrative arbitrariness and against exploitation by privileged parties."
"In a society that is based on universal equality, as well as the right to individual diversity, individual and social constitutional rights that are legally enforceable are indispensable."
"The EU's Charter of fundamental rights that was produced in 2000 does not go as far as some provisions enshrined in Member State constitutions, the European Social Charter and the Council of Europe's European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which applies to an area greater than the EU alone."
"This is why it is wrong to equate a proper arrangement of constitutional rights with a document that is no more than the outcome of a discussion of a convention that mapped out the common denominator of various wishes without taking a vote."
"A weightier status for the Charter can lead to two quite conflicting results, namely more scope for propaganda on the part of the EU and, at the same time, fewer guarantees for rights of EU residents."
"This is why the suggestion to start accession negotiations to sign up to the ECHR is, in my opinion, the most positive part of this report."
"In fact, why do we not adopt the ECHR instead of the Charter straight away?"
". (PT) To pursue the reasoning behind my intervention in the debate, I wish to emphasise that this report can only be supported enthusiastically by those who share the basic philosophy of the rapporteur, most candidly expressed when he spoke to us here on this very issue on 14 March 2000, saying 'The Charter represents an opportunity to construct a modern post-national society'."
"In fact, quite contrary to the statements made in the resolution and during the debate, there is still a serious risk that the Charter, if incorporated into the Treaties and given legal value, will be immediately appropriated in the most imprudent way by a militant and fired-up minority. Next, it will be thrown off course, so as to effectively limit the competences of the Member States to a very considerable degree, precisely where the central core of the sovereignty and self-determination of their peoples are concerned, tending to superimpose itself on the systems of fundamental rights of the Member States and to subordinate them entirely."
"A year and a half of its being in force in all but name, with various bodies behaving 'as if' the Charter were directly applicable, they are proving this in a dangerous way, and it is regrettable that Parliament is willingly moving towards this disaster and is not speaking out forcefully to defend the rule of law and the rules established in the Treaties."
"I have voted in favour of the report on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and its future status."
"I am in favour of the incorporation of the Charter into the treaty."
"On the other hand, I am against the line of reasoning that it is a prerequisite that the EU be a legal person in its own right or that the Charter would be a step along the way towards an EU state."
"Given the way in which the Charter seems to have been able to set its own terms of reference and its own limitations (or more accurately lack of limitations), it is necessary that fundamental questions be answered before it is allowed to develop further."
"Whilst it is right and proper that a legislative body such as the European Union should be bound by minimum standards of what is acceptable in civilised society, nothing will be gained if the implementation of the Charter continues to develop along the lines set out in this report."
"What is to happen if the European Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights develop contradictory case law?"
"Which will take precedence?"
"Who will gain from potential forum-hopping other than litigation lawyers?"
"How can a legally-binding document claim that all rights are equal - whether it is the right to life or the right to strike?"
"Are not many of these issues really political in nature rather than fundamental legal rights?"
"Was not Commissioner Byrne right when he said that questions of education, health and housing provision - and their financial implications - are best left to elected politicians rather than judges?"
"The report discusses the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and proposes that it be binding."
"A binding charter which is as broad in its application will be a driving force for further integration and supranationality."
"The Court of Justice of the European Communities is to be given increased powers to rule on human rights cases."
"Having a charter which has the force of primary law opens the way, in principle, for secondary legislation (regulations and directives) based on the charter."
"I share the opinion of the Swedish parliament in saying 'no' to a binding charter, and I think that the EU should instead only join the European Convention."
"I cannot, therefore, support the draft."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.29 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"- (DA) Mr President, when I was asked to make a statement on this topic, we did not know how tragically topical it would become."
"We are discussing this subject today in the shadow of the horrific terrorist attack in Bali on 12 October, in which more than 200 people lost their lives."
"It was a completely incomprehensible catastrophe, and has also underlined the fact that the terrorist threat must still be taken very seriously."
"We must not deceive ourselves - the fight against terrorism will be a very long and arduous task."
"The last time I had the honour to speak to Parliament about terrorism was on 11 September this year, when together we remembered the anniversary of the terrorist attack on the USA."
"At that time, I emphasised that the USA had been targeted for attack because of its power, because of its insistence on Western-style democracy and on freedom and tolerance; but it could just as easily have been us who were hit."
"The terrorist attack in Bali, coming as it did out of the blue, has shown that no one is immune."
"The terrorists have distorted the many advantages of globalisation for the purposes of their inhuman and ruthless game."
"The fight against terrorism is a global one, in which close cooperation between the EU and the USA is an essential prerequisite for success."
"We have thus far been able to satisfy ourselves that, if it was the terrorists' intention to break up Western democracies, they have achieved the exact opposite."
"We must let this thought guide us all in future."
"For this reason, too, the EU's external role is a very important element in the fight against terrorism."
"What, therefore, has the EU been doing since 11 September 2001, and how effective has it been?"
"The EU's political reaction to last year's catastrophe was very rapid and dynamic."
"First came a firm declaration from EU Heads of State and Government making it clear that the EU would do everything possible to ensure that those responsible were held to account and punished."
"The EU also stressed that the US Government and people could count on the full solidarity and cooperation of the EU in the continuing fight against terrorism."
"We shall not be moved on this."
"The EU did not stop at words."
"On 21 September, the Heads of State and Government adopted the plan of action which has become the backbone of the EU's efforts."
"The list of results makes impressive reading."
"One of the key points on this list was the strengthening of police and judicial cooperation."
"Particular examples are the introduction of a European arrest warrant, the establishment of a common definition of acts of terror, and joint investigation teams."
"These are areas in which the EU has taken a quantum leap forward by swiftly adopting the necessary legal acts."
"In addition, agreement has been reached on a decision on the freezing of assets and evidence."
"This will establish rules on the way in which the Member States recognise and execute in their territories freezing orders issued by a judicial authority in another Member State."
"It will also make things harder for terrorists in the Member States."
"In addition, negotiations have been initiated with the USA on a cooperation agreement on extradition and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, and it is expected that an agreement between Europol and the USA on the exchange of personal data will be finalised by the end of the year."
"All things considered, it can be said that the EU has delivered all that could be expected of it - and more."
"Another main point is putting an effective stop to the financing of terrorism."
"The necessary legal acts for the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1373 were adopted as early as December 2001."
"We have thus stemmed the flow of money financing acts of terror, the lifeline without which international terrorism cannot survive."
"In addition, a number of important initiatives have been taken with regard to aviation safety."
"All things considered, we have reason to be pleased and proud about our handling of the fight against terrorism."
"It has become harder to exist as a terrorist and perpetrate acts of terror in Member States and has made it safer and more secure for our citizens."
"Can we rule out the possibility of future terrorist attacks?"
"No, we cannot, but for this very reason we must continue the fight with renewed energy."
"This means not only continuing to round up terrorists, wherever they may be, but also providing targeted assistance in the quest to remove the underlying causes adding fuel to the terrorists' fire."
"Have we put legal certainty for our citizens on the line?"
"For us, the politicians, it is a fundamentally political dilemma: is it acceptable to restrict our freedom in order to protect ourselves against terrorism?"
"Are our efforts to protect our freedom and safety resulting in the creation of a Big Brother society?"
"Where do we draw the line?"
"I believe that the famous liberal philosopher Karl Popper gave us some guidance when he said: 'If we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.'"
"This is also the line I sense in Parliament's motion for a resolution, which emphasises that it is necessary to be firm when it comes to preventing terrorists reaping gains from their atrocities."
"The Presidency is fully in agreement with the emphasis which the motion for a resolution places on the principle that there must be no rewards for terror."
"I believe that we have struck the right balance."
"At the same time, the Presidency does not deem it necessary for there to be any further substantial anti-terrorism initiatives within the EU at the present time."
"The Danish Presidency has made the fight against terrorism a top priority."
"The handling of the fight against terrorism has been mainly oriented towards the EU's external role."
"At the same time, of course, we want to continue to work on the implementation of internal measures."
"It is the objective of the Danish Presidency to achieve progress in integrating the fight against terrorism into all aspects of the EU's foreign policy."
"On top of strengthening the EU's international role by increasing the emphasis EU foreign policy places on combating terrorism and by means of a systematic evaluation of the contribution of third countries to the fight against terrorism, it is our ambition for the EU to become a standard-bearer in the UN and other international fora."
"Maintaining the international anti-terrorism coalition and cooperation with the USA are essential aspects."
"Other aspects are the conclusion of a general convention against terrorism and the universal implementation of the 12 existing international conventions on combating specific acts of terror."
"The Council Conclusions of 22 July 2002 on the EU's external action against terrorism opened a new chapter in the fight against terrorism."
"In its future agreements with third countries, the EU will take more account of the contribution of these countries to the fight against terrorism and conduct a more targeted and if necessary tougher political dialogue with third countries."
"It was also decided to identify specific measures with a view to helping third countries to fulfil their obligations under Security Council Resolution 1373 and to concentrate on a smaller number of countries with a view to initiating a pilot project in cooperation with the UN's Counter-Terrorism Committee."
"This will mainly be aimed at countries which have the political will but not the ability to observe UN resolutions."
"In the latter areas, in particular, it is hoped that concrete results will have been attained by the end of the Danish Presidency in the form of the launch of one or two pilot projects."
"An accurate and comprehensive assessment of the threat is, however, a prerequisite for being able to re-evaluate the substance of contractual relations with third countries from the point of view of entering into agreements, for being able to tighten up the political dialogue if necessary and for being able to assess the possible need for aid to third countries."
"It has therefore also been a high priority of the Presidency's to prepare the necessary analysis of individual countries and regions."
"The work is making good progress, and we anticipate that the necessary analytical bases will soon be in place."
"We must send the message to our discussion partners in third countries that the way in which they handle the fight against terror will have a considerable influence on their relations with the EU."
"I am pleased, therefore, that this idea is expressed in the motion for a resolution."
"The EU can certainly be proud of its efforts in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attack."
"We have put our own house in order in conformity with the UN resolutions, and we have done this in such a way that legal certainty for our citizens has been respected."
"Now it is important to turn our gaze outwards and play the international role which is expected of us."
"We have to maintain the anti-terrorism coalition and intensive cooperation with our closest partners, the USA in particular: in this way we have hope of success."
"I therefore hope for the continuing support of Parliament for the line taken here and I would thank the two Commissioners for their cooperation in this field."
"Mr President, Mr Haarder, ladies and gentlemen, the recent tragic events in Indonesia are proof that terrorism, a mindless and cowardly crime, can still strike and inflict devastating consequences, despite the efforts, over the last year, of the international community in general, and the European Union in particular."
"These events can only strengthen our belief that we must relentlessly combat this terror using all the resources available and from a global perspective."
"The European Union has a major role to play in this fight, as Minister Haarder has so skilfully illustrated."
"Our response to terrorism is based on the determination to rapidly provide the European Union and its Member States with the resources to cooperate more effectively, and for this cooperation to be undertaken with full respect for our democratic principles, with a view to enhance both the protection of fundamental freedoms and the rule of law."
"Furthermore, it must be noted that the reason why the European Union's reaction in the wake of the 11 September attacks was so swift is largely due to the synergy between our institutions, namely Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
"This synergy was equally evident in the implementation of an inter-pillar approach which was able to respond to the magnitude of the challenge posed by terrorism, whether it be international terrorism or terrorism within each of our Member States."
"I do not wish to go back over the benefits that have already been gained from implementing the strategy that we adopted last year."
"I shall instead speak about the fact that, following the Commission proposals, the Union adopted a common definition of terrorism, harmonised the penalties applicable to acts of terrorism and created a European arrest warrant."
"These instruments are proving to be useful in the negotiations of the World Convention against Terrorism which is taking place within the United Nations."
"With regard to police cooperation, considerable progress has been made in strengthening operational collaboration between the national anti-terrorism forces and Europol."
"This operational cooperation is sometimes not particularly obvious, but it exists and it has been much improved over the last year."
"The Commission can only welcome the efforts made to improve analytical capabilities, especially as far as Europol's assessment of the terrorist threat is concerned, and particularly as regards the specific measures which have been taken to increase the amount of information provided to Europol, including the exchange between police forces and information services of the Member States, and to ensure that this tool for cooperation and analysis is improved and used more widely."
"Following the European Parliament's initiative, the Commission itself proposed to the Council to finance, from the Community budget, specific activities designed to provide Europol with the additional resources required to strengthen and coordinate the action of Member States in the fight against terrorism."
"As far as the fight against the financing of terrorism in Europe is concerned, I note that work is continuing on the development of instruments which facilitate the freezing of assets and block the funds of terrorist organisations, and also in the area of mutual recognition which will make it possible to act upon instructions to freeze assets that are issued by a judiciary authority of one Member State in another Member State."
"In 2003, the Commission will undertake an assessment of the mechanisms adopted against financial crime and, in parallel, will put forward a proposal on freezing and confiscating funds of entities controlled by individuals involved in the financing of terrorist activities. This is to ensure that legitimate activities cannot be used to finance terrorism."
"The protection of our external borders has also been the subject of intense work and of some initial innovative proposals, which some consider to be audacious, but which, in my view, are perfect for weighing up the many challenges that the Union must be prepared to face in order to safeguard its stability and domestic security."
"Turning to matters beyond our own borders, and without going into too much detail with regard to our actions, as Commissioner Patten will come back to this subject, our cooperation with the United States deserves a particular mention."
"The agreement on strategic cooperation between Europol and the United States, which provides for the exchange of strategic information and liaison officers, is a good example of this cooperation."
"We are currently working to extend this cooperation at police level by means of cooperation at judiciary level within the framework of Eurojust."
"The agreements currently being negotiated, whether they relate to the exchange of personal data, extradition or mutual assistance, will also play a crucial role."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the mandates issued by the Council enforce the guarantee of the full respect of our values and our principles of law through these future cooperation agreements."
"Let us reiterate, however, assuming that this is necessary: what is currently at stake in the fight against terrorism is not only the protection of our principles, it is, first and foremost, the protection of our fellow citizens as well as the guarantee, in times of misfortune, that solidarity can be demonstrated."
"I will also point out that, last week, the Commission proposed that all victims of crime and terrorism in the European Union will be compensated for the personal injury and losses that they have suffered, and that a minimum standard will be determined with regard to this compensation."
"Solidarity and prevention are also at the heart of the very practical initiatives taken in the area of air safety and civil protection in order to improve coordination and cooperation between Member States, including issues relating to public health and the protection of public facilities essential for community life, such as water supply or electricity or nuclear power stations."
"For the first time, on 27 and 28 October, a European civil protection exercise will simulate the consequences of a terrorist attack involving radiological and chemical materials, in order to test the new surveillance and information centre established by the Commission."
"These considerable efforts must not and will not stop there, however."
"The prevention and the fight against terrorism require, more than ever before, the strengthening of the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice."
"This is one of the major challenges of our work within the Convention on the future of Europe."
"The Commission will put forward proposals for institutional reform so that the Union has all the resources necessary to contend with, in a diligent and effective manner, the challenges we currently face and, above all, the challenges that the future holds."
"Mr President, I welcome the chance to contribute to this debate."
"As both the President-in-Office and my friend and colleague, Mr Vitorino, have said, recent events in Indonesia show clearly that the threat to the international community from terrorist attacks is still very real - despite the enormous amount of work we have undertaken in the last year in an effort to counter that threat."
"Our sympathy and condolences go out to all those who suffered bereavement and horrendous injury in Bali."
"We think in particular of our friends in Australia and promise them that we will be exploring ways in which we can work closely with them to confront terrorism in all its manifestations."
"We will shortly be sending a high-level troika to Indonesia to discuss the contribution we can make to this campaign."
"That troika will be going on to Australia to ensure that we can involve ourselves as fully as possible, working in cooperation with the Australians as well."
"We in the European Union have been at the forefront of the international effort to combat terrorism."
"Our actions in the immediate aftermath of 11 September demonstrate a point I have made in the context of the debate on the effectiveness of the European Union's foreign and security policy: when the political will is there, we can take effective action regardless of the institutional architecture."
"Within days of the attack on America, a series of concrete measures was tabled by the European Commission."
"This led to a Plan of Action adopted, as has been said, by a special European Council on 21 September."
"A week later the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1373 - a truly landmark resolution setting out for the first time a clear set of actions which all Member States must follow to combat terrorism."
"And I say 'must' advisedly."
"It is a resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which means that it is mandatory."
"It is a mark of the strength of international outrage following the 11 September attacks that such a resolution could be adopted with universal support."
"The European Union's action plan is not cast in stone."
"We have adapted it to reflect new realities, including the adoption of Resolution 1373."
"We have also prepared a 'road map' setting out the means of implementing the action plan."
"We have taken practical steps at Union level to outlaw terrorist organisations and cut off their funding, as previous speakers have said."
"My colleague has just outlined the significant steps taken on police and judicial cooperation, border security and other internal questions."
"But all such measures to combat terrorism can only be truly effective if they are applied everywhere - if there are no hiding places left for terrorists and their sources of funding dry up."
"The new challenge now before us is, therefore, to help those countries which cannot - for reasons of institutional weakness, lack of expertise or lack of financial resources - fully implement Resolution 1373 themselves."
"Here the European Union clearly has a crucial role to play."
"Much of the work which needs to be done is in areas where the European Union has built up an enormous amount of expertise through its programmes such as Phare, Tacis, Meda and CARDS."
"I am thinking here of the work we are already doing, helping our partner countries establish effective law enforcement institutions, improve border management and fight money-laundering."
"In addition to the work under way, the European Council conclusions of 22 July asked us to consider what more we could do."
"We have just agreed a strategy, endorsed by the Council at Coreper on 3 October, of identifying pilot countries where we judge there is a clear need for help and we feel the Commission has a comparative advantage."
"We are looking at the possibilities for action in countries of high importance in the fight against terrorism: in Central Asia, South and South-East Asia and the Gulf."
"We hope to send missions to some of these countries very soon to work up concrete projects, notably in the area of terrorist financing."
"We have also incorporated the fight against terrorism into all aspects of our external relations."
"We are systematically evaluating our relationships with third countries in the light of the support those countries might give to terrorism."
"In this context, we are examining where counter-terrorism cooperation elements can be added to, or form part of new agreements, as has been the case in our association agreements with Lebanon, Algeria and Chile."
"However, it is worth remembering that our external action goes wider than political dialogue."
"The European Union is a massive provider of development assistance. We provide about 55% of total international assistance and as much as two thirds of all grant aid."
"This is an often forgotten contribution to international security in its widest sense."
"Poverty and environmental degradation do not cause or justify terrorism."
"Nor are the poor more wicked than anyone else."
"But just as poor people are the major victims of crime in rich societies, so political instability and violence are more prevalent in the poorest countries."
"Nowhere is this clearer than in failed or failing states."
"If we are to deny Al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks the territory from which to plan future atrocities, we must do all we can to bolster weak or failing states."
"Our action in Afghanistan is a case in point."
"The European Union is the main donor helping to rebuild this shattered country."
"The Community alone has pledged over EUR 1 billion from the budget over the next five years, involving a substantial contribution to the operating costs of the new government, including salaries for police, nurses, doctors, teachers and civil servants."
"This is what we have done so far in the fight against terrorism."
"But I want to close with the thought that we can take a wide or a narrow view of counter-terrorist action."
"The narrow view focuses exclusively on terrorists and terrorist acts, on tracking down the former and preventing or punishing the latter."
"But there is a wider view too: our actions must be seen in the context of our unswerving support for democracy, human rights and the rule of law."
"We have a wide range of instruments at our disposal to tackle the root causes of terrorism, both in terms of poverty and economic development, and of institution building and the rule of law."
"It is here that our contribution to the fight against terrorism will have the most impact."
"The fight against terrorism is not like a conventional military campaign."
"It is unlikely to have a beginning, a middle and a glorious end, with surrender documents and peace treaties."
"It will go on and on, in many different shapes and forms, a few thousand terrorists against the whole of humanity."
"Earlier the President-in-Office quoted from Karl Popper's The Open Society and Its Enemies."
"I suspect that, for our generation, it was almost as important a document in shaping our attitudes as any by the great political philosophers."
"When Karl Popper wrote the words quoted, he was referring to the enemy of totalitarianism - a much clearer enemy."
"In response to that, drawing on other political philosophers like Burke, he argued that, to some extent, liberty had to be limited in order to be maintained."
"We face a different problem today."
"The ability to deliver terrorist assaults on free societies is much easier in open societies."
"The only way to make terrorism absolutely impossible is by a sort of global Orwellianism, which would itself provoke from liberals, like the President-in-Office and myself, the sort of assault others might regard as terrorist."
"We have a real paradox here."
"That is why it is so important that open societies and liberal democracies, without losing their values, work together comprehensively, cooperatively and intelligently."
"To prosecute the campaign against terrorism will require international cooperation of unprecedented breadth and depth: political cooperation, economic cooperation and security cooperation."
"The European Union must play its part in those efforts - vigorously, generously and creatively - a key partner, I hope, in a well-planned and resolutely pursued campaign of multilateral engagement."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, I want now to put a protest on the record."
"These resolutions, to which the groups have now tabled amendments, were prepared by two committees."
"I do not think it right or proper that my colleague from the other committee is not also heading the list of speakers."
"I ask that the list of speakers be amended to enable my colleague to be given the floor after me, and to be followed by speakers from the groups."
"I do not believe that anyone from the other groups has any objection to this."
"It is indeed symbolic that the issue of terrorism should be dealt with by these two committees."
"The fact that the group's amendments refer to work we did and presented together makes it clear that we are dealing here with something completely new, the need for the fight against the cancerous growth of terrorism to be the common cause in which internal and external security unite."
"No longer can traditional methods of policing and repressive measures within states bring us success, nor can this situation be got round by traditional military means any more."
"A new definition of security policy is now called for, one that leaves no doubt that we are dealing here with a problem that knows no frontiers."
"No longer does the antagonist stand behind a fixed border; now he is within our own frontiers."
"He is mainly within borders that protect him, because he is there to prepare himself to do something in another country, which means that borders no longer separate us from the enemy but protect him."
"It is for this reason that we have to develop new methods, and today we are endeavouring to put forward a number of proposals."
"What is in any case quite clear in all this is that there is a need for cooperation in all military and internal security matters on the part of the armed forces, the security services and the secret services, by which information may be gained as to how to take action against terrorism."
"It is wholly unacceptable for citizens to be killed in our States through the nation states' unwillingness to exchange information."
"I do think that, however important the steps taken in the aftermath of 11 September, only a part of what was discussed at the time has become reality."
"Commissioner Patten made particularly explicit reference to the terrible event in Bali, which has again demonstrated the way in which incidents of this kind will continue to proliferate."
"It must be made clear, though, that they can be successfully combated only if we respect the rule of law, including international law."
"We may not ourselves respond by breaking the law, but we must be in a position to be ready for action while at the same time guaranteeing the rule of law and international law."
"Hence the complicated situation we are in, which has to do with the United Nations and the role played by the Security Council."
"The primary and most important function of the Security Council is to be a way ahead in external policy matters, but it cannot be the only way."
"I think it right that we should be speaking here in terms of a general convention against terrorism."
"I also believe that it has to be made clear that the killing of civilians in terrorist acts can be justified neither by religion nor by poverty nor by anything else."
"There can be no excuse for terrorism - no excuse whatsoever!"
"Mr President, quite apart from whatever the Conference of Presidents may have determined, I would nonetheless like to insist that we should actually stick to the Rules of Procedure."
"You said that the authors come first."
"The authors are the two appointed by the committees."
"Then it says there that these reports are to be replaced by amendments from this or that person."
"That is the normal procedure with amendments."
"Both the authors are sitting here."
"Perhaps a mistake has been made!"
"Perhaps the bureau, and in particular its officials, are flexible enough to concede such a mistake, so that we can try something really completely new and not let our lack of flexibility show how incapable we are of policy-making."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I would like to insist that the chairman of my committee, Mr Hernández Mollar, speaks ahead of me."
"Mr Brok is right: this is a joint motion from the two committees."
"As the Liberal Group spokeswoman on the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, I wish the chairman of my committee to speak ahead of me."
"If the rules do not provide for that, they should."
"Let us be flexible enough to accept what should happen."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"On behalf of my political group, I would like to highlight and record here that the speed at which decisions have been taken by the European Union since 11 September must be a sign of political will and the great things it can achieve."
"I would remind you of this because, one year on, we are worried to see that the application of these decisions is not taking place as quickly."
"We need political will, but - and I reiterate the words of the chairman of my committee - we also need new procedures that will enable us to fulfil the citizens' demands."
"The Convention needs to address this issue and propose the necessary amendments in order to achieve a single structure that covers the area of internal justice."
"And this, which may appear to be incomprehensible Community jargon, means things such as being able to have a coherent legal basis - which we do not have at the moment - to be able to freeze the assets of terrorists operating within the European Union, and being able to resolve matters such as Europol."
"I would like to ask the Council whether, once again, we are going to allow Parliament to allocate a Community budget to Europol, and if we are going to allow that budget to remain pro memoria, without spending it, and how much longer we will be able to explain this to the citizens."
"I would ask you directly whether you are prepared to work towards an operational Eurojust, towards solving problems such as differing levels of data protection. I hope that you are and that you will fully involve Parliament in this work, as you did in reacting to 11 September, thereby showing this to be positive."
"We also believe that these measures cannot be separated from other measures designed to reinforce our society's defence."
"Defence of the Rule of Law, increased citizen confidence in the institutions, democratic dialogue, great care to avoid racism and xenophobia, respect and compensation for victims - and in this regard I welcome the Commissioner's proposal - and also a foreign policy based on these principles: strength in the fight against terrorism, strength also in the establishment of conditions that allow us to address at source situations of instability which are extremely dangerous for us all."
"In this regard, I would also like to ask you how the negotiations with the United States on cooperation in this field are going."
"I would also like to ask you whether you are going to inform Parliament of the progress of these negotiations and their result, and whether you are going to take account of Parliament's resolution of last December in this regard."
"In conclusion, nobody in Europe will understand that words such as unanimity, blockage, pillars, etc., slow down our cooperation in the fight against terrorism."
"We need to ensure greater freedom for our citizens by safeguarding cooperation between the Member States in pursuit of greater effectiveness."
"Mr President, there can be no compromise with those who hate freedom and democracy."
"There can be no tolerance of the intolerant."
"That said, we have more work to do to win hearts and minds in projecting a vision of Europe and the United States as beacons of human rights, non-discrimination, respect for difference and understanding of criticism."
"It is a paradox that young people in Africa and Asia gaze longingly at the American way of life while damning the United States as the 'great Satan'."
"We must show, for instance, that we understand the difference between religion that is moderate, reasonable and compassionate and the dogmatic fundamentalism that exists in all religions, not just Islam."
"But we must make a special effort to keep up a dialogue with Muslims and include them in European societies."
"We must demonstrably treat others as we wish our own citizens to be treated."
"Would it not have been a magnificent gesture and morally right to have offered to airlift out all the local victims of the Bali bomb, to show that we were not just looking after rich white westerners?"
"Maybe it is still not too late to do something."
"The international fight against terrorism inevitably overlaps with the question of combating weapons of mass destruction."
"We are all conscious of the present developments regarding Iraq."
"The danger is that any pre-emptive action in the form of a war of conquest geared to regime change will leave the United States looking like an imperialist power in the Middle East."
"The backlash could create a whole new cause célèbre for terrorism."
"We must ensure openness and respect for liberty and democracy in the adoption of anti-terrorism measures, but in the 30-page terrorism roadmap you will only find Parliament mentioned four times."
"The Council is negotiating agreements on mutual legal assistance, extradition and exchange of personal data with the United States, involving Europol-FBI cooperation."
"In principle, that is fine, but there is no democratic or judicial scrutiny."
"Although the subject matter is justice and home affairs, where there is normally some parliamentary input, external agreements are negotiated without parliamentary scrutiny."
"This is unsatisfactory and weakens our claim to be defending liberty and democracy."
"Mr President, there are many fine words in the report on combating terrorism."
"There are many fine words on safeguarding democracy and guaranteeing civil rights, and on the prevention of civil crises."
"The truth is, however, that we currently find ourselves in a crucial situation, in which the EU must make up its mind whether it wishes to follow the USA blindly, irrespective of what the latter may come up with in relation to Iraq."
"It is also worth addressing some of the concerns which my fellow Member, Baroness Ludford, expressed about pre-emptive strikes."
"We start to have a problem if we use these pretty words but act differently, and here I am thinking of civil rights in particular."
"The resolution gives its full approval for the EU's anti-terrorism package, and that includes the EU's list of terrorist organisations."
"We are therefore currently faced with a topical problem, namely that the National People's Army and the Communist Party of the Philippines have presumably ended up on the EU's list of terrorist organisations along with their leader José Maria Sison, who is incidentally in exile in the Netherlands."
"The problem is that these groups constitute a quite crucial part of the network involved in peace negotiations in the Philippines."
"This is incidentally a process which has been under way for many years."
"In any event, Parliament has adopted two resolutions which actively support this process, and I think Mr Haarder even voted for one of them."
"Now we are in the process of putting a vital player in a peace process on the EU's list of terrorist organisations."
"If that does not go completely against all of the pretty words on crisis prevention, I do not know what does."
"We are creating a problem, and I would advise Commissioner Patten and Mr Haarder to re-read their Popper."
"There continue to be totalitarian regimes, to which resistance must be offered; and if we in the EU are unable to tell the difference between terrorists and freedom fighters, it is a very sad world for us all."
"I would like a definitive answer to the following questions: is it true that Sison, the NPA and the Communist Party of the Philippines are to be included on the EU's list of terrorists?"
"Is it true that, in so doing, we are busy dooming the whole of this peace process to failure?"
"Has anyone given any consideration to how these fine words can be reconciled with the harsh reality?"
"Many people - almost everyone, I think - immediately associates terrorism and the fight against terrorism with images of extreme violence like those we recently witnessed in Bali."
"Regrettably, this association with violence is justified where terrorism is concerned, but it is not justified, and should not be, when it comes to the fight against terrorism."
"I am pleased that Parliament has managed to reach consensus about a predominantly non-violent fight against terrorism."
"Let me mention a few elements: terrorism is not a natural phenomenon but also has economic and social roots, and that is precisely where the EU's programmes could provide value-added."
"As Commissioner Patten mentioned a moment ago, the most effective strategy for fighting terrorism is conflict prevention."
"Military action can only be legitimised by and via the United Nations."
"These are all elements which my group very much applauds because they are the key elements of the non-violent fight against terrorism."
"Add to this the concern about the US's unilateralism and the rejection of so-called pre-emptive strikes, the strong emphasis on the protection of fundamental civil rights and the recognition of the need to lay down minimum standards in the field of criminal law, and I think it is right to say that what is being presented in this resolution is a balanced inventory of causes and possible actions."
"As far as I am concerned, this is a European view of terrorism, not necessarily compared to an American view of terrorism, but as a basis for an even-handed dialogue on terrorism between equals."
"What we do have to ensure, though, is that this balanced, paper vision is not imbued with a practice that remains governed by oppression and military means."
"I am convinced that only if the practice becomes as balanced as and is like this paper resolution, will we manage to fight terrorism successfully without creating new causes of terrorism."
"Finally, reference is made in the resolution to Galileo, an intelligence, information and navigation system which the European Union is setting up."
"I have also re-read the debate on Galileo."
"In it, it is stated repeatedly that Galileo is, in principle, a civil system that is not, or should not be, used to collect military information, and my impression is that certainly the first generation of Galileo is absolutely unsuitable for collecting information of any nature whatsoever that could prove useful in the fight against terrorism."
"It is therefore somewhat beyond me, in all honesty, why Parliament is so keen to include this reference to Galileo."
"In my view, this mention is either premature, because Galileo as it currently stands cannot serve any purpose whatsoever, or the European Parliament has been misinformed in the past."
"Surely, Galileo is a so-called dual-use system, and these are two arguments why, in my view, the reference to Galileo in this terrorism resolution should be deleted."
"Mr President, it may be incorrect to say this, but democratisation of the Islamic world is crucial for the security of the Western world."
"It is not possible to prevent and combat terrorism effectively while so many million people are living in a hopeless state of ignorance, poverty, political and economic stagnation and lack of freedom."
"Unfortunately, this is the way they will stay until the West intervenes."
"European leaders, with the exception of Tony Blair and the Danish Government, live in the dishonest belief that the whole problem can still be solved from within if we contribute with diplomatic chatter, by playing 'wait and see' and criticising the USA in the hope that the terrorists will not really strike in a European city."
"No leader in the Arab world has been toppled by a popular uprising in the last 80 years, and nothing will change if we remain passive."
"Europe has simply come to where we were in 1938, when Chamberlain returned from his meeting with Adolf Hitler in Munich and proclaimed that there would be peace in our time."
"I can fully understand that the USA may have difficulty in respecting us, as we do not dare back our many fine words up with force."
"Europe will not become a player by adopting who knows how many resolutions."
"We will only become one by developing our countries' militaries to the same level as the USA."
"The dictatorial regimes in the countries which produce terrorists and pay for terrorism do not enjoy popular support, but the peoples are so oppressed that they are unable to bring about the necessary revolution."
"If we mean anything by our professions of freedom and democracy, it is our duty to stand together with the USA in the showdown with the whole clutch of dictatorship states which are responsible for breeding terrorism."
"I would thank Minister Haarder for his clear emphasis on the need to do this."
"Mr President, on that unforgettable day of 11 September 2001, I was in Washington with a delegation from this Parliament."
"That day is the point of reference for the worldwide fight against so-called international terrorism."
"The Islamic driving forces behind the terrorist attack on this black Tuesday have now been sufficiently documented."
"This threat is continuing to this day, as is evidenced by the recent attacks in Indonesia and Israel."
"There is therefore no doubt as to the urgency of the global fight against Islamic terrorism."
"Parliament's present joint motion for a resolution, however, is proving to be of little use in this context."
"First of all, the nature of the Islamic threat is insufficiently highlighted."
"The resolution does not go beyond offering possible solutions to counter the spreading of Islamism."
"This is not enough."
"We should take the nature of this threat much more seriously."
"More knowledge about the mental legacy of these terrorists is a primary requirement in this respect."
"In addition, the resolution causes confusion."
"I would particularly refer to Paragraph 28 of the joint motion for a resolution which recommends the use of anti-terrorism clauses in agreements between the EU and third countries as instruments to fight terrorism."
"Who could be opposed to this?"
"The point is, however, that an association agreement with the Republic of Lebanon, of all countries, is quoted by way of shining example - a state in which an Islamic terrorist movement, the Hezbollah, is a growing force to be reckoned with."
"This is also compounded by the close ties between Hezbollah and Syria and, above all, the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"For this very reason I should very much like to hear from the Council and the Commission how the Lebanese Republic fits into the European strategy of a global fight against terrorism."
"I am really waiting for a reply."
"Mr President, this debate is being held just over a year after the attacks in the United States."
"I think this is a good time to take stock of the progress that has been made in the fight against international terrorism, but also of the guiding principles on which this progress should be based."
"Recent events, including the terrible disaster which took place in Bali a few weeks ago, show that the threat is still very much present."
"The crucial question with regard to the EU's policy is, of course, to what extent all the combined measures taken have contributed to a decrease in the risk of terrorism."
"Would the Commission and the Council be able to comment on this?"
"The European Parliament would like to be informed more frequently and more effectively about the implementation of the action plan."
"Our grassroots support needs this."
"I appreciate that much of the information is sensitive, but a comprehensive overview of the activities does not give us a direct insight into the policy's effectiveness."
"Are we really managing to drive back terrorist networks?"
"Parliament's motion for a resolution devotes a great deal of attention to the role of the United Nations in the fight against international terrorism, and rightly so."
"This role is crucial."
"We want an international approach to an international problem based on collective security, which means that action should be taken via the UN Security Council and not unilaterally or along with occasional coalitions."
"This is not only a question of principle, it is also desirable in view of the need to create the widest possible support for the fight against international terrorism."
"Fighting the root cause of terrorism is the most effective way of tackling this phenomenon's breeding ground."
"We would like to see aspects such as the promotion of democracy and the fight against poverty playing a clear role in this."
"The policy should not be confined to military or police operations."
"The European Union has, like no other, the complete bandwidth of instruments required for this at its disposal."
"We are, in fact, talking about a form of conflict prevention, which is surely the EU's general priority in its foreign policy."
"This brings me to the special problem that has already been mentioned by Commissioner Patten, namely the problem of the so-called failed states."
"These can mainly be found in Africa, but also closer to home, like Transdniestria, the break-away section of Moldavia, for example."
"These countries, or regions, offer an excellent home and operating base for criminals and terrorist activities, two things that often go hand in hand."
"The European Union should, I believe, adopt a more pro-active stance, particularly in the case of a few regions closer to home - one of which I mentioned a moment ago - and not leave the solution of the Transdniestria problem, for example, to other countries and organisations alone."
"Finally, we are of the view that the European Union could easily be a little more ambitious in its thoughts about its role in the fight against terrorism when it comes to the deployment of the new instruments of the common foreign and security policy in combating terrorism."
"In the exceptional circumstances we are facing, we need to ask ourselves whether there are any tasks in addition to those of Petersberg."
"This would also fit in with our more general view that our activities to fight terrorism should take place more at EU level than at national level."
"If the EU joins forces, this will pay dividends at UN level too."
"Mr President, the dread and panic which terrorism spreads is the same regardless of whether the perpetrator is a lone sniper in Washington or large-scale networks such as Al-Qaeda."
"Terrorism is not a new phenomenon in itself."
"It was not 'invented' on 11 September 2001."
"On the other hand, global terrorism with a worldwide network, high-tech weapons and apparently inexhaustible economic resources is a new and extremely frightening phenomenon."
"The attacks in New York and Bali made it clear to everyone that the fight against terrorism must be carried out at global level, in the form of police and judicial cooperation, intelligence and investigations."
"However, it is also important to engage in long-term, preventive cooperation to eradicate, or at least minimise, the causes of terrorism."
"Democracy is the best antidote to terrorism."
"The international alliance must therefore prioritise massive efforts to strengthen democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"Trade, aid and cooperation in international organisations are also important."
"In the fight against terrorism, peace in the Middle East would be an extremely important contribution to the jigsaw."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party fully realises the need for increased cooperation in order to combat terrorism."
"A good deal has been done; a good deal more can be done."
"We must, however, bear in mind that the chief target of the terrorists is the open society."
"That is why we must not, in our eagerness to combat terrorism, undermine the heart of democracy."
"The rule of law must never be sacrificed on the altar of our drive to act."
"Special rules, military tribunals and unclear reasons as to why an individual or group has found its way onto a certain list are unacceptable."
"It is scandalous that the prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay base are still in legal limbo."
"I should like to ask the Council what is being done to obtain a clear picture of, in particular, the situation of the European citizens in Cuba."
"Mr President-in-Office, you quoted from Karl Popper's The Open Society and its Enemies."
"We must not become enemies of the open society ourselves."
"If we do, the terrorists will win hands down."
"Mr President, the attacks of 11 September 2001, and more recently on the island of Bali, have demonstrated the unpredictability of the terrorist threat, its lethal seriousness and our vulnerability in the face of it."
"In the 1960s and 1970s Europe faced the violence of Communist-inspired extremist movements such as the 'Red Brigades' or the Baader-Meinhof Gang."
"Today, it is extremist organisations such as Al Qaeda that represent the destruction of modernity."
"They believe themselves to be justified in using violent means to bring down the reigning democratic orders, and believe that they are involved in an all-out war, designed to protect Islam from Western hegemony and to impose it on the infidels, as they call them, who do not share these views, attacking even moderate Muslim countries."
"It is true that there are other motives for terrorist activity, of a political, nationalist or separatist nature, even on European soil, which we find equally repulsive but which are today, unfortunately, outweighed by this predominant form of terrorism, which is especially dangerous because it attacks anywhere, uses indiscriminate violence and believes itself to be unfettered by any moral or human constraint."
"We cannot ignore the fact that, due to its liberality and its tradition of welcoming political exiles, Europe has become a place of refuge for numerous radical and terrorist groups."
"Despite its generous policy, these extremists sow the seeds of hate and take advantage of the facilities made available to them by the democratic systems, organise themselves, find funding, recruit new members and plot attacks against targets on our continent and throughout the world."
"The fight against terrorism as a truly transnational phenomenon, which could at any time imperil the rights, freedoms and guarantees that pertain to all of us must, therefore, be subject to a global Union and Member State strategy that, on its own, either within the United Nations or in cooperation with the United States within NATO, prevents and suppresses terrorist acts and, at the same time strengthens the rule of law."
"At European level, the strategy of the Member States must be underpinned, as has already been said, by the effective use of all the mechanisms of judicial and police cooperation and information sharing, also strengthening an extended concept of security and defence that takes account of the need to confront this renewed international threat."
"We realise that the prevention and suppression of terrorism can also involve the promotion of dialogue between civilizations and the adoption of effective policies to combat social, economic or cultural factors, which, although they cannot by any means justify terrorist violence, are systematically exploited and used by terrorist activists."
"It is, Mr President, on the basis of these principles of the unity of ideas in the fight against terrorism, which obviously outweigh the differences we have with some of the conclusions of the joint motion for a resolution that we are discussing, that we shall support this motion and vote in favour of it."
"Ladies and gentlemen representing the Member States, I do not wish to use a word first employed by Mr Prodi and which is now being bandied about extensively and describe the Council and Commission's statements that we have just heard as stupid."
"We must admit however that there is something particularly silly about the problem that currently occupies us, an issue known by the expression the 'fight against terrorism'."
"This expression and the very word 'terrorism' were in fact pretty poor choices to describe an obvious fact, namely that the policy conducted by what we agree to call 'the international community', that is, of course, the United States and its accomplices, the imperial powers, is increasingly fiercely contested throughout the world, so that we end up, as do all empires in fact, giving the label 'terrorism' to something that could just as well be called resistance;"
"Mr Krivine illustrated this point very well earlier."
"Of course, I am certainly not condoning acts which target innocent people, even though, in a democracy, I am aware, no one is completely innocent."
"Let us not dwell on that, however."
"It goes without saying that I utterly condemn the attacks of 11 September, as well as the recent attack in Bali, just as I condemn the recent attack on a French petrol tanker, or less recently, in 1995, the attacks on the Paris underground system, and this leads me, once again, to condemn the fact that the person who committed these crimes is able to find refuge, even today, in one of the Member States of the European Union, a country basically acting as if it were an accomplice to these crimes."
"This goes to show that nothing is simple."
"The fact remains, ladies and gentlemen, and this is fundamental, that we are not a tribunal."
"We cannot say what is good and what is evil."
"We must take a candid look at the world today, the state it is in and we will not fool anyone for long by suggesting that what passes as the West has only one enemy, Osama Bin Laden, Al-Qaeda and its presumed ramifications."
"In fact, those who we call terrorists exist the world over; their numbers are on the increase and they are becoming more radical even as the empire steps up its increasingly violent domination against the populations whose values and secrets it disregards and which it demonises, even though they are obviously in a different category in military terms."
"There will never be peace between rich people who are too rich and too arrogant, and poor people who are too poor and too humiliated."
"It is a fact of life, ladies and gentlemen, that any empire which cannot grow and cope with excessive ambitions and the arrogance of power without having recourse to violence will inevitably bring about rebellions; it is another fact of life that the rebellion of oppressed people is violent, mindless and savage and nothing could be more serious for us, the nations of Europe, who are familiar with history, than to become embroiled in a problem which, under the pretext of combating terrorism, could lead us to feel widespread mistrust towards the developing world which represents, I would point out, three quarters of the peoples of the world."
"Mr President, when we consider terrorism, we find that opinions develop fast. This is true in this report too."
"In the past, we actually assumed that terrorism was mainly a problem that affected unstable countries rather than apparently peaceful states."
"We have had to review our opinions completely, because we now know that terrorism also flourishes in peaceful countries such as mine, the Netherlands - albeit not in a violent manner; terrorists are careful about this."
"Instead, as the Commissioner has already stated, they use the free and open society with its facilities to quietly prepare terrorist acts which they commit elsewhere."
"This is why the European Union and also its very peaceful Member States will need to be very much on the alert so as to fight terrorism in their own countries too."
"Moreover, not all categories of citizens in the Member States will be faced with a threat of the rule of law."
"Sometimes it is only certain categories of citizens who are targets for extortion in our countries by fellow nationals collecting money for terrorist acts in places like northern Africa."
"There are certain categories of citizens in the Netherlands and in other Member States who are victims of such extortion, and we must fight for people in that position, so that the rule of law is no longer under threat for them."
"The causes of terrorism are often sought in poverty."
"I do not actually believe that this is so."
"It is a well-known fact that revolutions are not staged by the extremely poor; those involved are often people of a different type."
"This is also the case here."
"Those responsible for the serious attacks were well-educated, well-to-do people who were perfectly able to fit into any developed society, including Western society, and could even have achieved high status there."
"The problem is often that people's most vulnerable part, their deepest convictions, are taken advantage of and that the evil seed of violent terrorism is sown in the very growth cell of the social organism."
"There is always a handful of people who are susceptible to this."
"It is not necessarily down to fundamentalism; there is a huge number of peace-loving fundamentalists."
"A considerable leap is required to resort to violence."
"We were all shocked by the attacks on Bali."
"We should, in my view, make every effort to ensure that the Indonesian Government receives maximum support so that the state of Indonesia can be sufficiently strong to prevent and fight terrorism internally as much as possible."
"Mr President, yet again we are discussing the issue of terrorism in the context of the appalling atrocity in Bali in which hundreds of people lost their lives."
"Like others, I want to express my deepest sympathies to the relatives and friends of those who have died."
"I agree with most, though not all, of what has been said here."
"It is clear what needs to be done: respect for the rule of law, protection of rights, scrutiny of the action our states take to deal with terrorism, democratic dialogue to try and deal with underlying issues and so forth."
"What more can one add?"
"It seems to me that one thing we can add is the notion that we are not going to destroy terrorism by simply killing or imprisoning those who carry out these acts."
"Of course, it is not the poor in general who carry out the acts but those responsible for the acts are often poor."
"We have to try and deal with the hopelessness that motivates them."
"We have to try and overcome the idea that there is one true faith, one true version of history and one version of truth expounded by the chosen ones."
"I am not speaking here just of religion but also of politics."
"We must try to engage with people, so that we can open their minds and our own to what underlies their hopelessness."
"It is not enough to contain terrorism, although I have no doubt of the power of our states to do so."
"Not all the European Union Member States have experienced terrorism since the end of the Second World War, but a significant number have."
"That is quite extraordinary, considering that we are one of the most stable and peaceful regions in the world."
"We need to engage in education in the real sense, to open minds to the fact that the world is extremely diverse and could be a very tolerant and good place to live if we could only live with each other."
"Mr President, the events in Bali have underlined that there is a need for a multilateral approach to the fight against terrorism."
"We now know, of course, that terrorists can strike anywhere in the world, and it has proved true that we must work together across borders and across the Atlantic to stamp out terrorism."
"We acted rapidly in Europe following 11 September: we can congratulate ourselves on this."
"We want to live in an area of security, freedom and justice, and the fight against international terrorism is the most important challenge on the foreign and security policy scene."
"Anyone who has been following the European debate on relations with the USA in recent months will have started to have misgivings about the imbalance and one-sidedness it has shown."
"We share a strong set of values with the USA."
"Immediately after the terrorist attacks in September of last year, I am sure many of us saw these as an attack on ourselves and our values."
"The USA and Europe are united by the fundamental values and principles of democracy and freedom and justice, of human rights and the right of individuals to achieve their potential."
"We must stand firm on this."
"Despite our differences of opinion, that which unites us is much stronger than that which divides us."
"We must exert our influence on the USA within the framework of a multilateral approach to the fight against international terrorism, something which knows no justice."
"Mr President, an interesting debate, but one wonders what the point is of tracts fifty paragraphs long on the subject of terrorism, over and above their value as a medium for a series of internal exchanges of views between the political groups of the European Parliament."
"If, however, you turn on the mass media to which the citizens of Europe are listening, you will see that the main terrorist-related issue today is the question of the attack on Iraq, a country which is harbouring or is considered to be harbouring weapons of mass destruction which might be used to support terrorist and other activities."
"The European Union has literally become an international laughing stock in this Security Council procedure, what with the British Government secretly making proposals which are then tabled by the United States on the one hand and the French Government refusing to go along with the notion of unconditional intervention in Iraq on the other."
"I think the European Parliament should have taken a stand on these issues, but it has deliberately avoided doing so in the vague wording of this motion for a resolution which, I think, responds neither to the interests of the citizens of Europe nor to the demands of the time."
"Madam President, I would like to make a few comments on texts that I think are somewhat ambiguous."
"Firstly although the largest terrorist attacks in the last year have taken place in New York and Bali, it would be interesting to consider what Europe's response would have been if the original attack that drew our attention to the scale of terrorism, that of 11 September 2001, had taken place in Europe; if the aeroplanes, instead of flying into the twin towers in New York, had flown into the Eiffel Tower, the buildings of the European Parliament or any other major European building."
"Perhaps such self-examination would have given us a greater insight into the ambiguities and the difficulties we face in dealing with the phenomenon of terrorism, which we have not yet entirely renounced."
"The second aspect that I should like to mention - in addition to praising the Council's intention to maintain close cooperation with the United States in this field - is that, in fact, and this is an important point, terrorism has little to do with poverty."
"Poor people are clearly involved in terrorist actions, but those directing operations are not poor."
"And if we look at the world as a whole, the poorest people are not involved in the phenomenon of terrorism: Africa would be the main source of terrorist acts if a correlation really existed between terrorism and poverty."
"But this is not the case!"
"Terrorism is a phenomenon that contains a political rationale requiring the achievement of certain aims and also requires a degree of power."
"And this does not, of course, come from the poorest, or at least not directly from the poorest."
"Lastly, I should like to refer to something Commissioner Patten said, quoting Popper."
"The problem we face today is also one that Popper raised: it is not so much the tension between the need to preserve freedoms and our perception of what the security and defence of free society means, but our inability and unwillingness to believe in the moral superiority of democracy and of freedom."
"Furthermore, on the basis of this concept, which is fundamental to our civilisation and which is longed for by the peoples of the entire world, in particular the poor, perhaps we should be able and willing to act against terrorism. Unfortunately, some ambiguities in Europe today are preventing us from doing so."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Haarder - our former colleague and now the President-in-Office - today we are once again debating terrorism and how to combat it. I think we all agree that terrorism has to be combated and we also all agree that this can only be done at international level, because terrorism has become an international issue."
"If we wish to combat terrorism at international level, however, we of course also need to take a critical look at ourselves."
"As the Budget rapporteur for the Internal Market Committee, on which we formerly sat together, Mr President-in-Office, it has come to my attention that we are faced with much petty squabbling."
"We want to fight terrorism and to do so we need a European police force, Europol, and a successful authority, such as Eurojust."
"I now note, however, that although we in the European Parliament have already made as much as EUR 2.8 million available for Eurojust, for example, this money cannot be spent because our European authorities are not able to operate effectively for national, petty reasons."
"If the national police forces are not prepared to cooperate with Europol and if the national ministries of justice are not prepared to support Eurojust, then we can carry on getting up on our soapboxes to say how important it is to fight terrorism, but we will never succeed in doing so because it is preventive action that is needed."
"To be able to take preventive action we also need functioning authorities, and we will only achieve this if the national countries, the 15 Member States of the European Union, finally make it possible for our authorities, such as Europol and Eurojust, to act."
"I should therefore like to ask you, Mr Haarder, and also Commissioner Vitorino, to convey this point repeatedly and clearly to the Member States in the Council; otherwise success will elude us."
"Madam President, when I returned from the mission I was assigned by the United Nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I remember visiting Manfred Werner - who was then NATO Secretary-General - in Brussels in the autumn of 1993."
"I strongly asserted that the alliance should prepare itself to intervene in the Balkans or otherwise it would, eventually, cease to exist."
"Today, I can easily outline the argument that I put forward at that time."
"In the period following the end of the Cold War, the alliance had to be capable of intervening in the major crisis which was unfolding at the heart of Europe, otherwise European citizens would wonder what purpose it could still serve, and whether it was worthwhile continuing to invest a proportion of their taxes in it."
"It took two long years and the tragic fall of Srebrenica for this message to be understood."
"On 31 August 1995, however, by supporting the action of the UN reaction force deployed on the Igman mountain to put a stop to the Serbian batteries which had resumed their indiscriminate bombing of the city of Sarajevo, the UN played an essential part in resolving the crisis, enabling the signature of the Dayton Accords and the introduction of a lasting cease-fire."
"Since then, UN forces have been successfully deployed in Kosovo and more recently still in Macedonia, helping to restore calm to the area, although it has not resolved all the political problems."
"Today, the same debate has started on the role that the Atlantic alliance could possibly play in the fight against international terrorism."
"The alliance is in crisis, illustrated by the fact that the Americans did not believe they should call upon its support in the war in Afghanistan."
"Does this unilateralism spell the demise of the alliance?"
"I cannot believe so, since the Americans themselves would have pointed this out and expressed this desire."
"The vocation of the alliance to this day is to intervene in European territory and neighbouring countries, wherever there is a potential threat against its values that Pacheco Pereira has just reiterated."
"International terrorism is one of these threats, and it is a major threat."
"To this end, the only way of reforming NATO and ensuring its survival is to construct, at long last, a Europe of defence."
"The choice is simple, either the European Union continues to leave the Americans to deal with military problems on its continent by being happy to play some minor role in resolving problems that threaten peace, much like the Athenians in ancient Rome, or it finally becomes their equal and shares the burden of defending itself against all the threats, which is what they have been asking us to do since the Atlantic Alliance was formed."
"Madam President, terrorism is unacceptable."
"We are all agreed on that."
"It is our opinions on methods for combating terrorism which perhaps differ."
"The approach taken by the EU in developing its strategy for the fight against terrorism is extremely important."
"The rule of law and human rights must not be undermined in the process of carrying out this important fight."
"The resolution that the two committees are tabling jointly here is, therefore, an important one."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has made its contribution by delineating the main instruments which the EU has at its disposal for the prevention of conflicts, for example the development of democracy, and also trade and diplomacy."
"It is of course crucial to get at the fundamental causes of terrorism, such as poverty, violations of human rights and oppression."
"Under the shadow of 11 September, there is a risk of fundamental human rights being neglected in the fight against terrorism."
"There is also a risk of the only superpower we have today taking unilateral liberties outside the United Nations system."
"It is extremely important, therefore, that Parliament upholds the United Nations Charter, and that the right of a state under attack to defend itself is only legitimate if confirmation is given or a decision taken by the UN Security Council."
"To start deliberating on the desirability of UN resolutions would directly undermine the United Nations."
"I note with satisfaction that we are unanimous in our view that a strategy based on pre-emptive strikes, which the US government wishes to avail itself of, is not an effective way of combating terrorism, and in emphasising that a settlement of the Middle East conflict in accordance with UN resolutions constitutes a very important element of the fight against terrorism."
"International law is a crucial element if we are to have a society based on the rule of law."
"This applies to smaller states in particular."
"Undermining the UN can only end in disaster."
"For this reason, it is crucial that the EU stands up for the UN and its charters, even in difficult times, and does not undermine the central role of the United Nations as the world's peacekeeper."
"Madam President, the aim of today's debate is to take stock of the fight against terrorism one year on from 11 September."
"How has the EU reacted to this tragic event?"
"It has demonstrated its solidarity and will to support the United States, it has alerted people to the risk of linking terrorism to the Islamic Arab world and has speeded up integration in the fight against terrorism by means of an action plan consisting of more than 60 measures and a series of framework decisions, including the European arrest warrant and police cooperation in the fight against terrorism. It has highlighted the urgent need to find political means to resolve conflicts on which terrorist fanaticism feeds, not least the Israeli-Palestinian question."
"The determination to eradicate terrorism and the urgent need to set up new and effective instruments to achieve this cannot, under any circumstances, disproportionately affect individual rights, freedoms and guarantees."
"It is the affirmation of the intangibility of fundamental rights that underpins a public authority's legitimacy to use force in democracies."
"By the same token, the relentless fight against the terrorist threat must be definitively limited under international law."
"Totalitarian societies hold the primacy of the law in contempt both at national level and in international relations."
"The concept of international legality is the invention of democracies."
"If the States that have fallen victim to terrorism react to this threat by breaching the rules and principles of international law, they will be giving the criminals an unexpected boost, which would also constitute a step backwards for civilisation."
"The fanatical hatred that leads human beings to attack others and to commit suicide is often fed by ongoing situations of injustice or humiliation."
"This fact must not be interpreted as any kind of justification for the odious attacks against civilian populations but as a factor that is crucial to understanding this phenomenon of violence."
"At the strictly European level, we must here emphasise and condemn the inability and lack of will persistently demonstrated by the governments of the Member States to follow up the proposal to harmonise policies and to create common instruments to combat terrorism that were put forward, in a timely manner, by the Commission."
"Terrorism is a threat that requires an integrated and supranational response."
"Within European territory, this response is still failing to give sufficient signs of life."
"Mr President, nothing justifies the use of terrorism."
"Equally importantly, there should be no ambivalence about this evil."
"But, regrettably, this is not always the case."
"When the United States justifiably initiates a global campaign against organisations responsible for terrorism and the regimes that sponsor it, it is important for us to remind them that they allied themselves to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein when it suited their foreign policy objectives."
"In addition, condemnation of terrorism rings hollow when they fail to take a strong line against the incidences of state terrorism committed by Israel, which have the potential to create future generations of terrorists in that region."
"Just as I would criticise the United States, I am not blind to the inconsistency of the EU on these issues - the Council in particular."
"For example, during the present global fight against terrorism we have, on occasions, turned a blind eye to the shortcomings of the undemocratic regimes we have enlisted to support us."
"Whether for geopolitical reasons, in the case of Pakistan, or giving precedence to trading interests over human rights, in the case of China, we have at times failed to take a strong and consistent line against countries whose very structures of government are based on instilling fear in their citizens."
"They flout democratic principles, abuse human rights and ignore the rule of law."
"Inconsistency and hypocrisy such as this leaves the West in general open to the charge that it is selective in its definition of terrorism and is primarily influenced by the perceived threat to western interests."
"A global fight against terrorism will be successful only if it is free of inconsistency and hypocrisy in its approach and if it tackles the injustices that feed terrorism in the first place."
"Madam President, we may be horrified, but we should not be surprised by the nature of recent acts of terrorism."
"Terrorists have no power if they do not inspire fear."
"The more outrageous, shocking, unexpected and attention-grabbing an attack is, the greater its success."
"Yet there are still those who seek to apologise for the terrorists and try to establish some sort of moral equivalency between terrorist acts and, for example, the actions of the security forces of the democracies engaged in counter-terrorism."
"Terrorism needs to be addressed by a range of policy instruments, only one of which is military force."
"The area where our democracies have traditionally been weakest has been in attacking the legitimacy of the terrorists and fighting them politically in a systematic and well-targeted manner."
"This aspect is not well understood."
"We never fought the IRA politically, because we were never clear on our own political objectives."
"Now we have IRA terrorists in government."
"Too often by our actions we enhance the credibility and status of terrorists and thereby encourage terrorism."
"The message of recent years is that terrorism works."
"That is a fatal message."
"The resolution contains some elements that are indisputable, but it is very skewed and contains the usual ingredients of anti-Americanism, excessive concern with the rights of terrorists and extremists and those that support them, and further support for the federalist ambitions of the European Union."
"We have heard a lot of this from other speakers as well."
"I do not accept the implied condemnation of pre-emptive action in today's dangerous world where weapons of mass destruction may be made available to irrational and fanatical terrorists."
"Deterrence does not necessarily work."
"We cannot wait for an attack to take place before we act."
"This would be a dereliction of duty by any government."
"The reference in paragraph 4 of the resolution to the right of self-defence is incorrect and a distortion of the United Nations Charter."
"Article 51 of the UN Charter states that 'nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.'"
"There are 12 pages in this resolution and it adds very little, either to our knowledge or our capabilities."
"Where is the call for political solidarity and enhanced cooperation among all the democracies?"
"Where is the demand for improved military capabilities and greater political will by European states and where are the measures to be taken against those that support terrorism?"
"This is what is required."
"Madam President, I should like to express my thanks for a long and exciting debate, and I should like to make a couple of comments."
"Many have talked about the balance we need to find between the effective combating of terrorism, on the one hand, and consideration for citizens' rights on the other."
"If we wish to create an international community founded on the rule of law, in which states bring matters before the courts instead of taking the law into their own hands, what is also required is the resolve to act - if necessary using force - against those powers which, using violence and terror, try to drain the lifeblood of open, democratic and constitutional states. There is of course a need to be able to cooperate in taking such resolute action."
"I do not believe that preventive action can be excluded if there are clear indications of impending attack or of exposure to terrorism or such like."
"It may, then, make sense, of course, to prevent such an attack or strike."
"With regard to the EU's role and position, I want to say that we are actively involved in this confrontation with international terrorism."
"We want to see the people responsible brought before the courts so that their crimes can be discovered in the course of a procedure that complies with the principles of the rule of law governing fair trials."
"In the EU, we are very aware of the fact that the combating of terrorism must not involve infringements of human rights."
"Just as the end must not justify the means and can never legitimise terrorism, so the end must not justify the means in our fight against terrorism."
"With regard to financial resources, the Council has, as a follow-up to Resolution 1373, taken steps to freeze funds belonging to terrorists and terrorist organisations."
"The first terrorist lists were adopted in December of last year."
"Since then, the EU's terrorist list has been revised twice during the Spanish Presidency, and a further revision is anticipated in the very near future during the Danish Presidency."
"It would be wrong to comment on possible changes until the list is ready, so I shall avoid doing that."
"As quite a few rapporteurs have also mentioned, the relationship between the EU and the United States is basically rock-solid and founded upon a community of values."
"We are each other's most important partners, cooperating politically, militarily, economically and culturally, and 11 September has bound us together more closely."
"We need the United States, and the United States needs us."
"What binds us together is more important that what divides us."
"At the extraordinary Council meeting on 21 September of last year, we sent a strong signal of solidarity and cooperation to the United States."
"It is binding upon us, and it has been a success that will now hopefully be crowned by the signing of an agreement on mutual legal assistance and extradition."
"It is the case in this field as in others that, when the EU and the United States stand shoulder to shoulder, there is a lot we can do for justice and freedom in the world."
"It is crucial that we maintain the close cooperation with the United States, both in this and other areas, and we must of course constantly work to ensure that the United States chooses to act multilaterally rather than unilaterally."
"I would just like to say on behalf of the Commission that I am sure that one can conclude from this debate that the measures that have been taken at European level and in the Member States concerning the fight against terrorism have been adopted with a strict respect for the rule of law and the characteristics of an open society."
"Nobody can criticise the measures adopted by the Union or the Member States as being emergency or exceptional rules."
"They are fully integrated into our common legal framework."
"Of course, they demonstrate that democracy is not weak when it comes to fighting organised crime or terrorism."
"A perception by citizens that democracy is not efficient enough in fighting terrorism and organised crime is one possible source of disaffection."
"As Commissioner Patten said, terrorism represents a transnational global threat, requiring transnational global answers."
"This fact is slowly being accepted by the Member States."
"We cannot deal with terrorism as if it was business as usual."
"We need to use police and judicial tools, but they are not enough."
"We also need to mobilise military and other resources."
"We need exchanges of intelligence at European level."
"You know from your own national experience how difficult it can be to ensure proper exchange of intelligence between police forces and secret services in your own Member States."
"The cooperation between intelligence-gathering services and police forces at European level in the fight against terrorism since 11 September can be successful."
"However, we need to recognise that there are two other very important areas."
"The first is the fight against the financing of terrorism, which is much more complex."
"It requires extra efforts."
"The Commission will give priority to this issue in 2003."
"Secondly, multilateral action."
"We share Parliament's view that we should give priority to this."
"The United Nations is the first stage."
"It is a source of concern that the negotiation of a global convention on terrorism is currently blocked in the United Nations."
"We must not forget the important role of the Council of Europe in the fight against terrorism."
"I hope that the negotiations in progress in the Council of Europe on a convention on terrorism will be successful."
"In the dialogue with the United States of America on the fight against terrorism and on police and judicial cooperation, we should recognise the important contribution the American debate on civil liberties can make to our own European debate on fundamental rights and civil liberties."
"We should not minimise the ongoing debate in the United States on those key issues or leave them isolated."
"That is why we are engaged in a dialogue with the United States on a mutual legal assistance agreement and an extradition agreement in which we defend our own points of view and our values."
"We will also test the political will of the United States to accept and respect our positions."
"The test case for Mr Pomés Ruiz in the implementation of the decisions taken at European level will come fairly shortly."
"As you know, the framework decision on terrorism will have to be transposed into the national laws of the Member States by the end of this year and the European arrest warrant by the beginning of 2004."
"However, seven Member States have, as you know, committed themselves to adopting the European arrest warrant in their legal systems in the first half of 2003."
"The Commission can only encourage them to stick to those commitments."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"To conclude this statement, I have received four motions for resolutions, tabled pursuant to Rule 137(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The recent attacks by Islamic extremists in Bali, Yemen and Kuwait are confirmation that the community of States must now wage a constant battle against the desire and capacity for destruction of a number of non-State actors."
"Inter-state cooperation must therefore be carried out more actively, so that Islamic extremists can have no sanctuary."
"It seems that the overthrow of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan was only an initial stage in this battle, which must be conducted first and foremost within our own States."
"In this respect, Commissioner Patten, who is so generous in doling out advice to non-European countries, should first ask himself about the welcome that terrorist organisations in the British system are given."
"Far from advocating increased vigilance and enhanced cooperation amongst our Member States, the motion for a joint resolution sets off in a dangerous direction by recommending greater use of the quartet method, which could eventually lead to the Security Council being bypassed."
"And the same resolution becomes laughable when it attempts to persuade us that one of the main challenges in combating terrorism could be the three-pillar structure of the Treaty on European Union!"
"Any subject, even terrorism, can be exploited in order to advance the federalist cause."
"Madam President, with his wise concluding words, Mr Vitorino has not only rounded off the previous debate in the best possible way but has actually also paved the way for the debate we are now to have."
"It is well over a year since the European Parliament adopted a decision on the existence of a global system for intercepting private and commercial communications - what is known as the Echelon interception system."
"The decision states that there is no longer any doubt about the existence of a worldwide system for intercepting communications."
"The decision was based upon a report from the Temporary Committee on the Echelon Interception System."
"The report drew attention to a number of arrangements for protecting private individuals and enterprises in the EU."
"In my view, this is a very comprehensive and commendable piece of work."
"The report has done a lot to contribute to there having been particular awareness of this area in the EU, the Member States and the national parliaments."
"As a Member of the European Parliament, I had the pleasure of participating in one of the hearings held by the Committee."
"The focus that there has been on the ability to intercept communications with a view to obtaining commercial advantages has also helped the people of Europe and European companies to appreciate the need to protect communications."
"In connection with Parliament's reading of the report, the then Belgian Presidency's contribution dealt with the basic principles that ought to apply to any interception system."
"In this context, the Presidency referred, for example, to the central principles for protecting privacy and the right to free communication, expressed in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 7 of the European Union's Charter."
"I should like to refer to what the then Belgian Presidency said about the matter."
"My approach will be a different one."
"In my capacity as representative of the Presidency of the Council, I want to focus on the protection of our communications."
"Unfortunately, we must of course take account of the fact that technological development has, to a much greater extent than previously, made it technically possible to intercept our communications."
"Unlawful interception of private communications or the surveillance of companies for the purpose of distorting competition is naturally unacceptable and a serious offence, and it is therefore important for the Member States, both individually and in a European context, to be aware of the possibility of this form of surveillance and to go on working to achieve the best possible protection of people's and companies' communications."
"Work is already being done in an EU context to increase the security of communications for the individual."
"This has most recently found expression in the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector."
"It is the Presidency's view that, over and above this, efforts should be made to obtain an increased use of encryption, just as there should be a focus upon IT security, both in the EU institutions and in the nation states."
"IT security is a top priority in the common European action plan, 'eEurope 2005', which covers, for example, the development of secure communications used for the secure exchange of qualified public information within the Community."
"The action plan is also aimed at promoting a security culture in all areas in which work is done on developing and using information and communications systems."
"Finally, the action plan also includes the establishment of a Cyber Security Task Force which, in cooperation with the Member States and the private sector, is to operate as a catalyst for initiatives in the security area."
"The Danish Presidency believes it is important for the initiatives in the 'eEurope 2005' action plan to be put into practice."
"Allow me to note in conclusion that the Presidency would also like to work towards a Council resolution's being adopted, aimed at establishing a common strategy for network and information security with a view to establishing a common European security culture."
"The proposal for a resolution calls, for example, upon the Member States to ensure that IT security becomes an essential feature of the individual countries' rules, just as the Member States should adopt satisfactory measures to prevent and respond to events involving security."
"Finally, the proposal calls upon the Member States to encourage partnership between the university world and companies, with a view to bringing about secure technology and maintenance."
"Madam President, little more than a year ago we gathered in this House to discuss the outcome of the proceedings of the Temporary Committee on Echelon."
"A few days later, on 11 September, the entire world was in shock."
"The world changed."
"The role of network and information security proved to be crucial."
"We also found that European society was increasingly vulnerable to problems related to network and information security."
"Before responding to the main concerns raised by the European Parliament, I would like stress, as I did last year, a strong and solid underlying principle: the European Union is founded on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, based on Article 6 of the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"It is important also to keep in mind that Member States remain responsible for the conduct and supervision of intelligence operations, unless the Council decides otherwise, as specified in Title V of the Treaty on the European Union."
"With the rapid spread of information technology, economic growth, productivity, employment and social equity have come to depend increasingly on the smooth operation of ICTs."
"In today's debate, network and information security is about ensuring the availability of services and data, preventing the disruption and unauthorised interception of communications, securing the confidentiality of data and protecting information systems against unauthorised access."
"Full security will never be achievable."
"There will always be weak points, attacks, incidents and failures that will generate damage."
"This is no different from other technologies or other aspects of daily life."
"Society as a whole, as well as individuals, has to learn how to manage the risks involved in the networks and information systems."
"Security has therefore become a major policy concern."
"Governments have wider responsibilities towards society and are making efforts to improve security on their territory."
"This was the underlying objective of the Commission Communication on Network and Information Security, which proposed a number of measures, such as awareness-raising actions and improved exchange of information mechanisms."
"One example of awareness raising is the benchmarking of national policies in support of secure e-business."
"The newly adopted eEurope 2005 Action Plan aims to strengthen the exchange of information and good practice, to establish a European centre of competence, to create a culture of security and to establish a secure communication environment."
"We need to assign responsibilities to all the sectors involved in information and communication technologies in order to create a culture of security."
"The Council resolution of 28 January 2002 on a common approach and specific actions in the area of network and information security also developed this concept further."
"It welcomes the intention of the Commission to make proposals for the establishment of a cyber security task force."
"The European Parliament has dealt with the issue by preparing a report on the Commission's policy proposal, which was adopted yesterday, calling for a strong European answer to the increasing information security problem."
"With the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission advocating closer European coordination, the setting up of a 'security entity', as the most efficient way to achieve this objective, is now under consideration."
"The proposal being considered at present suggests a number of issues, interests and concerns that are addressed by Parliament."
"Based on those concerns, the following measures may be suggested: a centre of expertise should be set up, bringing together competent people that will be trusted by public bodies and national and Community institutions, as well as by the private sector; will help to establish internationally recognised standards; and will be able to act efficiently and quickly."
"Sufficient human and financial resources will therefore be necessary to enable smooth and flexible operation, as will a coherent approach - including cross-pillar dimensions - since security also touches upon certain issues related to law enforcement and national security concerns."
"Let me turn now to data protection."
"Article 17 of the general data protection directive contains the principle of data security."
"The new directive on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector was adopted last July."
"It will provide a high level of protection for processed personal data."
"It includes a provision that requires Member States to guarantee confidentiality of communications and to prohibit any form of interception."
"However, Member States can, according to the European Convention on Human Rights, take measures where this is necessary to safeguard national or public security interests or to investigate crime and prosecute criminal offences."
"The Commission has launched initiatives to ensure compatibility between data protection and privacy rules on the one hand and law enforcement needs on the other."
"With this in view, an EU Forum on Cyber-Crime has been set up."
"As far as the interception of telecommunications for criminal investigation purposes is concerned, the Commission believes that the interception rules in the EU Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters constitute, at the current stage, a balanced approach."
"The dual-use regulation, which includes export control provisions for information security products and services, in place since September 2000, guarantees the availability and free circulation of encryption products and technologies throughout the European Union."
"Its implementation has been successful, and the Commission is currently discussing the complex issue of export controls with candidate countries."
"As for the technology itself, support through the Community's framework research programme, in particular the information society technologies programme, has improved the conditions for developing top-of-the-range encryption products."
"This brings me to the activities undertaken to improve our in-house information and communication systems."
"Following the adoption of the regulation on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions, a wide-ranging security review took place."
"As a result, a Commission decision has been adopted containing security provisions and extensive rules on IT security."
"This decision substantially improves the protection of Commission documents which are not accessible to the general public."
"It further defines the various responsibilities of actors, including security clearance of personnel and security briefings."
"Furthermore, a Commission-wide technical auditing process has been carried out."
"Action to improve the situation is ongoing."
"As you see, we have achieved quite a lot already, but there is still a substantial amount of work to be done."
"The recently adopted data protection directive, the report from the European Parliament on the proposed information security policy, the eEurope 2005 Action Plan and the plans to establish a European cyber security unit will further lay down the modalities for future work in the area of network and information security."
"But enhanced cooperation is also needed globally."
"As an example of this cooperation, it is worth mentioning that the Commission was extensively involved in the drawing up of the recently adopted OECD guidelines on the security of information systems and networks."
"These guidelines emphasise the importance of applying certain common principles for information security, underpin the work which is taking place at European level and are in line with the 'culture of security' principle as addressed in the eEurope 2005 Action Plan."
"In December, the Telecommunication Council will debate and monitor the status of implementation of the common European strategy on network and information security, an issue the Danish presidency sees as a top priority."
"Through these actions by the European institutions and Member States, we hope to sharpen the focus and step up efforts on network and information security as a vital measure to prevent illegal interception or economic espionage, underpinning the smooth functioning of our economies and societies."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to confine myself to making a few comments to the Commission."
"As you know, a year ago the Echelon Committee tabled its final report."
"The work was also widely praised."
"Even when we were still drafting the report, however, it was already clear that the Commission was treating the matter like the famous three monkeys who, in the Buddhist tradition, are supposed to report on mankind at the Koshin festival in accordance with the dictum, 'Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil'."
"One year on we might almost add, 'and do not do very much either', because so far the Commission has not acted to remedy very many of the shortcomings or implement many of the tasks described in the report."
"Commissioner, you will be aware of what we call on the Commission to do in items 27 to 44 of the report."
"The question that is still outstanding is: what have you done about informing the public and companies of the dangers posed by Echelon?"
"What have you done to ensure that e-mails within the Commission are systematically encrypted?"
"And what has been done about training Commission staff in new technologies and encryption?"
"It is not enough to introduce new technologies; you have to provide further training for staff as well."
"Your data protection directives, which are very important and very far-reaching, are actually only of limited interest here."
"There too the question is: what has happened within the Commission?"
"You said that you had adopted a decision."
"Nevertheless, I see no evidence that the Commission has in the meantime carried out the security analysis that we requested, which actually also requires the development of a comprehensive system for classifying people and documents so as to protect secrets."
"That was clear from what you said."
"My question, then, is: who is responsible for this in the Commission?"
"I remember very well the time that you sent Mr Perkins to see us."
"He was the head of the Commission's encryption service."
"He could certainly tell us how advanced the cryptographic hardware was, but could not tell us anything about general security standards in the Commission."
"Clearly there was nobody who was really responsible for this, and - at least this is my feeling - there is still nobody today either."
"Or, Commissioner, are you or one of the Directorates-General responsible for ensuring that documents are continuously classified? Do you intervene in personnel issues and classify people so as to guarantee security in the Commission?"
"Nowadays, every national institution has someone who is in charge of protecting secret information and does precisely these tasks."
"Do you now have such a person in your Commission, someone who is also responsible for raising awareness of possible attacks by the Echelon system?"
"Or are you actually still working with a British fax encryption system, Commissioner?"
"I almost fear that the answer is yes, because you did not say anything about this."
"That is why we are going to give you a helping hand by adopting a new resolution and, Commissioner, should progress on this continue to be as disappointing as it has been so far, and should our points continue to be almost ignored, then we would also have to reach an understanding on the basis of the forthcoming Commission discharge."
"Our instructions to you will be on the table very shortly."
"I urge you to act on them!"
"I should like to concur with the comments made by Mr von Boetticher, which spawned a huge number of questions last year."
"Parliament made a host of recommendations to the Commission and the Council to which we have never actually received a response."
"I assume that other Members will also be expanding on this point."
"I should like to focus on one aspect of last year's debate."
"In the resolution we adopted last year on the worldwide interception of telecommunications, a great deal of attention was devoted to the political importance of international cooperation on the part of the intelligence services."
"An important point in that debate was that the vast majority of this Parliament is not opposed to interception per se and that intelligence services are necessary even in a democracy."
"In the report drawn up by the temporary committee, it was emphasised that effective intelligence services are necessary in our modern society."
"Not only in the fight against terrorism and international crime, but also as a key element in the development of our own European security policy."
"If we want to accomplish autonomous capacity in the area of defence and our own intervention force within the framework of the Petersberg tasks, then the ability and capacity to gather intelligence forms part of this. This is why the European Parliament has called for better European cooperation in this area and better democratic control over the functioning of intelligence services."
"According to our report, this aspect too leaves a great deal to be desired in a number of countries."
"Under pressure from international terrorism and the events of last year, cooperation between the intelligence services seems to have improved, not only within the European Union but also with the United States."
"With regard to democratic control, however, little appears to have changed."
"European citizens are entitled to know that the privacy enshrined in their national legislation is also protected in the event of international cooperation between the intelligence services."
"European citizens and companies must be able to rely on the confidentiality of their communications being guaranteed in the same way across the EU."
"They must be given the guarantee that European intelligence services are not misused to steal company secrets but to fight criminal activities effectively."
"Needless to say, we should like to thank Commissioner Liikanen for informing this House about the technical aspects of the worldwide interception of communications on behalf of the Commission."
"It is, however, regrettable, that Commissioner Patten is not here to inform us further about the international aspects I mentioned a moment ago."
"Without sufficient clarity on this score, EU policy is not only incomplete but also lacks credibility."
"Council and Commissioner, Mr Haarder spoke very clearly about the need for protecting communications and also stated that technology allows the communications to be tapped on a large scale."
"Not only does this technology make this possible, it is also being done, as was illustrated from our inquiry."
"I then ask myself what we are doing about this."
"Mr Liikanen mentioned the Charter of constitutional rights, but the Liberal group was quite firm in its belief that a legal framework is necessary in order to curb illegal tapping practices and to clearly define legal interception with effective control at European level."
"The Liberal group opted for a dual-track approach in this respect, namely the protection of the rights and privacy of the individual citizen on the one hand, and the safeguarding of the EU's economic interests by means of measures to prevent industrial espionage on the other."
"We also proposed specific measures."
"Instead, the Justice and Home Affairs Council is now talking about far-reaching competences of the Member States for data storage of both telecommunications and the Internet."
"Who actually protects our citizens against the authorities?"
"My next point is that we also asked for very specific measures to stimulate awareness among citizens and the business community."
"This includes the development of European encryption software and security analysis."
"I would now ask both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner: what is actually being done about this, what has been accomplished so far and what is in the pipeline on this score?"
"I do in fact have the feeling that little is being done about any of our recommendations, and I should like to draw your attention once again to Mrs Flesch's remark directed at Commissioner Liikanen."
"Madam President, until a few years ago, any attempt at dialogue with the Council or the Commission over Echelon would be cut short on the pretext that it was just a rumour in the press on which there was no comment to be made."
"After the work of the Echelon committee, the European Union finally acknowledged this interception system exists, and the subject of this debate - as Mrs Flesch rightly pointed out at the beginning of the debate - is Echelon."
"Nothing more, nothing less, so let us not beat about the bush."
"I have nothing more to say, except that, having heard Mr von Boetticher and all the other Members speak, I associate myself with what they have said and agree with them, for they have already given a comprehensive picture of what was not done after that work had been carried out."
"We poured time and human resources into the issue but we have very little to show for it, for, until today, neither the Commission nor the Council have made any effort to protect the citizens."
"There is another dimension to the problem: companies and institutions, with all the human and material resources available to them, are quite able to protect themselves, but the real message of the Echelon committee was that the citizens and their privacy need to be protected, that there is a fundamental right to privacy."
"Well then, thus far, nothing has been done in Europe in this area and I feel that the failure of the institutions and Parliament itself to take any practical steps regarding Echelon and the matter of interception of communications damages their legitimacy."
"The legitimacy of our institutions is truly diminished by this."
"If I may be so bold, it is my opinion that the Council and the Commission should, at least, consider drawing up a framework decision protecting the citizens from arbitrary interception of communications and giving them the right to plead their cause before a court, to appeal to a national court for prosecution of these types of interception."
"Mr President, like other speakers, I think it is deplorable that nothing has happened since Parliament's Echelon report."
"People still do not feel adequately protected."
"The Council should adopt a framework decision which provides protection against the activities of intelligence services of other Member States or third countries."
"The very existence of systems for the indiscriminate interception of communications is a violation of Article 6 of the EU Treaty, as the Commissioner himself has recognised."
"It is also essential that an agreement should be negotiated and signed between the European Union and the United States, stipulating that each party should observe the provisions governing protection of the privacy of citizens and the confidentiality of business communications."
"My group is strongly opposed to the actions taken by the Council with a view to bringing telecommunications interception capabilities into line with the new technologies."
"We particularly oppose the adoption of the directive under which Member States may, inter alia, adopt legislative measures providing for the retention of data for a limited period."
"The presidency needs to produce some sort of strategy to bring an end to the existence within the European Union of parallel data protection systems and the proliferation of monitoring authorities - for example Schengen, Europol or customs conventions."
"They work on the basis of differing protection standards and outside true democratic and legal scrutiny."
"Finally, the promotion of encryption cannot be a substitute for efforts to find political solutions - more strict legal guarantees and effective parliamentary control, for example."
"To say that encryption will solve our problems is an admission of failure."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament has spent a year undertaking an exhaustive piece of work in the Committee which I had the privilege of chairing."
"Many experts were heard, many visits were made and countless documents were studied, culminating in the excellent report by Mr Gerhard Schmid, whose conclusions were approved by an enormous majority in this Parliament."
"Almost all of our work was conducted in public, with a few rare exceptions in which the nature of the actions or the bodies being heard required this to take place behind closed doors."
"We concluded that an 'Echelon' network must exist, able to intercept and process communications, involving the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand."
"We clearly stated our concern about the low level of protection given to our individual freedoms against this threat, about the security of communications sent and received by our businesses, and even about 'fair trade' in the international market."
"Furthermore, in this plenary, we adopted 44 recommendations intended mainly for the Council, the Commission and the Member States."
"My feeling is that everyone has chosen to forget this report and its conclusions. I can, first of all, only deplore the decision by Parliament's Bureau not to promote the publication of the report."
"And, returning to the Council and the Commission, it is time to state clearly that little activity has been seen this year."
"Our situation today vis-à-vis the citizens and our businesses is not substantially different to that of a year ago."
"We have even seen a trend that we must definitely combat - and on this matter I must highlight the intervention by Mr Haarder in the previous debate - which is to suggest that the fight against international crime and terrorism is necessarily undertaken at the cost of our freedoms."
"I must repeat and emphasise that security is a tool with which to protect our freedom, but when security requirements stifle freedoms we are betraying our fundamental values and fall into tyranny."
"I hope that, a year from now, we do not have to come once again before the Council, the Commission and the Member States, and repeat what we have said today: that little has been done and that almost everything is as it was before."
"Madam President, I feel that Commissioner Liikanen and Mr Haarder have pulled off a difficult operation successfully, achieving a result that we were unable to achieve even during the work in committee - namely, unanimity in Parliament."
"I endorse all they have said thus far but I would like to add a specific point of my own."
"We are continuing to focus, as Mr Vattimo did in his last speech, on the Anglo-American system of systematic, blanket interception of communications filtered by search engines, but we are continuing to ignore the fact - and we are all responsible for we all know what is going on - that these systems are also being used in European countries such as Germany, Holland and France."
"In actual fact, we have a situation where some Union Member States are intercepting the activities of the institutions, citizens and firms of other Member States."
"These indiscriminate systems of data and document interception and communication violate the fundamental right of respect for one's private life which is enshrined in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union."
"As Commissioner Liikanen stated just now, these systems flagrantly violate the European citizens' freedoms, and thus undermine the concept of free trade and the security of the Union too."
"We consider these violations to be unacceptable, and the Commissioner's words, tossed as they were into the middle of the debate, will only be sufficient if they are borne out by subsequent action."
"I would just like to remind the Commissioner and the Minister of item 9 of Parliament's recommendations, calling for the adoption of a system of democratic control of the independent European intelligence services - to which we have received no response - and of other related intelligence activities at European level."
"Basically, we cannot address such sensitive points relating to the interception of communications and the supervision of police and intelligence services without dealing with a key issue which is a source of discrimination - judicial and parliamentary control, or democratic control."
"Madam President, it is good that this debate is taking place here today."
"After a year's work, the Echelon Committee tabled recommendations and requests."
"It is only good parliamentary control if we enquire, one year on, what has become of them."
"Allow me to make a preliminary remark."
"A few days after the debate that we held last year, there was the horrific attack of 11 September on the United States of America."
"There were two reactions to this."
"Some said that this proved that the interception systems were useless and that they ought to be abolished, while others wanted to put the secret services and their activities out to public tender."
"Both reactions are wrong!"
"The majority of this House was convinced that strategic telecommunications controls could be a useful instrument for intelligence services, provided that legal safeguards and a proper system of checks and balances were in place."
"What happened on 11 September does not in any way change our demands for clear legal bases, for parliamentary control and for the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights to be complied with."
"Of the range of demands that we made, I should like to highlight the essential aspects for whose implementation the Commission is responsible, and will not therefore mention anything in the field of external policy or at international level."
"As Commissioner Liikanen stated, the Commission has done a considerable amount of work on IT security."
"If you take a closer look you discover that these are initiatives that would have been necessary in any case because of e-commerce and of the need to support the IT industry."
"Parliament had made precise demands, which - at least this is my impression, Commissioner - have not been implemented in full."
"Firstly, we wanted open source to be promoted as a basis for the encryption software so that we knew for sure what the software did."
"We wanted the Commission to help to distribute the open-source software so that we could be sure that no backdoors were being incorporated into the networks."
"The Commission is doing too little here."
"Incidentally, the Commission itself, to my disappointment, is not using open-source software either, and neither is Parliament."
"As far as protecting confidential information in the Commission is concerned, which is something that we have of course also looked at, Mr Liikanen said that considerable changes had been made here."
"This is to be welcomed."
"When we took a look at this in the Commission last time, they were still using encryption faxes, with some of the ciphers being generated in Great Britain!"
"It would be good, Commissioner, if the Commission could offer to convince a few Members of the old committee of its current security standards by inviting them to the Commission to see for themselves."
"I understand that you cannot reveal any details in a public debate, but it would be helpful to us to know what has actually happened in this respect in a little more detail."
"Madam President, intelligence work is important if the open society is to be defended."
"That is why many countries have wisely chosen to strengthen their intelligence services in the light of 11 September, and there is, of course, also cooperation between the individual nations' intelligence services."
"I am, however, obliged to say, ladies and gentlemen, that, as things are at the moment, this is a national concern, and the cooperation that takes place between the countries' respective services is therefore an intergovernmental concern and not a matter for the Council."
"One might wish it otherwise, but that is how matters stand at the moment."
"I neither wish nor am able, therefore, to enter into a more detailed discussion of the individual requests in Parliament's decision from last year."
"Like the Belgian Presidency, I am obliged to bear in mind the fact that I am a representative of the Presidency of the Council, and I must focus my contribution and what I say upon those states of affairs that affect the Council or the EU institutions."
"The Council is able, and would like, to help strengthen cooperation on the protection of our communications."
"That is what I concentrated on in my speech, in which I particularly emphasised encryption as a means of protecting communications."
"I have naturally listened with great interest to the debate, just as I listened when, as a Member of this Parliament, I attended a hearing on Echelon, chaired by Mr Gerhard Schmid."
"At that time, I was a Member of the European Parliament."
"Now, I am a Member of, and spokesman for, the Council, and I am obliged to stick to what, for the time being, is the Council's, and therefore my own, role."
"I appreciate that Parliament does not find the EU's efforts in this field to be sufficient, and that is something of which I have taken note."
"It is something I naturally take on board, but I am not in a position in which I can tell my esteemed colleagues that, yes, we shall do this or that."
"I do not have a mandate for saying that, and that is something I think Mr Gerhard Schmid too knows even better than I do."
"Madam President I wish to reply to two comments, one by Mrs Flesch and one by Mr von Boetticher."
"Mrs Flesch, I mentioned Echelon exactly as many times as it was mentioned in Parliament's resolution."
"It was mentioned only once in the resolution because the resolution concentrated specifically on the information network security measures."
"As regards the concrete measures, I have a bad habit of adhering to Parliament's time-limits and I used nine minutes fifty-seven seconds out of the allotted ten minutes."
"There are 70 measures."
"That means I would have 20 seconds for each."
"But as I have been asked, I will go through them all."
"I hope you will listen to what we have done."
"On paragraph 27, the Commission's proposal for a cyber security task force will come in early December or in November, if we are lucky."
"This will create a network of experts in the field and also computer emergency response teams."
"This applies to both paragraphs 27 and 28."
"Paragraph 29 concerns research work on encryption technology."
"I have personally guaranteed that it will have higher priority in the IST programme under the Sixth Framework Programme."
"We have just given instructions to our committees."
"Open-source encryption software is a higher priority in FP6."
"Thirdly, on the promotion of open-source software, I personally organised an IDA - interchange of data between administrations - conference and Member States were invited to look at how open-source software can be used in public administrations."
"It was a great success."
"I have one comment to make on open-source."
"Remember, if the source code is open for developers then it is also open for interceptors."
"So it does not solve all the problems, but I am very much in favour of it."
"Paragraph 31 concerns standardisation."
"You said that nothing has been done."
"You are wrong."
"I have tasked European standardisation organisations to work on this issue."
"Their working group on NIS was set up in June 2002."
"The aim is to determine the need for new security standards, to improve security policy."
"Paragraphs 32 and 34 call for European institutions and the public administrations of the Member States systematically to encrypt e-mails."
"There are now a number of measures in the Commission's strategy which are based on preventing intrusion into the Commission's internal network, ensuring a good overall level of security."
"The sensitivity of the data called for special solutions."
"The budget in that area is still limited, only EUR 1 million."
"I hope the budgetary authority will be more helpful and increase the allocation."
"Paragraph 34 calls for particular attention to be paid to the position of the applicant countries."
"We have opened discussions with the specific aim of finding solutions for technology-neutral electronic signature."
"We have also initiated research programmes for the candidate countries."
"Paragraphs 36, 37 and 39 concern our internal decisions."
"As I said earlier, the Commission has conducted an internal audit to detect any flaws in the configuration of servers, primary domain controllers, personal computers and webservers."
"A new decision on the Commission's security provisions was taken in November 2001."
"Our security directorate has drafted a new information systems security programme."
"A specific decision was recently taken on the external delegations, as a result of which we have modernised and extended the cypher system for secure data communications between headquarters and Commission delegations worldwide."
"In paragraph 40, you call on the Commission and Member States to invest in new technologies in the field of decryption and encryption techniques as part of the Sixth Framework Programme."
"That will be a major priority."
"Paragraph 42 calls on the Commission to put forward a proposal to establish a coordinated network of advisory centres."
"That is exactly what the cyber-security task force is proposing."
"I am fully prepared to accept criticism, but if you say that nothing has happened, then I must be a very bad communicator."
"At any rate I will send Members of Parliament the information in writing."
"We are working in an extremely difficult field."
"Mr Schmid, who was the rapporteur on this very complex subject, concentrated on general network and information security network issues, not just on Echelon."
"I have replied on those issues where you have given the Commission specific tasks. Many tasks have been assigned to Member States and, on those, Member States will reply directly."
"Madam President, on a point of order, I appreciate the Commissioner's answer, which is very clear, but he said that he had organised a special meeting on open software to stimulate the use of open software by the public sector."
"My question is what is the Commission itself doing?"
"Is it also going to switch to working only with open software, so that for us too there is more protection in this field?"
"Madam President, we have taken some action in that area and work is going on at departmental level, rather than on the desk tops."
"I will check this with my colleague who is running an in-house computer system and will reply in writing to the honourable Member about the exact situation at present."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is Question Time (B5-0494/2002)."
"We shall hear questions to the Council."
"Mr Ortuondo Larrea has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I would like to say that the words of the speaker who preceded me are inadmissible."
"They are inadmissible, with reference to a complaint tabled correctly by me with regard to discriminatory treatment, without making any reference to the content of any question, for the discriminatory treatment received by the Members to be mixed up with a situation in the Basque country that, I am sad to say, is due precisely to the narrow-mindedness and lack of democracy we suffer in the Spanish State."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will understand that, despite my origins as Member for the Spanish electoral region, which is an honour, I must speak here solely in my capacity as President of the sitting, in Questions to the Council."
"I would probably have liked to take part in this debate, but we do not have that right, least of all me."
"And therefore, the President-in-Office of the Council - to whom I apologise for this delay - is going to answer the question tabled by Mr Nogueira Román."
"Question No 1 by Camilo Nogueira Román (H-0606/02):"
"Subject: Milk production in the Commission's proposed revision of the CAP"
"For a country like Galicia, which accounts for a large part of Spanish milk production, possesses an agricultural structure based on small family farms (and therefore ideal for sustainable rural development), and has in recent decades made an extraordinary effort to modernise the milk production sector, the CAP reform should encourage increased milk production, with the goal of covering the needs of the Peninsular market at the very least."
"While provision should be made for a transition period during which the intervention price is maintained."
"Does the Council believe that an arrangement of this type is compatible with the options provided for in the proposed post-2008 CAP reform?"
"For countries in Galicia's position, could these arrangements be brought into force before 2008?"
"Mr President, on 12 July of this year, the Commission issued a communication on the Mid-term Review of the Common Agricultural Policy and a working document on the dairy sector."
"Apart from these two documents, the Council has not tabled formal proposals for changing the current rules governing the various common organisations of the market or, therefore, those governing the common organisation of the market in dairy products."
"As soon as the Commission, which of course has the right of initiative, has presented the Council with the proposals for which it believes there is a need, the Council will give the matter its full attention and will, in any case, take account of Parliament's statement before a decision is made."
"The Council has taken note of the various reports accompanying the Commission's communication on the Mid-term Review and, as recently as this month, held a thorough debate on, for example, dairy products."
"That debate took, as its starting point, a number of questions put to the Presidency and was aimed at clarifying the key issues."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I wish to say that, were it not for the obstacles put in the way of the Spanish State and of Galicia, my country could achieve a level of milk production similar to that of Ireland or Denmark, whereas today it produces only 1.8 million tonnes. In any event, it would be able to meet its own requirements and double its level of production."
"Bearing this in mind and taking account of the farming structure in Galicia, which is based on family ownership, with a clear focus on milk production, I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council: would the Council accept specific measures - that could also be applied to another country - that would enable Galicia to increase its production whilst temporarily maintaining the intervention price system?"
"Mr President, it is the Commission that has the right of initiative."
"That is why it is the Commission that must come up with a proposal."
"Subsequently, the Council will deal with the matter and, as I said, also take account of Parliament's views before a decision is made."
"The fact that Mr Nogueira has raised the matter today may therefore, in fact, have been very useful."
"Question No 2 by Josu Ortuondo Larrea (H-0608/02):"
"Subject: Declaration by the EU Presidency concerning the island of Perejil"
"On 13 July 2002, the EU Presidency issued a declaration in which it voiced its concern over the situation created by Morocco on the island of Perejil, expressed its full solidarity with Spain and urged Morocco to immediately withdraw its forces."
"The Presidency's action on behalf of a Member State is to be welcomed."
"However, I assume the Presidency is unaware that some Spanish historians claim Spain has no right or title to this island, which was occupied by Spanish troops for defensive purposes until the early 1960s, when these forces were withdrawn as part of the winding-up of the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco following that country's independence in 1956."
"Does the Presidency not believe that the Spanish Government has overstepped the mark in sending a substantial military force to occupy this tiny island, which Morocco considered to be an act of war, and that the best thing for the European Union to do would be to advocate that the International Court of Justice in the Hague should settle the issue of the sovereignty of Perejil?"
"Does it not feel that there is a contradiction in Spain claiming sovereignty over Gibraltar from the United Kingdom when it rejects Morocco's claims over this island and other possessions in Africa?"
"Mr President, this is a matter I remember very clearly, for it was first raised at the same time that Denmark took up the Presidency."
"At the beginning of July, we all followed with great concern the developments surrounding this small island."
"There was no doubt about the current status of the island, which had been agreed."
"There was an understanding between Spain and Morocco to the effect that the island should remain uninhabited and without any sign of sovereignty on the part of either side."
"When Morocco infringed this understanding and this status, the Danish Presidency issued a statement expressing its concern about the situation, as well as solidarity with Spain."
"At the same time, a strongly worded request was made to Morocco to withdraw its forces."
"The Council was delighted at the fact that the new Spanish Foreign Minister, Mrs Palacio, who had just come to the Council from Parliament, had met her Moroccan opposite number in Rabat immediately after the episode and that they had confirmed the desire to return to the earlier status quo."
"The Danish Presidency is confident that this and subsequent meetings will help promote the close relations between Spain and Morocco."
"On behalf of the Council, I should like to emphasise that, traditionally, the EU's relations with Morocco have been generally sound."
"Great progress has been made in recent years, and the mutual cooperation has been extended in many areas, from trade to sensitive issues such as immigration - all on the basis of the association agreement that came into force two and a half years ago."
"Mr President, I could not dream of answering that question."
"It has nothing to do with what I was asked about and is an issue that the Council absolutely cannot have an opinion about."
"Mr President, that is of course what I was suggesting in my first answer."
"Question No 3 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0610/02):"
"Subject: Dramatic decline in the income of cotton producers in Greece"
"Owing to particularly favourable weather conditions, cotton production in Greece was abundant in the 2001-2002 season."
"Due to the implementation of the new arrangements and the unlimited 'penalties' provided for in Regulation 1051/2001/EC"
"Thank you, Mr President, for briefly stating what the question is about."
"I often think it must be odd to be listening and not to know what question it is that is being answered."
"Thank you, therefore, for that bit of educational guidance."
"I should like to draw attention to the fact that last year's Council Regulation No 1051 came into force, according to Article 23 of that same regulation, on 1 June 2001."
"The Council cannot alter a provision in a legal act without a proposal to that effect having been tabled by the Commission."
"I should also like to remind the honourable Member that it is the Commission that is to use the procedure in Article 21 of the regulation I mentioned, and that is something the Commission has already done in adopting transitional measures."
"Nor has the Council received any request from a Member State along the lines referred to by the honourable Member."
"We have strayed from the point with the Basques and Spain. This is an explosive issue because Greek cotton growers are in absolute despair about this regulation, coming as it does right in the middle of the growing season."
"I have listened to the minister's reply, I have heard that not one government has called for transitional measures and I merely wish to ask the minister if the Council is prepared to approve national subsidies to save thousands of small and medium-sized cotton farms in Greece, if it intends to allow Greece to pay national aid to make up what is, for them, a totally inadequate, ruinous income."
"I can safely say in reply that a proposal by the Commission is also, of course, required for a solution such as the one intimated here, and I do not believe that there is any Member State that has requested such a proposal."
"More than that I am unable to say."
"I should like to follow on from the question put by Mr Alavanos in connection with the 2001-2002 harvest, which is now a fait accompli."
"The problem is that this situation does not only affect last year's harvest, it also affects subsequent harvests."
"This year's cotton is being harvested as we speak."
"For the second year running, producers are tearing their hair out because the Greek government has arbitrarily set production at 275 kilograms per decare, whereas output is much higher and no-one knows what will become of it."
"In February 2001, this House voted almost unanimously for an increase in cotton production because the European Union has a 70% deficit."
"Not only has the Greek government made no attempt to push this European Parliament resolution through, so as to protect Greek cotton growers and their produce; it has, as you have heard, been in an untimely hurry to apply the new regulation and has refused to make use of the European Parliament resolution."
"Mr President, I call on you to stand up for us here and I call on the Council representative to take a stand on the Greek cotton farmers' request for an immediate overhaul of this disastrous regulation in order to protect farmers facing ruin and their product, which has the status of a national product in Greece."
"Mr President, I am obliged to refer to what I have just said."
"The rules of procedure are quite clear."
"It is the Commission that, in particular cases, must put forward such proposals and, as I said, there is no Member State that has requested a proposal."
"Under no circumstances am I able to say any more about this, but Members of the European Parliament are of course always justified in raising matters important to them."
"I most definitely cannot blame them for doing so."
"Question No 4 by Bart Staes (H-0612/02):"
"Subject: Binding nature of the European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports"
"In June 1998, the Council reached agreement on a European Union Code of Conduct on arms exports."
"That code is not binding."
"Inter alia, Member States are asked, when refusing authorisation, to indicate the country of destination, the merchandise involved and the end user."
"Only recently, the FN-Herstal arms company, of which the Walloon Region is a shareholder, delivered 5 500 semi-automatics to an unknown end user."
"What steps will the Council take in order to make the agreed Code of Conduct legally binding and to force firms such as FN-Herstal to publish the information required under the Code of Conduct, including in instances where delivery is authorised?"
"Decisions concerning the authorisation of export licences are taken individually by each particular Member State, with full account being taken of the Code of Conduct on arms exports and the criteria established in this Code."
"The implementation of arms export policies and, therefore, of the Code too continues to be the responsibility of the Member States."
"The Council has not been made aware of the situation referred to by the honourable Member in his question."
"In any case, the Council is not informed as to the reasons why the Member States either authorise or refuse export licences, and it is not within the Council's area of competence in any way to set itself up as a judge of these Member States."
"At the meeting on 25 January 1999, the Council discussed a proposal from the Presidency to the effect that the Code should be made legally binding, for example by means of a common position, but there was no agreement about this, and the issue of changing the Code into a legally binding act has not therefore been addressed since."
"Mr President, I thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his reply."
"In September, Belgium's Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Michel, made a statement to the press in Belgium in the wake of the Nepal crisis, in which he stated that he would ask his fellow foreign affairs ministers in the Council to have the code of conduct, which is indeed not binding at the moment, transposed into national legislation."
"Can the President-in-Office of the Council tell me whether Mr Michel's proposal was tabled in the Council?"
"Could he also tell me whether he considers it likely that the Council will commit to transposing the code of conduct into national legislation in each country?"
"Mr President, if I had been asked in the question to provide the information that is being requested here, I might perhaps have been able to do so."
"The information was not, however, requested in the question, and I cannot therefore offer an answer."
"Perhaps the honourable Member could, however, table a written question if it is important to have it answered."
"He might also perhaps telephone the Belgian Foreign Ministry, which I think would be obliging enough to give an answer."
"Mr President, I should like to answer the three questions together."
"I would first of all, however, emphasise that the Council's conclusions concerning the International Criminal Court do not encourage the signing of bilateral agreements on immunity."
"It is emphasised that account must be taken of existing agreements between the United States and the individual Member States."
"In our view, many of the American reservations can be disposed of on the basis of the existing agreements."
"It will be up to each individual Member State to assess whether its bilateral or multilateral treaty relations with the United States can be considered adequate to make allowances for the American requests."
"If a Member State were to find it necessary to change existing agreements or to enter into a new agreement with the United States, this would be done on the basis of the EU's guiding principles."
"If, in their bilateral contacts with the United States, the individual countries keep within this framework that has been set out, the Court will not be undermined."
"We would also make it quite clear that, if states that are parties to the International Criminal Court were to enter into agreements such as those now proposed by the United States, this would be incompatible with their obligations in relation to the statutes of the Court."
"In accordance with the EU's guiding principles, any solution should include suitable operational provisions that ensure that people who have committed crimes that come within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court do not enjoy immunity."
"Legal proceedings must therefore be taken against them, and they must, if necessary, be punished."
"Such provisions should be able to ensure that suitable investigations take place and that, if there is sufficient evidence, the national authorities take legal proceedings against people at the request of the Court."
"This guiding principle ensures that people are held accountable if they have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide."
"Moreover, they will be brought to justice irrespective of whether they are Americans or Europeans."
"The EU and the United States are agreed that individual responsibility shall apply in the case of the most serious crimes affecting the international community."
"For many years, the United States has, in close cooperation with the EU, adopted a leading role when it comes to setting up international criminal courts with a view to bringing criminal prosecutions for such crimes."
"Another guiding principle is to the effect that new agreements should only cover people who are not citizens of a state that is a party to the Court."
"Moreover, the EU has carefully defined the category of people to whom this might apply."
"It is stated, however, that certain persons do not come within the Court's jurisdiction because they have immunity under international law. Apart from such cases, any solution should, however, only cover those who, because they have been sent there by the sending state, are resident in the country that is being requested to hand someone over to the court."
"This is in accordance with the Rome Statute's very narrow definition of persons who should be included under immunity agreements."
"If the alternatives are looked at, the EU approach we have just described is the best way of defending the International Criminal Court."
"Any other solution would have caused cracks to appear in the EU's strong support for the Criminal Court and would have weakened the Court."
"A simple rejection of the American proposal would, however, have had very negative consequences for transatlantic relations, and it would have endangered the absolutely vital American commitment to worldwide peacekeeping operations."
"If a common EU position had not been established, it would have caused irreparable damage to the Court."
"In that connection, I should like to mention that the United States has already entered into bilateral agreements with 12 countries that are unable to take a stand on the EU's position."
"If the EU Member States and others were to be encouraged to enter into bilateral negotiations with the United States without strong EU agreement and without clear criteria governing who is to be covered by the resulting bilateral agreements, the outcome would be a multiplicity of bilateral agreements, and that is something which would most certainly undermine the court."
"With regard to what EU citizens, NGOs and legal experts think, I should like to emphasise that the Council did not discuss this subject in a vacuum and that it certainly did not reach the stated outcome in a vacuum."
"The Council's conclusions are based upon extensive consultations between the Member States and upon valuable contributions from the Council's legal service and from the Commission."
"The Council has also taken account of the points of view expressed by the NGOs affected."
"Throughout the whole process, there have been contacts with third countries that are parties to the Court, and the Presidency has also had exploratory talks with the United States."
"It goes without saying that the Council has also taken full account of the views expressed by the elected representatives in the EU, both in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament."
"With regard to which Member States may possibly enter into immunity agreements with the United States, I am not, unfortunately, at the moment in a position to provide information, but I should like to answer questions about Romania's bilateral agreement with the United States, signed on 1 August 2002."
"In that connection, I should like, on behalf of the Council, to draw attention to the common position, adopted on 11 June of last year and amended on 20 June of this year."
"It was a position supported by the candidate countries."
"The Council remained in close contact with the candidate countries during all of the preparatory work on the position, and the Council intends to maintain these contacts in order to keep the candidate countries fully informed about further developments."
"The Council has noted that Romania has still not ratified the agreement in question and hopes that it will take account of the position established by the EU after the agreement had been entered into."
"I should like to emphasise that a solution has been found that does not undermine the International Criminal Court."
"This solution will be of great help to, for example, the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe which have been in some doubt as to what they should do."
"A solution has also been found that does not impair existing agreements."
"I really do think that this is, all in all, quite a good result."
"The EU cannot monitor the whole world."
"We have ensured that the International Criminal Court is protected from being undermined, and I cannot say anything more about the matter."
"Mr President, I was not of course asked about this in the written question."
"I shall merely point out that we are concerned here with a common position."
"Everyone, including all the candidate countries, is expected to uphold the common position."
"I should be surprised - astonished, in fact - if they did not, so I think the honourable Member can be quite certain that they will do so."
"Mr President, I hear what the minister says;"
"I accept that the guidelines are better than nothing and I congratulate the Danish presidency on at least achieving them."
"But the legal advice given to the EU institutions was that a contracting party to the Rome Statute that concludes bilateral agreements outside the tight scope of Article 98 acts against the object and purpose of the Statute."
"Is it not true that the guidelines are really too weak to shut the door to impunity arrangements?"
"I heard the minister refer to a common position."
"I would like to know whether the guidelines legally constitute a common position."
"Whether they do or not, will the Council at least seek to strengthen these rather vague guidelines of 30 September which allow loopholes contravening the Statute?"
"That would give us a strengthened common position delivering additional safeguards. These should include: oversight of national pledges by the ICC; guarantees that the US will investigate and prosecute its own nationals accused of committing ICC crimes; a requirement on the US to update federal laws to ensure that its courts exercise jurisdiction over all ICC crimes - which is not the case at the moment; agreement to confine the scope to military personnel or closely allied civilian personnel - and not, for instance, mercenaries; inclusion of a sunset clause and the submission of the agreements for scrutiny by the relevant national parliaments."
"With reference to the very last point, I think it is very clearly apparent how restricted a category of people is covered."
"With reference to the first question asked, I want to say that a common position is a common position."
"There are no punitive measures for countries that might disregard a common position, but we are normally accustomed to complying with common positions in the EU, and I believe that the candidate countries too will be so."
"Mr President, I have to say that the answer by the President-in-Office of the Council shows signs of there being considerable elasticity of interpretation but, as we say in Denmark, it requires a very firm character to sell elastic by the metre."
"It can be stretched in all directions, and I do not think that the President-in-Office is tackling the fundamental issue of whether we have an American strategy that urges other countries to enter into bilateral agreements whereby such countries undertake not to hand over American citizens."
"This is in line with the fact that the United States has persistently and continually refused to ratify the International Criminal Court Treaty."
"It strikes me as self-evident that the Council has a credibility problem when, on the one hand, it states that it fully supports the setting up of the International Criminal Court and regards its establishment as a building block of international legal cooperation and, on the other hand, turns a blind eye to, and accepts, America's blackmailing of third countries."
"The President-in-Office said that a solution had been found to the blackmailing of Romania."
"The only practical questions I want to put are the following: what is the gist of this solution, and is it a solution that the Council finds acceptable?"
"If the answer to the latter question is yes, there is still a credibility problem."
"Yes, in response to the last question I can say that a solution has been found that, in my view, will ensure there are no other candidate countries that enter into agreements corresponding to that entered into by Romania."
"I should also like to add that, to my knowledge, Romania has still not ratified that agreement."
"Regarding the first point, I would say in reply that, were the United States to exert the pressure referred to by Mr Krarup, it would be just as well that we have obtained the common position, which is easy to support and through which any such possible pressure can be withstood. In my view, it is one of the great virtues of the common position that it gives very clear support to countries in the event of their being subjected to pressure."
"I am not aware of this happening, but the honourable Member says that it does. Were this in fact to happen, it would, as I say, be just as well that we have this position, to which the new Member States can also adhere."
"As the author is not present, Questions No 8 lapses."
"Question No 9 by Efstratios Korakas, which has been taken over by Mr Alyssandrakis (H-0623/02):"
"Subject: EU-USA agreement on deportations, secret police operations and communications surveillance"
"Statewatch claims that the EU and the USA are planning to conclude an agreement on combating terrorism and matters relating to public criminal law which will include joint police operations, surveillance of communications, the location and seizure of the proceeds of crime, simplification of deportation procedures for Europeans and non-Europeans, and restrictions on applications for asylum."
"What is the Council's position, particularly in view of the claim that the Danish Presidency is drawing up a plan for communications surveillance and the fact that such repressive and persecutory measures are totally contrary to respect for human rights and inconsistent with previous statements that the EU will not conclude any agreement which provides for deportation to countries, such as the USA, where capital punishment is in force."
"The states will, of course, enter into such agreements in accordance with the national rules. Where the European institutions are concerned, this will take place in accordance with the European Union's rules."
"Mr President, it is of course clear from the documentation produced by Statewatch that negotiations concerning these agreements were embarked upon as early as last autumn and that they have been conducted in the greatest secrecy."
"The request by Tony Bunyan of Statewatch that the documents be made available for scrutiny has been met with partial rejection because the negotiations concerned were secret."
"The fact is, of course, that, according to the Treaty, Parliament is not entitled to be consulted on these matters, and the question therefore arises as to why it has not been publicly stated that these developments are part of the anti-terrorist measures that are being worked on. My first question is about why the Council is holding its cards so close to its chest when these are matters of very broad general interest that are at stake."
"My second question is about how far these agreements extend."
"Looking at Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, it is apparent from Article 24 that, when it is necessary to conclude an agreement with one or more States etc in implementation of these Titles, agreements may be entered into on behalf of the Council without Parliament's being consulted and without any public debate."
"In the view of the President-in-Office of the Council, how far do these powers extend and why has Parliament not been informed?"
"I should have liked to have given Mr Krarup an answer, but I have not read what Statewatch says. Nor do I know if what it says is true."
"Moreover, I am charged with answering questions that have been put in advance, and these questions have not been put in advance."
"I am sorry, then, Mr Krarup, but perhaps it would be an idea to submit a written question or put the question next time."
"As the author is not present, Question No 10 lapses."
"Question No 11 by María Izquierdo Rojo (H-0626/02):"
"Subject: New opportunities as regards relations with Libya"
"How does the Council view the latest statements made by the Libyan head of state Colonel Muammar Gadaffi, the U-turn in his policy, and the tone of his televised address on the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of his accession to power?"
"What opportunities does this new situation open up for relations between the European Union and Libya?"
"The Council has not discussed Colonel Gadaffi's speeches."
"As far as the Council is concerned, it is, however, still prepared to allow Libya to become a fully fledged participant in the Barcelona Process as soon as the country has accepted the Barcelona rules fully and without reservation."
"Libya has still not given an answer where this issue is concerned."
"Until it does, it will continue to be invited as an observer to the meetings of the Euro-Mediterranean Committee and to the meetings between the high-ranking officials with responsibility for political and security issues."
"Libya participated in the ministerial conference in Valencia as the Presidency's guest."
"There seem at present to be two main trends in Libya. The first prepares the way for a rapprochement with the EU and clearly signals a break with the past, while the second reflects the fact that Libya's ambitions on the African continent are incompatible with participation in the Barcelona Process."
"The relative weight of the two Libyan points of view naturally depends upon Colonel Gadaffi's ambitions."
"In the EU's view, a strong role in Africa and participation in the Barcelona Process complement each other very well indeed."
"The Euro-African partnership, whose next summit is planned to take place in the very near future, is testimony to this."
"The Council also applauds the fact that certain political prisoners in Libya have been released and emphasises that, if Libya asks to do so, it will be able to participate in the Barcelona Process as soon as the outstanding issues have been resolved clearly and satisfactorily."
"Such participation in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership would also mean that Libya, in common with the other partners, would enter into an association agreement and be covered by the MEDA regulation."
"Mr President, I really do think that my answer was fairly clear."
"If Libya can give clear and satisfactory answers in connection with the outstanding issues, it will be able, upon request, to participate in the Barcelona Process, even if it has ambitions for a rapprochement with the African continent."
"I said quite specifically that those things are not necessarily in conflict with each other."
"There would appear, however, to be two conflicting trends in Libya."
"That is not something I was just trotting out, but something that we have observed in Libya."
"Question No 12 by Lennart Sacrédeus (H-0629/02):"
"Subject: Neighbouring country status for Ukraine"
"At the EU-Ukraine summit held in Copenhagen in July 2002, Ukraine was offered EU neighbouring country status."
"This is a new concept which now needs to be given substance."
"What does this status entail in practical terms?"
"Will conditions be the same for Ukraine as for Belarus, for example?"
"Will the same status apply to all countries that border the Union after enlargement?"
"Mr President, I am very happy to answer Mr Sacrédeus's question concerning Ukraine."
"At the EU-Ukraine summit in Copenhagen this summer, Ukraine was informed about the Council's decision in April to highlight the opportunity of strengthening relations between the future enlarged EU and its new neighbours."
"Both sides emphasised the importance of taking account of the fact that relations between the EU and the countries concerned vary in character and are at different levels of political and economic development."
"The EU and Ukraine were agreed that the enlargement process creates new opportunities and challenges in various areas."
"Both sides confirmed that Ukraine could best make use of these opportunities by stepping up its efforts to adjust its legislation, norms and standards to the EU's. It was also agreed to step up the relevant partnership and cooperation bodies' discussions of the effects of enlargement on, for example, trade-related issues, visas, the movement of persons and the promotion of regional and cross-border cooperation."
"The EU recognises Ukraine's European aspirations."
"It is important for Ukraine to become better at fulfilling its obligations if these aspirations are to have real content."
"The EU will continue to support Ukraine in the reform process, including the strengthening of the judicial system, media freedom, human rights and civil society."
"The Danish Presidency feels duty-bound to step up EU-Ukraine cooperation."
"The working plan for implementing the EU's common strategy for Ukraine has been presented to the Council, which examined it on 22 July of this year."
"The Presidency believes that it should be the EU's overall objective to make the dialogue and cooperation with Ukraine more focused and results-oriented."
"The priorities in this working plan are as follows: first of all, the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and public institutions; secondly, support for the economic transition process, including Ukraine's integration into the European and world economies, and for regional cross-border cooperation with neighbouring countries; thirdly, cooperation on strengthening stability and security within and outside Europe; fourthly, the strengthening of cooperation in the environmental and energy fields and in the context of nuclear safety; fifthly, support for reinforced cooperation in connection with enlargement of the EU; and sixthly and finally, the development of cooperation on legal and internal affairs."
"The development of an overall EU policy towards the EU's new neighbours, with full respect for the differences between the countries involved, will help in achieving the overall objectives."
"On the basis of a common contribution from the High Representative, Mr Solana, and from Commissioner Patten, the Council discussed relations between the enlarged EU and its Eastern neighbours at the meeting on 30 September."
"The Council reiterated its conviction that EU enlargement will offer a good opportunity to strengthen relations between the EU and its new neighbours with a view to creating stability and narrowing the gap in prosperity at the EU's new borders."
"I should like sincerely to thank Mr Haarder and the Danish Presidency for that detailed and excellent reply."
"It is my personal belief that it was of great strategic importance when, during the Swedish Presidency, Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson, on his last trip away on foreign policy business, actually visited Kiev and met with the Ukrainian government."
"I view the line taken by the Danish Presidency as a continuation of that policy."
"I should like to ask a couple of follow-up questions."
"Firstly, is it conceivable that, in the relatively near future, Ukraine could be offered a special agreement, which could be an Eastern European variant of a special economic relationship, that is to say, a form of Eastern European EEA Agreement?"
"Secondly, I wonder how you feel that relations between the EU and Ukraine have been affected by the claims concerning military cooperation with Iraq on the part of Ukraine."
"I should like to thank Mr Sacrédeus for the great interest he has shown in Ukraine."
"It is important for us to remember Ukraine, which is a very important country in Europe."
"I should like to compliment Parliament on the report on Ukraine which - if I remember correctly - was adopted approximately a year ago."
"I am able to add that the Danish Presidency expects the Council, again this year, to request the Commission to submit proposals for the development of an overall EU policy towards the EU's new neighbours, and it can safely be said that Ukraine is a very important nation among these neighbours."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you specifically for mentioning the fact that you are also working on nuclear safety in the Ukraine."
"I would be interested to know whether it is actually intended to use the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency as a basis for guaranteeing safety there."
"Mr President, with the historical background of which we are all of course aware, there is no doubt at all that the subject of nuclear safety will be part of any discussion between the European Union and Ukraine."
"Question No 13 by Bernd Posselt (H-0631/02):"
"Subject: The EU and Macedonia"
"What is the Danish Presidency's assessment of the present situation in Macedonia, and is it planning action to give a fresh boost to the Stabilisation and Association agreement, e.g. through additional financial assistance or by abolishing visa requirements?"
"The Presidency is delighted that the parliamentary elections on 15 September in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia passed off in such an orderly fashion."
"At its meeting on 21 October, the Council expressed satisfaction with the agreement concerning the new government in Skopje."
"The Council encouraged this new government to lose no time in putting full implementation of the framework agreement and stabilisation and association process at the top of the agenda and emphasised that it is looking forward to close and fruitful cooperation."
"The EU will maintain its strong commitment to Macedonia and will actively support a government amenable to reforms."
"The Council is also looking forward to the planned census being held in accordance with international standards."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement has not come into force because it has still not been ratified."
"Until such time as it is, an interim agreement on trade aspects, which came into force just over a year ago, has been entered into."
"As part of a multi-annual programme for the years 2002-2004, the European Community has appropriated EUR 130.5 million to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in order to support the country as it prepares to fulfil the obligations associated with the interim agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"The issue of the visa requirement for Macedonians was discussed at the most recent meeting of the Macedonia-EU Cooperation Council, held on 1 and 2 July of this year, and, on this occasion, the Commission reminded the authorities in Macedonia that they must make a number of practical arrangements before the EU will be able to consider cancelling the visa requirement."
"The Member States and the Commission are following carefully the progress in fulfilling these criteria that is being made by the authorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for that very good, detailed reply and for your formidable knowledge of the situation, which of course explains why we hold you in such high regard."
"I should just like to ask a brief supplementary question."
"It is a delicate issue, I admit."
"You also once spoke of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"We are seeing that the term Yugoslavia in expressions such as 'the former Yugoslavia' and 'the remains of Yugoslavia' has actually disappeared and is to be replaced by the term Serbia-Montenegro."
"The word 'Yugoslavia' would then only continue to exist in the official name of Macedonia."
"I should like to ask you whether it might not be possible, in the long term, to find a diplomatic solution to the name issue, because it certainly places a strain on this country, which, while it may not threaten its existence, does have profound psychological consequences."
"Precisely because of the deep psychological significance of this issue, so rightly pointed out by Mr Posselt, I do not intend to express any opinion at all on it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that in Macedonia's case it is particularly important to consider how the support that we provide can most effectively bring stability to this region."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises obviously play a pivotal role here."
"That is why I would be interested to know whether within this support programme that you mentioned, which will provide EUR 135 million for the period from 2000 to 2004, funds are also available to promote small and medium-sized enterprises."
"I cannot say offhand that there are funds for the middle class."
"Aid cannot, however, be given for economic development without this being of benefit to the middle class, and I am convinced that it will be of benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises."
"As far as I know, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has no other kind of enterprises, so I do not think the honourable Member needs to worry."
"Moreover, I should like once again to express my delight at the developments in Macedonia, especially the political developments, which I find reassuring in view of how black the outlook was just over a year ago."
"Question No 14 by Olivier Dupuis (H-0634/02):"
"Subject: Abduction of Mr Ali Khanbiev, a doctor, in Chechnya"
"At around 3 to 4 a.m. on the morning of 4 September, masked men abducted Ali Khanbiev from his home in the village of Benoi (Chechnya), where he had continued to work as a doctor in the local hospital."
"Mr Khanbiev, who was born in 1958, is the brother of Umar Khanbiev, Minister of Health in Aslan Maskhadov's government."
"What information does the Council have concerning Mr Khanbiev's abduction?"
"Is the Council aware that it has all the signs of an abduction by Russian military and paramilitary forces and, consequently, there is every reason to fear for Mr Khanbiev's safety?"
"What initiatives has the Council taken, or does it intend to take, to urge the Russian authorities to make every effort to secure Mr Khanbiev's immediate release?"
"The Council has not received any information about this abduction, but I am able to tell you that the Council is still very concerned about the situation in Chechnya and that it can only condemn the many abductions that exacerbate the already very difficult humanitarian situation in the region."
"The Council emphasises that it attaches exceptional importance to full compliance with human rights and also to the efforts to find a political solution and to improve the humanitarian situation."
"I am well aware that Mr Dupuis would like me to say more than that and state that more will be done, but that is all I can say at the moment."
"I should also like to thank Mr Dupuis for the commitment he has shown for many years - especially when it comes to the humanitarian situation in Chechnya - for as long, in fact, as he has been, as I was, a member of this Parliament."
"The agenda for the EU-Russia Summit that is to take place in Copenhagen on 12 November has still not been prepared."
"With regard to this abduction, I can only repeat that the Council has not received any information about it. As I said earlier, however, the Council is well aware that many abductions have taken place and it has, in common with Parliament, regretted the fact time and time again."
"Unfortunately, the situation is such that what Mr Dupuis says is probably right, but the Council has not yet received any information about the incident."
"Mr President, I should like to ask a question."
"We have often had occasion to discuss with Commissioner Nielson the possibility of his visiting Chechnya to assess the humanitarian situation there in more detail, and we also wish to send a parliamentary delegation to Chechnya."
"At this EU-Russia Summit, could you not put on the agenda the fact that the European institutions wish to visit Chechnya to see the situation there for themselves?"
"Perhaps you could also discuss this with Commissioner Nielson - while Denmark has the Council Presidency you can of course also do that in his mother tongue."
"But that apart, it is important that an official visit takes place."
"I should like to thank Mr Posselt for his commitment and also for the proposal he has put forward."
"Naturally, I cannot, here on behalf of the Council, say what the answer will be, but I want to say thank you for the proposal and am also able to add that the Council is, of course, deeply engaged with the issues mentioned here."
"Question No 15 by Paulo Casaca (H-0638/02):"
"Subject: Human rights"
"According to the 8 July edition of the Financial Times the Iranian authorities in Teheran told Mrs Laurette Onkelinx, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, that they defended the practice of stoning women 'with the aim of safeguarding the inviolability of the family' and punishing adultery."
"Can the Council say what impact the advocacy of this practice has had on relations between the European Union and Iran, particularly in view of the priority which the Council has repeatedly claimed it gives to human rights?"
"As a matter of principle, the Council never comments on press reports."
"When comments are issued, it is the Presidency that issues them."
"With regard to the visit in question, I should like to make it clear that, during her visit, the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister, Mrs Onkelinx, expressed her condemnation of stoning."
"Moreover, she repeated the European Union's position on the matter in order to dispel any misunderstanding of what had been said during the discussion in question."
"Human rights issues - and, specifically, the use of cruel forms of execution such as stoning - have always been high on the agenda of the comprehensive political dialogue that takes place at the half-yearly meetings between Iran and the EU."
"At the most recent meeting in Teheran on 10 September 2002, a number of specific human rights issues were also discussed."
"Furthermore, the EU makes regular overtures in connection with such matters."
"We are at the moment aware of three cases in Iran in which people have been sentenced to death by stoning."
"All three sentences have been appealed against, so the judgments are still not final."
"There must be no doubt at all that the Council will follow these cases very carefully."
"More generally, I can inform you that the EU has discussed an initiative aimed at establishing a formal human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the guidelines for dialogues with third countries approved by the Council in December of last year."
"Not until this month did European and Iranian human rights experts meet for a series of exploratory talks in Teheran."
"I should also like to add that human rights are one of the four essential areas in which the Council has stated that it wishes to see progress, now that the EU and Iran are in the process of developing close trade relations."
"On 21 October, that is to say a couple of days ago, the Council emphasised that it considers it very important that a human rights dialogue should offer an opportunity to achieve practical improvements regarding respect for human rights."
"It decided therefore to embark upon such a dialogue on the basis of the conditions, timetable, subjects, benchmark points - that is to say, objectives - and choice of interlocutors discussed in the course of the EU's fact-finding mission to Iran."
"It was also decided that the first meeting within the framework of this dialogue should take place as early as this year in Teheran."
"Finally, the Council has, on the basis of an initiative by the Presidency, very recently brought up a number of matters in quite a few different countries, including Iran."
"On the basis of this initiative, the Council adopted, on 30 September, a declaration on the death penalty and, in particular, cruel forms of execution."
"In its declaration, the Council again emphasises, clearly and unambiguously, that the EU repudiates the death penalty and, in particular, execution by stoning."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I offer you my sincere thanks for your direct answer."
"I should like, however, to inform you that precisely on the eve of a mission to Iran by EU experts in October, a series of five public executions took place in Iran, which were reported in the world's press. I hope, incidentally, that the President-in-Office of the Council is not going to say that he was unaware of what was being said in the press."
"Such actions clearly demonstrate the position of the Iranian authorities, which is not to budge one inch in their approach to human rights. The number of executions reported in Iran has trebled in the last three years and, given these circumstances, the question is this: is the European Union going to conclude a trade agreement with Iran in the wake of these systematic breaches of human rights or not?"
"This is what I wished to find out from you."
"Mr President, I did not say that I - and the Council - do not read press reports and newspapers."
"I said that the Council never comments on press reports."
"That is something quite different."
"My esteemed colleague is undoubtedly right that, in Iran, the death penalty is not just something that exists in theory but also something that is practised."
"That is deeply tragic, but the Council has devised a strategy for nonetheless being able to embark upon human rights dialogues with countries that impose this penalty."
"That is, in my view, perfectly in order, moreover."
"It is of course a dialogue involving, on the one hand, vigorous condemnation and, on the other hand, simultaneous efforts of persuasion to bring about improvements."
"Mr President, a question such as that cannot be answered in general terms."
"If, however, something along the lines of an answer is desired, it can often be a good idea to ask the democratic forces in the country concerned."
"As the author is not present, Question No 16 lapses."
"Question No 17 by Konstantinos Alyssandrakis (H-0648/02):"
"Subject: Promotion of police-state mentality and informer culture in EUROPOL text"
"A report in the newspaper Rizospastis claims that a EUROPOL document entitled 'European Best Practice for Handling Informers' gives guidance and instructions for the 'recruitment and handling' of informers."
"These instructions include methods of payment and amount, as well as certain forms of immunity to be granted - informers are not to be arrested 'when they commit offences within prescribed limits' and they are also allowed 'to take part in criminal activities' after 'authorisation from an authority established in accordance with the guidelines'."
"Does the Council approve of this EUROPOL text, which is flagrantly contrary to respect for human rights and human dignity itself? Will it take immediate measures to call a halt to this slide towards a police state mentality, authoritarianism and spying on the private lives of citizens, their political, trade union and social activities and their collective organisations?"
"Mr President, I am sorry, but I seem to be repeating myself here, for the Council does not comment on statements in the media, either. I can nonetheless confirm, however, that there is a Europol document concerning the subject we are now talking about."
"This document describes best practice for handling informers with a view to helping the police authorities in the Member States. The document is not binding, and it has been prepared on the basis of Article 3(2)(i) of the Europol Convention."
"It is based partly upon the Executive Committee's decision of 29 April 1999 on general principles governing the payment of informers and upon the Decision of the Central Group of 22 March 1999 on general principles governing the payment of informers."
"These decisions have therefore been integrated into the European Union's prior regulatory framework, cf. the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, and both have been published in the Official Journal of 22 September 2000."
"Police use of informers, including questions of payment and immunity, naturally depends upon the state of the national law in the Member State concerned."
"Mr President-in-Office, I am astonished by the clarity of your reply; it is something we are not used to from you."
"At the same time, I shudder at the thought that we are surrounded by a network of informants and I wonder if the purpose of such clarity was perhaps to remind us of this and warn us that our slightest misdemeanours are under constant surveillance."
"As Europol appears to be giving informants official status, I wonder whether a scale of pay has been set and whether there will be invitations to tender and then at least some of our young unemployed could apply for the job."
"Mr President, Europol is a cooperation body that deals with some of the very worst crimes, against which democracies must protect themselves."
"I do not therefore think it is fair to talk about an informer state."
"That is an expression I should like to repudiate."
"Europol was of course set up and has had its powers extended partly at the request of Parliament and of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"One reason for this is that Europol's task is not of course to cause people trouble but to protect them."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 18 to 37 will be replied to in writing"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at this difficult time for the civil aviation sector, whose future we debated recently in this Chamber when we discussed the single European sky rules, the European Commission has proposed a new regulation on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding."
"The liberalisation of the air transport sector has brought numerous benefits for passengers."
"Competition has arrived on many routes, causing a fall in prices and a great increase in the choice of routes and destinations."
"In spite of this, however, consumers have valid reasons for dissatisfaction."
"Denied boarding and cancellation of flights provoke strong resentment, and the assistance provided during the excessive delays all too often leaves something to be desired."
"We in this House fly so often that many of us have experienced such inconveniences, and it is therefore very easy for us to put ourselves in the shoes of the citizens in this case and understand that new, effective legislation is needed to protect their rights across the board."
"Faced with the shortcomings of current legislation, the European Commission proposes to take a different approach, introducing, on the one hand, a call for volunteers, as per the effective US system, and, on the other, a dissuasive system which compels airlines to provide greater compensation to passengers for damages."
"In addition, protection is considerably increased, as we will see in a moment."
"We must not, however, lose sight of the overall context of this proposal."
"We have had the opportunity to pursue an extremely constructive debate in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, exploring all aspects of the question."
"As the Commissioner has just pointed out, overbooking, the principal cause of denied boarding, is a negligible consideration when seen against the backdrop of the annual flow of air passengers in the Community area."
"We cannot risk penalising the entire spectrum of travellers with a potential blanket price increase in order to provide greater protection for a very small number of passengers."
"We must be very careful and identify precisely the best solutions for achieving the objective without causing repercussions, bearing in mind, not least, the economic impact."
"In this context, Commissioner, I am afraid I must complain of the lack of statistics provided by the Commission in support of the proposal."
"We do need practical statistics and facts on which to base a decision, and the lack thereof has certainly made it quite difficult for me to draw up a report."
"I will now outline the principal points on which we have worked to produce the final document."
"The first is the definitions."
"In terms of methodology, I believe it is essential to define all the actors involved and terms used more precisely, to avoid any confusion which might affect either passengers or airlines."
"To this end, a number of amendments have been adopted seeking to make the provisions of Article 2 more detailed."
"The second point concerns tour operators."
"Passengers who have bought a package holiday are already more than adequately protected by Directive 90/314."
"The Commission's proposal is therefore in danger of creating confusion over the reference text, to the detriment, principally, of the passengers, and it was therefore necessary to restrict the responsibility of tour operators in the context of this regulation to seats only, as we have done."
"Lastly, the most controversial point: the provision of compensation to passengers in the event of denied boarding."
"The Commission's proposal has given rise to a great deal of debate and much concern."
"Neither the criteria established for the definition of the new compensation amounts nor the impact assessment satisfy the members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"As far as we are concerned, the important thing is to preserve a balance between protecting passengers and the vitality of a major economic sector such as the air transport sector."
"We have therefore proposed a three-category division on the basis of distance and a reduction in compensation amounts."
"Indeed, we must remember that we should be concentrating more on implementing the system of calls for volunteers than on compensation."
"In addition, I believe it is entirely inappropriate to extend the provision of compensation to excessive delays, for a number of reasons."
"First of all, because it is not easy to identify the cause of the delay quickly enough, and, secondly, because this would create a chain reaction."
"We therefore feel it is entirely appropriate to equate denied boarding with cancellation, but we feel it is inappropriate to treat excessive delays in the same way."
"Rather, we must ensure that a proper, systematic system of assistance in the event of delays is in operation, particularly where people with disabilities or minors are concerned, as regards both the provision of information and logistics, and we have adopted a number of amendments to this end."
"I would just like to say, by way of conclusion, a quick word about the amendments tabled."
"They show that the debate on compensation amounts between those who would like them to be higher and those who would like them to be lower is still ongoing."
"Certainly, at the moment, the only reaction is a certain amount of dissatisfaction regarding our proposal on the part of both airlines and consumers, and this, Commissioner, allows me to hope that, precisely because no party is satisfied, the compromise we have reached is the most balanced and most intelligent solution."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Lisi on his report."
"While he was drafting it, he attended the discussions on my opinion in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and incorporated many of the points raised."
"Our differences are really minor, but I will return to them."
"As Mr Lisi said, Members pontificate here on many subjects about which they have an imperfect knowledge, but we all regard ourselves as experts on the problems of passenger travel."
"They dominate our working lives."
"So there was a warm welcome for Commissioner de Palacio's proposals to move ahead from the 1991 regulations, not just on denied boarding but on delayed and cancelled flights as well."
"There is no dispute that what we call the hierarchy of remedies must apply, starting with compensation levels proportionate to the distance travelled."
"I think most of the airlines have responded well to this debate, with the air service passenger commitment as a gesture of intent."
"I would say to those maverick airlines that ignore all that - and we know where they fly to, if not always where they live - that they would be wise to heed the public mood."
"No frills should not mean no concern."
"In our opinion, we are offered an amendment to Article 7 which called for levels of compensation to be based on specific impact assessments, so that it could not be argued that they were frivolously levied."
"I must say that the levels of compensation in Mr Lisi's report are well beyond what we wanted under Article 7."
"We wanted mandatory compensation of between EUR 300 and EUR 1 500, subject to distance and review."
"That has fallen to between EUR 200 and 600, but I accept that in itself is progress for the consumer."
"I am still concerned that this does not necessarily apply under Amendment No 31, which refers back to Article 9 and not Article 8."
"Perhaps the Commissioner can assure me that those amendments will actually apply."
"Otherwise, Mr Lisi and his committee have advanced the consumer cause and have allowed us to move forward to a system of airline ranking."
"If only this applied to all airlines, all flights and all problems."
"Every day further horrors come to light."
"On a British airline, a woman had to endure an 11-hour flight next to a 23-stone woman who sat on her, not next to her, throughout the flight."
"She was left with serious injuries and initially offered GBP 15 compensation."
"You might say that the airline began with one handicapped passenger and ended with two."
"Our journeys should be reducing handicaps, not increasing them."
"I welcome this report as a step in that direction."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Mr Lisi, for all his hard work on this report. I would like to support the comments he has made."
"As a general observation, and taking issue with the Commission position, I would like to continue by saying that this report came as an unwelcome surprise, not least because, last year, a report on air passenger rights was taken through committee by Mr Collins, with Parliament overwhelmingly supporting a voluntary approach."
"In addition, there has been no industry consultation on this issue and no business impact assessment of value."
"There is no data on the projected costs to carriers; no assessment of the impact on competitiveness - between both EU and other carriers; and no information on the direct and consequential impact of this legislation."
"The voluntary air passenger service commitment agreement was signed in February in Strasbourg."
"Virtually all the European airlines were party to it."
"It included references to a number of points contained in this proposal on delays, cancellations and diversions, special needs passengers, reducing the number of involuntary denied boardings and so on."
"So why did Mr Collins and our committee go to the trouble of taking his report through Parliament when the Commission clearly had a legislative proposal in its back pocket?"
"The voluntary agreement has not failed; it has not even had a chance to work."
"Here we are again with the Commission knocking another nail into the coffin."
"The proposal is flawed in several key areas: it fails to recognise fundamental differences between scheduled and charter operations; it ignores, for example, the package travel directive covering the rights of charter passengers."
"In particular, it concerns proposals on cancellations and long delays, hence the inclusion of the tour operators, as supported by our committee."
"The proposal also ignored the proportion of events due to failures within the monopoly providers such as ATC and airports, and the inability of airlines to obtain compensation from them."
"Given that the ticket price has gone down in the last ten years, the increase in compensation levels proposed for denied boarding by the Commission is an incredible 400%."
"Left at those levels, this regulation would cost the scheduled carriers somewhere in the region of EUR 1.35 billion."
"The many regional and low-cost airlines would be more critically affected, as their margins are much smaller."
"In addition, none of these rules will apply to third country airlines."
"We in Europe will again suffer the consequences of an unlevel playing field - another example of the Commission taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut."
"Finally, under the leadership of our rapporteur, we have achieved a more sensible and realistic conclusion."
"I live in hope that the Commission will listen to Parliament and act accordingly."
"The public quite rightly expects and deserves good customer service but this proposal is a step too far."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur."
"In our view, the compromise that was struck in the committee constitutes a significant step towards greater consumer protection."
"At long last we have legal security on additional issues and not just voluntary commitments from the airlines."
"Moreover, the regulation is of course also being extended to cover severe delays and flight cancellations."
"I was not infrequently the victim of cancellations by the former airline Sabena."
"No doubt other Members have had similar experiences with other airlines."
"Last but not least we are doubling the current levels of compensation, which will also be more subtly differentiated than hitherto and divided into three bands."
"Clearly, the issue that we most need to discuss is the level of compensation."
"The objective of the regulation cannot be to abolish the practice of overbooking, but it can be to ensure that this procedure is used in a more reasonable, customer-oriented way."
"Of course, we could also eliminate overbooking, as the low-cost carriers have done, if, on the other hand, flights were non-exchangeable and a no-show meant that a flight was automatically forfeited."
"But this is neither consumer-friendly nor justifiable on environmental grounds."
"Consumers need flexibility when they are planning their journeys and half-empty planes make no sense at all from an environmental point of view."
"The economic argument is even more persuasive."
"If overbooking were abolished, air prices would inevitably rise and we cannot expect either consumers to put up with this or indeed the airlines, which are up against international competition."
"A further reason why we can support the compromise struck in the committee on compensation levels is because we think it is important for consumers to benefit from these improved and binding rules as quickly as possible and not have to wait for them for years because the legislation is, as is so often the case, still sitting in the Council."
"In the interests of consumers, my group will be voting against part of Amendment No 29, because we think that compensation only for flights that are cancelled up to 48 hours before departure is unreasonable."
"At least two weeks is required here and this should be negotiated afterwards with the Council and the Commission."
"In addition, we think that the inclusion of package tours in the Commission proposal is unnecessary, because they are covered by the directive on package tourism."
"The fact that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has advocated the introduction of a scheme to rank airlines by user-friendliness is a strong vote in favour of the consumer."
"A ranking system of this kind, as is quite usual in the USA, can help to stimulate competition between the airlines on quality and on which provides the most consumer-friendly overall service."
"I hope that this proposal is also upheld in the plenary."
"Against the background of the current situation, this report represents a determined step towards greater consumer-friendliness."
"Many a consumer dream may fly on, but they are hopelessly overbooked."
"I am broadly in agreement with the rapporteur, certainly with regard to the Commission's original proposal."
"It was high time to draw up better regulations, particularly with regard to overbooking."
"In my opinion, however, the Commission proposal is seriously lacking when it comes to flight cancellations and delays."
"In this context, the airline companies are being held responsible for a problem that is overwhelmingly caused by air traffic control and the aviation authorities."
"My objections are based on the following reasons."
"The Commission proposal is not based on a proper evaluation of the economic effect, and it has not considered the consequences of the measure for the sector and in particular for ticket prices."
"Although it provides increased protection, the proposal will limit the consumer's free choice."
"The definition of a superior power or force majeure, given by both the Commission and our own Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, does not contain enough certainty to be able to properly distinguish between delays and flight cancellations which fall outside the responsibility of the airline companies."
"It can be argued that the airline companies ought to recover the damage from the appropriate party themselves, but that is not feasible in practice."
"Where we are talking about regional or low-cost airlines, it would probably be preferable to let consumers themselves choose whether to pay a premium above the price of the ticket."
"They could probably then cover themselves against flight cancellations."
"This option could easily be introduced by the sector itself."
"I have a couple of remaining questions for the Commission."
"Can the Commission confirm that it intends to carry out a thorough economic analysis of the consequences and the effects of its proposal, of the increasing costs for the airline companies and of the new flight tariffs in the different segments of the aviation market?"
"Can the Commission confirm that it intends to investigate the real reasons for flight cancellations and delays, so that we can have a better understanding of which causes are indeed the responsibility of the airline companies and which are not?"
"Has the Commission also considered other policy measures which might ensure better rights for passengers than the ones presently included in their proposal?"
"Travel insurance aimed specifically at flight delays and cancellations might be a possible solution."
"We have had further debates and further discussions here in Parliament."
"My amendments are a necessary supplementary measure intended to provide a decent balance between ticket price and compensation."
"The first amendment relates to denied boarding and flight cancellations."
"I propose a supplementary measure to the sound compromise, i.e. that there should be a different arrangement for an additional category of tickets below EUR 200."
"This applies to both denied boarding and cancellation."
"The other amendment relates to incoming flights, to which Mrs Foster referred and does exactly what she wants."
"This is exactly what my amendment is about, and I look forward to your support tomorrow."
"Mr President, it is, of course, splendid that prices have dropped following liberalisation, but never before have passengers had to suffer cancellations, denied boarding, long delays, lost luggage etc. to this extent."
"Being squashed into an aircraft like sardines is also a fairly recent phenomenon."
"I therefore think that you are right to say that measures need to be taken urgently."
"I personally would like to see all these malpractices banned, but I realise that such drastic action is not practicable."
"In any case, the compensation the companies have to pay must be high enough to act as a deterrent - particularly where the airlines can rely on a system of volunteers, which should not really be so appealing as to encourage overbooking."
"I hope that you will take another look at our amendments, which aim at increasing the actual compensation sums and introducing a system of classification."
"I can only remind you of the number of times we seasoned fliers have all arrived at our destination after a flight only to find our luggage is not there."
"What company is still customer-friendly in such circumstances?"
"If this cannot be done in a separate amendment, I should like to ask Mr Lisi whether he might be able to include this classification in his report, although that will be every 5 years."
"I hope that this type of compensation will eventually be introduced for train passengers as well, and indeed for all individuals who are the victims of high prices and poor service."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to confirm first of all that the majority of the PPE-DE group of course supports the Commission proposal, along with the essential proposals to improve it that have been made by Mr Lisi."
"The proposal has a clear two-pronged approach."
"It firstly calls on the airlines to use the volunteering principle, whereby the airline makes offers to individuals to identify those who do not urgently have to take the next flight, but could also take the one after that."
"It is true that experience in America with the volunteering system has been positive."
"If there are not enough volunteers, however, and everyone wants to go home or to their business appointment and passengers are denied boarding, then they must have some legal redress."
"They have booked a flight, they have an OK on their ticket and they therefore have a right to board."
"If the airline overbooks in its own economic interests, because it knows that there are a lot of no-shows, then it must pay if it cannot uphold the booking."
"It is as simple as that."
"Because if passengers have an OK on their ticket they have the certainty that they can travel, and if they cannot then the carrier has to pay."
"Commissioner, you were, of course, a little harsh about the level of the payments."
"My colleague, Mrs Foster, with whom I do not always agree, said something that is very true."
"Air prices have fallen in recent years and that is why the argument that we should set compensation very high, so as to take account of recent cost increases, is clearly flawed, because air prices have fallen."
"Most of us in any case are familiar with the ingenious system of special tariffs, which mean that you can easily fly at more reasonable prices than those prescribed."
"With this in mind, please understand that we have reduced the compensation to a level that we deem to be economically fair."
"Our view is that if excessive compensation is paid to passengers who are not taken on board, the carriers will pass on these costs to all passengers, and then general price levels will rise, which will affect more people than those denied boarding."
"I say to Members of the Liberal Group - we usually see eye to eye, but today, exceptionally, we do not - that we have to set a flat rate of compensation for two reasons: firstly, the prejudice suffered by anyone who is denied boarding is always the same, whether they have paid EUR 150, EUR 500 or more for their ticket."
"They have been given a guarantee that they will fly and they are left behind."
"It is completely irrelevant how much the ticket cost."
"Their confidence has been damaged, and more besides."
"That is why I believe that the low-cost carriers, which actually do not have any problems with overbooking because they do not accept more passengers than have booked, should also compensate passengers for any injury caused if they cancel a flight for economic reasons, and they obviously do this from time to time."
"We need uniform tariffs so as to make the job of the poor airport staff easier."
"You see, if a passenger is denied boarding or a flight is cancelled, we want the compensation to be paid at the gate."
"You really cannot expect the poor flight attendant to calculate thousands of prices and people to wait until she has calculated the individual compensation entitlements."
"I therefore believe that our proposal is quite sensible."
"With your permission, on behalf of my colleague, Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten, who is unfortunately unable to speak this evening and who has asked me to make some points for her, I should like to refer once again to the split vote that we are proposing on Article 3(2)."
"This states that the regulation does not apply to passengers travelling at a reduced fare which is not available directly or indirectly to the public."
"We fear that this wording is very vague."
"We should state quite clearly that a passenger travelling at a reduced fare also has a right to full compensation."
"I believe that it is very important that the provision is interpreted in this way."
"Commissioner, I should like to ask you one more question."
"As you know, Mr Lisi has made a very good proposal on Article 13, namely that the Member States have to ensure that if a carrier pays compensation and is not in actual fact responsible for the delay or cancellation it may have recourse to those responsible, whether it be air traffic control or other bodies, including state-owned systems."
"With a view to ensuring fair burden-sharing, can you assure us that, if we make the airlines responsible for paying compensation in the first place, they will also be able to have recourse to any state-owned organisations that have caused the delay or cancellation?"
"You would assist us greatly if you were to support this portion of our amendments."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of air transport has brought countless advantages for passengers."
"Nevertheless, lower prices and greater demand have not put an end to consumer complaints, as we all know."
"As some Members have already said, we are seeing cancelled or delayed flights, passengers being denied boarding, problems with baggage and so on. This is unacceptable!"
"In order better to protect consumers, the liberalisation of air transport requires better market management and rationalisation."
"The harmonisation of current legislation is becoming crucial in light of the new state of affairs."
"It also makes perfect sense to involve operators in this sector, forcing them to adopt rules for the protection of citizens, enabling authorities to intervene in the event that the guarantees for protection that have been announced should prove to be insufficient."
"I also believe the intervention of the authorities is extremely important."
"The operators' involvement of passengers by appealing for volunteers, involving them directly in the negotiation and acceptance of alternative arrangements, is a good approach that will make the management of reservations more flexible and will contribute to passenger protection, improving the efficiency of the operation."
"I would reiterate here the issue of the competent authority: the proposal for a regulation reveals the importance of Article 14, which deals with the obligation on the part of the authority in this field to inform passengers of their rights."
"Basically, this reincorporates an amendment adopted by Parliament in its response to the Commission's 1998 proposal."
"Passengers must be informed clearly and transparently about how to contact the competent national body - of which they are often, even usually, unaware - responsible for dealing with complaints about the regulation."
"I would also emphasise the importance of Article 17, concerning implementation, which obliges Member States to designate the body responsible for the implementation of the regulation, to provide them with information and to force them to comply with measures ensuring that passengers' rights are respected."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all of us here in this room spend far more time than we would like on planes and at airports."
"These issues affect us all too often, either because we ourselves are affected by delays or cancellations, overbooking and the like or because we experience at second hand what happens to other passengers and that is not always pleasant."
"Often it is even very unpleasant."
"In this situation, the European legislator has to act in the interests of consumers, but also in the interests of the air transport sector as a whole."
"Much has already been said about the rules that we are examining here at first reading and on which we will vote tomorrow, about how best to tackle the problem of denied boarding, and about reasonable rules in the case of delays."
"Naturally, all these rules and regulations bring the industry little joy, particularly in the current difficult economic climate."
"But this is of course not only about the airlines; it is also and above all about the passengers."
"They in any case are repeatedly and increasingly frequently finding themselves to be the weaker party, and we need to protect and support them with European law."
"There is one other player that we should consider here; I refer to the airport operators."
"They have been experiencing many problems recently because of increased concerns about terrorism and security."
"They have resolved a number of them, but in some cases their activities have become extremely expensive."
"There is another problem that remains unresolved: how passengers are treated."
"Nowadays flying is a massive business; there is no doubt about it."
"This should not mean, however, that passengers are treated like herds of animals."
"Perhaps we could also address these aspects of flying in the foreseeable future and regulate them accordingly."
"Passengers will thank us for it."
"The next item is the report (A5-0316/2002) by Mr Khanbhai, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on sustainable agricultural policy, agrarian reform and rural development for self-reliance in developing countries (2001/2274(INI))."
". Mr President, Mr Khanbhai sends his sincere apologies for not being here to present his report."
"Unforeseen circumstances have forced him to return to the UK this evening."
"I would like to stress that this is his report, and I thank him for his work and his willingness to cooperate with other parties."
"It is perhaps appropriate that Mr Khanbhai drew up this report, because he was born in Tanzania, where his family have lived for 170 years."
"He and I have travelled extensively in rural Africa and we share many views on the eradication of poverty in developing countries."
"It is therefore a pleasure to stand in for him today."
"It is unacceptable that even today, more than one billion people are living on less than a dollar a day in rural areas of developing countries."
"They have no access to water, sanitation, electricity, health services or education."
"The poor are hungry, have no jobs, and fear disease."
"More than 40 years of international aid have not eliminated poverty."
"Many of these poor countries have huge debts, and their people are worse off than they were 25 years ago when Lomé assistance started."
"The EU is the largest donor in the world."
"Why have we not identified the country-specific problems, so that we can focus our aid on attacking the causes of poverty?"
"I have been travelling in the ACP countries for over 20 years."
"The major cause of poverty is the lack of investment in rural areas. We need to invest in helping the rural population to have a stake in their local economies."
"These people need infrastructure, technical skills for farming and animal husbandry, and vocational training to establish small businesses in the agro-processing, engineering, IT and service sectors."
"They need the kind of support provided by micro-finance schemes such as the Gramine Bank in Bangladesh, and I strongly support Mr Khanbhai in this matter."
"A 'bottom-up' approach is the only way to regenerate rural areas."
"Asian countries like China, India and Bangladesh were food-deficient and net importers 20 years ago."
"Subsidies to farmers, selecting appropriate seed, irrigation, micro-finance for small farmers, establishing food cooperatives and other rural investments transformed the agricultures of these countries."
"Today, they grow enough food for their huge populations and have surplus for exports."
"There must be a lesson here."
"The EU and the US offer substantial subsidies to their farmers."
"Without such subsidies, there would be no economic prosperity in countries like Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and France, which have all benefited from European subsidies."
"Without investment in Europe's rural infrastructure, the EU would not function as it does today."
"Sadly, international aid for rural areas in sub-Saharan countries has dropped from EUR 14 billion in 1988 to EUR 8 billion in 1998."
"This has resulted in a sharp decline in food production."
"It has been aggravated by natural disasters, both drought and floods."
"A decade of famine and malnutrition has precipitated disease, fear, social tension and civil war in many poor countries."
"The EU needs to encourage land reform, the efficient and fair utilisation of water resources and the transfer of technology for the rural populations of poor countries."
"We need to teach them to grow their own food, create their own employment and sustain their own economies."
"The poor do not wish to beg for life; they value their self-respect and dignity in the same way as we do."
"They do not want our fish."
"They need to learn how to fish and feed themselves."
"I agree with Mr Khanbhai that this is the spirit within which the EU should reassess its policy on aid."
"Agriculture, agrarian reform and rural economic development should be top priority areas for EU assistance."
"This will help production, employment and the sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries, enabling the poor to be self-reliant and break their dependence on our aid."
"I hope that the House will accept this report."
"Mr Khanbhai has agreed to over 75 per cent of the amendments that have been tabled."
"Mr President, the Commission would first like to thank Mr Khanbhai - and Mr Corrie as his stand-in - for their work in bringing an issue as important as sustainable rural development to this debate."
"Poverty and food insecurity in developing countries will not be eradicated without substantial investment in rural areas."
"The Commission fully shares the main thrust of the report on the importance of rural and agricultural development for poor people in developing countries."
"Beyond rural development, the report also addresses issues related to EU trade and agricultural policy."
"It underlines the importance of improving trade opportunities for the rural poor, which we fully share."
"In this respect, the World Summit on Sustainable Development reconfirmed the commitments made in the WTO Ministerial Declaration in Doha - the so-called Doha Development Agenda."
"These include taking into account the specificity of developing countries in the trade negotiations and putting in place flanking measures such as capacity building and trade-related technical assistance."
"The Commission has recently sent to the Council and Parliament a communication that will provide the policy framework for this type of assistance."
"The Commission wants to highlight the positive trade agenda promoted by the European Union and adopted in Johannesburg to complement the WTO process."
"It is also worth recalling that the Union is committed to providing to least-developed countries, through the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, full duty-free and quota-free access to the European market."
"We hope to see similar initiatives adopted by other developed countries."
"As regards agriculture, the Commission supports the emphasis on the multifunctionality of agriculture, a concept of particular relevance for developing countries."
"However, I would like to draw your attention to the reference made in the report to the dumping of European agricultural production."
"The Community provides an export refund, which reduces the difference between the higher Community price and the world price."
"Technically that cannot be called dumping."
"Ceilings on export subsidies, in quantity and value, are regulated by the WTO, and these ceilings have been reduced between 1995 and 2000."
"The Community has constantly reduced its use of export refunds, beyond WTO obligations."
"These positive efforts should be recognised."
"But rural development is the main focus of the report."
"For many donors, including the European Commission, rural poverty is a multidimensional issue."
"To address it, it is necessary to combine interventions at different levels."
"At national level, we need to improve incomes, reduce inequality in access to productive assets and services, combat the degradation of natural resources and reduce vulnerability to risk."
"At an international level, we need to improve the coherence between developed countries' domestic policies - in particular trade and agriculture - and their development objectives."
"In developing countries, addressing such a complex set of issues requires coherent and balanced national strategies tailored to local needs, resources and institutional settings."
"Although there is no 'one size fits all' solution, the Commission, in its recent communication, 'Fighting Rural Poverty', has identified some key principles to be applied in all rural development interventions."
"They include the importance of promoting gender equality, maximising the impact on poverty, supporting national strategies and the participation of stakeholders, as well as mainstreaming environmental protection."
"Support for pro-poor land reforms, capacity-building, improved access to financial services, agricultural research, infrastructure and services are all areas whose importance is underlined in the Commission strategy and in which the Community's development programme is heavily involved."
"Similarly, the Commission also broadly shares other, more specific recommendations, such as the importance of supporting the development of arts and crafts, rural training centres and domestication of wildlife."
"However, the level of priority of such interventions depends on local circumstances and on their relevance for poverty reduction."
"Support for such activities will therefore have to be addressed on a case?by-case basis and in line with the priorities defined in national strategies."
"Rural development is also primarily about decentralisation and local governance."
"Resources will only reach the rural poor if they can be managed effectively and planned in a participatory way, with the active involvement of local communities."
"The most disadvantaged sections of societies - particularly women - must be effectively represented and participate in these processes."
"Reinforcing and democratising local institutions is a key challenge for governments and donors alike."
"The report rightly emphasises the importance of good governance for the sustainability of all development efforts."
"Once again I thank the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai, and Mr Corrie."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to thank Mr Khanbhai very much for drafting his report and also for making it possible for us to cooperate so effectively with all colleagues."
"Agriculture and rural development are of central importance in the EU and developing countries alike."
"That is why I support and welcome the fact that 'food security and sustainable rural development strategies' is one of the six priorities listed for EU development policy."
"The multifunctional agricultural model and its underlying philosophy is, I believe, also the only right way forward for developing countries."
"We should continue to support the approach of making sustainable management one of the non-trade concerns."
"Let me remind you that the EU is by far the world's largest importer of agricultural products from poor countries."
"The Commissioner has already pointed out that the EU has substantially increased market access for the poorest countries in recent years."
"I hope that other industrialised countries will also follow the EU's example."
"The agripolitical measures in the developing countries should not focus exclusively on exports, but must above all guarantee the food security of the domestic population."
"The war on poverty must continue to be the overriding aim of development policy."
"An important precondition for this is to improve the infrastructure for supplying energy, for transport, for water supply and distribution and for health and education."
"Above all, however, improved governmental and administrative systems as well as democracy and the rule of law are necessary, as has already been said, to enable robust policy-making."
"Appropriate land reform and access to water and productive resources can enable the rural population to increase their standard of living and help to boost economic development."
"To support the process of building appropriate capacities in the developing countries, the European Community should provide more technical help for farmers and also pass on technical know-how, for example on renewable energies and in many other areas."
"A further essential aspect is, in my view, policy in rural areas, so as to stop migration to the slums, and it is also important that there be proper recognition of the work carried out by women."
"Mr President, agriculture, support for rural development and the protection of rural communities are at the heart of Mr Khanbhai's report and he addresses many of the fundamental inequities which feature so prominently in the lives of the rural poor."
"Clearly, as other speakers have said, the European Union and its Member States have a very important role to play."
"I think we need to show much more understanding of the real reasons for the so-called urban drift from rural areas and of the effect of the systems and structures which conspire to destroy the livelihoods of millions who live by the land."
"The European Union is, of course, part of the solution."
"As the biggest trading block, we have an important role to play."
"I have to say that it is sheer hypocrisy to continue to protect our own agricultural competitive position with higher resources, while at the same time forcing developing countries to liberalise."
"Rapid opening of their markets threatens food security and sustainable livelihoods in developing countries."
"The parallel negotiations which will be going on at the WTO and between the ACP and the European Union must be used as an opportunity to show that the European Union clearly understands that trade and market access and tariff levels are directly and inextricably linked to our understanding of how we meet those critical millennium development goals."
"The paradox is that, in a time of global plenty, farmers in developing countries are abandoning the land and agriculture."
"They simply cannot compete with heavily subsidised food flooding into their markets and dumped on their markets."
"The report describes the effect of the dumping of milk on Jamaica and the dumping of beef on West Africa."
"In Uganda, for instance, the coffee growers are suffering enormously."
"One hundred and fifty Ugandan shillings are what a grower gets for a kilo of the coffee he grows."
"If you go down to the Sheraton in Kampala, you pay one thousand Ugandan shillings for one single cup of coffee."
"With growers receiving such a poor reward for their efforts, it is not surprising that Oxfam describes this as a situation that affects health and education and the whole rural community."
"So small farmers from Haiti to Mexico and Mozambique to Tanzania are simply selling up and selling out."
"They are unable to compete with the rich agricultural barons."
"That is the reality we are facing, one which Mr Khanbhai deals with very well indeed."
"He also gives us a very timely reminder in his report that 75% of the 1.2 billion living on less than one dollar a day are in rural areas."
"That certainly is a call to action."
"Mr President, I support this report wholeheartedly, but I wonder, Commissioner, if we do not manage to do what you so rightly say, and if we do not manage to do what this report says, whether we will be part of the problem or part of the solution?"
"Our wealth means that we ought to be part of the solution."
"When I read in the report that investment in rural economies has almost halved over the last ten years, then we should not be surprised that the income of the rural population has also dropped."
"When I toured Africa I was ashamed; throughout the rural areas of any country, people living in remote rural areas have nothing, they scarcely have a chance of survival."
"For this reason, I want to ask that we set priorities."
"That from now on we should declare that we will stop selling products from our markets that will cause problems for local producers."
"We should set honest prices."
"I agree with what has been said about the price of coffee."
"I would like to propose that we now start by abolishing unnecessary subsidies on exports; that we set up a phased plan in which we demonstrate that we want to help rural economies, rural culture, the men and women - as you correctly stressed - who live there, to produce their own food by their own efforts, with our specific help, using environmentally-friendly methods and new forms of energy without being dragged into a system of agricultural production which has proved disadvantageous for our own countries."
"Mr President, we have a long way to go before successfully bridging the gap between Third World poverty and living standards in the developed world."
"The proposed enlargement of the European Union reminds us of the inequalities between existing Member States and the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"While I am not suggesting that our efforts should be concentrated on assisting these countries in preference to Third World countries, the more we consolidate the economies, particularly the agricultural economies of the proposed new Member States, the more successful we will be in achieving our goal for Third World development."
"It does no harm to remind ourselves - and I do not say that for any selfish reason - that the EU's commitment to sustainability of family farming, both in existing Member States and for new entrants, is facing considerable difficulties."
"While the Commission proposals for a further reform of the CAP are likely to be more compatible with Third World development needs, I fear that our aspirations to protect Community farmers, particularly those on the margins, are not going to be easy to achieve."
"The fact that 1.2 billion people living in the rural areas of developing countries live in poverty is a shocking indictment of the developed world, but equally the long-term development and sustainability of Third World economies depend on our efforts and - hopefully - success in helping them to develop and add value to their natural resources, with corresponding measures to assist with market access for their products."
"It should not, however, go unnoticed that the EU is the world's largest food importer, with 53% coming from developing countries thanks to the CAP compatible trade concessions."
"I agree with Parliament's Committee on Agriculture's viewpoint that uncontrolled free world trade has had devastating effects on the development of food crops in developing countries and their entitlement to protect producers by tariff barriers."
"As regards agricultural and rural development, the EU and developing countries have the same objective of developing a multifunctional form of agriculture with increasing emphasis on rural development and the sustainability of rural communities."
"It is wrong to place all the blame for the problems of developing countries on the common agricultural policy, particularly for the reasons I have stated."
"I support the continuing access of products from developing countries to Community markets but believe the transition must be gradual and carefully planned in tandem with CAP reform."
"I abhor the term 'dumping' in so far as it refers to food produced in excess of market requirements."
"It makes no sense to overproduce a food product for which there are no consumers and even less sense to offload that product in a manner which disrupts the agricultural economy of developing countries."
"Farmers and processors must be discouraged from seeking over-access to the markets of developing countries as a substitute for poor marketing and product diversification within the Community or other developed economies."
"Mr President, I heartily agree with the aims of the Khanbhai report, which deals with the issue of how to reconcile European agricultural methods with the development of agriculture in the developing world."
"I should like to make three observations about this well-balanced and explicit report."
"First of all, a proper anti-dumping policy is necessary in order to bring about more reasonable world market prices."
"Dumping product surpluses onto world markets at extremely low prices in many cases makes world market prices drop to very low levels."
"This makes it almost impossible for farmers in poor countries to participate independently in world trade at market prices."
"The European Union is, however, still guilty of dumping in return for export subsidies."
"These subsidies account for 8% of the agricultural budget, which runs to EUR 40 billion."
"The rapporteur ought to have highlighted the abolition of export subsidies more clearly."
"Secondly, the situation for poor countries can be improved by giving them greater access to the European market for products that are essential to them."
"Access to the European market is hindered by tariff barriers and, more particularly, by non-tariff barriers such as health and environmental requirements."
"Increased access is especially crucial for countries that are only active in one product category, such as bananas, sugar or cotton."
"The rapporteur recognises the need to diversify exports and indeed makes practical suggestions."
"Finally, the trading position of poor countries is helped most by targeted development cooperation."
"The report correctly refers to the need for facilitating support."
"Structural aid for basic infrastructure comes primarily from the Member States."
"The report should therefore leave the setting of priorities with regard to spending this money to the donors and recipient countries themselves."
"Overall, the report contributes towards achieving a productive relationship between the agricultural sectors of Europe and the developing countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this report contains some very important statements, particularly where it recognises that mechanisms to protect EU farmers through the common agricultural policy are competing with the interests of farmers in developing countries, where it calls - as Members have done repeatedly - for the progressive elimination of trade and tariff barriers and increased access to markets for producers from developing countries and regrets the EU subsidised produce dumped on developing country markets."
"The report contradicts itself on this matter, predicting devastating effects of free trade which I am sure will not come to pass in the agricultural sector, but the central concern, which, I repeat, has been mentioned several times in this evening's debate too, is - and, at European level, must be - the barriers which the European Union continues to erect to access of goods, including agricultural produce, from developing countries."
"We must bear in mind that farm subsidies in wealthy countries amount to USD 350 billion per year, which is seven times more than the USD 50 billion which the same countries appropriate each year to external aid."
"In this connection, we could recall what Oxfam pointed out too, namely that, in actual fact, thanks, purely, to trade barriers, the aid we give to a continent such as Africa, for instance, is less than the value of the trade opportunities we provide for these countries."
"There are two things I would like to say to the European Commission. I believe that we need to reflect on the characteristics of an agricultural policy which would be sustainable for the developing countries and, therefore, on the fact that the Community agricultural policy is unsustainable."
"I believe we must start to take the line that the CAP has to be abolished, albeit gradually, for there are no longer any economic, social, national, European or international grounds for preserving the CAP system."
"The reform proposal put forward by the Commission is inadequate in this sense, for it preserves the amount of aid completely intact. The report helps us to understand the devastating impact of this on the developing countries."
"The Commissioner mentioned the Everything but Arms initiative, and rightly so, but I would like to remind her and the House as a whole that the Everything but Arms initiative itself provides for the deferral of the definitive abolition of tariffs on three major products - bananas, rice and sugar - to 2009."
"I feel that this does us no credit at all."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Khanbhai for his excellent report."
"Despite the moderate tone of the report, he makes some criticism of the European Union and the CAP, which I feel is, in some cases, unfair."
"Firstly, the report does not acknowledge the fact that the EU is today the largest market in the world for agri-food products from the poorest countries."
"We need only remember that the EU is the world's largest importer of agricultural products and that imports from developing countries stand at more than EUR 27 billion per year, in other words, more than all imports from these countries bought by the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Canada and Australia put together."
"Secondly, the EU and its Member States are by far the largest supporters of these countries, providing, for example, around USD 28 billion of development aid, compared to the USD 11 billion provided by Japan or the USD 9 billion from the United States."
"Thirdly, we should remember that, in negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, it is the European Union that has pushed hardest for positive discrimination in favour of developing countries and that it is the EU that is responsible for the most important initiative for the world's 50 poorest countries: the 'Everything but arms' initiative, which proposes allowing the main products of these countries onto the Community market free of any tariff and without these countries having to accept any reciprocal measures in this area."
"Lastly, I should like to point out that, fundamentally, farming in the EU complements farming in developing countries, since these are major importers of products from temperate zones, whereas the European Union is a major importer of tropical products."
"The conflict is often seen more from the point of view of the interests of certain companies operating in these countries than from the point of view of the interests of local communities."
"Mr President, in this year 2002 during which the international community has met successively in Monterrey, Rome and Johannesburg, setting as a priority the challenge of leading two-thirds of humanity out of the situation of hunger, poverty and under-development that affects them, it seemed that the European Parliament was obliged to consider and adopt a position on how the European Union can support agricultural and rural development policies that contribute to the development of the countries of the South."
"The numerous amendments, which the rapporteur has shown flexibility in accepting, mean that we are faced with an acceptable and balanced motion for a resolution."
"But there are principles that we should take more account of when assessing the different policies of the European Union and also, of course, Community agricultural policies."
"In fact, for many years the Socialists, when judging any Community policy, have used the yardstick of what that policy offered in terms of social cohesion."
"To this end a particular policy was considered by us to be positive insofar as it offered added value in terms of the cohesion of our societies and negative insofar as it increased inequalities between the Europeans."
"Well, in the global world we are becoming involved in it is clear that solidarity cannot be an exclusively internal, or intra-European, value."
"And therefore, every Community policy deserves our support insofar as they contribute not only to social cohesion within our borders but also to reducing inequalities at world level."
"For us, the common agricultural policy was something to be welcomed, since it supported our farmers, so that they would not be left behind in a process of prosperity which was benefiting other sectors of society."
"But, later on, when it comes to evaluating the Community's agricultural policies, it will not be sufficient to measure whether they contribute to maintaining or improving the situation of our farmers and breeders."
"Furthermore, we should consider whether subsidies to our producers also contribute to improving the situation in the Third World, or whether they actually devastate it, increasing the chasm separating it from our developed world."
"In this case, those policies will not be acceptable and, however difficult the exercise will be, others will have to be found which are good, fair and provide a balance for the North, while being good and fair for the South, and providing a balance in terms of relations between the South and the North."
"From this viewpoint we will vote in favour of the Resolution proposed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation as a conclusion to the report presented by Mr Khanbhai."
"Mr President, the problem of food security and famine faced by 20% of the world's population is, without doubt, a blot on the copybook of modern civilisation and proves that capitalism is unable to resolve even basic problems."
"The salient features of this report are a hypocritical interest in the people and farmers of developing countries, wishful thinking and contradictions and its ultimate purpose is to offer those responsible for the problem an alibi so that they can continue with the very policy which is exacerbating the problem."
"The objective of the proposed draft is to resolve the food security problem and it sets an interim date of 2015 for halving the number of people forced to live on a dollar a day."
"This objective is cancelled out by CAP reforms, which cut Community agricultural output in order to bring it into line with the international market, as defined by the WTO rather than mankind's food requirements. Why?"
"Because, according to the prevailing view in the European Union, food is not a commodity that meets various needs, it is a commodity that guarantees huge profits for the food industry and multinationals."
"With its endless reforms of the CAP, the European Union is becoming more and more product-deficient, ruining farmers and, at the same time, forcing developing countries, with extortionate agreements and price mechanisms, to sell their agricultural produce at knock-down prices, tightening the noose around the neck of their people and protecting the multinationals' profits."
"The solution is not to abolish subsidies in developed countries, ruining their farmers and bringing them into line with farmers in developing countries, but to maintain a parity in international trading relations between developed and developing countries in practice, so as to improve their standard of living, reduce their foreign debt and increase their overall domestic output."
"The wishful thinking and contradictions in the report reach the height of hypocrisy in the proposal to fund genetically modified crops for developing countries, to be supplied by various multinationals and never mind the consequences."
"We know from experience that famine is a political and social problem, not a technical problem."
"We have the productive potential and wherewithal to feed the entire world and still take care of the environment and public health, but not under the current social system, by which I mean the prevailing capitalist system."
"This report keeps to the standard formula and offers no positive suggestions to mitigate the global food problem."
"On the contrary, the measures it proposes will exacerbate the problem, which will be compounded by serious risks to the environment and public health and the dependency of developing countries on multinationals in the developed world."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to thank my colleague, Mr Khanbhai, very much for his own-initiative report."
"As a member of Parliament's ACP delegation, I have been concerned with this issue for years."
"Sustainable agricultural policy, land reform and rural development are important political challenges with a view to the developing countries being entirely independent."
"Why, with our considerable financial aid, have we not been able to make a more decisive contribution to improving the situation in the poorest countries?"
"I constantly ask myself what Europe is doing wrong."
"What are the rich countries doing wrong, but also what do the poor countries gain by stepping up their own efforts?"
"I think that we will have to get much tougher on these issues because we can see - and have examples to prove it - that the world population is not prepared to put up with this injustice any longer."
"As European politicians working on agriculture, we know only too well that the European Community's common agricultural policy regularly comes in for harsh criticism for the impact that it has on agriculture in the poorest countries and this has again been the case this evening in a number of contributions to the debate."
"It is true, however, that the critics often think that the answer is too easy, because it is wrong to think that a greater opening up of trade will inevitably lead to better development of the food sector in the developing countries."
"Many have said it: the EU is already the largest importer of food in the world and against this background the agricultural problems in the vast majority of developing countries will not be resolved solely by more intensive trade and agricultural deregulation."
"It is actually wrong - and here too I am addressing Mrs Kinnock - to call for total liberalisation and an abandonment of national quotas in developing countries."
"This would lead to merciless distortions of competition, which small farmers would have absolutely no chance of withstanding."
"In conclusion, allow me to mention three facts: we need production for domestic consumption and for export on the basis of a reformed system of land tenure; we need better employment; we need sustainable management and we should consider new ways forward."
"Mr President, we could go on all night discussing rural development, agricultural subsidies, gender equality, land reform, increased ODA as part of rural development and so on, but I am sure you would not want us to, even though those serious issues deserve our full attention."
"The debate will continue, and we have only touched upon these most sensitive and important issues."
"Agricultural reform, as outlined in the review, goes in the right direction, but that will certainly not be enough in the long run."
"I was happy to see that the fight against poverty was at the forefront of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg."
"That will help our forthcoming discussions."
"This report provides valuable input in the implementation stage and in the follow-up to the summit, as does the communication on rural development presented by my colleague, Mr Nielson."
"I thank you for this very important and interesting debate."
"Subsidies to large agricultural holdings in Europe are restricting agricultural production levels from small holdings in Europe and also those from developing countries which are not capable of contending with such competition."
"The CAP must be revised in this area by including all the measures that are likely to enable these countries to develop a competitive agricultural industry with respect to production costs, and also product quality."
"We will therefore ensure respect for the environment so that its degradation does not lead to the degradation of farmland, particularly compared to intensive farming, the intensive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, the pollution of agricultural produce by GMOs."
"We will therefore be able to safeguard a healthy and organic production."
"Particular attention will be paid to these issues, especially by means of collaboration with the common research centre."
"The preservation and rational use of water resources are also of the greatest importance for these countries."
"The Short and Medium-Term Priority Action Programme (SMAP) and MEDA programme and all the other programmes to enhance cooperation between the European Union and third countries could also be developed in this area."
"Mr President, the protection of biodiversity is one of our most important, but also one of our most difficult, tasks."
"Time and time again we find ourselves in a situation in which it seems that now is not the time to opt for biodiversity."
"Time and time again there are good reasons to abandon, for the time being, strict and specific measures for the protection of endangered species."
"This is the case now."
"I am talking specifically about African elephants."
"I believe that there are good reasons for not imposing a total ban on the ivory trade."
"Firstly, in accordance with scientific advice, the African elephant simply does not fulfil the criteria; the elephant population is growing and is healthy."
"Secondly, I am not convinced that a total ban would mean that poaching would cease."
"A ban might lead to a fuelling of illegal trade and push up the price."
"That will not help any elephant."
"Thirdly, the idea of the destruction of ivory meets with considerable resistance."
"Destruction goes against every notion of sustained use."
"Why should we have to destroy a natural, valued and valuable material such as ivory?"
"Finally, I am convinced that protection does not work without commitment from the local authorities and local population."
"We can try and prescribe laws for others from our ivory towers here in Strasbourg."
"We can preach morals from our ivory pulpit, but we have to realise that it does not work like that."
"Five countries in southern Africa have presented alternative plans."
"They have gained experience and have also had some success."
"We ought to take their arguments seriously at least."
"Conservation is not something that can be imposed by the international community, and we should not want that to be the case."
"There are, therefore, good reasons not to transfer the African elephant to Appendix I tomorrow."
"However there are also good reasons to do so, and that is sending a political signal."
"The signal that the European Parliament takes the protection of biodiversity seriously."
"That the European Parliament is now committing to going all out to preserve biodiversity within the European Union."
"To summarise, I can reluctantly approve the resolution, but, as far as I am concerned, it must incorporate a political pledge - the pledge that we ourselves will also do something about biodiversity."
"That we must try to find a solution that will also work for the African peoples."
"I would also like to speak about the elephants."
"Five countries in southern Africa want to sell their stocks of ivory."
"That would be very wrong."
"The previous CITES conferences took the decision to stop protecting the elephant."
"Unfortunately that was approved by the Commission with the majority of the fifteen EU governments, but against the wishes of the European Parliament."
"This has proved disastrous."
"Illegal elephant poaching is now taking place on a much bigger scale, also in southern Africa."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes unanimously to give elephants full protection once more."
"The Commission must abandon its cowardly, half-hearted position."
"MIKE (monitoring of illegal killing of elephants) does not work."
"Let us use European money - EUR 10 to 15 million would be enough - to buy up and destroy southern Africa's ivory stocks, and if the majority of the European governments will not agree to that, then the NGOs will have to collect enough money to stop all the elephants being sold off."
"There are only 10 000 elephants left in Asia and 300 000 in Africa."
"Twenty years ago, in 1981, there were as many as 1 500 000."
"Whoever maintains that elephants are in a strong position is mistaken."
"I do not approve of the culling of elephants; it is uncivilised."
"I am curious to see who will vote for culling tomorrow."
"Mr President, I do not think that any of us here are contesting whether or not there should be an ivory trade: of course there should not."
"But that has nothing to do with the fact that southern African elephants should not be moved back into Appendix I."
"I do not know whether you have seen the letter we received this week from the European Sustainable Use specialist group."
"It reminds us that such a decision would be directly contrary to the scientific advice given to the parties by IUCN, who are the official advisers to the CITES conference on species listing proposals."
"This advice points out that the elephant populations of the southern African countries mentioned do not meet the criteria for Appendix I, but meet the criteria for Appendix II."
"So, scientifically we have absolutely no reason to move them."
"Nor should we if we want to maintain the populations because it is quite clear that the use of wild living resources, if they are sustainable - and they are in southern Africa - is an important conservation tool."
"The social and economic benefits derived from such use provide incentives for people to conserve them."
"As it is, if we were to take them back into Appendix I, it would send the wrong signal to those countries that have a small elephant population."
"It would say to them that if they try to invest money in preserving their elephants, they will not get back any revenue."
"So they will pay out for the elephants, instead of paying for schools or hospitals."
"What kind of incentive to preserve elephants does that give to countries with small elephant populations?"
"It is a pity that more of you were not at the presentation by the Minister of Wildlife and Tourism of Botswana."
"She said that they loved their elephants."
"They want to preserve them and the way they can best do this is to keep them in Appendix II."
"Mr President, I am going to comment on paragraph 3 of this motion for a resolution and, specifically, on the species with the scientific name of Dissostichus, which is known as the Patagonian or Antarctic toothfish."
"The Dissostichus is of great commercial value (it is known as 'black gold') and its balance is very delicate."
"The Committee on Fisheries, of which I am a member, has produced three reports on this resource and I am rapporteur for the one which relates to the creation of a system for documenting catches."
"Today I would like to argue to the House that it should not be included on the CITES list, for the following reasons: we cannot forget that there is already an international organisation - the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which from now on I will refer to by its initials, CAMELAR - which, for twenty years, has been successfully dealing with the preservation of this and other species in the Antarctic Ocean."
"The Community is a contracting party to this Convention."
"The proposal to include Dissostichus in the CITES Convention did not come from us but from Australia."
"Neither we nor - as far as I know - the Commission oppose this; we simply believe that it would be more useful for CAMELAR itself to take this decision at its annual assembly, which is taking place this week and next week in Chile, and in which the European Parliament will be represented by Mr Stevenson, the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries."
"Following tough negotiations, CAMELAR has now incorporated Canada and Mauritius with the status of associate members."
"Together with the United States, Canada is the main commercial destination of the species Dissostichus and Mauritius, a significant place of transit."
"Their entry into CAMELAR gives this international organisation control of 98% of the world trade in Dissostichus."
"For us, CITES would be useful as a complement to CAMELAR."
"But we must be cautious, because - if our decision-making moves faster than the natural course of events - we could unintentionally cause unwanted contrary effects, weakening an organisation that, during its long life, has done a great amount of good work with regard to the Antarctic marine environment, which is extremely delicate."
"We must concentrate our efforts, not disperse them, and we must increase our presence in multilateral fisheries organisations, which is the only way to respond to the challenges that the preservation of fish species confront us with on a world scale."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you - and also my fellow Members - have already said, the issue of elephants will once again be discussed at the forthcoming CITES meeting."
"If we move elephants back into Appendix I, at the request of India and Kenya, will this be enough to prevent these animals from tragically becoming extinct in some countries of Africa, even though their numbers are on the increase in other countries?"
"Opinions are divided."
"The MIKE system that has been set up, which is highly sophisticated, has not yet provided, and will not provide, according to a number of specialists, a satisfactory answer."
"It has, in fact, absorbed a substantial amount of funding which could have been put to better use, had it, for example, been spent on ways to combat poaching or on the training of keepers."
"Elephants are poached for their ivory and their natural habitat has been considerably altered and reduced."
"Even if their use is authorised, whatever the precise and restrictive framework that might be decided upon, there is a danger that poaching will once again become widespread and that this, in the long term, will led to elephants becoming extinct in some countries of Africa."
"The European Union must therefore very firmly reject any unlawful resumption of the trade in ivory."
"At the same time, what lesson could we have to give the local populations who would levy a reasonable tax on their fauna, when we ourselves, in France for example, are incapable of providing adequate conditions for the survival of bears in the Pyrenees or rare wolves in the Alps?"
"By way of comparison, we welcome the gesture made by Cuba, which has withdrawn its request for the use of turtles and, in parallel, the European Union has a duty to reject the request, submitted by the Cayman Islands to breed green turtles in captivity, which could facilitate the illegal trade in these animals."
"The desire and the need to safeguard biodiversity on the planet requires the adoption of tough and proactive decisions which must not allow any loophole for traffickers of any kind, whilst enabling the local populations to use their natural resources, including fauna, in a sustainable manner, even if this may sometimes be akin to attempting the impossible."
"Mr President, I would like to conclude with two short remarks on elephants and toothfish."
"First, I would like to reassure you that the Commission remains opposed to any measures that could increase the illegal killing of elephants."
"I have already stated that we are opposed to the resumption of the commercial ivory trade until it can be demonstrated that this will not lead to an increase in poaching."
"At the same time, I acknowledge the excellent record of a number of southern African countries in managing their elephant populations."
"It is easy to understand why these countries sometimes feel they are penalised rather than rewarded for their efforts."
"If their concerns are not addressed, there is a real risk that these countries will be unable to maintain popular support for elephant conservation or for CITES in general."
"We should avoid measures such as the proposed stricter classification for elephants in CITES which will only serve to polarise the debate, without achieving any real additional protection for these animals."
"On toothfish, we must respect the competence of CAMLAR and other fisheries organisations, at the same time taking a constructive approach to any proposals that might achieve better protection for commercial fish species."
"Accordingly, if CITES listing can strengthen and complement CAMLAR's current management of toothfish you may rest assured that it will have my support and that of the Commission."
"To conclude the debate on this statement I have received a motion for a resolution B5-0527/2002, pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on two reports by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy:"
"(A5-0291/2002), on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals (COM(2001) 803 - C5-0320/2002 - 2002/0026(CNS)),"
"(A5-0290/2002), on the proposal for a Council decision approving, on behalf of the European Community, the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade (COM(2001) 802 - C5-0095/2002 - 2002/0030(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have before you two Commission proposals concerning the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) Procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade."
"One is a decision to ratify this Convention on behalf of the European Community; the other the regulation required in order to implement the Convention in the Community."
"The decision on ratification hardly needs further elaboration."
"The Commission proposal for an implementing regulation reflects the position of both the Commission and the Member States: that the provisions should go beyond purely incorporating the Convention, which was the result of a compromise between all of the parties to the negotiations."
"The Community called for stricter provisions in certain respects but did not manage to push them through."
"The Commission considers that the proposals are well balanced and that they will contribute to the achievement of the Community's objective of improving the protection of human health and the environment in importing countries - especially developing countries - from hazardous chemicals, without preventing the smooth application of the Convention."
"The Commission is grateful for the support the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has given to the proposals."
"It wants the Community to ratify the Convention early on, in accordance with the spirit of the conclusions of the Johannesburg Summit."
"The Commission hopes, therefore, that agreement can be reached as soon as possible on the implementing regulation, which it considers to be a prerequisite for the work on ratification to continue."
"In this connection, the Commission wishes to stress the efforts of the Council and Parliament in making progress with the work on the proposals, above all, the compromises reached as the basis for a possible agreement between the Council and Parliament at first reading of the proposal for an implementing regulation."
"By way of conclusion, I wish sincerely to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, something which I should have said right at the start."
". (NL) Mr President, I do not often get 10 minutes of speaking time but I hope I will not need it all."
"We have before us two reports regarding the import and export of chemical products."
"The first report supports the approval of the Treaty of Rotterdam in respect of specific hazardous chemical products and pesticides in international trade."
"I propose that we do this as quickly as possible, given that the Treaty can enter into force from the moment that it has been ratified by sufficient parties."
"The report concentrates mainly on the following three points:"
"First of all, parties to the Treaty can only export chemicals included in the Appendix to another party to the Treaty if they have obtained prior approval from the importing country."
"This is called the PIC procedure - Prior Informed Consent."
"Secondly, new products may be added to the Appendix to which the PIC procedure applies."
"Thirdly, a party exporting prohibited or strictly regulated chemical products must provide information to the importing party."
"Moreover, all products listed in the Appendix to which the PIC procedure applies, must be labelled."
"These matters have already been more or less laid down in a regulation dating back to 1992."
"The chemical industry also began to implement the Treaty of Rotterdam voluntarily in April of this year."
"There is therefore no longer any reason to delay the ratification of this Treaty any longer."
"The second report aims to implement the Treaty of Rotterdam through a regulation."
"This regulation goes further than the Treaty of Rotterdam on a number of points."
"It is somewhat stricter, more precise and broader, and this can be seen as an improvement to the legislation."
"More has also been done in respect of providing information to third countries, especially developing countries."
"A more difficult issue is that in the original proposal by the Commission, the Commission itself wanted to impose a monopoly on the procedures."
"This is not sensible, as Member States do not all have the same legislation with regard to chemical products."
"I am referring particularly to pesticides and biocides."
"As you know, it will take another five to ten years before we have Community legislation on this area."
"It is also possible that, even after this period, Member States will make use of exceptional provisions."
"It is therefore a good idea to leave some leeway for the Member States in this regulation."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted 15 amendments."
"The legal basis for the regulation has been amended from the internal market to the environment."
"This means codecision for the European Parliament."
"More freedom has also been created for the individual Member States, meaning that individual Member States can pass more far-reaching measures."
"This will be evident from the fact that individual Member States may also make proposals with regard to adding new products to the list to which prior informed consent applies, as there is still a group of products for which there is still no harmonised European legislation, such as pesticides."
"Another improvement is that the lists of hazardous products will only have to be updated each year at the most."
"It is very important that persistent organic products are added to this regulation."
"The arrangements made as part of the Treaty of Stockholm are included in the list of prohibited products."
"As it seems that the Council had a similar vision to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as rapporteur I have tried to complete the legislative process at first reading."
"For this purpose I was given the mandate by the parliamentary groups."
"The talks on this area were most satisfactory."
"The Council adopted most of the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Council's mostly technical adjustments were easy to incorporate."
"This led to 42 new amendments, which were signed by most of the groups."
"The Council sent a letter which promised that if the European Parliament accepted the total package of compromises, the Council would lay down the common position accordingly."
"This means that we could complete matters by the end of the first reading, saving a considerable amount of time - at least a year."
"I am really pleased to hear from Mrs Wallström that the European Commission is also able to endorse the measures wholeheartedly."
"I would like to request that special attention be paid to Amendment No 22."
"With regard to the scope, it has been agreed with the Council that the rules will in any case apply to amounts exceeding 10 kg."
"This will be very sensible in practice for feasibility and control purposes."
"This is also part of the whole package of measures."
"Mr President, the package of compromises before you is a very satisfactory result that I can heartily recommend to Parliament."
"The voting slip comprises 4 blocks."
"Block 1 covers the compromise amendments with the Council."
"If block 1 is adopted, block 2 will no longer apply."
"Block 3 comprises the amendments of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy which were approved by the Council, so we must vote in favour of these."
"Finally block 4 comprises 3 amendments which must be rejected by Parliament, based on the total compromise."
"Finally, I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Danish Presidency for their proper, constructive cooperation."
"Mr President, there is not a lot more which needs to be said, because most of it has been said by Mr Blokland."
"I would like to start by agreeing with the last speaker."
"This is a good report and the rapporteurs have worked really hard on it."
"A first-reading agreement, though it is not absolutely certain yet, is what we would like to see."
"We think that by and large the amendments are sensible additions to the text."
"We are a little concerned about the proposals on Member States including chemicals in the PIC procedure and think that everyone should be properly consulted if that is going to happen."
"We need this measure without delay."
"It will help to improve our public health and environmental protection, both inside and outside the European Union."
"We are anxious to go through with it and we will be supporting the vast majority of the amendments and following the rapporteur tomorrow."
"We would like to see a solution as quickly as possible."
"We need more international agreements like this and we need speed."
"Many pieces of chemical legislation have taken too long to be properly implemented in the past."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am tremendously pleased that we have reached this compromise, which means that we will now also be able to arrive at a compromise with the Council at first reading."
"I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, the Danish Presidency and the Commission for making a real effort to arrive at a solution which is satisfactory and acceptable for us all, even if not all of our amendments have been adopted."
"The intentions of the Rotterdam Convention are important, and it is also important that it be ratified as quickly as possible, because it concerns the trade in extremely hazardous chemicals."
"I also think that it can be said that the Commission did an excellent job in presenting this proposal for a regulation, which is to replace the present legislation on hazardous chemicals and pesticides with the rules of the Rotterdam Convention."
"The proposal actually goes beyond the Convention, for example in proposing that the export notification procedure, too, must be extended to cover articles containing so-called 'unreacted' forms of chemicals and that the export of certain chemicals must be banned outright."
"I am extremely pleased with the proposal, therefore."
"The aim of this whole exercise and of the Convention is to improve the control of the trade in hazardous chemicals and to place joint and increased responsibility on importing and exporting countries."
"It is about protecting human health and the environment."
"For this reason, I also believe that it is reasonable and fair that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, with the help of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has changed the legal basis from Article 133 to Article 175, which means that the European Parliament has codecision powers and, at the same time, enables the Member States to have stricter rules."
"I really hope, therefore, that we obtain a large majority, perhaps unanimity, in favour of this report tomorrow."
"I believe that we have every reason to congratulate ourselves."
"Mr President, I shall make short comments on some of the amendments tabled for the vote tomorrow."
"Most relate to the draft implementing regulation."
"Firstly on the legal base, as the Commission has already made clear in the Council, it believes that Article 133 - not Article 175(1) - is the correct legal base."
"The Commission has to reserve its right to make use of the legal means at its disposal."
"Given our position on the legal base, the Commission cannot accept that national regulatory actions taken by Member States should only fall within the scope of the regulation and be subject to the procedures for export notification and PIC notification."
"It follows that the Commission cannot accept Amendments 3, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 17, 20, 26, 33 and 34."
"On the other hand, the Commission recognises that Community import responses for PIC chemicals should, additionally, give us as complete a picture as possible."
"The Commission can therefore accept Amendments 11 and 18."
"On the Commission's role as regards Community participation in the Convention, given its position on the legal base, the Commission cannot accept Amendment 28."
"Article 14 of the Commission proposals provides for the possibility of an export ban for certain chemicals to be listed in Annex V. The Commission knows the wish of Parliament and the Council to add the chemicals subject to the POPs Convention to Annex V, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant annexes to that convention."
"However, the Commission can accept Amendment 56, as drafted, together with the associated Amendments 41 to 46, 48, 50 and 53."
"The remaining amendments are technical, mainly aimed at giving greater precision to certain provisions."
"The Commission can accept all these amendments."
"I now turn to the draft ratification decision."
"Three amendments have been tabled and, for the reasons I have already explained, the Commission cannot accept the change of legal base proposed in Amendment 1, nor can it accept Amendment 3 that stems from it."
"Finally, the Commission can accept Amendment 2 which reintroduces the principle of a key Commission role in the Community's participation in the different bodies implementing the convention."
"I shall hand over a summary of the Commission position on oral statements, if that is acceptable to you."
"Finally, once again I thank Mr Blokland for his hard work on a constructive and valuable report."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing the thanks of the Commission to the rapporteur, Mr García?Margallo y Marfil, for his work and for his extremely forthcoming attitude."
"I would also like to express our appreciation of the fact that Mr García?Margallo y Marfil has decided not to retable the amendments which played a role in the first reading of this proposal."
"I have listened with great interest to what Mr García?Margallo y Marfil has just said."
"Many of the matters that he discussed are important but, at the present time, the Fiscalis programme is more restricted than he would have liked."
"However, it is important that the programme should be adopted before the expiry of the current Fiscalis programme, which ends on the 31 December of this year."
"I am therefore very pleased that this proposal has secured the support of the European Parliament at second reading. I would therefore like to welcome, in particular, the positive contribution of the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr García?Margallo y Marfil."
"As you may be aware from the Commission's communication to Parliament on the Council's common position, the Commission has expressed its satisfaction that the Council endorsed the general approach adopted in its original proposal."
"The Commission has noted that the Council has supported the continuation of the actions currently carried out under the existing Fiscalis programme."
"In particular, the Commission has welcomed the Council's support for extending these actions to the area of direct taxation."
"Nevertheless, the communication regretted the reduction in budget from the Commission's original proposal of EUR 56 million to EUR 44 million."
"I am satisfied that an agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission has been possible, so that the new programme may be adopted shortly."
"For that support, I would like to thank Members of Parliament and, in particular, as I said, Mr García?Margallo y Marfil."
"Mr President, I also welcome the progress made in this report on the Fiscalis programme for the next five years."
"I would particularly like to welcome and draw attention to the statement in the common position."
"As the rapporteur has already mentioned, it points out that this is not a political programme, but one designed to enhance administrative cooperation between Member States' tax officials."
"It is important that we are clear about this objective."
"We are talking here about improving administration, and not in any way about tax harmonisation."
"When it was first proposed that the extension of the programme was going to be aimed at direct taxation, there was a lot of concern, particularly in the UK, that this might lead to measures to introduce harmonisation of direct taxes."
"We therefore welcome the fact that the common position clearly states this will not happen."
"If I may speak on behalf of the UK once again, we particularly welcome this because we have been among the most active users of the Fiscalis programme over the last few years."
"We think it is very valuable, so I would certainly be concerned if anything happened to detract from the programme and make it more difficult for certain Member States to take part in it."
"The programme has much to offer."
"It has introduced exchanges of officials; it has introduced seminars on tax issues of common interest; it has provided multilateral control exercises, it has developed professional training, such as audit skills; it has improved language training and it has maintained and developed communication and information exchange systems."
"That is all very good stuff and to be welcomed, continued and improved upon."
"What we are always trying to do in these sort of situations is improve the way that the systems work and get things to work better."
"Certainly, that has been one of the achievements of the Fiscalis programme."
"Therefore, it is to be regretted, as the Commissioner said, that we are seeing a cut in the budget."
"All we can hope is that the budget, as it now stands, will be adequate to take the programme forward."
"So, on the whole, I welcome the common position and the fact that it looks as if we are going to be able to achieve an agreement and get the programme extended."
"I also welcome the fact that we are very clear now that this is not about tax harmonisation in any way, but about administrative systems."
"Mr President, the absence of an institutional agreement would lead to a delicate situation as the rapporteur has already acknowledged, given the urgency of adopting a new Fiscalis framework that is operational on 1 January 2003."
"It is a shame, however, that the Council's agreement with the positions adopted by Parliament has been established only for a minimum period."
"It is significant, incidentally, that whilst acknowledging that the aim of the Fiscalis programme is not to harmonise tax legislation, the Commission has welcomed the fact that a statement to this effect has been included in the minutes."
"Even though it may be acceptable to classify the Fiscalis programme as a mere tool for strengthening administrative cooperation, the European Parliament will nevertheless have to concern itself with the political effects of implementing this type of programme."
"Although it is true that tax evasion and fraud have a national dimension specific to each country, they also and increasingly have a supranational dimension rooted in the use of sophisticated techniques and schemes."
"At a particularly delicate time for the Union's public finances, these factors cannot be ignored and much less can we fail to take advantage of the opportunities arising in order to change and improve the tax situation."
"It should be added that the EU is on the threshold of an historic round of enlargement, which means that, with the entry of new countries and different tax policies, new and hitherto unseen problems will also arise."
"In fact, the new programme extends the scope of the programme to cover not only direct taxation, but also the candidate countries."
"Improving the functioning of tax systems in the internal market is, in itself, a praiseworthy objective, but combating tax fraud and evasion as well as launching bases with a minimum degree of harmonisation are also opportunities that should not be wasted."
"I therefore regret the fact that the Commission has invoked Article 95 of the Treaty with regard to this matter, and has not dared to invoke Article 93."
"With the reserves that have been created and bearing in mind the need for the new programme to get off the ground, I support the rapporteur's recommendation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Welcome"
"I would like, on behalf of the House to give a warm welcome to the delegation from New Zealand, who are led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mr Jonathan Hunt, and who are seated in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery."
"Mr Speaker, we welcome you!"
"The delegation from New Zealand consists of five members of the country's House of Representatives."
"The Tenth Interparliamentary Conference between the European Parliament and New Zealand started yesterday and several meetings have already been held."
"Further meetings are scheduled for today."
"New Zealand and the European Union are closely joined together by common values, faith in democratic institutions and the decisive role played by parliamentary democracy."
"We are glad that you are visiting our House here in Strasbourg and hope that you will have good dialogues during your stay here and that the bonds of friendship between Europe and New Zealand will continue to flourish."
"(Applause)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0343/2002) by Mr Robert Goebbels on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Council common position (9359/6/2002 - C5-0384/2002 - 2001/0118(COD)) for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on insider dealing and market manipulation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on market abuses is important for several reasons."
"It is the first directive to be adopted under what is known as the Lamfalussy procedure."
"This is a piece of framework legislation that will be supplemented by implementing regulations."
"The Commission will pass this secondary legislation on the basis of proposals by the Committee of European Securities Regulators, known as CESR in English."
"The CESR will draft its proposals on the basis of broad public consultation."
"The Commission will also adopt the implementing regulations in a transparent way."
"The Ecofin Council and the European Parliament will monitor the Commission."
"Parliament will have a deadline of three months in which to deliver an opinion."
"If, within that period, Parliament adopts a resolution, the Commission will have to re-examine its draft measures."
"This, therefore, provides a guarantee that secondary legislation will be democratically monitored."
"For the future, in order to provide the possibility both of giving secondary legislation more regulations of a technical nature and of providing colegislators with final decision-making rights, a 'call-back' procedure, amending Article 202 of the Treaty, absolutely must be provided for."
"The aim of the directive is to lay down the same rules for all financial products throughout the Union, in order to combat all forms of insider dealing and market abuse."
"At first reading, Parliament adopted 77 amendments."
"The Council accepted 60 of these in full and 10 in part. This is clearly a success for Parliament."
"I wish to pay tribute to the Belgian, Spanish and Danish presidencies and to the Commission staff, who have always proved willing to reach workable compromises."
"I also address my thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, especially Mr Thomas Mann."
"Because the Commission and the Council have declared their agreement on the five amendments accepted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs following second reading, the directive could be implemented quite rapidly."
"The new rules will certainly help to restore confidence in the integrity of the financial markets."
"Since the bursting of the speculative bubble over the stock markets and the financial scandals that have hit both the United States and Europe, many investors are hesitant."
"Since the beginning of 2000, more than USD 7 trillion of virtual stock exchange profits have also been wiped off the market."
"In Europe, several thousand billion euros have also gone up in smoke."
"This situation destabilises economies, penalises savers, weakens investment funds and lowers the value of pension funds."
"In order to restore the confidence of investors and small savers in the financial markets, we must combat all forms of criminal connivance, forcing companies to be as transparent as possible."
"In recent months, we have seen numerous revelations about the pally form of capitalism operating amongst company directors, accounting companies, investment banks and financial analysts."
"This entire group, which on the surface, appears to be quite respectable, operated in such a way that it could milk stock market exuberance for their own profit."
"As a result of the market's lack of transparency, there have been conflicts of interest within accounting firms."
"Many financial analysts have been both judge and accused."
"Auditors and analysts duped the market players that placed their trust in them."
"The reason for this was the practice of stock options and other personal bonuses to be received in line with the financial results of their employers."
"The sums in question sometimes defy belief."
"One example is that the CEOs of the twenty-five largest American companies to have declared themselves bankrupt in the last 18 months had awarded themselves, in the three years preceding their company's bankruptcy, packages totalling around USD 3.3 billion."
"Although we should not generalise, the golden years of the financial sector have nevertheless led to a sort of 'financial mad cow disease' - the 'mad finance syndrome'."
"Just like the clean-up of the meat market, the need for and the establishment of a rigorous monitoring system and the clean-up of the financial markets will require precise rules to combat all insider dealing and all market manipulation."
"The sole aim of the directive is to better regulate the financial markets."
"It is not seeking to regulate the profession of journalism."
"Unfortunately, some parts of the press, especially in the United Kingdom, have launched a sometimes incredible campaign against the Commission's proposals, suggesting that the very freedom of the press was at stake."
"The freedom of the press has not been in any danger and nor will it be."
"The first article clearly states that no journalist can be held responsible for disseminating false or misleading information, unless that journalist is gaining any advantage or profit from divulging such information."
"I am starting from the premise that all journalists attempt to do their job correctly and that they check their sources."
"If a journalist is wrong, they will not be held responsible, unless he has touched money in the manipulation that has occurred."
"Some recent scandals, from the Daily Mirror to the Magazine des actionnaires, show that no profession is entirely honest."
"Parliament wishes to encourage the establishment of codes of good conduct and self-regulation for journalists, not least with regard to potential conflicts of interest, but the best form of self-regulation in the world will never exempt legislators from having to remain vigilant and from intervening at regulatory level if, perchance, self-regulation should prove to be inadequate or unworkable."
"This is why I ask you to reject the two strangely identical amendments tabled on this matter."
"It is simply unacceptable that a profession, even one as respectable as journalism, should attempt to exempt itself definitively from a European regulation that concerns it."
"Once again, it is not the CESR that will establish the rules but the Commission, under the democratic control of the Council and Parliament."
"I can assure you, Mr President, that I shall be the first, and not the only one, to oppose any attack on the freedom of the press or against any unworkable over-regulation."
"European law must, however, be the same for everyone."
"Every democrat and, consequently, every journalist worthy of the name should welcome this crucial principle."
"I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Goebbels, for all his efforts."
"As we all know, he has been working under heavy pressure."
"This is a very complex and sensitive issue."
"I applaud the fact that he has resolutely defended the aim of the directive, which is to enhance the integrity of European financial markets."
"I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteur and Members of this Parliament and, in particular, of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their readiness to proceed as quickly as possible."
"After all the discussions we have had on comitology in the past, let me highlight the successful cooperation between our institutions in drawing up this directive, the first to apply the Lamfalussy approach in full."
"I believe that today's text will provide a good basis for effective cooperation between the European Commission and the European Parliament in the future."
"As Mr Goebbels knows, the Commission is in favour of amending Articles 202 and 211 of the Treaty to bring the positions of Parliament and the Council into line."
"I hope that will become even clearer in the contribution the Commission is preparing for the Convention, which, I hope, will be finalised by the end of November."
"Mr Goebbels, his colleagues and the Commission think alike on that topic."
"I assure this Parliament that the European Union has no truck with greedy financial cheats - certainly not with the equivalent of financial mad cows, as Mr Goebbels called them."
"That is a very vivid phrase which the Commission finds very apt."
"We want stable, transparent, integrated and efficient European markets for every consumer and investor."
"The directive will indeed enhance investor protection and make European financial markets more secure and attractive in future."
"It will dispel the international concerns expressed over the last few years about insider dealing and manipulation on European markets."
"As we are all aware, recent events have shown how important these issues are."
"Scandals like Enron and other household names show clearly the need for strong rules to make markets more transparent and safe, to ensure that they remain free of abuse and free of fraud."
"The smooth functioning of financial markets and public confidence in them are essential to sustained economic growth and the creation of wealth."
"Abuse of markets leads to companies paying more for the finance they need; investors will stay away and the economy will suffer as a result."
"We must do everything to stamp this out and to restore public confidence in our markets."
"The directive aims to do just that."
"Since there has been an in-depth discussion about the application of the directive to journalists, which Mr Goebbels referred to, let me say a few words on that subject."
"Firstly, may I make it clear that under no circumstances do we want to add to the burdens of journalists."
"The directive does not do that."
"Journalism is a difficult profession; the pressure of work is great and we do not want to add to that."
"The directive guarantees freedom of expression and the liberty of the media."
"That is clearly expressed in the recitals, and the text of the directive itself introduces several safeguards for journalists, including the possibility of self-regulation."
"However, recent scandals in several Member States have shown how recommendations by journalists to buy or sell a specific share can influence its market price to their advantage."
"What we do not want is to exempt from transparency obligations the small category of highly specialised financial journalists who recommend investment strategies."
"The Commission cannot therefore accept Amendments 6 and 7."
"It would not seem justified to exempt this rather small category of persons from basic market integrity standards which apply to all the other market participants."
"In addition, completely or partially excluding journalists from the scope of the directive would mean harmonising the definition of 'journalist' at Community level, not a very easy task and something we do not wish to do."
"Therefore, Amendment 5 is a compromise proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for today's plenary."
"It is fair both to journalists and to the public interest, and therefore acceptable."
"I strongly hope that Members of this Parliament share the view of Mr Goebbels and of the Commission on this point."
"After all, financial journalists who specifically recommend a certain strategy to the investing public should declare any conflict of interests they may have."
"I do not see why that should not be a useful aspect of this directive."
"So the Commission can agree with Amendments 1 to 5, but we cannot agree, for the reasons which I have already explained, to Amendments 6 and 7."
"Should Parliament adopt the common position together with Amendments 1 to 5 and reject Amendments 6 and 7, for which I am now making a plea, I hope the Council will be able finally to accept this text in the next few weeks."
"Adoption of the directive before the end of the year would be a major step towards the integration of European financial markets by 2005 that we all aspire to."
"I recommend adoption of this directive to Parliament and I hope that all who take part in the debate will agree with Mr Goebbels and myself."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it now gives me great pleasure to call Mr Thomas Mann."
"Before you speak, Mr Mann, let me most warmly congratulate you on having the Federal Cross of Merit conferred on you yesterday by the German Federal President."
"Congratulations, Mr Mann!"
"Let me also take the opportunity, as he is present in the Chamber - and please allow me this - to also congratulate the leader of the group, who is sitting in front of me."
"He was, indeed, invested yesterday, by the Federal President, with the Federal Grand Cross of Merit!"
"Warm congratulations to both Members!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I feel especially honoured that it is you who are presiding when this important report is presented."
"The American and European financial markets continue to be hit by successive scandals, which make it clear that the actors in them include many black sheep, who lack professional integrity."
"Balance sheets are being falsified, funds embezzled, and false information deftly fed to the public."
"Securities are first talked up in price, then offloaded at a profit, and shortly afterwards the price falls rapidly."
"Many small investors have suffered as a result of market abuse and insider dealing."
"This makes clear rules and confidence-building measures necessary."
"As the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, I had a hand in a number of the amendments."
"At first reading, Parliament submitted 77 amendments, to the quality of which the Council paid tribute by adopting almost 60 in their entirety and giving partial approval to 10 more."
"At the time, I congratulated Robert Goebbels, the rapporteur, and I would like to reiterate those congratulations now that we are at second reading stage."
"We have come to agree on important matters."
"The points at issue include 'frontrunning', in which, on the basis of a client's being of sufficient size to affect the market on its own, brokers trade on their own account even before they carry out the client's orders."
"This is to exploit insider information and is already prohibited."
"A ban should apply to all the markets within the scope of the directive."
"The question of how financial journalists who recommend investments to the public should be obliged to disclose their conflicts of interest - to which Commissioner Bolkestein has just referred - provided substantial material for debate."
"We are not dealing here with objective financial information, but exclusively with recommendations to the public."
"There are journalists who succeed in using their own publications to manipulate the prices of securities for their own benefit."
"Yet it should be in the interests of journalists themselves to make a distinction between their reputable and less reputable colleagues."
"It is surely not acceptable that a small element in a single profession should get some sort of derogation."
"I have proposed, by way of compromise, taking Mrs Kauppi's amendment as a basis for taking into account journalists' professional rules of conduct, including self-regulation, when arranging the technical details."
"Mr Goebbels and I have jointly tabled an amendment providing for this idea to be incorporated in Article 6 (10), which covers this area."
"This was supported by a broad majority on the committee."
"I am of course acquainted with the criticisms of CESR, the Committee of European Securities Regulators, and with the open letter from journalists' associations concerning its work, but I want now to point out that it has no legislative authority, and cannot, therefore, impose binding rules on the way journalists work."
"The Commission called on it, as an independent institution, to play an advisory role."
"The Commission will then elaborate the regulation, which will be submitted to the European Securities Committee - including representatives of the Member States' finance ministries - and also to us in Parliament."
"I cannot imagine that the Commission will disregard the principles of press freedom and journalists' right to free expression of opinion."
"After all, they are anchored in the recitals of this directive."
"As the PPE-DE Group's shadow rapporteur, then, I am seeking support for the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee's resolutions dating back to early October, which, slightly altered, now form Amendments Nos 1 to 5."
"Commissioner, on that you have my forthright support."
"Under these circumstances, there is a good chance that the Commission and the Council will give their assent at an early stage."
"The directive could enter into force at the beginning of 2003."
"That would represent a decisive move towards greater integrity in Europe's financial markets, with greater confidence on the part of investors resulting in increased investments."
"I believe we have a good chance of ensuring that we win broad support for this important piece of comitology."
"The recommendation for second reading on a directive on market abuse, which we are considering today, is both timely and appropriate."
"It is timely because confidence in the integrity of market participants has been seriously damaged over the last two years as a result of various cases of market abuse, chiefly in the United States."
"It is appropriate because the common position addresses the need for regulatory authorities to have sufficient enforcement flexibility to be able to detect market abuse and sanction its practitioners on a consistent and effective basis."
"Also covered is the right of market participants to enjoy reasonable legal certainty that their actions will be considered appropriate."
"The key is to be able to deal with market abuse in a consistent manner."
"Those who have intent and knowledge of market abuse - and knowledge includes journalists - or who act recklessly will be punished."
"Those whose actions are innocent but have unintended effects will not, however, be penalised."
"The fact that we now have a debate with so few amendments tabled nearly 18 months after the initial proposal, when the financial services industry initially questioned whether there was any need for such a proposal, owes much to the skill and patience of our rapporteur, Mr Goebbels."
"I would like to congratulate him."
"We have obtained an appropriate definition of market manipulation and of financial instruments whose use falls within the scope of the directive."
"Nevertheless, Member States must increase the resources available to their regulators so that they can be effective in their investigation and pursuit of market manipulators."
"Mr President, I will begin with the controversial issue in this directive."
"It should clearly cover financial journalists, and Article 1 of the directive does just that."
"If journalists profit from the dissemination of information, they will fall within the scope of the directive and they can and will be prosecuted."
"The controversial question is different."
"Should journalists be subject to new regulations that may be established by the Commission and financial regulators, as currently proposed under Article 6(10)?"
"Currently, Member States must ensure there is appropriate regulation so that persons who disseminate research or other information, i.e. news organisations, take reasonable care that such information is fairly presented."
"Commissioner Bolkestein would have us believe that it only concerns journalists if they recommend shares."
"That is not what the directive says."
"It actually gives the Commission and financial regulators a role in determining whether information is fairly presented."
"You do not need much imagination to see how this provision could undermine press freedom."
"It is extraordinary to suggest that the financial regulators, the most criticised public institutions in most Member States - they always get the blame when banks fail - should help determine whether information has been fairly presented."
"This is why the ELDR Group has retabled an amendment we tabled in committee seeking to exclude bona fide journalists from this regulatory provision, not from the whole scope of the directive, and to do so without opening up any loophole that would allow financial analysts to parade themselves as journalists."
"Do we really want today to set such an extraordinary precedent?"
"Do we really want to introduce the first ever European regulation of the press?"
"Do we want to ignore the objections of news organisations like Handelsblatt, Reuters, Agence France Press and the Financial Times, all of which live by their high reputations?"
"Do we really want to take this terrible first step of regulating the press without a proper discussion of the potential consequences?"
"I urge you to back the ELDR Group amendment and reject this ill-thought-through attempt to introduce media regulation by the back door."
"Mr President, I would say that our Parliament has worked extremely well and that we should congratulate our rapporteur, Robert Goebbels, on his excellent work."
"We should, in particular, welcome the fact that the pressure to incorporate the concept of intent into the definition of offences, a concept which is usually impossible to prove, has been rejected, and also the fact that we have strengthened obligations of transparency in the field of insider information and in cooperation between market surveillance authorities."
"We are therefore in the process of breaking in the Lamfalussy procedure which has got off to a good start, I believe, with fine cooperation between our three institutions."
"Nevertheless, I feel that it is perhaps regrettable that the Commission asked, at 6 p.m., to begin its work on the regulation's implementation before it is even adopted by Parliament and the Council."
"In any event, this was merely an excuse to redouble the pressure exerted by the lobbies of financial journalists who want, in fact, to create a general exception in their favour in the field of comitology; I am talking about self-regulation full stop."
"In our view, financial journalists must indeed comply with all the provisions concerning transparency and the veracity of information and, with regard to the progress that can be made in the field of comitology, this will fall under a future revision of Article 202."
"This is why we fully reject the two amendments tabled by the Liberal and PPE-DE groups and support Amendment No 5, adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which further strengthens the guarantees concerning that profession."
"To conclude, I wish to say that, in light of the extremely serious shortcomings revealed by current developments, we are simply trying to take the first step, particularly where insider dealing is concerned."
"What is at stake is the entire production and consumption of the financial setup."
"Consequently, with regard to the harmonisation of accounting procedures, government reform of businesses, the organisation and the supervision of audits, of financial analysis and credit rating, we call on the European Union and the Commission in particular to rapidly draw up new regulatory and legislative initiatives."
"Mr President, the concept of trust is a key one to any discussion about the economy."
"Our whole economic system is based on trust."
"And as long as trust is not betrayed, the economic system functions as we expect it to."
"Expectations of the financial markets are closely linked to the way in which legislative institutions, such as the Council, the Commission and Parliament, deal with unexpected circumstances."
"The financial markets expect to have regulations, but these should be unambiguous regulations, which are not open to many different interpretations."
"The concept of interpretation, in particular, plays an important role in the debate about prior knowledge."
"After all, what is prior knowledge and when do we talk about prior knowledge which has an actual effect?"
"Article 1 of the directive mentions having 'a considerable influence on the prices of financial instruments' - a concept which ought to be explained, however, on the basis of the effect of the directive in practice."
"It is not possible to draw up one unambiguous rule which would apply to all situations."
"Events which have taken place in practice within Member States have led to regulations being drawn up in order to prevent or sanction fraud and insider dealing."
"This practice shows that in many cases an assessment of the facts is required based on a given situation."
"In my opinion, journalists are very much in a position to determine from specific cases in practice whether prior knowledge applies."
"After all, in their day-to-day work they have to judge whether something is 'news' or prior knowledge."
"The reason for which information is gathered or disseminated forms the basis for the assessment of whether prior knowledge applies or not."
"It is for these reasons that I will not support Amendments Nos 6 and 7."
"It is unsatisfactory to declare that technical modality does not apply to journalists in the exercise of their profession."
"Considering that an assessment takes place on the basis of facts and situations, reference should be made to existing rules and self-regulation within this professional group."
"It is also the case that an appeal to this professional group constitutes a question of trust."
"Although I believe that a number of matters should be regulated at Member State level, the arguments for harmonising the rules at European level are convincing."
"National legislation falls short within the international context of the financial markets."
"I support, therefore, the recommendation for a second reading by Mr Goebbels."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Goebbels, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done an excellent job on this directive."
"I do feel, however, that there are a number of things we need to bear in mind."
"We are all quite familiar with the Enron question and other financial scandals, but the important thing is not to be under the illusion that a new law, a new regulation, a new authority will resolve the problem of market abuse and insider dealing."
"It may be that the situation is gradually improving, but we must be under no illusion - I reiterate - as to whether the new law, the new directive, the new authority will resolve once and for all the issue of transparency and the need to prevent abuse in the financial markets."
"Then we have a number of particularly serious concerns where the regulation affects the mechanisms through which information reaches the market - principally the work of the media."
"Here too, in the past, the most effective tool for preventing the exploitation and manipulation of confidential and other information has proved to be the market, which confirms the reliability and validity of methods of producing and disseminating information."
"I agree with what Mr Huhne said and with the amendment tabled by Mr Huhne and Mrs Villiers, and I believe that we must avoid introducing specific, rigid legislation, which would, inevitably, ultimately lead to some sort of regulation of the freedom of the press and the freedom to exercise the profession of journalism."
"We must therefore reject the illusion that we can use the law to regulate and guarantee the veracity of the information provided by economics and financial journalists."
"Moreover, we would be running the risk of it having little or no effect because, if a person wants to put the information in their possession to an inappropriate use, they will find a way to do so whatever we do, whatever the law governing the matter."
"Mr President, it is vital to have tough rules to prevent insider dealing and to punish those who abuse the market, including journalists and market practitioners."
"It is vital to protect consumer investors from the misconduct of market insiders."
"I would like to put on record my thanks to the Council, the Commission and the rapporteur for taking on board a number of issues in relation to accepted market practices, commodity derivatives and Chinese walls at first reading."
"But this draft directive leaves a number of very significant problems."
"It is of very serious concern, as we have heard, to a whole range of journalists and media organisations across the European Union - media organisations that live or die by their reputation for integrity and a high standard of public conduct."
"I agree that journalists should be subject to market abuse rules."
"I agree that journalists should be subject to rules that prevent conflicts of interest."
"I agree that we should have tough enforcement mechanisms to enforce those rules."
"However, I do not agree with the rapporteur that the Committee of European Securities Regulators is the appropriate body to do this."
"In the case of journalists, the rules should be enforced by specialist media regulators, who know how the media works and understand the issues that relate to journalists."
"CESR does not have the expertise to regulate journalists."
"It has already demonstrated that it does not understand how the media works."
"The proposals in its consultation paper would have been impractical and unworkable."
"Special constitutional issues apply to journalists because of the demands and importance of that vital constitutional issue, freedom of speech."
"It is vital that we respect those constitutional issues."
"It is at least arguable that, in some countries, giving CESR this role would be unconstitutional and contrary to the principle of freedom of speech."
"The free flow of information to the markets is absolutely vital in preventing market abuse and protecting consumer investors."
"If we disrupt that free flow of information to the market, we will be playing into the hands of market abusers."
"That would be the consequence of allowing CESR to regulate journalists when it does not understand the media issues."
"Throughout the first reading, MEPs believed that Article 6(5) was not targeted at journalists."
"Despite this understanding, CESR has indicated it will regulate journalists."
"This is a test case."
"This is the first time we have used the Lamfalussy process."
"We need to use our codecision power to send a clear message to CESR that we will stand up for the prerogatives and powers of the only elected EU institution and support Amendment 7."
"Mr President, there are still too many obstacles in the way of smooth provision of financial services across national boundaries."
"The draft directive on market abuse that we are discussing today is one step in the right direction."
"Investor confidence is crucial for the successful development of our financial services markets."
"The integrity of European markets has to be safeguarded."
"Common and efficient standards to combat market abuse have to be established and thoroughly implemented."
"Clearly, actions that intentionally manipulate financial markets, including those by financial journalists, have to be penalised."
"Like some other colleagues, however, I am worried about some proposals whose basic intention might be good and respectable but whose effects would be devastating."
"I believe that there must be tough rules in place to prevent conflicts of interest among financial journalists. But these need to be rules that are sensitive to the media context."
"Free speech is one of the cornerstones of democracy."
"In many countries, for example in my country and in Scandinavia, it would be simply unconstitutional to subject journalists to the sort of heavy-handed regulation that the CESR put forward in July."
"Under the draft guidelines, a report by a journalist that merely records accurately a recommendation made by an investment analyst - for example, Merrill Lynch has upgraded its rating on Nokia - would require a public disclosure of personal interest on the part of the journalist."
"This would be impractical, unnecessary and disproportionate."
"The European Parliament did not address the issues raised by Article 6(5) at first reading because it was widely believed that the Article was targeted at financial analysts employed by investment firms where well-publicised abuses have occurred."
"The publication by the CESR of its draft guidelines in July revealed that it has another plan."
"The aim is to cover an extensive range of routine financial journalism where standards have remained high and existing governance mechanisms have proved adequate."
"As explained above, the recent amendment to Article 6(10) by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is insufficient, as the CESR would still be able to override or amend these mechanisms."
"The feedback we have had from the European financial journalism community is clear."
"The proposals would have an adverse impact on media freedom and on journalistic independence."
"Financial journalism contributes to one of the key objectives of the directive, that is to ensure market transparency."
"This is especially important for small retail investors."
"They are the investors in the European Parliament should be trying to protect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking those Members, from all the groups, but especially those belonging to my own, who worked on this report in our committee, and who demonstrated commitment, expertise and passion - which have also been apparent in this debate - in tackling this important topic."
"This is an important and necessary directive, it is one that we want; we want an agreement with the Council, and we want the directive to enter into force at the beginning of 2003."
"This directive is the first under the new comitology procedure."
"I see it as being founded on seven points."
"The first is that the insider-trading directive, which has provided the framework, is thirteen years old."
"A lot has happened in the meantime."
"It is based on the results of the Lisbon Council and on the conclusions of the Stockholm Summit."
"It forms part of the action plan on financial services."
"It is a response to 11 September, because the directive is what the Member States want in order to be better able to take counter-terrorist action."
"It is a response to Enron, Microsoft, and the EM.TV trial; today's information society makes it easier to engage in insider trading by exploiting the many sources of information available."
"We have to build up confidence in the financial services sector, in the financial markets and in the economy."
"This directive helps to do that by safeguarding the integrity of the European financial markets, establishing rules for combating market abuse in Europe, and strengthening investors' confidence in the European financial market."
"I would like to say, though, that we have not made it easier for ourselves, as this debate itself shows."
"Between the Goebbels Report as it was at first reading, and what we have before us today, there are two more extreme standpoints."
"Let me point out, though, that this is not a directive on journalists, but one on insider dealing and market manipulation."
"This directive is not to exclude anyone, but it does have to deal with the differences in quality."
"We should not expect this House to come to a decision that promotes censorship and infringes fundamental rights and freedoms."
"That is the basis of our political work."
"Because we want to get both sides together, combining the arguments of Mr Huhne, Mrs Villiers, Mrs Kauppi and those of the parties affected, the committee came up with a compromise motion, and I believe that it, and perceptiveness, have enabled us to find a very good and broad compromise on the basis of the special role of journalists and of the possibility of self-regulation."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, many of those involved in this business used to wonder whether regulation is needed - they still do."
"It is my belief that the answer to this question should be an unambiguous 'yes', even though many of the actors take the opposite view."
"I am, in principle, opposed to the proliferation of rules."
"I hope that the future will see politicians, policies, and even the Commission, judged on the basis of what rules and directives they have abolished or unified, rather than the opposite."
"This situation, though, is rather different."
"This is about honesty, about trust; this has to do with the prevention of theft, insecurity and, in the final analysis, fraud."
"I am glad that there is to be an increase in controls and, it is to be hoped, that there will be more sanctions in future."
"If I may turn to the subject of journalists and media freedom, I cannot but agree with what Mr Karas has said about the principle that we stand up for freedom of opinion and oppose any sort of censorship."
"I do, however, see it as inadequate to take the view, as some in this House do, that the good name of certain media and media organisations that have been referred to guarantees that abuses will be prevented."
"I was myself in that line of business and am, alas, all too well aware that publishers and journalists are human, but that there is a very, very narrow dividing line between honesty and respectability on the one hand and debatable conduct on the other."
"It is for this reason that I believe a good reputation does not at present offer a sufficient guarantee, and that there is a need for regulation."
"Arthur Andersen also had a good reputation until that business was struck by disaster."
"I am in favour of these interests being disclosed."
"I believe that we owe a duty to the public to address problems and find approaches towards a solution even in sensitive areas."
"It will be for the future to show whether we have been able to do that properly in the first stage, with all the nuances involved."
"We will then have to make any adjustments that turn out to be necessary."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I have asked to speak again on this subject because of certain remarks made by Mrs Villiers, Mrs Kauppi and Mr Huhne."
"Both Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi said that freedom of speech is under attack."
"With all due respect to those Members of Parliament who have spoken and whom I have just mentioned, that is a caricature of the aims of this directive."
"Financial journalists are free to write whatever they wish."
"There is not the slightest doubt that they can write as they please."
"The only thing the directive says is that, when they recommend to the public certain stocks in which they themselves have invested, they must state that fact."
"In other words, if financial journalists advise the public to buy shares in a certain company and if they themselves own shares in that company, they must declare how many shares they own."
"I do not understand why that should be an attack on the freedom of the press or, as Mr Huhne said, regulation of the press or of the media by the back door."
"Why should the rule of transparency apply to all and sundry who engage in dealings on the stock market but not to financial journalists?"
"After all, we are simply asking them to be transparent about their investment in stocks they are recommending the public buy."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A5-0324/2002) by Mr Ward Beysen, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council decision (COM(2001) 775 - C5-0111/2002 - 2001/0311(COD)) on amending Decision No 1254/96/EC laying down a series of guidelines for trans-European energy networks."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the particular importance of this report is clearly apparent right from the Commissioner's introductory explanatory comments."
"As a result of congestion and insufficient joint activity, certain Member States can now only profit to a limited extent from the advantages of the open markets, meaning that competitive advantages for consumers are becoming increasingly smaller."
"The European Commission is therefore right to propose a reform of the guidelines for Trans-European Networks in the energy sector."
"The revised proposal takes account of the liberalisation of the energy markets, the increasing external dependence on energy and the stricter requirements to get sustainable sources of energy accepted."
"These are the objectives which have been emphasised by the political leaders on the European Councils of Stockholm and Barcelona."
"Concentration on a new list of priority projects forms the core of this proposal."
"Member States will give special support and attention to these projects."
"The maximum percentage for co-financing will be increased from 10% to 20% and from now on the construction phase will take precedence."
"The question which immediately comes to mind is whether this is the best solution."
"In my opinion, a massive subsidy for the energy sector is not a good solution because I feel that it is at variance with the current trend towards liberalisation and the creation of a competitive internal market."
"It must be emphasised that the main responsibility lies with the energy sector and with the industry itself."
"Measures which are taken on the basis of this decision may in no way be allowed to cause disruption of competitive practices within the internal energy market."
"I also feel that Community aid should only relate to the design phase."
"Subsidies for the construction phase such as proposed by the Commission should then only be granted in exceptional cases."
"In this context, the integration of renewable energy sources constitutes an important factor."
"In my opinion, these will contribute in future to the diversification of energy sources and thus as such to the continuity of energy provision within the European Union."
"Support of tangible projects such as off-shore wind parks should therefore be encouraged."
"The way in which the Commission wants to implement all this does give rise to a number of questions."
"I think it is not a good idea to give the European Parliament a droit de regard only when the issues concern strategically important changes to project specifications."
"It is important to seek a balance between, on the one hand, a quick reaction by the Commission to new developments and, on the other hand, the need for effective control by Parliament."
"To satisfy the need for transparency, the Commission needs to submit regular reports."
"Finally I would like to emphasise that actual measures will be necessary if we want to reap the rewards of the internal market."
"In fact, the new guidelines might significantly contribute towards coping with the problems of: the continuity of energy provision, the integration of renewable energy, the outermost regions as well as enlargement."
"I would like to clearly point out that Community aid must be applied pragmatically and that, in the first instance, accountability must be given to the energy sector itself."
"Mr President, my sincere thanks go to my colleague, Mr Beysen, for the work he has done."
"He took the views of the shadow rapporteurs into consideration back in the formulation stage in an exemplary manner and the levels of cooperation we have seen have been fruitful."
"We must take account of the fact that in rather more than a year's time there will be 10 new Member States in the European Union."
"Their concerns are also our concerns."
"The candidate countries must be included in programmes like the TEN-Energy programme as swiftly as possible."
"All candidate countries have huge problems with regard to their electricity transmission networks."
"In the Baltic countries there are no such networks as such."
"If and when Ignalina is closed, and whatever decisions are made concerning bituminous shale, the Baltic countries' energy strategies cannot rely exclusively on Russia."
"What sort of timetable does the Commission have for including the new Member States in the trans-European networks?"
"I have given emphasis to the question of whether the EU should support the private sector."
"The basic philosophy here is that the energy sector must be one in which the market economy works unaided."
"Only in exceptional cases can public sector aid be granted to the private sector."
"The Commission's contribution, which in the end is the European taxpayer's money, must not be raised from 10% to 20%."
"Previously, aid was available only for studies in the planning stage."
"If the Commission's new proposal is accepted, aid would also be granted for project development."
"There is always the risk that project coordinators will increase their costs just to obtain as much aid from the Commission as possible."
"It is good that the Commission will provide support for building trans-European networks."
"This programme and this amount of money, however, will have only a limited effect, and will not solve the problems of Europe's energy infrastructure."
"The solution to the problem of bottlenecks is to be found in the Member States rather than in this EU programme."
"There have been a lot of problems when constructing power lines as a result of the way in which decisions have been made at local and regional level."
"Residents complain about electromagnetic radiation, the impact on the environment, blighted landscapes, and so on."
"It is for this reason that no solution has been found for the largest bottleneck in the European electricity networks, which is on the border between Spain and France."
"Matters relating to technology must not be linked to this programme."
"We are now deciding on trans-European networks, without adopting a position on what technology is to be used in producing the energy transmitted through the network and what its source is."
"The supplementary role renewable energy sources play in basic production is a part of the European energy palette."
"In certain circumstances they serve as excellent local solutions."
"This report is about infrastructure, not energy production."
"The network and production must be kept separate."
"As a separate issue I want to mention Amendment No 9."
"If this is meant to suggest that renewable energy sources will result in lower charges for the consumer, that is not true."
"All the research shows that nuclear power is the cheapest option for the consumer of all forms of energy."
"The Commission is proposing an electricity interconnection capacity of at least 10% as a European minimum level."
"The level of interconnection is already 20% in some countries, however."
"The Commission should set its targets higher and insist on a level of 20% for all Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by making a point of thanking Mr Beysen."
"It is unlike me to start a speech by congratulating the rapporteur, because I think that is what we are here for and we generally make a good job of it."
"I think, however, that Mr Beysen deserves special praise for his hard work in contacting the other groups right from the start, in order to ensure the report was as unanimous as possible before it was tabled in plenary."
"And he has succeeded admirably. So thank you for involving us from the outset."
"As a result, my group feels there is no need to table any amendments because, in my opinion, what Mr Beysen has done is fine as it is."
"I would therefore like to just comment briefly on three political points that are important to me."
"First, as the Commissioner made clear, this decision comes under the general heading of the liberalisation of the energy market; in other words, it contributes to what is already on the Council's agenda."
"And when it comes to the overall package to open up the energy market, let there be no mistake, we have handed our homework in on time."
"We adopted our first reading here in plenary on 13 March, after the Council urged us to get a move on."
"The Commission did likewise; it too has done its homework, unlike the Council."
"The Council is doing what it always does, what it does best - nothing at all."
"It sits and talks and fails to come to any decision."
"That amounts to institutionalised indecisiveness, and that is why we need to say at this juncture: this is an overall package and we want results so that we can move forward."
"Secondly, I really do think the Commission was right in this context to suggest - and our resolution should reflect this - that strategically important projects in the trans-European energy network sector should be given top priority."
"By which we mean projects which are vital for security of supply, strategically important projects which are important in opening up the market, especially those relating to one part of this package I referred to, namely the regulation on which Mr Mombaur acted as rapporteur."
"It is a pity he is not here today; I think he too would have had a few comments to make here."
"Thirdly, unlike traffic networks, the industry and companies involved in the energy networks generally make real money."
"They make money!"
"And that means that it is primarily up to the industry to finance these projects."
"It is our job as legislator to support this by putting framework conditions in place, which brings me back to the fact that the Council needs to wrap things up."
"So that is how we want to go about this, by cofinancing support but with the companies in the front row when it comes to putting money in the kitty."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too first want to thank Mr Beysen for his excellent report."
"He has raised some important points, and our group supports his approach."
"The Commission is proposing that financial support for the trans-European networks must be stepped up."
"This is to be supported in order to foster the internal market in electricity and gas."
"As has been said here, it is also important to connect the new Member States to the internal market in energy."
"This point of view is also contained in the report adopted by Parliament on cross-border exchanges in electricity."
"It has also already been said here that the main responsibility for constructing and maintaining adequate energy networks lies with EU industry and business."
"In this sense the energy networks differ from the trans-European networks, which receive large amounts of public money."
"Network operators, however, have no interest in removing bottlenecks in the supply to their neighbours."
"For that reason, state intervention and EU aid to promote competition is well justified."
"Naturally we also have to see that aid does not distort competition and that it is used for the right purpose."
"Concentrating EU aid on priority projects will encourage the removal of bottlenecks and boost competition, giving consumers greater choice."
"In this way Europe's own energy resources will be put to more effective use and the European economy will be given a boost."
"In developing the trans-European energy networks, account must also be taken of social and economic rapprochement."
"We also have to ensure networks are developed in island, peripheral and remote regions."
"If necessary we must provide support for connecting the networks in these regions to other networks."
"Following on from Union decisions, we also have to encourage the diversification of forms of energy and increase the use of renewable energy sources."
"We have to ensure that decentralised renewable energy can access the network at a reasonable cost."
"The recent massive storm damage was a reminder that we must insist on companies and industry being sufficiently prepared to repair damage speedily and restore networks in all regions of the Union."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wish to begin my speech on Trans-European Networks in the energy sector by reminding you once again and quite forcefully, that energy is not a product like any other and that the market cannot be the main force regulating it."
"Security of supply is a prerequisite for the political independence of our countries and of Europe."
"This security requires a diversification of energy sources and will involve major long term, not to say extremely long-term investment."
"Energy is, furthermore, an important factor in land-use planning and falls entirely within the field of public services in the truest sense of the word."
"I would add that we must always bear in mind that when we talk about energy and about transport networks that, whereas new infrastructures must be created, existing infrastructures must also be reorganised in order to make better use of them."
"Lastly, there must be - and I wish to express this forcefully - an obsession with the environment in all its dimensions: the visual dimension, pollution, and the despoliation of resources, not forgetting the issue of waste."
"Incidentally, with regard to the report by Mr Beysen, whom I congratulate on his work, I can state my broad agreement with the proposals that have been made."
"We must in fact improve and extend the energy transport networks and, by means of studies and investment, support the implementation of the least profitable ones where they are needed."
"The internal market in energy is necessary but what it needs more than deregulation is investment throughout the Union, especially in the least accessible and least densely populated regions."
"No one would deny that the interlinking of networks is necessary."
"Let us not forget, however, that we need energy to put into these networks and a number of conditions must be met if we are to achieve that."
"Lastly, I wish to confirm the importance to us of renewable energies, of research in this field and of the public investment needed for its development."
"I must also admit that I do not fully understand the connection that some people wish to make between this aim of developing renewable energies and a liberal approach that often leads to a quest for the lowest cost in the short term, without worrying about the consequences in the medium and long term."
"To conclude, whilst remaining critical of the liberal principles that I believe are dangerous for Europe's energy independence and for small consumers, not forgetting the least-favoured regions, I believe that the Commission guidelines on the Trans-European Networks are a step in the right direction and, as they stand, I thank you for them, Commissioner."
"Mr President, the European Commission claims that spending more public funds on building additional electricity lines in Europe will enhance competition."
"There is no academic evidence for this."
"What do we have to do if we want to reduce oligopolistic tendencies in the European market?"
"Firstly, we must reduce market dominance."
"We need to bring in measures such as divestiture in those countries where there are dominant operators."
"Secondly, we must increase centralised electricity production, because that is the only way to make the sector more competitive in the near future."
"Independent research shows that there is no economic rationale for spending billions on a new electricity grid."
"I have with me some summaries of these studies and I will hand them over to the Commissioner."
"So what should we do with the public funds available to us?"
"We should spend them on gas pipelines, because that will bring more competition and security of supply."
"We should spend money on offshore projects in the North Sea and the Baltic."
"Historically, this market and the grid which exists in Europe were set up to promote centralised fossil fuel and nuclear power plants."
"If we want fair competition, we have to use some public money to provide a level playing field for offshore projects."
"We have enormous potential for this."
"This should not be a Christmas gift shop."
"If you look at the annexes to the report, this is a Christmas gift shop with all the electricity lines any operator ever wanted to build in Europe."
"This is not a good use of European public funds."
"Mr President, I have taken the floor to inform the Members who will listen to me of the significance of an amendment I have tabled, Amendment No 22 to be precise."
"It raises a number of issues which relate to the region I represent, Sardinia, but which also concern all the islands in the Community and, therefore, around 15 million citizens dispersed throughout all the seas of Europe."
"The general framework governing the trans-European networks described in this proposal includes, of course, the desire and the intention to help the underdeveloped regions."
"The amendment I have tabled equates the situation of the islands to that of the less-developed regions, for energy is one of the sectors in which islands are at a greater disadvantage: there is not one island on our continent that does not have an energy problem in terms of cost, quantity, capacity for progress and economic development."
"Some practical measures have been taken, for an important project has been included in the list of projects of common interest which concerns two islands in the Community - Sardinia and Corsica - specifically, the gas pipeline which will convey a considerable amount of methane gas from Algeria to Italy, France and southern Germany."
"It has been included among the projects of common interest but not yet among the priority projects."
"I therefore hope that, if the European Parliament adopts my amendment, a further boost will be given to this project whose implementation is awaited by a significant part of Europe, and, if possible, to other projects, which will then be practically implemented."
"Mr President, Mr Beysen has tabled an excellent, forward-looking report which takes account of important basic documents such as the White Paper on renewable sources of energy, the directive on the internal market in electricity and the directive promoting electricity from renewable sources of energy."
"We particularly welcome the proposed amendments calling for fair network access for electricity companies using renewable energy sources."
"Of course, in the long term, we also expect the Commission to internalise external costs, which need to be broken down in the case of fossil and atomic energy production."
"At present, we are probably all taking far too little account of future problems with security of supply and underestimating the expected cost increases in the primary energy sector in general."
"In this sense, we welcome the proposed amendments tabled by Claude Turmes, while Mr Beysen is to be congratulated on having pushed so forcefully for the inclusion of wind energy."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this report."
"It is about a logistics system in the European Union that we are trying to build."
"It appears that electricity consumption will continue to grow over the next 20 years but that the rate of growth will fall off or slow down."
"At the same time the production of electricity and other forms of energy will go down in relation to consumption."
"We in the Nordic countries have opened up our electricity markets."
"For example, in my own country, Finland, households have been able to choose their electricity supplier for many years now."
"This practice has worked well in the Nordic countries, and even Norway, a country outside the European Union, participates."
"The importance of renewable sources is increasing in our logistics system and limiting carbon dioxide emissions has also become a key issue."
"Natural gas is also growing in importance."
"We must be on our guard against the emergence of monopolies and reliance on just one supplier, which would cause huge problems."
"Let us just recall how things went for Enron or how things are still going for a certain large company in Great Britain."
"Where are the largest and nearest energy resources from the Union's point of view?"
"They are in Russia."
"Now while the relevant Commissioner is listening attentively over there I would propose that, at the next summit between the European Union and Russia, an attempt at some sort of concrete agreement is made on energy, both gas and electrical energy, because we are very interested in both and we will be dependent on Russia for gas within 20 years or so."
"Mr President, who could be against the construction and maintenance of infrastructures in the energy sector and the integration of energy networks of the countries that are soon to join the European Union?"
"No one would be, of course, if it were truly a matter of meeting the needs of the people."
"The real issue, however - as the report makes quite clear - is to make the construction and the maintenance of infrastructures in the field of energy subject to the laws of the market."
"In order to establish a more open and competitive internal market for energy, public funds supplementing private funds will rise from 10% to 20% of total investment."
"Members from the Lutte ouvrière are opposed to the use of public monies to increase private profits."
"Besides which, the aim of increasing interconnection between gas and electricity networks is not to rationalise energy distribution at EU scale, but instead to open up the entire gas and electricity market to competition."
"What this means, where France, for example, is concerned, is another step closer to the privatisation of Électricité and Gaz de France, a process that we reject entirely."
"We reject it, as do the tens of thousands of workers who demonstrated on 3 October in Paris for Électricité and Gaz de France to remain public services."
"We also oppose any attack on salaries or on the pensions of workers in this sector."
"The various States or the European Community itself must be able to fund an energy transport network which is fit for the twenty-first century, whose management criteria are not profitability or the quest for profit for a few but which are to meet the energy needs of everyone and equal access for everyone."
"We do not think, however, think that by allowing themselves to be guided by private interests, the current European institutions will achieve this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in accordance with Rule 120, paragraph 5, the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs de Palacio, now has the final word."
"The next item is the vote."
"Draft general budget of the European Union - 2003 financial year"
"Draft amendments and proposed modifications to appropriations in Section III of the 2003 draft general budget concerning the Commission"
"Draft amendments to Sections I, II, IV, V, VI, VII and VIII of the 2003 draft general budget concerning the European Parliament, the Council, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Ombudsman, and the European Data-Protection Supervisor"
"Mr President, before we begin the vote on the budget and the budgetary amendments, there are some statements I would like to make, some corrections and oral amendments that I would like put to the vote."
"Firstly, I would like to inform colleagues in the Chamber that we have a very tight margin in category 3, for internal policies."
"It is only EUR 2.6 million."
"If, as a result of the vote, we pass the ceiling, I would feel obliged to propose offsets and further reductions on other budget lines."
"That is just a little warning."
"Then there are some technical corrections."
"First of all, amendment 662 on budget line B53004 (new) should not be subject to a separate vote because nobody has requested that."
"It has been listed as a separate vote by mistake."
"It should instead be voted on as part of block 4."
"I will check this with all the political groups but, as I understand it, there is no problem."
"We also have a technical adjustment in heading 5."
"The amendments proposed reflect the announcement by Eurostat on 15 October."
"We have new parameters for salaries in 2003."
"The 2.6% increase has now been reduced to 2%."
"The resulting adjustments to match the front loading in 2002 need to be made."
"I will quickly read the figures for the record."
"In Amendment 525, the final amount should be EUR 1 450 901 000 and nothing else."
"In Amendment 556,the final amount is EUR 68 890 436."
"In Amendment 650 on budget line A360, the final amount should read EUR 38 219 720."
"Then we have two new amendments, because we had no amendments on pensions."
"These are on budget line A1900, where the final amount should read EUR 412 887 000, and on budget line A6000, where the final amount should read EUR 124 456 000."
"In Amendment 562 on budget line A7000, the final amount should read EUR 54 916 000."
"Finally, in Amendment 527 on budget line A200, the final amount should be EUR 147 529 904."
"We also have some technical corrections on agencies."
"There is a separate remark for the agency enlargement costs."
"They have now been slightly amended and should read as follows: for Amendment 583 on budget line B3-4201, the correct amount is EUR 7 150 000."
"For Amendment 589, budget line B5-3111, the correct amount is EUR 300 000."
"For Amendment 596, budget line B5-8301, the final amount is EUR 3 522 711."
"Finally, we do not need a figure for Amendment 593, because it has been withdrawn."
"There is no enlargement cost in that case."
"There is one item which has to be voted on and that is budget line A-3014, one of the A-30 lines about European masters' courses in human rights and democratisation."
"The reference here to the University of Padua is not correct. It should be replaced by the European Inter-University Centre."
"That is actually a new amendment to the draft budget and should be voted on at the beginning."
"I would also like to tell the House that, in order to be consistent with the resolution, I will ask the sessional services to replace the second part of the first paragraph of the grounds for Amendment 644 on Afghanistan by paragraph 26 in the resolution, so that there is no difference between the wording of the resolution and the amendment. I do not think that requires a vote, but I just wanted to point it out to the House."
"Finally, a politically more important point, because it concerns North Korea and the discussions we have had on KEDO and nuclear issues."
"Following the recent information on the declaration by the North Korean Government on the possible production of nuclear weapons, the Committee on Budgets, at its meeting this Monday, authorised me to table an oral amendment in plenary."
"This proposes that the EU's total contribution to KEDO, which is EUR 20 million, be entered in the reserve, on the grounds that the North Korean Government has admitted it is working on the research and production of nuclear weapons."
"This is clearly at odds with the general objectives of EU participation in the Euratom-Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation KEDO, which are 'to contribute to reinforcing and maintaining the international nuclear non-proliferation regime and to help achieve appropriate cooperation with both North Korea and South Korea to ensure the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy'."
"The appropriations will be released from this reserve on the condition that, firstly, North Korea proves itself willing to respect the international non-proliferation regime and, secondly, that North Korea proves it has discontinued its nuclear weapons production programme."
"This is also a new amendment to the draft budget and must, preferably, be voted on at the beginning."
"Finally, when we come to category 4, I shall comment on two specific aspects of that category, but that is all I wish to say at this point."
"Mr President, before proceeding with the vote let me draw Members' attention to the following oral amendments to heading 5."
"Firstly, as the Council is now making a contribution to the frontloading operation, and given that Parliament will contribute almost EUR 43 million instead of EUR 40 million, which is what the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets decided on Monday evening, I propose that an amount of EUR 35 million should be taken back in 2003."
"Thus Parliament's net contribution will amount to EUR 8 million."
"Secondly, following Eurostat's new figure on salary adjustments, which is now reduced from 2.6% to 2%, the amounts entered in the different sections on staff expenditure also need to be adjusted accordingly."
"I therefore suggest the following adjustments to the following amendments to reflect these changes."
"Amendment 493, section - Parliament: a reduction of EUR 1.9 million on item 1100."
"Amendment 715, section - Parliament: a reduction of EUR 3.1 million on item 209."
"Amendment 514, concerning the Court of Justice: a reduction of EUR 500 000 on item 1100."
"Amendment 516, concerning the Court of Auditors: a reduction of EUR 36 000 on item 1100."
"Amendment 520, on the Economic and Social Committee: a reduction of EUR 236 000 on item 1100."
"Amendment 522, on the Committee of the Regions: a reduction of EUR 102 000 on item 1100."
"Finally, Amendment 523, concerning the Ombudsman: a reduction of EUR 11 000."
"I will have to make further remarks on the resolution."
"Mr President, I would just like to say that we are now going into category 4 - External Actions - and here we have a special situation because we have created a so-called 'asterisk' amendment."
"We are above the ceiling of EUR 72 million."
"This 'asterisk' amendment means that if we make any more increases after this block 5, credits for Afghanistan will be reduced."
"I just wanted to warn everybody about this."
"Of course, this is a first reading position, but still I wanted to inform you of the situation."
"Mr President, this should, I hope, be the last time I speak in this vote."
"Last Monday, we discussed East Timor in the Committee on Budgets, and I just want to explain what we are doing here."
"To maintain a separate budget line for East Timor - which is very politically important for the Timorese Government and for many others - a split vote has been requested on Amendment 674."
"In order to clarify the vote, I should like to explain that the split vote means that the first part will include the amounts."
"If we vote in favour of the first part, we vote in favour of the increased amount, which is EUR 25.5 million."
"As far as I know, that is acceptable to everybody."
"The second part of the vote concerns the nomenclature."
"If you want a separate line for East Timor - which is the rapporteur's recommendation, authorised by the Committee on Budgets - you should reject the second part of the amendment by the Committee on Budgets."
"Mr President, I hope this will be the only thing I have to say concerning the resolution."
"The first-reading resolution needs to be adjusted to reflect the vote."
"Therefore, paragraph 8 needs to be amended as follows. The word 'intention' should be replaced by 'decision'."
"The figure of 40 million in the first line should be replaced by '42 690 000' and the figure of 40 million in line 8 should be replaced by '35 million'."
"Secondly, a minor change is also needed in paragraph 19 in the verb tenses."
"In line 3, the words 'should be' should be replaced by 'are'."
"In line 4, the words 'should be' should be replaced by 'is'."
"In line 5, the words 'should conduct' should be replaced by 'conducts'."
"Thank you for those clarifications."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing the regret of Mrs Schreyer, my colleague, who cannot be here."
"She has to be in Brussels this morning for discussions with the President, obviously on issues concerning the financing of enlargement and - equally obviously - before the Brussels European Council takes place."
"Very briefly, on behalf of the Commission, I note with thanks Parliament's adoption of its negotiating position at this first reading on the 2003 draft budget."
"The rapporteurs, Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck, have supported a position that gives a reasonable prospect for a constructive and prudent 2003 budget at second reading."
"The Commission will respond rapidly and fully to Parliament's various requests and queries in order to encourage early resolution of the outstanding points before second reading."
"We still have to finalise preparations for enlargement, but we are grateful to Parliament for its offers for 2002."
"That will obviously ease the problems in 2003."
"I shall make three other very brief points."
"Firstly, we must, and will, pursue the administrative reforms vigorously."
"A comprehensive progress report on reforms will be produced in January for Parliament to inspect."
"Secondly, we shall update the Union's agricultural budget and fisheries agreement needs for 2003."
"The Amending Letter will be put before the House next week."
"Thirdly, the Commission notes Parliament's concern that neither of our institutions is sufficiently involved in preparations for possible Common Foreign and Security Policy joint actions or in estimating the funding required for such actions."
"Clearly, the budget for external actions has yet to find a reasonable overall balance."
"The Commission will, consequently, propose realistic solutions in the coming weeks to help the budgetary authority reach satisfactory conclusions."
"Mr President, I propose adding the words 'Pakistan and Russia' to the word 'Israel'."
"Mr President, this is just a clarification, for the amendment should be in your voting list anyway."
"I would just like to say that, at the very beginning of Amendment No 5, my group proposes that the word 'condemns' should be replaced with the word 'regrets'."
"The European Parliament has passed the EU budget, voting down an EDD amendment calling for the reimbursement of MEPs' expenses at actual cost."
"Amendments to this effect have been put down at successive budgets as long as I have been a member here, and have been rejected on every occasion."
"At a time when the EU is celebrating enlargement, it is critical that the European Parliament demonstrate a commitment to financial probity and open accounting. Once again, it has failed to do so."
"In the vote on the budget, we have in general voted against the committee's proposals to increase the agricultural expenditure in category 1."
"That is because we think that the EU's money can better be used in other areas where it is really needed."
"It is unreasonable for approximately half of the EU's total budget to be spent each year on subsidising the production and export of agricultural products."
"As it stands, the common agricultural policy is not only expensive for the EU but also contributes to higher consumer prices."
"The export subsidies mean that the EU's food surpluses are dumped on the world market at low prices so that the food industry is placed at serious competitive disadvantages in many developing countries, for example."
"The fact that the EU also subsidises tobacco cultivation is particularly worth noting."
"The EU's activities and budget should instead be directed at cross-border problems that the Member States cannot solve themselves."
"The EU's agricultural policy in the form of export and production subsidies should therefore be phased out and replaced in part by subsidies promoting biological diversity and environmental measures."
"We welcome the fact that the appropriation for combating HIV/AIDS is up by approximately EUR 200 million, or 60%, on the Council's proposal."
"This shows that Parliament really does want to comply with the commitments we made when the Global Health Fund was set up."
"In general, we Swedish Christian Democrats share Parliament's negotiating position on the issue of the budget."
"There are nonetheless a number of points of widely differing character that we should particularly like to comment on."
"We believe that, before we can approve the whole of the proposed amount, it is important for the Commission to be able to clarify how the aid for Israel and Palestine is to be used."
"By approving, therefore, only half of the appropriation in the present situation, we are exerting pressure in the right direction."
"It is encouraging that a start is being made on phasing out the subsidies for the transport of live animals, even though we should have preferred to have seen them removed completely."
"We are sorry, however, that the aid for East Timor is being reduced, since the country is still in a phase of consolidation in the immediate aftermath of its declaration of independence."
"We believe it is wrong to provide subsidies, to the tune of EUR 7 million, to European parties until such time as there is a legal basis for doing so, and we regret that the proposal to remove the appropriation was voted down by 393 votes to 76."
"We were also in favour of a feasibility study for a civil peace corps, something which was, however, rejected."
"I voted against budget lines B7-6312, Arndt 605 and Arndt 361."
"This funding for population and reproductive health care will be accessed to provide abortion in developing countries, according to the upcoming Sandbæk report."
"The European Union has no legal right to provide or promote abortion and it is unacceptable to use public funding for this purpose within the Member States, candidate countries or developing countries where it is unacceptable to communities."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have today voted against the amendments aimed at increasing the subsidies for agriculture."
"We believe that the agricultural subsidies must be reduced."
"A first step in the task of reforming agriculture would be to transfer resources to rural development."
"On a slightly longer term view, it is not however enough merely to redistribute resources within the agricultural sector. Instead, the agricultural subsidies must also be considerably reduced."
"That applies in particular to the tobacco subsidies."
"The EU must not provide subsidies for the production of crops that endanger our lives as human beings."
". (FR) My colleagues and I from the Mouvement pour la France Group have signed the amendment removing the EUR 7 million appropriation for 'European parties' from the 2003 draft budget."
"In effect, the Treaty of Nice, which provides for public financing for political parties 'at European level', has not yet come into force, and still less its essential implementing regulation."
"We are well aware that the existing 'parties' are in need of money, for the Court of Auditors has declared their funding by certain Parliamentary groups of this House to be illegal."
"We do not feel, however, that this is sufficient reason to disregard the fundamental provisions of the law."
"Moreover, the implementing regulation drawn up last year in anticipation did not comply with the conditions of respect for national constitutional rules on neutrality in the funding of national politics and equal treatment of all the political groupings represented at the European Parliament, as they were defined by Declaration No 11 of the Treaty of Nice."
"Basically, we can only reaffirm our rejection of this kind of funding, which will cost the taxpayer a lot of money and only provide minimal resources for European parties which have no real substance."
"For quite a few years, the common sector in the Member States has been the victim of major cutbacks."
"In that context, it is depressing to see that the EU's budget contains an incredibly large amount of unused resources and that there is a complete waste of money in certain cases."
"There is a great deal of the EU's expenditure budget that we wish wholly or partially to abolish, such as agricultural subsidies, subsidies for the export of live animals to third countries, the greater part of regional aid, subsidies for tobacco cultivation and the running of the Economic and Social Committee and subsidies for European political parties, federalist EU organisations and the dissemination of EU/EMU propaganda."
"This list of what we think are downright objectionable items of expenditure in the EU can be extended still further."
"Another detail we have insisted on every year is that travel expenses for Members of the European Parliament should only be reimbursed in the case of actual costs that have arisen in connection with travel on EU business."
"It is quite incredible that this issue can never be resolved, in spite of the fact that so many people purport to stand up for this principle."
"The public funds spent by the EU can be better used in the Member States."
"We believe that the Member States' contributions to the European Union can be reduced."
". (FR) Of course, our group endorses the European Parliament's refusal to allow the Council of Ministers to cut agricultural market expenditure across the board and the reestablishment of this expenditure at the level laid down by the 2003 preliminary draft budget."
"Our group also welcomes the adoption of its amendment by the Committee on Budgets, an amendment seeking to increase by EUR 20 million the appropriations facilitating the establishing of young farmers in rural areas, an initiative which is proving very successful in France."
"At the start of the Brussels European Council, however, we must not lose sight of the serious threats to the CAP posed by a new, historic enlargement of the European Union."
"Indeed, the agreement on Europe's Financial Perspective, which will be valid until 2006 and which was obtained at such high cost to France at the 1999 Berlin Summit, must not be jeopardised in the name of enlargement, considering that the last year of implementation of the current Financial Perspective will also be the year when the CAP is reformed and that France will henceforth be a net contributor to the European Union Budget."
"The burden of the automatic increase in enlargement-related agricultural expenditure must not be borne by French farmers, and if farm subsidies were to be revised in 2006, this revision would, of course, have to include the Structural Funds and each country's contribution to the European budget."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (PT) I roundly welcome the decision, in the framework of the general budget of the European Union, to maintain both a specific line for aid for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of East Timor, and for an appropriate level of funding."
"The vote on the special function of the two parts of Amendment No 674, in terms that the roll-call vote makes quite clear, merely continues the spirit of intense cooperation and solidarity that the European Union has demonstrated towards the world's most recent nation."
"Let us remember the award of the 1999 Sakharov Prize, by the European Parliament, to the current President of East Timor, Xanana Gusmão, and the promise of assistance in consolidating the new nation, marvellously expressed in the European Parliament's resolution of 4/10/2001."
"The processing of this specific budget line in Parliament rewards the attention, the tenacity and the excellent coordination between the Members who are best informed and best disposed towards East Timor, specifically the Portuguese Members from the various benches in this House. Given the extremely broad majority achieved in plenary, however, it is also a sign that Parliament remains equal to its political and moral responsibilities and is not breaking the commitments it has given to the Timorese people."
"This is indeed extremely gratifying."
"I am chairman of the C.N. Group, which owns several newspapers."
"For that reason, in order to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest, I shall not participate in the vote on this report."
"In Sweden, freedom of expression has been protected by the constitution since 1766."
"The Directive on Insider Trading and Market Manipulation has given rise to debate and to some degree of unease, since there is a continued wish to protect journalists' right to freedom of expression, even once the directive has come into force."
"We believe however that we have received both sufficient explanations of why the directive is of great importance in terms of the desire, for example, to prevent financial speculation harmful to the private individual, and sufficient assurances that the directive will not have any effect upon the Swedish constitution."
"The directive as a whole has an important role to play in creating a free and more efficient financial market demanding sound consumer and investment protection."
"The amendment by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party would bring financial journalism within the scope of the directive, but responsibility for implementation would be left to existing self-regulating bodies."
"That is why we have today voted in favour of the Directive on Insider Trading and Market Manipulation."
". (FR) It is disgraceful that the rapporteur is proposing to reduce the compensation amounts proposed by the Commission, with more concern for the financial well-being of the airlines than the interests of the passengers who are the victims of their commercial practices."
"In the same way, he extols the merits of deregulation of the air transport sector, presenting it, against all evidence, as of benefit to travellers, whereas its sole purpose is to allow airlines to increase their profits."
"It has also served to increase the chaos in the sector, the primary victims of which are those working in the sector and air transport users."
"If we have not voted against this report, abstaining instead, it is only because, despite its limitations, it might lead to air transport passengers receiving a little more compensation in the event of overbooking, cancellation or long delays of flights."
"We believe, for reasons of justice, that two levels of compensation for passengers would be the best solution, in practice one within the EU and one outside the EU."
"In the absence of alternatives, we are, however, voting with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that is to say for three levels of compensation."
". The ELDR Group supported the Lisi report."
"However, we maintain serious reservations with regard to the Commission's proposal on air passenger compensation for the following reasons:"
"1) The Commission's proposal has not undergone a proper economic impact assessment, to determine the potential effect on ticket prices and consumer choice."
"Such an assessment is fundamental to ensuring that the proposed system is sustainable in practice."
"2) Both the proposal and Parliament's compromise fail to recognise the fundamental difference between the usual circumstances leading to denied boarding and those leading to cancellations."
"Whilst denied boarding usually results from deliberate overbooking, cancellation is very often due to circumstances beyond the airline's control - for example, air traffic control."
"Parliament's definition of 'force majeure' is an inadequate safeguard in this respect."
"Though one might argue that airlines should seek recourse against those actually responsible in such cases, this will be very complicated in practice."
"3) Ultimately, particularly where budget carriers are concerned, it might be preferable to require airlines to offer consumers the option of paying a separate insurance premium, on top of the price of their ticket, thereby guaranteeing them compensation for cancellation and delay beyond the airline's control."
"This resolution comes at a crucial time for world peace, in view of the imminent attack on Iraq."
"The European Parliament feels the need to take a stand once again on this issue, expressing its full support for the militaristic policy of the EU, naming the 'fight against terrorism' as the main objective of the European security and defence policy and calling for full and fast implementation of the European terrorism law and other autocratic measures by the Member States."
"It fully espouses the American interpretation of the events of 11 September, endorsing statements on the global threat of terrorism and lending credence to propaganda about attacks on Iraq or anywhere else."
"More to the point, the resolution states that ???? is instrumental to Euro-Atlantic stability and openly supports the new ???? doctrine, orientated as it is towards the fight against 'terrorism'."
"Of course, it does not fail to put the EU on a par with the USA in its role as global policeman, accusing the USA of unilateralism."
"Against this background, statements about respecting the rule of law, freedom and democracy ring extremely hollow."
"We consider the reference to the UN Charter to be both extremely dangerous and revealing, accompanied as it is by the view that 11 September was a case of armed attack."
"That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the resolution."
". (FR) I supported the European Parliament resolution on combating terrorism in order to show my commitment to this cause, but, if the truth be known, I find the text extremely dissatisfactory in a number of respects."
"In Paragraph 6, the European Parliament appears to be saying that the legitimate right of a State which has been attacked to defend itself can only be exercised with the authorisation of the UN Security Council, which would appear to be entirely incorrect."
"In the event of an attack, the Security Council can only pronounce on the collective use of force, not on the right of the State which is the object of the attack to defend itself."
"In Paragraph 36, the European Parliament suggests that what is known as the 'pillar' structure of the European institutions could hamper the fight against terrorism, and this hardly makes any sense."
"The general 'disarmament' which the Union has undertaken, abolishing internal border controls and turning a blind eye to the flow of 'unidentifiable' immigrants in the name of human rights, has a much more damaging effect."
"Lastly, as regards recital P, if, as we must, we want to avoid equating the Muslim world with terrorism, we also have to be conscious of the need to expose the ambiguities contained in the concept of jihad, which are extremely unhealthy fuel for terrorism."
"The resolution on 'Assessment of and prospects for the EU strategy on terrorism one year after 11 September 2001' contains several contradictions."
"Amongst others, I would highlight, some of its more negative aspects:"
"its defence of the militarisation of the 'fight against terrorism', examples of which are changing the current concept of defence to what is being called a 'broader concept of security', which includes 'pre-emptive strikes', such as we are seeing now, at the hands of George W. Bush, confusing Member States' internal security missions with defence policy;"
"the reaffirmation of NATO and of partnership with the USA as a framework reference for the EU in the 'fight against terrorism';"
"its support for the reform of NATO (its political and military structures) in order to change its defence alliance missions into an offensive alliance;"
"its willingness to criminalise the action of organisations and movements that fight, sometimes by means of an armed struggle, against the repression with which their peoples are targeted, confusing these with 'terrorism';"
"the use of the war against terrorism to move ahead with the communitarisation of Justice and Home Affairs in the EU."
"Hence our vote against the report."
". (FR) Terrorism sows and inspires horror."
"No country in the world is safe from the effects of terrorism now."
"In democratic States, there is no religious, political or economic justification for recourse to terrorism."
"We must combat international terrorism actively, and, of course, in this regard, we support the joint motion for a resolution."
"I regret to say that the attacks which took place on 11 September 2001 and, more recently, in Bali, have revealed the weak links in the global fight against terrorism."
"The 50 or so European texts - European Parliament resolutions, framework decisions, conventions, regulations, directives - currently in force have had absolutely no success in reducing terrorism."
"Yesterday, however, all the political groups one by one welcomed the speed with which Europe reacted after 11 September. Of course, in the crisis, a common definition of terrorism was produced, although with difficulty."
"Moreover, Europol was given new responsibilities in this field and a list of unstable States harbouring fundamentalist cells was drawn up, but, a year later, the terrorist networks are still there and we are witnessing more and more terrorist attacks."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"The panic caused by 11 September 2001 has still not died down."
"Fear of terrorism has led to decisions which, under normal circumstances, would only be supported by a minority of this Parliament."
"Although EU Member States are more restrained than America with regard to preventive warfare and more prepared to make payments to Developing World countries, we are still significantly affected by the short-sighted policies of Bush junior."
"In preparing this resolution, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy has made gains from the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the Christian Democrats and Liberals have been able to largely impose their will on the Social Democrats and the Greens."
"This means that more importance is being attached to NATO than the United Nations and that the curtailment of the rights of freedom has been considered more important than removing the causes which make humiliated people into terrorists."
"This is exactly what it takes to ensure the enduring and increasing indignation of the victims of the current balance of power, ownership and income in the world."
"It is nice that the Liberal party still wants to add a charitable slant to this poor position but it does not change the effect."
"I am disappointed by the support of the Social Democrats and the Greens, who are showing that they now want to belong to the emerging parliamentary majority at any price."
"I, like many of my British Conservative colleagues, abstained in the final vote today on the terrorist resolution, since a number of paragraphs adopted were directly aimed at undermining the inherent right to self defence enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, and the right, when there is a clear and imminent threat from a rogue state or terrorist organisation to the security of a country or region, to act pre-emptively under the same inherent legal authority."
"In addition there were references to diverse political concepts from CFSP to ESDP and the Echelon project."
"On these we have distinct policies which are well known and differ from those of the majority of this Parliament."
"Needless to say, we as a party condemn terrorist activities of all types everywhere and have as a country suffered at the hands of the brutal IRA and other paramilitaries for a very long time, so our abstention also reflects the rather weak tone of the resolution."
"In parts this seems to be more concerned with protecting the civil rights of terrorists than with condemning their murderous behaviour towards innocent civilians."
". (FR) Although he mentions the '75% of the 1.2 billion people living below USD 1 a day ? in rural areas', the rapporteur makes no proposal for remedying the food shortage in poor countries other than 'access to markets for developing countries in order to allow them to benefit from common prosperity and achieve economic growth', together with a number of charitable measures."
"Yet it is precisely the market economy which has driven these countries to abandon food-producing traditions in favour of single-crop farming for the world market, and this same market economy which means that even the growth of the world economy leads to more poverty and hunger for over a billion people."
"Moreover, the rapporteur is quite aware that the major powers are cutting aid to poor countries and that it only actually benefits a tiny section of the local population, and that is when it does not take the form of orders for wealthy countries' corporations."
"In any case, what the poor countries need is not patronising charity but an end to the plundering and exploitation they have always suffered at the hands of precisely these large industrial groups and major powers."
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (FR) Europe is strongly divided over the debate currently taking place on the future of the common agricultural policy."
"Basically, on one side, there are the advocates of multifunctional farming, of which I am one, who find it unacceptable that 80% of Community aid should end up in the purses of 20% of the farmers, and, on the other side, there are the defenders of the status quo."
"In this respect, Mr Kanbhai's report gives me the opportunity to put paid to a rumour which is all too often spread about and which I consider to be erroneous, namely that the European Union is closed to exports coming from the world's poorest countries."
"The implication is that we are falling short of our duty of solidarity towards the developing countries by implementing a protectionist agricultural policy focusing solely on European farmers."
"Where does this rumour come from, considering that the European Union imports more agricultural products from developing countries than from the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand taken together?"
"Lies, I suppose."
"Are we to infer from this that boosting trade and agricultural deregulation are the essential pillars of development policy?"
"(Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137(1) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Mr Khanbhai is once again proving to be an effective champion for developing countries."
"He recognises the right of every country to protect its products by raising tariff barriers and urges rich countries to open themselves up to exported products from the poorest countries in spite of all this."
"He also asks the wealthy countries to spend a minimum of 0.7% of their Gross National Product on development aid and recognises the need to redistribute agricultural land ownership."
"I hope his views are shared by his Christian Democratic and Conservative group colleagues."
"Unfortunately they have discovered a new priority during recent times."
"This is the priority of free trade, that is, support for the wrong kind of globalisation than is encouraged by the World Trade Organisation."
"If free trade is implemented, this will mean survival of the fittest."
"Companies with the lowest labour and environmental costs will then be able to steal the market from their competitors, wealthy countries will become richer at the expense of the poorest and the number of those excluded will grow at national level and world level."
"It is therefore delightful to see that a majority is now forming for an attitude which relies on solidarity rather than the opinion 'you do not get anything for nothing'."
"Incidentally, I am aware that this relates to a non-legislative initiative proposal with few direct consequences in practice."
". (FR) We do not endorse the contents of the resolution on the 12th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) to be held from 3 to 15 November 2002 in Santiago, Chile."
"Returning all the African elephant populations from Appendix II (marketing authorisation) to Appendix I is tantamount to banning the export of limited quantities of skins and ivory under the supervision of the Convention Secretariat, whereas such export activities have been made possible again by the substantial increase in herds in a number of southern African countries."
"The increase in the populations in these countries is a considerable nuisance, causing the destruction of harvests, damage to local habitats and substantial losses of revenue for local farmers."
"With a view to the proper management of elephant populations in southern Africa (Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa), we supported the amendments tabled by our group calling for the transfer to Appendix I to be postponed."
"Our vote and our position reflect the mutual interests of the local populations and the wild fauna which is threatened with extinction."
"Mr President, this is a question about the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol dealing with the reduction of CO2 emissions."
"Is an urgent matter because the New Delhi Conference, to which the question refers, is now beginning."
"The European Parliament, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in particular, are very concerned that we should keep the Kyoto momentum going."
"In the European Union all is really not well, because some of the Member States that have ratified Kyoto are in the process of increasing their emissions of CO2, notably Spain."
"We have adopted a number of directives tending to decrease CO2 emissions, and the Commission has put forward a very useful programme showing what it has done and what it intends to do."
"We are particularly interested in the proposals on monitoring mechanisms, which are likely to come forward soon."
"I want to ask three things."
"Firstly, how important is the New Delhi Conference?"
"The Commissioner would say that it is very important."
"If so, then my next question is why is she here and is she planning to go?"
"I am sure that if she is not planning to go, it is not a symptom of the downgrading of the status of the conference."
"We simply want to know what is likely to happen at New Delhi."
"We have heard conflicting rumours."
"Secondly, it would be interesting to hear how the Commission thinks other countries could be encouraged to participate in the Kyoto process."
"For example, I recently met with the Australian Ambassador to the European Union."
"Australia is not a party to Kyoto and is clearly not planning to become one."
"Australia might not have major CO2 emissions, but it could lead the way in South East Asia - a very important area where increasing industrialisation is increasing those emissions."
"Thirdly, we should sort out what the role of MEPs is when they attend such conferences."
"In the past, my colleagues have had increasingly uncomfortable experiences attending these conferences, for example the Johannesburg Conference on Sustainable Development."
"The Commission is always extremely helpful and briefs MEPs as much as possible, but our delegations are not part of the meetings held by the EU delegation as such."
"We cannot understand why we cannot be observers at that process."
"It is absurd for the representatives of the people of Europe to travel halfway round the world only to be spectators at a conference where the people negotiating on their behalf are not directly elected on a European mandate."
"We would like to see this changed so that we are at least given observer status in EU meetings at such conferences."
"Mr President, thank you for those very valid questions on COP 8 as it is called, which I will try to answer as clearly as possible."
"First of all, after Bonn and Marrakech, COP 8 is an opportunity to reinforce the commitments from developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and repeat calls on those countries that have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so in the near future."
"The discussions at COP 8 in India will first of all deal with progress on implementation. That is to establish the state of play."
"The concerns of developing countries relate to adaptation to climate change and the initiation of a process for further action to be taken after 2012, for a second commitment period."
"The progress of the Conference will be detailed in a daily declaration."
"However, if you ask how important this conference is compared with the others, I can say that no negotiations on major issues of substance are foreseen."
"So there is a difference between previous COP meetings and this one."
"This is not to say that it is not important, but it is not at the level of true negotiations as yet."
"We can expect the developing countries to remind the industrialised world of our obligations under the climate convention when it comes to helping them in capacity building and adaptation to climate change."
"The European Union, together with other developed countries, wants to have an initial discussion on the process for deciding on further action for the second commitment period and to initiate this process in New Delhi."
"The Environment Council also called upon other countries to engage in a dialogue on this question last week."
"I can anticipate that the role of the European Union will be to try to build bridges between Japan, the United States and other countries which would like to push the developing countries to move towards quantified commitments for the second commitment period, as of now."
"The developing countries are opposed to that and, of course, argue from a political standpoint that it is our role to lead the way, to show that we are serious about getting our greenhouse gas emissions down, before they will accept anything that could hamper their development."
"So this debate will probably start, but we in the European Union have said that we should concentrate on establishing the process, because our first objective is for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force."
"We should not let anything stop us from reaching that goal."
"The Commission together with Member States will use COP 8 to emphasise the importance of implementing the Kyoto Protocol and the agreements reached in Bonn and Marrakech."
"We welcome the various points raised in the European Parliament resolution of 2 October and we will take them on board as far as possible."
"One issue that we will pursue at COP 8 is also a follow-up to the coalition of the willing on renewable energy that the European Union launched in Johannesburg."
"We will discuss the way forward with like-minded countries and encourage others to join in."
"As you know, the Kyoto Protocol will enter into force once 55 parties representing at least 55% of the emissions of Annex 1 have ratified the Protocol."
"So far, 95 countries representing 37.1% of emissions have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, representing around two thirds of the world population."
"The speed of ratification, and this concerns your second question, Mrs Jackson, increased before and during the World Summit in Johannesburg."
"Such events often trigger this kind of reaction."
"That is fine, but the important thing is to get the countries to ratify the Protocol and to make progress in implementing it."
"Canada and Russia said, during the World Summit, that they intent to ratify it, while major developing countries, such as China, India and Brazil, have by now done so."
"I would say that what is most important now is to continue to put pressure on Russia, because we know that the ratification by Russia, which represents 17.4% of emissions, is vital to reach the 55% threshold needed for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force."
"We are, of course, in contact with the Russian authorities and we are closely following progress on ratification in Russia."
"My colleague and I have urged other parties, with whom we have bilateral meetings, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and we are continuing to do so."
"We have done all we can, travelling around the world talking to Australia and other countries in the everyday bilateral context, drawing attention to this issue and to the importance of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol."
"So we are continuing to call on the US and Australia to return to the Kyoto process."
"The European climate change programme Mrs Jackson referred to was launched on 8 March 2000 and has identified key elements for a cost-effective EU-wide strategy to combat climate change."
"Our communication last year outlined a first package of ten measures with a cost-effective reduction potential of between 122 and 178 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent."
"That is nearly halfway towards our Kyoto target of -8%."
"The Commission has already presented proposals for a number of these measures, including an EU emissions trading scheme, the energy performance of buildings, co-generation and a strategy to increase the use of biofuels in road transport."
"Others, such as legislation on minimum energy efficiency standards for end use equipment or the promotion of energy services and on fluorinated gases, are in the pipeline."
"But is true that some of our Member States will have to take serious steps to deal with the current trend when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions."
"You cannot afford to be lax in that area."
"Transport has been identified as one of the more intractable sectors, with carbon dioxide emissions from transport the fastest growing, despite the progress made through our agreement with the European Automobile Manufacturers Association."
"The Commission has indicated that changes in current mobility patterns need to be a high priority."
"Turning to the role of MEPs, the MEPs I met yesterday, who will be in the delegation going to India, find it frustrating that often they are in the same group as the NGOs."
"As observers, they will not have access to the negotiations or to the round table discussions in New Delhi."
"We have had Members of the European Parliament in the European Communities delegation at previous COPs in Bonn and Marakesh."
"On both occasions I appreciated and enjoyed the outstanding cooperation with the EP delegation."
"It has been very helpful to have the Members of the European Parliament present and active on those occasions and at bilateral meetings with other parliamentarians."
"In a letter to President Cox, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, recently confirmed that, on the basis of the framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission, the Commission could accept the inclusion of eight Members of the European Parliament as observers in our Community delegation for COP 8."
"The inclusion of the MEPs in the COP delegation follows the established rules on the presence of Members of Parliament in delegations to international conferences."
"We decided, after our discussion yesterday, that we on the Commission side will do everything we can to see whether some parts of the round table discussions could be made public or opened up to Members of the European Parliament, but we are in the hands of a UN organisation, so we can only ask."
"You will then need to ask the Council and the Member States whether it would be possible to participate in coordination meetings."
"This issue will have to be raised in a more general context, because it concerns not only the MEPs attending this and other climate change meetings, but also other international fora."
"It is important to sort out for the future the different roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the Member States and Members of the European Parliament."
"Now is probably not the time to change all the rules in the existing agreement, but later on it should be taken to a more general level and clear rules established for the future."
"I have appreciated enormously the cooperation with Members of the European Parliament. I hope that will continue at COP 8 in India."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is no longer a matter for negotiation - it is a matter for action."
"And I would say that, in terms of the EU's new political agenda, there is a set of three objectives in this field that must be achieved in the short term."
"First of all, ensuring that the Protocol will enter into force."
"In order for this to happen, Russia must ratify the Protocol."
"The problem, however, is that Russia has already promised on several occasions that it would ratify the Protocol and this has not yet happened."
"I ask the Commissioner, what type of concrete political and diplomatic initiatives are being and will be adopted in conjunction with the Russian Government to ensure that the Protocol is urgently submitted for ratification in the Duma?"
"Secondly, I believe it is important not to give up - and in fact we cannot give up - attempting to convince the US administration to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol."
"The directive on emissions trading will help the European campaign to persuade the Americans to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol."
"Let us say that, with emissions trading, we will be able to demonstrate that it is possible to comply with Kyoto at less economic cost."
"I do feel, however, that on this issue too, embarking on a charm offensive is not enough. We must take Kyoto to the next round at the World Trade Organisation."
"And I wish to ask the Commission, is it prepared to submit an initiative to the next World Trade Organisation round, that guarantees the elimination of competitive and legitimate advantages that American products will gain as a result of their economy not being covered by the Kyoto Protocol?"
"Thirdly, Mr President, I believe it is important for the European Union to strengthen its international leadership on the basis of action rather than words."
"On this matter, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Wallström on the excellent work she is doing in this field."
"The Commission has demonstrated its ability to take the initiative, not least in its directive on emissions allowance trading and in the European Programme on Climate Change, but I do feel that this is a serious political problem: where the Member States are concerned, we are seeing real paralysis."
"I believe it is crucial, for the sake of the credibility of our leadership, that the Member States also start to take action."
"With regard to the role of Parliament's delegation in New Delhi, I would emphasise the words of its Chairman, Caroline Jackson: the parliamentary delegation must be allowed to attend the daily meetings held by the EU representatives."
"Mr President, I want to begin by emphasising what Mr Moreira Da Silva and Mrs Jackson have just said."
"Political leadership on this issue is incredibly important."
"I also think that the way in which the EU has dealt with the issue via the Commission has been excellent."
"These issues need nonetheless, in the future too, to go on being given a high profile."
"It is not acceptable for there to be certain Member States that do not really take the issue seriously and that, instead of reducing emissions, are tending to do the opposite."
"Almost the same situation applies too to the candidate countries that wish to become members of the EU but that have still not ratified the treaty."
"We must continue to exert pressure and say that we require ratification if membership is to become possible."
"What we expect first and foremost from the New Delhi conference is political leadership and the maintenance of a strong political message from the EU."
"The most important issue, even if we are now beginning to understand that it will probably not be possible to concentrate on it, is about what will happen during the next commitment period."
"What, then, will happen after 2012?"
"What shall we do?"
"What are the objectives?"
"I should also like to put these issues to Mrs Wallström."
"What is it intended should happen during the forthcoming period?"
"Does the Commission already have plans as to how matters need to proceed?"
"What demands are to be made, and how are we to make progress in solving the problem of climate change?"
"The same applies to our role in relation to the developing countries."
"We quite often point out the need to ensure we help the developing countries fulfil what is required of them by the Kyoto Protocol."
"How are we to do this in purely practical terms?"
"We have today voted on the EU budget at first reading."
"There will of course be a second reading, but it is difficult to see where climate issues in particular fit into the picture."
"To repeat Parliament's old demands, it should soon no doubt be time to incorporate shipping and aviation into these talks."
"That has still not happened, but it is no doubt desirable that it should."
"Even if these issues cannot perhaps be among those raised in New Delhi, it is nonetheless important that we make these demands."
"In conclusion, I want to repeat the principle on the basis of which I think this discussion ought to proceed and which, in actual fact, gave rise for once to some discussion at the most recent meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"I mean that we must seek equal rights for all citizens of the world."
"The committee certainly adds the rider that this is to happen in the long term, but what is nonetheless required is for all citizens to have the right of access to good, renewable energy on equal terms."
"Mr President, Commissioner, whilst there is genuine cause to welcome the question and the resolution tabled by Mrs Jackson on the Union's position at the New Delhi Conference on Climate Change, the fact that the report has been tabled so late leaves us with some doubts as to its real aim."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, how should we interpret this debate, which is being held after the opening of the Conference, if not as a sign of political and psychological immaturity in the face of the reality of the threats to our world posed by the upheaval of climate change?"
"We must ask ourselves whether the latest UNEP report, which revealed that USD 150 billion is spent on environmental damage each year, escaped the scrutiny of certain European visionaries."
"Do not worry, ladies and gentlemen of this House. I do not mean you."
"Commissioner, how do you intend to convince your fellow Commissioners of the urgent need for practical measures?"
"In New Delhi, what we actually need to do is to increase the international reaction to the threat of climate change a little more."
"This momentum, which the European Union harnessed to implement the conclusions of the last Earth Summit as fully as possible, must be maintained with a view to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, as defined at Bonn and Marrakech."
"The European Union must continue to be a driving force in combating climate change."
"At New Delhi, we must also pave the way for the second period, as you have said, and prepare to address requirements which are more pressing because of the gravity of the situation, and we know that time is of the essence."
"There are three essential points we must uphold in New Delhi."
"Firstly, as regards carbon wells, which distort the true environmental picture, scientific rigour and objectivity exclude this simple solution, this expedient."
"Secondly, it is imperative that the surge in air traffic and its impact on the increase in greenhouse gas emissions are included in the process."
"What is the Commission's current view on this?"
"Thirdly and lastly, the COP 8 must not fail to condemn the attempt to include nuclear power as a renewable energy, for nuclear power is limited and even obsolete."
"For example, Amendment No 15 to our resolution, seeking to reinstate it, must be rejected."
"There is no more urgent subject for us and our debates than the potential future impact of climate change."
"There is nothing more essential in politics than the very essence of all politics: the continued survival and proper functioning of the Earth itself."
"We must act now to give ourselves the chance of a future."
"Mr President, many other conferences have already taken place since the climate conference in Kyoto."
"Now that we are preparing for New Delhi, the Kyoto Protocol is still not in force, however."
"Obviously we cannot have complete control over the world just like that."
"Certainly not when we consider that man has limited influence over CO2 emissions."
"Technically speaking there are vast sources of CO2 emissions and CO2 wells."
"It is therefore only to be expected that emissions caused by man have only a limited effect on the overall amount."
"However, we still have a duty to limit CO2 emissions as far as possible."
"A glance at the conference programme shows me that specific matters relating to the implementation are up for discussion."
"The emphasis being placed on wind energy, cooperation with third countries and emissions trading schemes is a positive development."
"In my opinion the European Union can make a substantial contribution towards projects for clean development in developing countries."
"The EU already has a pioneering role to play with regard to emissions trading schemes."
"Parliament has chosen to implement an unambiguous and well-thought-out system to be introduced in 2005."
"Economies can be made by businesses being more frugal with energy and the link with the overall energy policy is of course very important."
"With regard to CO2 wells I would like to point out the danger that we might overestimate in our accounting for CO2 wells in, for example, the ocean."
"As the water warms up, its capacity for absorbing CO2 will fall again."
"The European Union ratified the Protocol six months ago."
"Let us hope that the New Delhi climate conference will result in ratification by the Russian and Canadian Governments."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks to Mrs Jackson for tabling such an important question and to Mrs Wallström for her honest answer."
"It is, though, a pity that, realistically speaking, no serious political progress is expected in New Delhi because people are in fact hoping for something else."
"After the dreadful floods in Germany and neighbouring countries, people expected the climate problem to be resolved once and for all in Johannesburg, only to be told that it had a different agenda."
"The same appears to be true of New Delhi, but we must continue to be tough negotiators, even if we cannot always make rapid progress."
"We must also remember that Kyoto is, of course, just the first step, which is why we reiterate quite clearly in our resolution that all citizens must end up with the same rights, which basically means that per capita emissions should be the same the world over."
"For the developing countries, this implies a great deal more than we promised in Kyoto."
"In view of the recent debate on emissions trading in Germany, we have to keep reminding ourselves that all the parties in Germany are in fact agreed that we need to reduce emissions in the long term by 80% - I repeat 80% by 2050 - and if we are already arguing so energetically against it now, when first steps need to be taken, then I do not hold out much hope for this long-term objective."
"Nonetheless, we must stand by it and our resolution reaffirms this."
"Ratification by Russia, Japan and the USA is still very, very important."
"As we have been told on numerous occasions, all we can do is keep on making demands and ensuring that every meeting, at whatever level, between representatives of the European Union, be it the Commission or the Council of Ministers or us here in the European Parliament, between the EU and the USA, between the EU and Russia, addresses this issue."
"It must be our top priority in our dealings with these countries."
"We must not relax in our efforts and I expressly endorse what Mr Moreira Da Silva said about the WTO."
"We must get the WTO to agree to allow us to keep certain products off the European market if they have been manufactured using processes that cause additional climate change."
"The credibility of the European Union is, of course, vital."
"We have to clean up our own act."
"Parliament has, by a very large majority, taken a clear stand on emissions trading."
"I am sorry that the Council of Ministers has postponed its decision yet again and I am sorry to hear from initial reactions that important amendments which we adopted, for example on the CAP or on 1990 as the base year, may not meet with the Council's approval."
"The Council needs to adopt a clear concept, and quickly, and we, the European Parliament, need to be tough negotiators."
"That is all I have to say."
"Three minutes is too short a time to expand on the whole issue but I think it really is important for us to keep clarifying our position here in this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate policy is a process that will inform everything we do in the twenty-first century and I trust that Europe will continue to play a leading role here."
"I have something to say to the members of the parliaments."
"We have more and more global processes, not just now with Kyoto, but on other issues - I am thinking of the International Monetary Fund, financial policy, worldwide credit policy, environmental policy and trade policy - which are in fact decided solely by the executive."
"The parliaments rubberstamp them, they have no choice."
"The question is: surely, with increasing globalisation, parliaments could be more involved in the opinion-forming process?"
"This question is directed both to us and to our parliaments."
"We need to find new ways of working together instead of just taking recourse to the executive - in this case the Commission."
"Secondly, Kyoto must be ratified and that will be our main job in New Delhi."
"We must convince our counterparts, especially our Russian counterparts, that this makes sense."
"Thirdly, when we talk of reducing CO2 - and other greenhouse gas emissions, but mainly CO2 - we always mention renewable energy in the same breath."
"And so we should."
"I have no wish to contradict that."
"It is just that, in New Delhi, we will be in a country that generates well over 50% of its electricity from coal."
"If they could bring their coal technology up to current European standards, we would save much, much more CO2 throughout the world than with all the other very costly reduction measures put together."
"This is a fact and we must face it."
"In other words, if we want a climate policy, we need an active coal policy and we should mention that in the same breath as renewable energy, because 80% of the world's energy is still generated from fossil fuels."
"Finally, I think that climate policy also gives us a chance to foster a new relationship with developing countries, in the form of emissions trading."
"The Commission itself conducted a very interesting study in its institute in Seville, with a time frame of up to 2030, when, it states, emissions trading with Asia will be worth around EUR 80 billion."
"That implies a capital inflow of around EUR 80 billion for these countries."
"Know-how will be transmitted to these countries and the advantage to us is that the reduction in emissions will be entered against our account, meaning that both sides will benefit from the trade off."
"We should be thinking more along these lines."
"Mr President, Russia intends to ratify shortly and then the Kyoto Protocol will be in force."
"A worldwide discussion will immediately arise - how and when will the US and the developing countries participate in this issue?"
"Europe has to take the lead again in this discussion."
"Much greater reductions are to be implemented in Europe after 2012, for example minus 30% in 2020 as proposed by the German Government."
"How do the Commissioners feel about this?"
"On the other hand, as has already been stated, equal rights to emit CO2 per world citizen at a sustainable level is also written in the Parliamentary resolution."
"How does the Commission feel about this idea?"
"That will mean that India will be allowed to emit double its current amount, China must stabilise, Europe must reduce its emissions by 80% and the US by 90%."
"Worldwide burden sharing is necessary if we really want to make progress in the fight against climate change."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we have already heard several times, one of the most important items on the agenda of the COP 8 conference in New Delhi in India is to agree on when the Kyoto Protocol will finally enter into force, with the emphasis on ratification by Russia."
"I should like to reiterate what Mrs Annelie Hulthén said, namely that we must make sure that future Member States of the European Union understand that this is one of our priorities."
"Another important issue -- and at this time and at this conference, which should not be taking place anyway, this probably has less to do with specific negotiations and more to do with thinking up a strategy and enumerating its features - is how we can convince numerous developing countries to join the fight against climate change in the future."
"This will of course depend on our own credibility when it comes to climate change."
"In other words, Europe and the European Union must deliver satisfactory results here."
"Our success or failure in achieving this credibility with our partners in the developing countries - for whom I realise, Commissioner, this will not be easy - will not depend solely on our environmental policy; it will also depend on whether we have coherent policies in other sectors, such as European agriculture."
"One point, which has not yet been raised today but which I consider very important, is the question of monitoring."
"I think that, if we want the Kyoto Protocol to be a success and deliver demonstrable results, then we need a reasonable, reliable monitoring system."
"In other words, we must ensure that the Member States deliver reliable figures on their emissions and on the flexible mechanisms."
"We also need reliable data on what Europe sees as the very negative question of planting, in other words reforestation and similar activities."
"My final point, which numerous members have raised, is of course the question of what happens after 2012, at the end of the first period, and it seems to me that we can make good use of COP 8 if we avoid getting embroiled in finer points and negotiations in order to table this problem and start thinking now about what must and will happen in 2012."
"Mr President, thank you for these valuable contributions to this debate."
"I would like to comment on some of the points that have been raised."
"First of all, what can we do to influence Russia and to push for ratification from the Russian side?"
"It is difficult to talk to the Russians."
"We have for some time now been planning a troika visit to Russia and we are continuing to plan for that visit because we want to meet the right people."
"We want to have it at a high political level in order to have a meaningful discussion."
"In all bilateral talks, including those between Commissioner Prodi and Prime Minister Putin, climate change and the Kyoto Protocol have been on the agenda."
"Of course we raise this issue in all our bilateral contacts."
"We are also aware of a study that has just been published by the Russian Government on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol."
"We are currently analysing the results - hopefully we will be able to use some of them in our ongoing debate."
"We are keeping a close eye on what happens in Russia, in order to be able to use the positive forces that exist in Russia."
"In the end, I suppose that it is Prime Minister Putin who will decide."
"What about a WTO initiative?"
"That has not yet been included in our plans at all."
"Maybe that is a good idea."
"I have not though about it enough to give you a really considered answer today, but I am worried about anything that could complicate or halt the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol."
"We should be very careful not to raise the issue in such a way that we create more stumbling blocks in the debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol."
"I would be happy to come back to the debate on the WTO and the links between these issues."
"What happens in the second commitment period?"
"First of all, we are interested in establishing the process in Delhi and COP8."
"It is too early and in view of the risk of complicating the whole debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, we want first of all to establish the process and decide how to get to the second commitment period."
"It seems a little pointless to go into the details on that before the Kyoto Protocol has even entered into force."
"So first things first."
"We have to stick to that strategy at COP8 as well."
"There was one question on air traffic."
"Of course the Commission and the European Union are working within ICAO, because this is clearly an international issue."
"I am sure we would all agree that the work in ICAO has not been satisfactory when it comes to speed and commitment, but it also has a UNCCC mandate to work on the climate change issue."
"This is an area where we can hopefully do more, but we will have to continue to work in an international context."
"Finally, what about equal rights per world citizen?"
"The ultimate goal is to stabilise concentrations in the atmosphere at harmless levels."
"Remember that."
"We need to reduce emissions as a result."
"I believe this will lead to convergence of per capita emissions internationally."
"Whether equal rights is the right target, I cannot say."
"I do not want to say to the European Parliament that it is a ridiculous idea, but my personal opinion is that it might not be the most sensible approach."
"It is a moral concept rather than an environmental measure."
"Our main objective is to protect the environment."
"That, I believe, is how we should formulate it."
"We emit eight times more, on average, than an Indian citizen."
"How do we create equal rights for citizens throughout the world?"
"I would like to approach it from an environmental point of view, so that we make sure that we stabilise concentrations in the atmosphere at harmless levels."
"I hope you understand my argument."
"Perhaps this is something which requires further debate."
"We have an important role to play in New Delhi, in the COP8 discussions, because we can definitely work with the developing countries."
"We will probably be the bridge between G77, China and the developed countries in the debate on how to deal with climate change."
"To conclude this debate, I have received, pursuant to Article 42 of the Rules of Procedure, the motion for a resolution B5-0531/2002, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Mr President, Commissioner, when we debated the seed directive here in Parliament in the mid-1990s, I acted as rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"At the time, we successfully applied for the final vote on the issue of genetically modified organisms to be deferred."
"I then negotiated for two years on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture."
"The issue at stake then was not whether genetic engineering should or should not be used; the issue at stake was labelling and the inclusion of this seed directive and its methods in the release directive, which at the time was still Directive 90/220."
"We achieved this."
"At the time, the scientists still insisted that genetically modified crops could coexist alongside non-genetically modified crops; they excluded the possibility of contamination."
"This stand has now been overtaken both by events and by opinion within the scientific community itself."
"Now those who wish or rather who, under the bio regulation, are legally obliged to farm - be it conventionally or organically - without using genetic engineering, face the problem of unwanted contamination."
"Now the Commission wants to set a threshold below which no labelling is required."
"This is where the figures start to get confusing."
"Once upon a time there was talk of 1% contamination; now we are down to 0.3 and 0.5%."
"But the fact remains that genetically modified organisms are being released unintentionally in huge quantities."
"If we relate this to an area of seven-and-a-half or eight million hectares of rape or corn, 7 million plants seed every year."
"This is not going to be negotiated with Parliament, not even in the Standing Committee on the release directive, which has now been renewed; it is to be decided in the Standing Committee on Seeds, where a ruling is to be laid down under the comitology procedure which, if implemented as it stands, contradicts Parliament's figure of 0.5% in the food labelling directive."
"If we approve seeding in these quantities without labelling, then we must assume that the other value will be exceeded during seeding and that even those who do not use any form of genetically modified organism will be forced to comply with labelling and testing requirements."
"We need a ruling here which clarifies once and for all - and this is also the position which the Committee on Agriculture has just adopted - that there has to be coexistence, that those who wish to use genetically modified organisms must ensure that those who do not are not brought into contact with them."
"That applies both to the 70% of farmers in Germany who do not want GMOs and to about the same percentage of consumers who do not want GMOs."
"So there is no point in starting from a specific threshold because, if it is exceeded, the risk and the individual costs will be impossible to bear under compensation rules."
"So we need a ruling whereby those who are to blame can be held to account under the polluter-pays principle."
"This process, these rulings are no simple matter, Commissioner, and cannot be decided under the comitology procedure or in the standing committee and technical annex; they need further debate and another vote, with codecision by Parliament."
"We should also hold science to account and organise hearings in order to clarify how coexistence which is really worth its name, can be applied."
"All this takes time and must not, under any circumstances, be rushed."
"Until then, the rule must be that uncontaminated seed can be guaranteed for those who do not want to use genetically modified organisms."
"Mr President, the questions are very important in the context of the current debate on GMOs in Europe."
"We still do not have a clear-cut reply to some of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's questions."
"Please accept that my answers are to some extent preliminary ones, which will require further scrutiny and reflection, both within the Commission and in our ongoing discussions with the Member States and the different stakeholders."
"I wish to begin with a short description of the problem we are faced with when dealing with the adventitious presence of GM seeds in conventional products."
"This is also important for everyone who has followed this debate."
"On a global scale, GMO cultivation has increased dramatically in recent years."
"In 2001, 5.5 million farmers in 13 countries grew an estimated 52.6 million acres with GM crops."
"Between 2000 and 2001, the number of acres planted to GM crops increased by almost 20%."
"For some crops, the increase was particularly large."
"In the US, GM corn increased from 4.4% of all planted acres in 1996 to 32% in 2002."
"GM soya beans increased from 7.4% in 1996 to 74% in 2002."
"To date, the cultivation of GMOs has been geographically concentrated, with 99% of all GM crops produced by four nations: the United States of America, Argentina, Canada and China."
"However, GM cultivation is likely to spread to other nations in the next few years."
"So far Europe has played a very marginal role, with fewer than 20 000 acres of GM crops, mainly in Spain and France."
"That is some 0.03% of the worldwide area."
"Europe has large volumes of trade with major GM producers - although trade in GM products has mainly concerned products for animal feed."
"Imports of GM products for human consumption, like maize, have largely ceased, because of the inability of exporters to ensure the identity of all individual GMOs in shipments."
"The last few years have shown that the adventitious presence of traces of GMOs in conventional products has become inevitable."
"Cross-pollination between plants is a natural phenomenon - that also happens between other seeds."
"We simply cannot completely control its mechanisms, which include factors such as wind and insect movements."
"It is therefore largely unavoidable that small traces of GMOs will be transferred to conventional crops and their harvested products."
"Storage and transportation practices may also make it difficult or extremely costly to ensure total segregation."
"Consequently, conventional seed lots will contain traces of GM seeds."
"Setting tolerance thresholds for impurities for GM seeds in this particular case is the only way to address the problem."
"Closing our market completely is not a viable option."
"Against this background, the Commission is currently preparing a proposal for a Commission directive amending the annexes to the seed directives."
"This proposal includes additional conditions and requirements concerning the adventitious presence of GM seeds in lots of non-GM seeds."
"The Committee on Agriculture has been informed twice about the status of this proposal."
"Commissioner Byrne has written to inform Mrs Jackson that the text will be formally submitted to the European Parliament, which will then have the opportunity to scrutinise it."
"Article 21(2) of Directive 18/2001/EC provides for the possibility of establishing thresholds below which traces of authorised GMOs are exempted from labelling requirements."
"Hence, conventional products containing adventitious traces of such GM seeds below this threshold would not have to be labelled."
"Let me now answer some of the questions raised by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf."
"On the competent body to set thresholds, the Regulatory Committee, provided for in Directive 18/2001/EC, is competent for decisions pertaining to thresholds under Article 21(2) of the directive, with regard to exemption from labelling requirements."
"However, it is not competent for decisions made under the sector-specific seeds directives, where thresholds relate specifically to marketing criteria for seeds."
"The Standing Committee on Seeds rightly has the necessary competence in this case."
"Consistency between the different pieces of legislation has to be maintained."
"On the risks that a significant percentage of GM seeds may be released out of control into the environment, I would first say that it is paramount that any threshold should take account of the protection of human health and, importantly, in the case of seeds, the environment."
"You will be aware that this includes a comprehensive free-market assessment of the potential risks."
"Secondly, thresholds must be workable and enforceable."
"The proposed thresholds arise directly from the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Plants and are scientifically founded with reference to the characteristics of the crop species."
"Thirdly, on the registration of GMO cultivation, under the provisions of Article 31(3)(b), Member States are required to establish registers for recording the location of GM fields grown for commercial purposes."
"As detailed in the article, the objective of this is to allow the possible effects of these GMOs on the environment to be monitored."
"As for the scope of Directive 18/2001/EC, this clearly relates to cultivation of a GM seed product itself and not a conventional seed product containing traces of GM seeds."
"The GM seed product itself has to be labelled as such and also traced, so that growers will know what they are sowing."
"It will therefore be possible for Member States to record the locations of the resultant crops."
"However, the threshold values, which are based on robust scientific assessment, should aim at ensuring that the cultivation of conventional seeds basically maintains the characteristics of non-GM cultivation."
"Coexistence is a key issue in the Commission communication on Life Sciences and Biotechnology - a Strategy for the Future."
"The Commission has commissioned a number of studies on this issue."
"The main aim is to assess the consequences arising from an increase in the cultivation of GM crops in the European Union in the context of coexistence."
"So far, we only have preliminary data based on hypothetical scenarios, and further experimental data is required to provide a more accurate picture."
"The Commission is actively pursuing such work before considering possible options to ensure the viability of conventional and organic farming and their sustainable coexistence with GM crops."
"As a further step in this process, the Commission has commenced discussions in partnership with Member States, farmers and other private operators to find the most appropriate solutions."
"It is important to say that the issue of coexistence is not one of risk per se."
"It does, however, highlight a possible need to establish correct agricultural management systems and practices for the different crop types to ensure their coexistence and consumer choice."
"This is my initial reply to your questions and I will be happy to make further comments at the end of the debate."
"Mr President, allow me if you will another brief supplementary question."
"The Commissioner said that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has been informed."
"That is correct."
"She said that Parliament will be informed."
"This too has been promised."
"But we do not want to be informed, Commissioner, once you have made your decision; we want to be included in the decision-making process."
"Our complaint is that this is to be regulated in the form of a technical annex."
"We feel that this is a core amendment to the directive and we want to be included in the decision-making process."
"I would be grateful if you could comment on this or if you could at least pass this on to the Commission as a whole."
"Mr President, this is a recurring institutional debate."
"Should the codecision procedure or comitology be used?"
"The seeds directives provide for purity criteria in the annexes and they can be adapted to scientific and technical knowledge by the comitology procedure provided for under the seeds directive."
"It is thus possible to set thresholds for GM presence in non-GM varieties through a comitology procedure."
"The 1% food labelling threshold provided for in a Council regulation has been set by the comitology procedure provided for under the foodstuff labelling legislation."
"Article 21(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC also states that labelling thresholds may be set in the comitology procedure provided for under the directive."
"Timing and the possibility of making it a practical procedure are also factors."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too have, on numerous occasions in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, bemoaned the fact that seed regulations are being pushed to such an extent under the comitology procedure."
"I have said that I think it would make more sense if the Commission held fire on the regulation for GMOs in seed under the comitology procedure until Parliament has completed the current procedure."
"We need the new seed regulations to be consistent with the regulations on GMOs in food and feed and on the traceability and labelling of GMOs."
"These issues were hotly debated at first reading here in this House as recently as the summer."
"The resolution was extremely tight on several points, especially the question of threshold values."
"We are now waiting for the Council of Ministers to reach a decision, which since last week has again been postponed to December."
"A final decision by the Council cannot now be expected before the middle of next year."
"I think it would be far better if the Commission were to keep its paper in the pending tray for another year, so that the threshold values can be adjusted to the regulations currently on the agenda."
"So much for the procedure."
"Now for a brief material comment."
"The question of whether GMOs are a good or a bad thing does not belong in today's debate."
"But as Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf refers in his question to positions on GMOs, I wish to do likewise."
"It is clear from all the Member's questions that there is something he has failed to understand or does not wish to admit."
"There is a difference between releasing GMOs under Directive 2001/18, on the one hand, and setting a technical limit value for the adventitious presence of GMOs in conventional seed by amending the annexes to the seed directives, on the other."
"These directives contain an array of technical rules and requirements on the quality and marketing of seed in the EU."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf himself said that the actual directives were adopted in the usual manner after hearing the European Parliament and that it was decided in the process that certain technical details were to be regulated under the regulatory committee procedure."
"The committee does not of course decide on the release of GMOs, it decides how to define a further quality standard for conventional seed and it has the jurisdiction to do so under current EU law."
"The Commissioner said as much."
"The scientific committee has, in its turn, confirmed, as do countless other scientific works, that statistically halfway reliable statements do not brook a limit value of less than 0.1%."
"This is the cut-off point."
"There is no such thing as a 0% value, and nothing is GM-free."
"The Commission draft suggests threshold values for GMOs that do not represent a risk to the environment and consumers, and which can therefore be commercially cultivated in the EU."
"The registration requirements in Directive 2001/18 have nothing to do with the marketing of conventional seed."
"Reproduction seed, which farmers themselves cultivate, is at times much more of a problem."
"It is not subject to any quality testing requirements whatsoever and does not therefore undergo any tests to detect GMOs."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf himself is in favour of liberalising these reproduction regulations."
"The lower the threshold value for the adventitious presence of GMOs is set, the more conventional and organic products will have to be labelled, which is why the Commission, various Member States and a large majority in the European Parliament are calling for a realistic limit value of 1% in the forthcoming GMO regulations."
"To close, may I say that working farmers need a fundamental understanding of the simple biologic facts of the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of type A seed in type B. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf works as a farmer."
"There are such things as natural events."
"There will always be GMOs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, after so much criticism, I should like to offer Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf my warmest thanks for his oral question to the Commission."
"It is not just on the mind of my group, it is, of course, also on Mrs Sommer's mind."
"As she said, we worked together with an overwhelming majority in the Committee on the Environment on this issue, precisely because we have the impression that our right of codetermination is being curtailed, whatever the legal situation here; I think we all know that, Mrs Sommer."
"We have asked the Commission and various representatives working on this directive for a deferment on several occasions, because the message we keep getting is that the idea is to railroad these legal provisions through before the end of the year."
"The legislation in this area, which is currently being dealt with by the Council but which was dealt with by Parliament at first reading up to July, signals that we are taking this seriously."
"I shall resist the temptation to rehash the debate we held up to July, but I should like to comment on one point which is, of course, also addressed in the legislation and which, as rapporteur, I am familiar with, namely the regulation on genetically modified food and feedingstuffs."
"What we want to know is: what is being done to prevent technically unavoidable, unwanted contamination?"
"What proposals does the Commission have for investigating this question?"
"Word is spreading that we are in fact regulating something at European level."
"We are regulating limit values, threshold values for technically unavoidable, adventitious contamination."
"We all agree here that we need these limit values and that there is no such thing as completely 'GM-free'."
"At the same time, we are not saying that there are laws in the pipeline, there are recommendations in the pipeline tackling how this can be avoided in future."
"If the objective - and here too we agree with the Commission - is to deny this contamination and if the objective is the coexistence of various types of farming, such as traditional and organic farming, then this is a question we really should be asking ourselves."
"If the Commissioner says that there are no clear-cut replies to these questions, which is perfectly understandable, then I understand even less why this is now being railroaded through here under the comitology procedure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I really am appalled by your reply, because you said absolutely nothing about the central issue of how we want to achieve or can guarantee freedom of choice for the consumer."
"You said absolutely nothing about how we are to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on a limit value of 0.5% for labelling."
"That is precisely what the Council is currently negotiating."
"With your planned limit value for seed, this value is not achievable."
"You know that, which is why I should now like to ask you to tell us what conclusions you intend to draw from this vote by Parliament."
"Is it in fact that you want to press ahead, that you want to bring about a fait accompli, that you want, as it were, to give the seed industry a Christmas present?"
"I think you should state here today how you intend to handle Parliament's resolution at first reading on this regulation."
"You said just now that contamination is unavoidable."
"That is as incorrect as it is unacceptable!"
"In saying this, you are setting yourself up as the mouthpiece of the genetic engineering industry because that is what the lobby claims, but it is not true."
"Tests in Europe have shown that there is no contamination of seed of any consequence and in Austria we even have purity requirements for seed and I think that is exactly what we need."
"We need freedom of choice for consumers and, in order to guarantee it, we need purity requirements."
"We should not just throw in the towel in the face of contamination when, with the right policy, there is no contamination, because products or seeds which cause such widespread contamination cannot be released."
"So what we need is freedom of choice for consumers and, please, rather than giving Christmas presents to the seed industry, give us a timetable today."
"We want to know what the Commission is planning to do and if it really is prepared to accept Parliament's democratic resolution and wait until we have adopted a resolution on the Scheele Report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I agree with you that all the directives and regulations on GMOs should be part of the same framework and should not conflict with each other."
"Secondly, I understand that the Commission chooses the quantitative detectability techniques in order to define the adventitious presence of GMOs."
"That I quite understand."
"In fact, you sometimes even disregard the 1% adventitious presence of GMOs because - and I agree with you here - the authorisation for the circulation of a given GMO comes under a different directive, which takes into account the risks for human health and the environment."
"If there is no risk to human health and the environment, an authorisation is given."
"However, when it comes to the directives on traceability, for some peculiar reason, you do not follow the principle of detectability which you follow for all the others."
"This will also create problems for the World Trade Organisation, because if you accept that the presence of 1% is not a problem for health and so on, why do you not accept that detectability should be included in all traceability directives?"
"If GMOs are present, whether adventitious or not, that fact should be stated."
"You insist on not including detectability in the traceability directives."
"You must abide by what you have said, namely, that all directives should be part of the same framework."
"I expect to hear what you have to say about the detectability issue, which is very important, even in trade."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is important, in the light of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf's question, to remember that we are discussing the adventitious presence of GMOs which are licensed in the European Union."
"We are not discussing the release of GMOs, but the definition of a further quality standard in the marketing of conventional seed."
"Parliament adopted the proposal for a regulation on the traceability and labelling of GMOs or genetically modified food and feedingstuffs at first reading in June, calling for a threshold value of 0.5%."
"I agree with the Commission here that this value is pitched too low and is impracticable."
"A tolerance threshold of 1% for the adventitious presence of GMOs in non-GM products is realistic."
"In setting threshold values for seed, which is what we are discussing here, the Commission has to take due account of Parliament's and the Council's suggested thresholds in the procedure mentioned."
"The threshold values for the adventitious presence of GMOs need to be coordinated in the two texts."
"I should also like to stress that uncontrolled reproduction represents another particular and potential source of GMOs in food and feed."
"Reproduction seed is not subject to any mandatory quality testing and is not therefore tested for the presence of GMOs."
"That needs to be made perfectly clear here."
"The Commission's biotechnology strategy sets the coexistence of various types of cultivation as an important priority."
"Coexistence is only possible if we have reasonable threshold values as, technically, wind-borne pollen can never be discounted in nature."
"One hundred percent purity was never possible for biological reasons and never will be in the future."
"Threshold values for product purity are standard and necessary in numerous industries."
"In the organic farming sector, for example, there is a threshold value of 5%."
"That means that products labelled as organic products may contain up to 5% of certain non-organic ingredients."
"I say that for the benefit of the Greens."
"The important criterion must be that the statutory framework is practicable."
"More importantly, it must be in keeping with WTO rules and must not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe by tying it up in unnecessary red tape."
"Mr President, of course the questions and the statistics by our Green colleagues are loaded and selective."
"Can I therefore ask if the Commission agrees that a Eurobarometer survey shows that 75% of Europeans favour basic research aimed at new technologies which help knowledge to progress?"
"Is it true that, according to Eurobarometer surveys, 48% of Europeans agree or strongly agree that GM is useful in food production for improved nutrition and for improving shelf life or taste, despite the emotive campaign by the Greens to convince them of the contrary?"
"Not only are these campaigns emotionally charged, they muster distorted and misleading information to support their ultimately untenable and irrational opposition to the new technology of genetically modified crops."
"I wish they would be honest enough to recognise that there are at least some benefits."
"I believe that these actual benefits, not to mention the potential benefits, substantially outweigh any risks."
"Yes, there are always potential risks in any new technology product or process."
"We are challenging the frontiers of knowledge, but we have safeguards in place."
"We require exhaustive testing and trials in laboratory and field."
"But the opponents do not want proof."
"They condone obstruction and destruction of these trials."
"Will they deny that GM crops have major environmental benefits?"
"Not only do they reduce production costs, they also cut back on the use of energy, pesticides and herbicides and reduce CO2 emissions."
"Though their opponents are still grasping at straws, it is clear from experience in America and elsewhere that the environment benefits."
"In Europe we can perhaps afford the luxury of denying ourselves the food productivity benefits which GM crops offer, but do our Green colleagues not consider the interests of their fellow human beings in sub-Saharan Africa or East Asia to whom GM crops will bring nutrition and health benefits and may even help them survive?"
"Do they consider the effect that turning our backs on this advance will have on our scientific base and researchers, on our farmers and farm workers' jobs?"
"On thousands of jobs in the food processing industry?"
"On the price of food as well as the quality and the variety available to our consumers?"
"Yes, European consumers are entitled to be able to choose what food they buy and eat."
"We must protect our environment as best we can, but we also owe it to our constituents to be frank and honest about the risks and benefits."
"It is accepted that an organic label indicates 95% organic, i.e. up to 5% not organic."
"Why make the non-GMO label almost unobtainable by specifying unachievable levels of purity?"
"I could well accept that premise, with the mischievous intention of making non-GMO so rare that no one could afford it."
"Then everyone will be forced to come to terms with the real world, where there will always be the possibility of some adventitious GM content."
"Mr President and Mr Purvis, I know one thing and that is that the GMO issue will give me grey hairs."
"We know from Eurobarometer opinion polls that most people are worried about GMOs."
"At the same time, they say that they do not know enough about them."
"Perhaps there is a connection."
"I would like to say to Mrs Breyer that we have looked at those concerns very carefully to ensure that we establish clear legislation - a clear framework - for handling both the potential benefits and the risks of GMOs."
"That is why we have revised Directive 18/2001/EC to include better risk assessment and better information, so that consumers can make an informed choice."
"That is why we have proposed further legislation on traceability and labelling."
"However, it would not be honest to say that if we continue to import seeds, for example, we can guarantee total purity and no adventitious presence of GMOs."
"We know that everything in nature escapes - through cross-pollination for example - so closing borders is not a viable solution."
"We have to be pragmatic and establish levels and thresholds to deal with natural phenomena."
"We have to look at the situation as it actually is and at the products we import."
"This leads me to Mr Trakatellis' question about traceability."
"The proposals on traceability and labelling, as well as on food and feed, are not based entirely on the detectability of GMOs."
"Even if they cannot be detected, consumers have the right to know."
"The current Novel Foods Regulation will be replaced by these proposals and the scope will be broadened to give consumers a choice, even if the GMOs are not detectable. Consumers have the right to be informed of the presence of GMOs in the products they buy, even if the GMOs are not detectable."
"I shall comment on two further issues that have been raised."
"Firstly, on labelling thresholds, the Commission can only take account of existing legislation and, for the time being, a 1% threshold is in force for foodstuffs."
"This 1% threshold is provided for by the Council regulation, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 49/2000."
"Above that 1% threshold, an indication of the presence of a genetic modification in a food is compulsory."
"As the recital of the regulation states, the 1% value best serves the purpose of establishing a tolerance level which simultaneously remains low and takes into account the necessary feasibility along the production chain."
"All these factors along the production chain are involved."
"The seeds thresholds are based on this 1% threshold."
"You have to count backwards in order to reach this 1% threshold."
"A recital of the draft Commission directive on seeds provides that, should the food threshold change, the thresholds for seeds would need to be reconsidered accordingly."
"On the coexistence issue, the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies is carrying out a study entitled 'Scenarios for Coexistence of Genetically Modified, Conventional and Organic Crops in European Agriculture', commissioned by the Agriculture Directorate-General and coordinated by the Joint Research Centre."
"The main aim of the study is to assess the consequences arising from an increase in the cultivation of GM crops in the European Union in the context of coexistence."
"The study aimed to identify the source and estimated levels of adventitious presence of GM crops in non-GM crops at farm level, identify and assess changes in farming practices that could reduce adventitious presence below policy relevant thresholds and estimate the costs of relevant changes in farming practices, monitoring systems and potential insurance systems."
"The study confirms that cross-pollination and coexistence are issues that need to be considered in relation to agricultural production in general."
"The results of the study need to be interpreted with caution."
"Only three crops were analysed: oilseed rape for seed production, maize for feed use and potatoes for human consumption."
"The results are derived from models and have not been validated by real field data."
"Therefore this study provided preliminary conclusions but the hypothetical results need to be confirmed and further research will be done."
"The Commission is discussing this and coordinating with the various directorate-generals."
"This debate will certainly continue."
"This is a very complex and sensitive issue, legally, technically and politically."
"As I said earlier, we readily admit that we do not have all the answers."
"However, what we can do - as we have done with other technologies - is to put in place a legal framework to deal with the potential benefits as well as the risks."
"That is what we have tried to do with the revised Directive 18/2001/EC, traceability and labelling."
"Consequently it will, for example, affect thresholds when it comes to seed regulation."
"I thank you for this debate and I am sure we shall continue it at a later date."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The next item is the debates on cases of violation of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The next item is the debate on the following five motions for resolutions on the International Criminal Court:"
"B5-0546/2002 by Mr Sakellariou and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the General Affairs Council's position concerning the International Criminal Court;"
"B5-0549/2002 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the International Criminal Court;"
"B5-0553/2002 by Mr Oostlander, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the International Criminal Court;"
"B5-0557/2002 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the International Criminal Court;"
"B5-0561/2002 by Mrs Frassoni and Mr Wuori, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the International Criminal Court."
"Mr President, the aim of this report is to call upon the Council of the European Union to fulfil the commitments it has made as regards the ratification and effective establishment of the European Criminal Court."
"Credit is due to the Danish Presidency for having made every endeavour to maintain a united Union position."
"However, the General Affairs Council has assumed a very ambiguous position regarding the possibility of concluding bilateral agreements, following the offensive launched by the current US Administration in an attempt to obtain immunity for all US citizens across the board and the willingness to accept this demand displayed by a number of European countries, including Italy - something which particularly pains me - which, apart from being my native country, was also the first Member State to ratify the Treaty of Rome."
"I would therefore like to stress how shameful it is that the United States should have gone so far as to resort to threatening to impose sanctions on the countries which have ratified or intend to ratify the International Criminal Court Statute, and emphasise that there can be no agreements allowing those who have debased themselves by committing crimes against humanity or genocide to do so with impunity."
"Since the Rome Statute does not allow for derogations from this requirement, any agreement to that effect is to be deemed not to be compatible."
"That applies to the 15 Member States, but also to the countries which are going to join the Union and the countries with which the Union enjoys relations."
"The Council therefore needs to make every effort to hold a frank dialogue with the US Administration and to present to us a report stating a clear position on the compatibility of any potential bilateral agreements with the Rome Statute, before the Copenhagen European Council takes place."
"Mr President, the United States' refusal to ratify the International Criminal Court is indicative of its pride, but also of the ridiculous, hypocritical nature of the Court."
"It is supposed to give substance to the concept of international, immanent justice which can punish, if not prevent, genocide and crimes against humanity."
"Even with one International Criminal Court conducting an investigation into a few crooks who bear a large part of the responsibility for the massacres in the former Yugoslavia and another conducting an investigation into the genocide in Rwanda, however, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that all those guilty of offences which are just as serious will be prosecuted."
"How likely is it that the politicians and economic profiteers of the former colonial Belgian power, who consciously set the Tutsis and the Hutus against each other, will be prosecuted?"
"Will the French leaders be prosecuted, those leaders whose troops in Rwanda were present, holding their fire at the massacres unleashed by the government in office, when they did not make matters worse by supplying weapons to either side?"
"Will the United Kingdom be prosecuted for its part in the political man?uvres which played such a major role in the ethnic massacres in Sierra Leone?"
"How likely is it that George Bush, who is preparing, openly and publicly, to bombard tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians with the excuse that he is punishing their dictator, will be prosecuted before the Court for crimes against humanity?"
"How likely is it that the industrial groups which, thanks to the gung-ho activities of politicians, are free to derive considerable profits from the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction, will be prosecuted?"
"Well then, the only effect of the International Criminal Court will be to add a touch of hypocrisy to an imperialist world where the strongest have the last word."
"Mr President, we must maintain the integrity of the Rome Statute and be instrumental in getting the International Criminal Court up and running as soon as possible. That is why it is unacceptable for the American Government to undermine the Court by trying to enter into bilateral agreements with EU countries or candidate countries."
"I am pleased that the Danish Presidency has worked hard to maintain a common EU position, and I am sorry that no such position has come about."
"The Council has to a large extent given in to American pressure, and I want, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to call upon the national parliaments in the EU and in the candidate countries to keep a close eye on what their governments are doing so that the Rome Statute is not weakened."
"As is well known, the United States signed the statute, but has withdrawn its signature."
"I hope that the Council will embark upon a new dialogue with the American Government concerning the recognition of the International Criminal Court, which all the Member States and most of the candidate countries have now ratified."
"The EU and the United States share the same basic values."
"Both parties profess freedom and democracy and the defence of human rights and the principles of the rule of law."
"That is why the United States, which will be able to contribute in a particularly positive way to the Court and to the way it operates, should be among the signatories of the Rome Statute."
"Since 1998, the EU has tried to accommodate American anxieties in relation to certain provisions of the Statute, but its efforts have unfortunately been in vain."
"It is unfortunate, moreover, that the United States does not now intend to be a party to the statute which, as I say, it in fact signed during the Clinton administration."
"The United States' decision is wrong, and we must all regret the American measures."
"We must therefore hope that the United States can be convinced to adopt a more positive line once the Criminal Court has in practice had the opportunity to show that it operates in accordance with the highest standards of the rule of law and does not allow itself to be misused for political purposes."
"Mr President, this debate on the International Criminal Court has gone from one extreme to another."
"We heard one extreme earlier, in Mrs Cauquil's speech."
"Mrs Cauquil, I must say to you in all honesty that we do not want an international revolutionary tribunal."
"Putting forward theses such as yours is a sure-fire way of scuppering the whole idea of a criminal court."
"On the other hand - and here I do agree with you - we do not want a criminal court to be no more than a rubber stamp in the hands of the major powers."
"I am really sorry that the forces that, even if they are not willing or able to prevent this court completely, want to downgrade it to some sort of rubberstamp are gaining ground in the USA and China and Russia and other countries."
"We in the European Union are going the way of the law and I think that this forms part of a good and important tradition."
"The Council of Europe was founded as a human rights community here in Strasbourg over 50 years ago."
"The Human Rights Convention was adopted and the Court of Human Rights was created here in Strasbourg."
"For the last 50 years, the European Parliament has sat here in Strasbourg as the voice of the people, as the voice of the European rule of law and because we want to extend this rule of law to the whole continent, we quite deliberately set the idea of the Copenhagen criteria, democracy and the rule of the law, at the spearhead of the historic enlargement process, which is now approaching its culmination."
"This is a consequence of our history, which has, unfortunately, seen its own share of genocide, expulsion, disenfranchisement, suppressed minorities and crimes against humanity."
"We have no right to play teacher to the rest of the world, as we sometimes do, unless we take our own rule of law seriously."
"That does not just mean respecting the rule of law internally, it also means being the strong partner for others throughout the world, when it comes to the worldwide rule of law."
"The criminal court, like our founding treaty, was born in Rome and the idea of Rome is somehow bound up with the concept of law."
"The Rome Statute underlying the criminal court should not be undermined, weakened or watered down."
"If we do not want the courts needed for genocide and recurrent crimes against humanity to be wrongly denigrated as victor's justice or one-off justice, then we need a permanent criminal court to which all are equally subject, large and small states alike, whatever the nationality of the perpetrator or criminal."
"That is why we want to hold on to this Statute as it stands."
"We are severely critical of the Council of the European Union for skimping on clarity and dignity here, for repeatedly trying to get by with devious manoeuvres and for repeatedly giving in to the powers that be."
"If Europe wants to take itself seriously, it must fight for this criminal court and must say to the United States of America that they are indeed our most important ally, but that just such an ally has a duty within the free world to take the law seriously, however uncomfortable it may find it."
"We do not need more unilateralism in response to 11 September; we need to strengthen the rule of law throughout the world, which is why we are calling for fast, undiluted ratification of the Rome Statute."
"Mr President, the last time we debated this, in answer to my question, the President-in-Office confirmed that agreements under Article 98(2) are compatible with the Rome Statute and indeed are foreseen in the Rome Statute."
"I am therefore slightly surprised at the negative text of the resolution we have before us and at some of the contributions to the debate, because the General Affairs Council surely produced a very good outcome - European solidarity was confirmed."
"It was a good example of how the common foreign and security policy works in bringing Member States together and it preserved the integrity of the International Criminal Court."
"So we should really be welcoming that agreement, particularly as it established the general principles governing any agreement to be signed, including the point made by colleagues that no agreement should be signed if it means that people will enjoy impunity."
"That is specifically ruled out."
"We must recognise the reality: the Americans need to be brought gently along and persuaded that this is not a witch-hunt against American forces, it is about having international law ruling the whole of global politics."
"Mr President, in response to this interesting albeit short debate, I would like to say, on behalf of the Commission, that the European Union is, as we have already heard, firmly committed to the International Criminal Court, which it considers to be a critical development in the quest for international protection and human rights."
"The principles of the Rome Statute, as well as those governing the functioning of the Court, are obviously in line with the principles and objectives of the Union."
"Our commitment is articulated, as Mr Titley just reminded us, in the common positions on the ICC adopted in June 2001 and revised in June 2002."
"It is reflected in the Action Plan on the ICC adopted in May of this year and the conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council as recently as 20 September."
"These decisions all give clear evidence of the European Union's continuing support for the Rome Statute and for an effective International Criminal Court."
"Consistent with that is the fact that the European Union is actively committed to ensuring the widest possible signature, ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute."
"To that end, between 1995 and 2001, the Commission's European initiative for democracy and human rights financed nearly EUR 7 million in projects with this purpose in various parts of the world."
"An additional EUR 6 million is earmarked for projects in 2002/2003."
"As well as continuing to encourage all states that have not already done so to sign, ratify and adopt implementing legislation for the Rome Statute as soon as possible, we also encourage all states to respond to Washington's request for immunity agreements in a manner which is consistent with the Rome Statute."
"The conclusions and guiding principles adopted by the Council on 30 September provide guidance on the ways to ensure that such responses preserve the integrity of the International Criminal Court, which is absolutely fundamental and vital."
"The European Union also wants all states which have ratified the Rome Statute to be actively involved in nominating and electing the chief prosecutor and judges of the International Court."
"This should be done in a manner consistent with the process and criteria established by the Rome Statute and the resolution of the first assembly of states parties."
"I am grateful for this opportunity to set out the position of the Commission and the European Union."
"Mr President, pursuant to Article 142, I should like to ask the Bureau how, under Article 50 of our Rules of Procedure we will be discussing a matter such as the dialogue with Iran in the field of human rights?"
"What does this have to do with urgent cases of breaches of human rights?"
"This has nothing to do with the provision of Article 50(1)."
"The motion tabled by the Socialist Group, concerning the stoning of women, a frequent practice in Iran, which is even inflicted on girls of 9 years old, made perfect sense."
"This is something I fail to understand, Mr President."
"I wish, however, to ask the Bureau a second question: If we are going to look at the dialogue on human rights between Iran and the European Union;"
"I should like the Bureau to clarify the precise meaning and scope of this debate, because according to the Iranian authorities and according to what we can read about the dialogue on the Internet, what they are saying is that Islam is being persecuted in Europe, particularly in the United Kingdom."
"It is there, in print."
"I should like to have clarification of this matter."
"Mr Casaca, I would remind you that it is the Conference of Presidents which establishes our agenda, after which it is approved by the plenary, and that it is then, and only then, that Members may express their objections."
"I am afraid you have waited too long to express your objections and I urge you to do so earlier next time."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately after the debates, at about 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the debate on the following six motions for resolutions concerning the 'Human Rights' dialogue with Iran:"
"B5-0548/2002 by Mr Ford and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on death by stoning;"
"B5-0551/2002 by Mrs Frahm and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the 'Human Rights' dialogue with Iran;"
"B5-0552/2002 by Mr Belder, on behalf of the EDD Group, on the 'Human Rights' dialogue with Iran;"
"B5-0554/2002 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Gahler, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the 'Human Rights' dialogue with Iran;"
"B5-0556/2002 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on Iran;"
"B5-0559/2002 by Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on executions and stoning in Iran."
"Before giving the floor to the authors of these motions for resolutions, I would point out, ladies and gentlemen, that we are extremely behind schedule."
"If you want the House to be able to express itself by voting on your scintillating speeches, I would ask you to genuinely respect your speaking time."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of the Socialist Group in this debate on a resolution that has jointly been tabled by five groups."
"This clearly expresses our joint concerns about the executions of women and, more rarely, men by the cruel and barbaric practice of stoning and about the sharp rise in the use of the death penalty in Iran over the past two years."
"Seventy-five people died in 2000, 139 in 2001 and so far this year 250."
"We note the letter of 23 October from the Iranian ambassador to the EU, assuring us that there have been no cases of stoning in recent months and that directives have been issued by the competent authorities for the cessation of this process and are being observed."
"Nevertheless, we are not entirely reassured while sentences of death by stoning continue to be passed and while the use of the death penalty more generally continues to grow."
"The European Parliament and the EU generally protest against the use of the death penalty throughout the world, whether it be in the United States, China, Japan or anywhere else, and Iran is no exception."
"Nevertheless, we recognise that sections of Iranian society are trying to move on."
"Forces of progress who want to see a less cruel form of Islamic society exist and they are growing in numbers."
"This resolution does not threaten talks between the EU and Iran regarding future trade and cooperation agreements, though it is clear that this will include a human rights clause."
"The European Parliament, which has to approve such agreements, will watch with close attention."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a government that has presided over the execution of over 250 people since January 2002, including 27 since 30 September alone - the day on which negotiations were held between the EU and Iran; one which, secondly, includes a woman such as the advisor to President Khatami, a woman who has said that stoning is a legitimate and defensible method of protecting family values; thirdly, one that sentences human rights activists such as Nasser Zarafshan to years in prison - such a government deserves the label 'inhumane regime' and must be condemned in the strongest terms."
"I do of course endorse the material need for dialogue between the European Union and Iran."
"However, I simply cannot understand why negotiations on a cooperation and trade agreement between the European Union and Iran should begin on 29 October."
"Parliament has called on numerous occasions for cooperation agreements or financial aid to be suspended or frozen when human rights are being violated."
"So why are we applying this double standard?"
"The Council decided on 22 October, just two days ago, not to table a human rights resolution on Iran at the next sitting of the UN Commission on Human Rights."
"I find that totally unacceptable."
"I cannot but wonder if the reason for not wanting to expose the Iranian Government now is that it does not square with the policy on Iraq?"
"We in the Confederal Group of the United European Left/Nordic Green Left support the joint motion, although it does represent a shift from the real resolution on human rights to a composite resolution on human rights plus cooperation between the European Union and Iraq, but we think that parts of items 4 and 5 are wrong for the reasons I have mentioned and we have therefore applied for a split vote."
"I really would be delighted if the hope reflected by this common motion were to be fulfilled, by which I mean if an end to human rights violations in Iran were to give us cause for optimism."
"However, present circumstances alone give me no cause whatsoever for any such belief, which is why we must raise our voices, at any rate here in Parliament."
"Mr President, first of all a point of parliamentary self-criticism."
"As far as I can see, this draft resolution seems to be remiss on one particular point from an editorial point of view."
"The four Iranian women condemned to death by stoning have not been fully named with first names and surnames - see the end of Paragraph 3."
"Of the four names mentioned, for example, two at least would be considered to be generally used as first names."
"I therefore propose a correction to the text for the sake of the case of these condemned women."
"Speaking metaphorically, the dialogue with the Islamic Republic of Iran on human rights is very much an uphill struggle."
"From the European perspective, we have to guard against being responsible for obstructing the way ourselves."
"Any hand extended by Iran is therefore welcome."
"We welcome particularly the valuable gesture made by the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Kharrazi, to an ad hoc delegation visit of this Parliament on 20 July, who wanted direct contact between representatives of the Iranian legal system and EU lawyers."
"I would like to see the Council and the Commission seize this offer as quickly as possible."
"After all, the Iranian sentences, which have been rightly challenged, can be dealt with by this motion for a resolution at a correct and conclusive level."
"The chance of this type of contact should also be seized upon in order to oppose the barbaric sharia punishment of stoning."
"For let there be no misunderstanding with regard to Europe's position towards Iran."
"We cannot and will not live with a system which condones stoning fellow human beings, wherever this may be."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for Iran, I support the joint motion for a resolution."
"Dialogue with Iran is important, but our main concern, as the European Parliament, is for a human rights dialogue."
"As parliamentary representatives, we are free from diplomatic constraints when it comes to demanding this universal principle, which is why we say loud and clear to any country concerned that we reject the death penalty in general."
"As far as the rise in the number of death sentences carried out in Iran compared with previous years is concerned, I should like to state here how I evaluate the situation."
"Conservative forces within both formal and informal structures are obviously using death sentences carried out or corporal punishment inflicted to intimidate both the people and the liberal forces in parliament and other societal institutions."
"It has nothing to do with Islam or the Koran."
"Because internal pressure is increasing, so is repression."
"That is why we must stick to the demonstrable facts in all our criticism and check every allegation, irrespective of its source."
"That is why I am against overloading the resolution with allegations which, in the final analysis, we cannot prove, thereby undermining our own credibility."
"People have been sentenced to be stoned to death."
"We have proof that two of these sentences were carried out in the first half of 2001, but not for 25 September 2002."
"Let us therefore make use of Iran's readiness to discuss all human rights issues, including individual cases, without preliminary conditions, as expressed in talks with the EU-Iran Human Rights Exploratory Experts mission at the beginning of the month."
"I still worry that the Council has drawn the short straw by officially refraining from tabling the annual human rights resolution on Iran at the United Nations."
"It is not the Presidency that deserves to be criticised here, but the usual suspects who feel their plans may be upset."
"What we do say is that it is good that they want to talk; let us hold a comprehensive dialogue and, if we see improvements, only then should we refrain from tabling new resolutions in due course."
"There can be no upfront concessions at the expense of human rights."
"Given the situation, we should clearly remind the structures in question in Iran - and in my view the Council and Commission as well - of one thing."
"A negotiated agreement will only come about with Parliament's assent and the issues to which we shall be paying particular attention are those I have just addressed."
"Modernisation currently taking place within Iran is still not leading to an improvement in the human rights situation."
"Barbaric punishments are still being carried out."
"The backward and medieval practice of stoning still forms part of its criminal justice system."
"Individuals are publicly hanged, hands are chopped off for minor transgressions and eyes are even put out without anaesthetic."
"Women are predominantly the victims of this inhuman judicial procedure."
"If Iran is serious about opening itself up to the West, if it is serious about a dialogue with the European Union, then this violation of human rights has to stop."
"The extreme nature of the sharia represents an insurmountable obstacle for normal relations."
"There can be no question of a trade and cooperation agreement with Europe as long as the human rights situation is not resolved."
"The negotiators working on behalf of the European Union have to make this very clear right from the start."
"Does Commissioner Kinnock agree with me on this?"
"Clearly we cannot abandon a condemnation resolution in the UN if Iran continues with its evil infringement of universal principles."
"This is not a question of a successful human rights dialogue with the EU as was suggested, but of a successful abolition of barbaric methods."
"The European Union cannot afford to isolate Iran."
"It is very important for reformists to be supported in their battle for a democratic and more humane Iran."
"The younger generation wants change and offers hope."
"Unfortunately the Iranian authorities do not know how to handle the situation."
"But there is no substitute for openness and democratisation."
"Modernisation can only triumph if barbaric practices and an evil past are brought to an end."
"Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately what Mr van den Bos is saying is not presented clearly in this joint motion for a resolution and that is why we have not signed it."
"As long as Khatami's adviser on women's affairs considers stoning to be a measure which underpins the family, we can only consider this to be truly horrible."
"Since our resolution of 13 December 2001, 250 people have been executed in Iran, and 75 the previous year."
"How can they speak about progress!"
"It does not look as if the human rights situation is improving."
"I find that the motion for a resolution placed before us for our vote is not sufficiently clear."
"Despite the visit by a European delegation in connection with human rights, there were still five public executions on 30 September."
"We therefore condemn the European Council's decision not to introduce a resolution about human rights in Iran before the next sitting of the UN Comission on Human Rights in Geneva."
"We want to state clearly and unambiguously that this resolution must be introduced before the next sitting."
"We want to say in all clarity that the European Parliament cannot assume that we can discuss cooperation agreements if there is no real improvement to the situation on human rights in Iran and that is why we have not signed."
"Mr President, Iran is a large and important country with an ancient tradition of culture and learning going back to the pre-Islamic Zoroastrian period."
"It is also a country with which the West has had troubled relations over a number of years."
"In rejecting Western consumerist values, Iran radicalised itself and supported radical Islamic groups in Lebanon, such as Hizbollah."
"There is added complexity because the conflicts with the West have long been bound up with internal disagreements within Iran itself."
"Recent years have seen a growing awareness within Iran that this isolation was harmful to Iranian interests and leading nowhere."
"The result has been a thaw in relations which we should welcome in the EU."
"Our relations will depend on fundamental progress in the areas of human rights and illegal immigration, weapons of mass destruction, in particular the country's nuclear weapons programme, drugs, the Middle East, Afghanistan and the battle against terrorism."
"With regard to drug trafficking, the Iranians, who have a very serious drug problem of their own, should be commended for their efforts and cooperation."
"They have also resisted the temptation to destabilise Afghanistan and have indicated they will not attempt to foment instability in Iraq in the event of Saddam Hussein's departure from the scene."
"Iran needs regional stability, and this has been recognised by the Iranian leadership."
"On the Middle East, Iran has joined Saudi Arabia in accepting the principle of 'land for peace', if that is what the Palestinians want."
"All of these developments are important and very welcome."
"Iran needs to understand that Europe is extending the hand of friendship and that ways can be found to live together without Iran losing either its identity or its opposition to the worst of Western values."
"It would be wrong for the European Union to overstress the issue of capital punishment per se, which remains legal, if used appropriately, in international law."
"It is practised in the world's largest democracies such as the USA, Japan and India and is supported by tens of millions of citizens in my country, the UK."
"Iran's leaders, however, should be in no doubt about the universal horror felt by us about the barbaric and medieval Sharia punishment of stoning to death."
"I urge the Iranian leadership to reflect on this and to find solutions commensurate with Iran's dignity and history."
"Mr President, sadly, it cannot be denied that there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of executions in Iran in the past year."
"The practice of stoning men and, in particular, women, not only continues to be provided for by law but is frequently applied, as is shown by the many death sentences already pronounced."
"As we are aware, in the coming months, a further four women will be stoned under a legislative framework which forces an oppressive, discriminatory system of control on women."
"As far as respect for fundamental rights is concerned, the deterioration of the situation in Iran has been pointed out and emphasised by a number of organisations as well as a UN General Assembly resolution and the most recent report produced by the Special Representative of the UN Human Rights Commission on Iran."
"Now, in the dialogue taking place between the European Union and Iran, the Union's exploratory mission did indeed record willingness on the part of the Iranian Government to discuss human rights issues, including specific cases, but this verbal expression of good will has not been borne out by any practical measure."
"Quite the opposite: the situation seems to be deteriorating."
"Although it is true that we must welcome signs of cooperation from the Iranian Government, we also need to realise that the increase in executions and the continued stonings are a negative sign for the Union, which cannot accept them out of respect for its own Charter of Fundamental Rights and the international conventions."
"It is therefore imperative that, at all stages of the current dialogue, the Union makes clear that it is an absolute necessity that Iran guarantees respect for fundamental rights, especially women's rights, and that it reiterates the need for Iran to abolish the death penalty, the practice of stoning and all other inhuman or debasing practices."
"There were many of us, not only here in Europe but throughout the world, who put our faith in President Khatami."
"That applied above all, of course, to the Iranian people."
"We all hoped that he would be able to lead Iran onto a more democratically open and tolerant path."
"Unfortunately, we have all, time after time after time, been disappointed."
"The latest reports are frightening."
"Journalists, intellectuals and critics of the regime disappear and are tortured, imprisoned and put on trial for trivial reasons."
"The death penalty is frequently applied."
"In that respect, Iran is one of the world's worst offenders."
"The latest reports of women having been stoned to death according to ancient sharia laws are utterly hair-raising."
"The fact that this is happening in 2002 is completely unacceptable."
"A whole world turns in abhorrence upon Iran."
"Relations between the EU and Iran are characterised by a certain amount of caution, which is good."
"If these relations are to become meaningful, the issue of human rights must always be at the top of the agenda, however."
"I would also draw attention to the fact that Parliament has its veto when it comes to acknowledging possible agreements, and this is something we shall use if the situation does not improve."
"Mr President, we too protest against the sentences inflicted on many Iranian women, against the disgraceful sentence of death by stoning and against the two-fold oppression of women by the dictatorship of mullahs."
"We will vote for the resolution on the table in the hope that it will put pressure on the leaders of these countries and induce them to put an end to these barbaric practices."
"The dictatorship of mullahs is not the only regime under which women are barbarically oppressed, however."
"This is also the common practice of numerous regimes which the major powers consider to be their allies and on which they have the means to exert effective pressure, starting with Saudi Arabia and some of the oil emirates in the region."
"I also protest against the barbarity of the death penalty and against obscurantism, even when it is not practised by primitive religions but by the leaders of the principal world superpower, which has the gall to set itself up as the defender of civilisation."
"Mr President, it is true that President Khatami inspired hope concerning human rights in Iran, hopes that he himself crushed a long time ago, however."
"Now, he is demonstrating good will in the light of the trade agreement with the EU."
"We do not need good will, however; we need results."
"I agree with all my fellow MEPs who have said that we cannot enter into any trade agreement with Iran."
"It would be completely schizophrenic, on the one hand, to say that we want to see a strongly critical resolution in the UN and, on the other hand, to enter into a trade agreement with the same country."
"Let us think for a moment."
"Of course we must embark upon the critical dialogue with Iran, and if this yields fruit in terms of our no longer seeing stonings or barbaric death penalties and sentences in Iran, then we can of course begin to pave the way for trade agreements."
"Not a moment before, however."
"Mr President, I hope that discussions on Iran will take place soon in the form of a dialogue between parliamentary committees and that an association agreement will be signed and implemented as a result."
"Both sides need to make an effort if we are to achieve this objective."
"On our side, we need to show we are willing to acknowledge the history of this vast country, as well as its present situation and the natural and socio-economic factors which shape it from both within and without."
"We need to set an example and show our confidence in the leaders and people of Iran, the charming, dignified, talented people of Iran looking forward to democracy and reform, witness the hope they still place in President Hatami, who really is fighting to bring about changes in their theocratic regime."
"On Iran's side, its leaders must realise that the West, and the European Union in particular, will only open up to and work with the developing world if it respects human rights; these are not values Europe wishes to impose, they are ecumenical values and they include women's rights, which are particularly prone to abuse."
"Communication and dialogue will help here."
"So let us continue and strengthen this dialogue and signal once again, via this resolution, that we shall not waver from our principles and values and that this will be reflected in the preparations for and final text of the association agreement."
"May I state, as coordinator of the European People's Party in the Committee on Women's Rights, that we are giving this matter serious attention."
"We are planning a fact-finding mission with our opposite numbers and representatives of civil society and we shall lobby for the final text of the agreement, if it comes to that, to include a clear, express clause on women's rights."
"Mr President, I should like to express my gratitude to honourable Members for tabling this motion for a resolution."
"Naturally, the Commission continues to be concerned by the human rights situation in Iran and, in particular, by the persistence of repressive measures against democratic institutions, civil society and the media."
"The prevalence of arbitrary arrests, torture, discrimination against minorities and evident lack of the rule of law are all deeply disturbing."
"The all-too-plentiful evidence of the use of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments, including the appalling stoning of children, of women and of men, continue to demonstrate the scarcity of civilised standards."
"The most effective way to raise these concerns is through the half-yearly comprehensive dialogue meetings, bilateral talks at ministerial level and similar sustained activities."
"In addition, avenues for more direct and specific dialogue have been explored recently by the troika, as several Members said."
"On 21 October the GAERC endorsed the strategy for starting a human rights dialogue with Iran on the basis of the recommendations of the exploratory troika mission that visited Teheran from 30 September to 1 October last."
"During these explanatory talks, the Iranian Government voiced a political will to enter into a human rights dialogue and to do so largely on the EU's terms."
"No restrictions were requested in relation to the list of human rights issues to be discussed and the dialogue will be regularly assessed with the help of specific and realistic benchmarks, such as reports from the visits of the United Nations thematics rapporteurs."
"The dialogue would initially take the form of an experimental round table in Teheran in December of this year."
"Its format will be assessed immediately after the first session and could be revised, as necessary, in the spring of 2003."
"The opening of negotiations with Iran on a trade and cooperation agreement, indissolubly linked to instruments on political dialogue and counter-terrorism, gives the European Union substantial leverage, since the progress in the negotiations will be directly related to parallel progress in, among other things, human rights."
"This connection is at the heart of the political package defined at the June Council and formally adopted on 12 July."
"The establishment of a structured EU-Iran dialogue on human rights is obviously not a complete antidote to the variety of deep and serious concerns."
"At this juncture, however, it seems to constitute the most effective available means of promoting our attempts to bring about tangible improvements in the grievous human rights situation in Iran."
"I emphasise that, in all of this, our concerns relate to the basic rights and well-being of human beings, regardless of their faith, regardless of their customs."
"That is the fundamental value that guides us and provides the motivation of the European Union."
"We will continue to act upon those fundamentals."
"Mr President, Commissioner, just one supplementary question."
"Would the Commission be prepared to include the European Parliament in the December round table in Teheran which was mentioned?"
"Mr President, I can certainly make enquiries of my colleagues whose portfolios directly concern this issue."
"I am certain that the Commission, whether Parliament is involved or not, will welcome any reinforcement of its consistent and assiduous efforts to achieve objectives that we know are fully shared by this House."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m., that is if the Members wishing to speak on the final item on the agenda make an effort to be concise."
"The next item is the following six motions for resolution on the situation in Nepal:"
"B5-0545/2002 by Mr Collins, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the situation in Nepal;"
"B5-0547/2002 by Mrs Carrilho and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Nepal;"
"B5-0550/2002 by Mr Vinci, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Nepal;"
"B5-0555/2002 by Mr Thomas Mann, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the situation in Nepal;"
"B5-0558/2002 by Mr van den Bos, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the political situation in Nepal;"
"B5-0560/2002 by Mr Messner and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on Nepal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by expressing our sympathy for the Nepalese people, for whom the last few years have been one of the most difficult periods in their history."
"Nepal's fledgling democracy is shaky and the rule of law is constantly giving way to the arbitrary and to violence."
"Over 3000 people have died in less than a year - which is appalling - following the violent confrontations between the army and the Maoist guerrillas, whose aim is to overthrow the monarchy, apparently against the wish of the population."
"In actual fact, this people has been subjected to a genuine civil war for over six years, and the reaction of the international community has been almost total indifference."
"The difficult situation has just been violently exacerbated by the events which took place at the beginning of this month."
"In announcing the dismissal of the Prime Minister and temporarily assuming the executive powers, something which has not happened since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1990, King Gyanendra has sparked off a major political crisis."
"Indeed, even though he subsequently appointed another Prime Minister, the new Prime Minister has no representative legitimacy and, indeed, the King must be sorely tempted to use the fight against Maoist guerrilla groups to suspend the rule of law and put an end to the period of parliamentary democracy which has prevailed for 12 years."
"These events have destabilised Nepal and thus exacerbated the unrest and instability throughout the region as a whole."
"The European Union can no longer be content just to express good intentions faced with such a situation."
"We must urge the new Prime Minister in the strongest terms possible to resume unconditional dialogue with the Maoist rebels."
"Moreover, it would be desirable, in this respect, for the Council to appoint a special representative for Nepal without delay, who would, if necessary, be able to serve as mediator between the two sides."
"Lastly and most importantly, given that this conflict is largely the result of economic and social problems, we must set aside a substantial amount of financial aid in order to be able to make an effective contribution to the restoration of peace and democracy in this small kingdom when the time comes."
"Mr President, the escalation of force in Nepal is an unacceptable threat to stability in the entire region of the Himalayas."
"The destructive work of the Maoist guerrillas continues unabated."
"In many parts of Nepal there are no longer any schools or hospitals and the infrastructure will be in ruins for years to come."
"Every week we hear of more police officers and civilians murdered."
"The most recent low point was when the famous statue of King Gyanendra was blown up in the middle of Patan, an area that I know well."
"One passer-by was killed and nine others were injured."
"The guerrillas - unlike the majority of the population who are unequivocal in their support - want an end to the constitutional monarchy."
"Over 5 000 people have fallen victim to the violence since 1996."
"It was only last May that the European Parliament conferred with Prime Minister Deuba in Brussels."
"Now the King has sacked him because, contrary to what he said in public, he was in favour of postponing the November elections for a year."
"Bahadur Khadka, whom the King appointed as his successor , and who has already been prime minister twice before, is now heading the transitional government and has announced that he intends to secure peace and stability in the country and start negotiating with the rebels."
"The position of the PPE-DE is perfectly clear."
"Nepal needs the rule of law, pluralism and continuing parliamentary democracy."
"The fight against corruption and nepotism must be stepped up and the postponed elections must be accompanied by effective security measures, so that they can be held as quickly as possible."
"We call on the European Union, across the party political divide, to offer its services as mediator."
"The Council should appoint a special representative for Nepal."
"I hope the Commission shares this position."
"I have acted as vice-chairman of the SAARC delegation for many years and know from my regular contacts with and in Nepal that Europeans are held in high regard."
"We could start acting as honest brokers right now and make an important contribution to the peace that the Nepalese people have long deserved."
"Mr President, it looks as though in Nepal, the very beginning of democracy has been murdered along with King Birendra."
"The current ruler is concentrating all power in his own hands."
"The state of emergency has been replaced by a permanent state of absolute power with no real hope of improvement."
"The rebel movement grows daily because the sense of hopelessness is steadily increasing in the countryside and young people join the rebels."
"They are fighting a corrupt regime which owns 95% of the country's wealth."
"And some of our Member States, including my own, Belgium, are sending weapons to this country."
"In its earlier resolutions, the European Parliament has rightly urged that Europe should make the effort not just to support democracy but also to ensure that a political solution and negotiations can be achieved, but not that more powerful weapons should be delivered allowing even greater repression."
"This contravenes the European code of conduct itself."
"In the last six years alone five thousand people died in Nepal."
"Yesterday, another 25 were killed in various clashes. I do not care which side the victims come from, what concerns me is that we must strive for a peaceful solution, that the only hope we can give this country is developing its land and providing opportunities for its people."
"I therefore hope that you will support our amendments which refer to these points."
"For surely it is unacceptable for there only to be one answer: shooting and killing."
"We do not think that this is acceptable and we ask your support otherwise we will not be able to endorse this resolution, at least as far as I am concerned."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is universally known that human rights are being violated in Nepal."
"This resolution rightly condemns all acts of violence, those perpetrated by the security forces, but also those by the Maoist rebels."
"It rightly presses for mediation and political consultation."
"However, it rightly asks for the underlying causes of the conflict to be addressed, that is, abject poverty, social inequality and marginalised population groups."
"In August, the European Commission provided EUR 615 000 for a peaceful solution to the conflict."
"Against this background, it is unwise to supply murder weapons to Nepal."
"It is also a clear violation of the code of conduct regarding the export of weapons."
"The Flemish Greens clearly state that the conditions for supply are not fulfilled and our party will continue to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Belgian Parliament whether it is still possible to suspend the planned supply of weapons."
"In this sense, this resolution is a more than obvious sign to Mr Michel of a poor, incoherent document."
"The Nepalese need ploughshares, not weapons, Mr Michel."
"Mr President, together with honourable Members, the Commission deplores the increasing number of victims generated by the clashes between Maoists and government forces in Nepal."
"It is particularly concerned by human rights violations both by the insurgents and by counter-insurgency forces in and around the country."
"Observers believe that there cannot be a durable military solution to the crisis and that it is extremely urgent to end a period of political instability caused by endemic rivalries among the different leaders of various political parties."
"The Commission hopes that the designation by the king of the new Prime Minister, Mr Chand, as head of an interim caretaker government, will give the necessary impetus to rebuild the national consensus, including efforts to improve governance, allow free and fair elections as soon as possible and re-open the dialogue with the Maoist insurgents."
"Ongoing consultations with political parties should help to complete the formation of the new government From it, we expect tangible initiatives to foster multi-party dialogue and the implementation of urgent measures to fight the underlying socio-economic causes of conflict to which Mr Staes and other Members have rightly referred."
"Within the context of its cooperation activities, the Commission is ready to provide support to long-term development initiatives, especially for poverty alleviation in critical areas of the mid-western part of Nepal and to provide support to local institutions seeking to strengthen the rule of law and the protection of human rights."
"The Commission calls on the authorities to create the conditions for holding peaceful and democratic elections and to announce new dates for local and parliamentary elections soon."
"Meanwhile, the Commission confirms that the funding foreseen for the planned EU election observer mission will remain committed until December 2003."
"At this juncture, these are all the feasible and practical undertakings we can give to try and resolve an appalling and long-lasting bloody situation."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed immediately to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 5 40 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 24 October 2002."
"On 31 October 2002, a violent earthquake hit the region of Molise in Italy which resulted in the destruction of some villages and claimed the lives of a number of people."
"In particular the small town of San Giuliano di Puglia was destroyed and a school collapsed killing 29 people, 26 of whom were children."
"The entire primary class of children born in 1996 was killed under the rubble of that disaster."
"Many of the families are now left homeless with winter approaching."
"All natural disasters and tragic events provoke in us a response of sympathy and kindred feeling for those who have suffered."
"On this occasion, however, throughout Europe and further afield, people were deeply touched at the tragic loss of the lives of so many young children."
"On behalf of the European Parliament I have expressed our sympathy and condolences to the Mayor of San Giuliano di Puglia, to the President of the region of Molise and to the families of the victims."
"I invite you now to observe a minute's silence in their memory."
"(The House rose and observed one minute's silence)"
"I also regret to inform the House that this morning a Luxair plane flying from Berlin to Luxembourg crashed in Niederanven on its approach to Luxembourg Airport, carrying 19 passengers and three crew."
"The initial reports suggest that as many as 17 people have died in this tragic accident."
"Earlier this morning in France, a train en route from Paris to Vienna caught fire near Nancy. Twelve people lost their lives in this tragic accident."
"I would like to inform you that on my own behalf and in the name of the European Parliament, I have expressed to the Luxembourg and French authorities our solidarity with and deepest sympathy for the families of all those involved in these tragic accidents."
"I would also like to inform the House that I have written a letter to the President of the Duma expressing our condemnation of the act of terrorism in the Doubrovka Theatre in Moscow where over 700 people were held hostage."
"I expressed our deep regret at the subsequent loss of life."
"Pursuant to Rule 111a I have received a request from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for the inclusion on the agenda of an extraordinary debate on the seizure of hostages in Moscow and its tragic ending, and on the war in Chechnya."
"Mr Solana will be making a contribution and will include a report on the EU-Russia Summit."
"This matter could be dealt with under this heading."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to say that we agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that this topic is of key importance."
"However, our group does see the need for a thorough and somewhat more systematically-prepared debate to be held during the second November part-session, when we will be discussing relations between Europe and Russia."
"There is obviously, though, no objection at all to the dreadful events in Moscow being specifically mentioned in items 22 and 23 of the resolution on the results of the European Council and to the topic also being raised during the debate with Mr Solana."
"However, we consider it necessary for this topic to be discussed in a more structured way during the second November part-session, but as I said before, we have no objections at all to this point also being discussed in the debate on the results of the European Council and in this afternoon's debate with Mr Solana."
"Mr President, on a point of order: I was somewhat astonished, at 1 p.m. this lunchtime, to learn of the existence of this application by the Greens."
"We are a democratic group, in which decisions are never taken by the chairman acting alone."
"I immediately sent an e-mail to the bureau and to the two co-ordinators, Philippe Morillon and Arie Oostlander, to the effect that we would support this application by the Greens subject to no objection being expressed to me."
"My dear Mr Cohn-Bendit, I would, however, ask you to ensure that, in future, our groups have the time to discuss such an issue in a democratic manner."
"In the absence of any objection from the bureau and the co-ordinators, our group is in favour of taking this topic and Mr Solana's statement together."
"We are agreed therefore that we do not need a vote."
"The matter is simply going to be taken as part of the general debate on Mr Solana's report on foreign policy."
"I certainly agree that it was a horrific attack and I will forward your request to the President."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at its meeting today the Commission adopted a series of measures which, within the framework of the Euratom Treaty, are aimed at achieving a Community approach to the management of nuclear waste and nuclear safety."
"This package consists of a communication, a proposal for a directive defining the general principles and obligations in relation to the safety of nuclear installations in the European Union and a proposal for a directive on the management of radioactive waste."
"The package is supplemented by a draft Council decision authorising the Commission to negotiate an agreement between Euratom and the Russian Federation on the trade in nuclear material."
"I will comment on the reasons for, and the timeliness of, the proposal."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the broad debate on the Green Paper on the security of the energy supply has highlighted the problem of the security of supply in Europe and the role played by nuclear energy in relation to it and our environmental commitments with regard to greenhouse emissions within the framework of the Kyoto agreements and Protocol."
"Furthermore, nuclear energy is currently faced with two challenges, two problems mentioned during this debate: the safety of installations and the treatment of nuclear waste."
"Despite the fact that the Euratom Treaty provides for important measures guaranteeing a high level of safety, above all with regard to non-proliferation, that is, the appropriate use of fissile material and radioactive material, the current situation is not as ideal as we would like."
"Firstly, I must point out that in the various States of the Union there is no equivalent application of nuclear safety standards."
"Secondly, it must be said that, in the negotiations with the candidate countries, we are demanding that the candidate countries comply with certain obligations and behave in a certain way, in the field of nuclear safety, which cannot be compared with anything in the current countries of the Union."
"We are therefore faced with a situation in which there are significant disparities within Europe."
"To a certain extent we are faced with a surprising situation."
"We may, as I have pointed out on other occasions, have complete and detailed legislation on the quality of bathing water in the European Union but, nevertheless, we do not regulate the levels of security required of nuclear installations within the Union."
"But furthermore, as I pointed out, in view of enlargement and the concerns of the European citizens, we must act quickly and decisively."
"We are creating - and there is no other way of putting it - a situation of asymmetry between the candidate countries and the Member States of the Union."
"What is our intention through these proposals?"
"Simply, a new Community vision of nuclear security and the treatment of radioactive waste."
"The first relates to increasing safety in nuclear power stations and the issue of their dismantling."
"We are talking about a proposal for a directive that is not yet approved since its legal basis is Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty and that obliges us to submit this text to a committee of experts, consisting of experts from the different countries of the Union; it is still awaiting this procedure, and then the proposal will be approved definitively so that it can be communicated to Parliament and the Council."
"Now, the proposal we are presenting today has three fundamental axes."
"Firstly, it proposes common rules for nuclear safety; secondly, a Community system for controlling the application of these common rules and thirdly, it guarantees the existence and availability of the funds necessary for the dismantling of nuclear installations."
"The common rules are based simply on the rules of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the headquarters of which is in Vienna, but our proposal provides for something completely innovative. That is that these rules, which within the framework of the Atomic Energy Agency are simply recommendations, thanks to the proposal for a directive, when they come to be adopted - as I hope they will - will become Community rules, and will therefore be binding on all the countries of the Union, with the legal force that Community law always has."
"But furthermore, they are able to evolve and take up the results of the negotiations held over recent years with the candidate countries, negotiations which have allowed these common rules to be developed, which must be complied with, not only by the candidate countries, but also, in the Commission's opinion, by all the countries of the European Union without exception."
"The second fundamental axis consists of how, once we have these common rules, we will control their effective application."
"How can we guarantee to all the citizens that the required standards will be complied with in all the nuclear installations of the European Union?"
"Well that is very simple, ladies and gentlemen, there will be two systems."
"Firstly, control is required of all countries."
"Independent control authorities already exist."
"The control of installations will still be a task for the national competent authorities of each and every Member State of the Union."
"The innovation is that we are establishing a system of auditing crosschecks, promoted and coordinated by the Commission, which will guarantee the appropriate application of the Community rules within the different Member States of the Union."
"But, furthermore, the third element of this proposal for a directive is the definition of Community rules for the creation, management and use of funds for dismantling nuclear power stations, with the aim of guaranteeing that the funds are sufficient and available."
"I would insist that we believe it is essential that these funds are available when they become necessary."
"We therefore propose a series of elements, but essentially the externalisation of these funds or an equivalent means of guaranteeing their availability to prevent them from, for example, in the event of bankruptcy, being included in the bankrupt assets and therefore not being available for their objective of dismantling the installations when the time comes."
"The second directive, ladies and gentlemen, will contribute to the creation of new habits in the management of irradiated fuel and radioactive waste in the Member States of the Union."
"We are not just talking about highly radioactive waste, about waste from reactors, from nuclear power stations or from reactors used in research, but also about radioactive waste from other types of application such as medical or industrial applications, low intensity waste."
"Firstly, we propose a timetable with limit dates so that all the countries of the Union will have appropriate installations prepared and available for the underground storage of high activity waste, because that is currently the safest technology for the storage of that waste."
"In the case of waste of a lesser intensity, there are other types of storage, but in those cases we also propose the availability and establishment of appropriate locations."
"In this regard I would like to congratulate, for example, Finland on having already taken decisions with specific and very immediate dates and timetables, which seems to me to be extremely important."
"I congratulate Finland on the speed of its action."
"But unfortunately other countries are not in such an advanced situation and we therefore propose a limit date."
"We are establishing the possibility that the underground storage of this radioactive waste can be carried out in a manner which involves cooperation between different Member States of the Union."
"We are therefore confronting this thorny problem once and for all."
"Secondly, we believe that this solution, while it is the most suitable today, cannot be considered sufficiently satisfactory and, in this regard, we propose that it is necessary to continue research into the treatment of radioactive waste in order to reduce or possibly even eliminate the existence of this waste."
"The final proposal, Mr President, is a draft Council decision allowing the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Russia relating to the trade in nuclear material."
"This trade has created friction with Russia for some time, for various reasons."
"Enlargement will mean the incorporation of five new States, with twenty-two reactors, in some cases with early closure scheduled; but, in any event, for some time, these reactors will present us with a problem because the current restrictions, in accordance with the Corfu Agreement, will prevent the supply of fuel for these reactors."
"In order to deal with this problem we therefore have to negotiate with Russia."
"All of this must take account of the protection of the European Union companies that carry out enrichment, the protection of consumers, but also the new difficulties the situation may present from the Russian point of view."
"Furthermore, this may open up the possibility for us - and let us hope this is the case - to be able to demand and promote the speedy closure of the oldest nuclear reactors in Russia, some of which may clearly at some point cause problems and which are very close to us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, this package of proposals as a whole is aimed at increasing levels of safety in nuclear power stations and installations within the European Union, which now has fifteen Members, but which will later have twenty-five."
"Increasing the availability of funds in order to guarantee that when the time comes the dismantling necessary to return sites to their original state can be carried out, in other words, so that those places where there are currently nuclear installations may be totally decontaminated, free of all risk."
"We must increase transparency so that the citizens know that, within the European Union, there are a series of rules and levels of security that are guaranteed."
"And we must confront a thorny problem, the problem of waste, above all high activity waste, but also other waste originating from medical or industrial applications."
"We must also try to make progress on resolving the issues, difficulties and differences we have with Russia, but which also affect the future Member States of the Union."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"We have many requests from the floor."
"May I remind colleagues that short, sharp questions are better."
"Mr President, the Commissioner is to be warmly congratulated on the courage with which she has tackled this very difficult problem."
"I would like to make two points."
"First of all, for some of the accession countries, the question of financial provision is a very difficult one."
"Lithuania and Slovakia were specifically mentioned by the Council last week."
"Could the Commissioner tell us how that issue is going to be tackled?"
"Secondly, about a year ago I took the initiative to invite Mr Lacoste, the chairman of the Nuclear Regulators' Association, to come to the Industry Committee."
"I have kept in touch with him since and we have discussed the possibility of him coming to the Parliament to give an annual report on what is happening."
"Could you foresee the inclusion of such a provision in your proposals?"
"Thank you, Mr President."
"For decommissioning of the plant, the Swedish model could perhaps be adopted, in which at the moment the money - SEK 0.02 per kilowatt-hour sold, roughly 0.3 of a euro cent - is sent to the Swedish national bank, where it is kept safe no matter what may happen to the enterprises and is ready to be used for decommissioning."
"With regard to radioactive waste, I would like to mention a specifically Danish problem."
"We have no nuclear reactors of our own, but we do have waste - 200-300 kg of highly radioactive waste - from the time when we thought we were going to make fuel elements."
"If we must dump it in Denmark, as the current rules state, it will cost a very, very great deal. If, on the other hand, Denmark were allowed - under new rules, as indicated by the Commissioner, particularly on cooperation between different countries - to add its 200 kg or so of radioactive waste to the many tonnes of highly radioactive waste from the big countries, I doubt that anyone would object to its doing so."
"This would be advantageous overall to the economy of the EU, although naturally it would be subject to the recipient country in question being happy to receive it."
"That is not an option available to us at present, since each country is obliged to take back its own highly radioactive waste. This makes no sense in the case of small countries, which have only a small amount of medical and other waste."
"Mr President, it is good to speak about these energy issues and go into them in some detail, and good too that we should now include everyone in the same framework for safety standards."
"We must, however, keep a cool head."
"When legislation is being drafted everything must be based on scientific and technical facts, and not political passions."
"The International Atomic Energy Agency is an expert organisation whose level of competence is trusted globally, and it is important that its expert opinion is heard in these connections as well."
"I hope that the Commission will not now create another super-regulator to function alongside the IAEA in the monitoring of these matters, because the IAEA is very important worldwide."
"It is, however, important that standards of safety attained at Union level are so high that we can also demand the same from the applicant countries."
"I should nevertheless like to ask the Commission how it intends to take account of national regulators in preparing this package of directives."
"Energy issues are decided nationally - and that is the way it should be - and the role of national regulators will also be vitally important in the future."
"Mr President, there are already some doubts about the viability of the nuclear industry in a liberalised energy market, as witnessed by the problems of British Energy in the United Kingdom."
"I would like to seek assurances from you today, Commissioner, that in no shape or form can this package be used as a bail-out for the nuclear industry in a way which would prejudice other energy sources and give unfair preference to the nuclear industry in the European energy single market."
"The coverage of the very considerable costs of waste disposal, for instance, should not simply be lifted from the accounting books of companies producing nuclear energy."
"In your statement you said you would now make sure that under no circumstances could decommissioning funds be redirected as cross-subsidies for the commercial operations of nuclear companies."
"Could you confirm that there will be no exceptions whatsoever to that and that under no circumstances can decommissioning funds be used for commercial purposes?"
"Mr President, the Commissioner is working under the constraints of the undemocratic and anachronistic Euratom Treaty."
"Despite this, would you, Commissioner, accept the need for the European Parliament to give an opinion on the two directives and communication which you are presenting to us, particularly on whether or not the case for deep-level storage of highly radioactive waste has been proved?"
"This is contrary to the views of the British Royal Society, which finds that the scientific case has not been made."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the outcome of the European Council of 24 and 25 October 2002 in Brussels."
"I should like to place on the record my personal gratitude to Prime Minister Rasmussen for the level of engagement which he has shown with the European Parliament."
"He set a headline which I hope future presidencies will follow by meeting with the Conference of Presidents prior to the launch of the Danish Presidency."
"Before the summit meeting in Copenhagen he will again meet with the Conference of Presidents."
"Exceptionally, at our part-session in Strasbourg on 19 November 2002 he will contribute to our debate on enlargement in the presence of observer MPs from accession states."
"This is of course in addition to the normal kind of dialogue for which the Prime Minister is here."
"I wish to express my personal gratitude to him on behalf of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by associating myself with the expressions of gratitude to the Presidency and to Parliament."
"The pressure exerted by the three institutions together has made the breakthrough in negotiations possible and enabled us to have a solid expectation that this project, the greatest in our time within the European Union, can, as planned, be brought to completion in Copenhagen in December."
"The post-Brussels political momentum has become even stronger than it was already, and if this Council made anything really visible, it was the shared desire to make a success of this project of uniting Europe, which is becoming ever stronger."
"I would now like, briefly, to give you some information on how things have progressed."
"The President of the Council has already observed that we wasted no time, and that it was as early as Monday last week that we communicated the results to the candidate countries, starting the very next day on a further round of negotiations, which has, in the meantime, been concluded."
"The object of this round of negotiations was to establish which positions on the part of the candidate countries remain unresolved."
"We now have a complete overview of everything and of every single item remaining to be sorted out in the negotiations, and here I have both bad news and good news."
"Let me start with the bad news, which is that there is a great deal more left on the table than we could or should have expected."
"The good news is that none of it is incapable of being sorted out in the timeframe envisaged, so that it seems realistic in terms of the timetable to conclude a second round of negotiations by the time of the General Affairs Council on 18 November, thus getting a very large number of the still unresolved issues out of the way."
"This is then to be rounded off by a final round, leading to the accession conferences immediately prior to the General Affairs Council in Copenhagen."
"Let me conclude with one political observation - one that is of great importance to me."
"In the few weeks remaining to us, it will be of the utmost necessity that negotiations be conducted in an extraordinarily political way."
"No longer can we negotiate as we used to - in a very technical way, often with a very large number of questions going backwards and forwards, but now the setting of clear political priorities and the taking of political decisions really are the order of the day."
"I have to say with some emphasis, that, in past negotiations, we expected a great deal of the candidate countries, and the European Union's positions were not always founded on in-depth understanding of the candidates' problems; rather, they were very often motivated by our own needs."
"I would simply like to remind you that it is not only public opinion in the Member States that has to be taken into account in wrapping up the package for the final negotiations; we also have to bear in mind the fact that the governments and parliaments in the candidate countries have to convince public opinion on their side that joining the European Union is a good thing."
"Let me also point out that the results of the process of transformation that we have already seen in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe have varied to a wide degree."
"In the countries in transition, people enjoy freedoms that were hitherto unknown to them; they enjoy democracy and human rights."
"We should not, though, overlook the fact that it is, as a whole, we who have benefited from the economic advantages and the advantages of stability that these transformations have brought into being."
"It is we who, to date, have benefited most from the transformation of these countries into market economies, a transformation that involved, and continues to involve, serious social hardship for these people."
"Now is the time to send out a clear and unmistakeable signal that we honour the enormous achievements that have come about over the last ten years in societies over there, and to do this by forcing ourselves to adopt a certain generosity as the negotiations move into their final stage."
"This is not about interfering with this or that fundamental principle of Community policy or of the Community method."
"Nothing in what the future Member States seek is fundamental from our point of view, but it can be fundamental to them and to their ability to win the support they need, and so I very much hope that we will all - by which I mean the Council, the Commission, and Parliament - summon up the flexibility that will be needed if the project is to be a success, not only for politicians like us, but most especially for those who really matter - the people in the present and future Member States."
"Mr President, we acknowledge - and thank - Prime Minister Ramussen for his endeavours to inject some ideology into the Brussels European Council, to make its scope wider than the dry, tedious debate on the funds we will need between now and 2006, but, as we know, the discussions held and decisions taken at Brussels revolved around the financial winners and losers, and this, along with the matter of how to avoid penalising countries without losing face, was the focus of the work in Brussels rather than the question of how to establish solidarity within a robust, stable institutional framework."
"In this fairly uninspiring context, we do, in any case, welcome the fact that the decisions taken at Brussels will allow the Union to present its negotiating position to the candidate countries on time."
"However, we cannot hide the fact that the agreements on the common agricultural policy are essentially yet another way of putting off difficult decisions until a later date."
"We can only criticise the Council for not linking the decision on direct payments to a further reform of the CAP and not seeking agreement on the principle of making these payments conditional upon environmental and social requirements, running the risk of perpetuating all those dysfunctional elements and imbalances which make the CAP the most absurd, costly European policy in existence today, harming precisely those small producers of quality produce that we want to reward."
"Moreover, we cannot hide the fact that the candidate countries are not wholly satisfied with the agreements reached in Brussels."
"Indeed, although it is true that, on paper, the Union has undertaken to offset the new countries' obligation to contribute 100% to the Community budget as of day one with compensatory payments and Structural Funds appropriations, it is also true that there is no guarantee that these countries will be able to absorb these resources for high-quality projects quickly, or at least not as quickly and directly as they will have to pay out the money to the Union's budget."
"We would have preferred gradual phasing-in of these countries' contributions to the Community budget, as was the case for Spain and Portugal."
"Quite frankly, the impression is that the new countries will have to fund the United Kingdom's common agricultural policy abatement and that it was only decided at the last moment not to make them contribute to Spain's Structural Funds too."
"As regards the Copenhagen Summit, the Union still has to prove itself."
"As Prime Minister Rasmussen rightly said, enlargement is not yet completely in the bag."
"One further comment, Mr President, on the question of Chechnya."
"We wanted the European Council, in addition to making a few general, salient points on terrorism, to come down clearly in favour of a negotiated end to the Chechen conflict, which is marked by the ongoing violence of the Russian troops, and to condemn the contempt for the hostages' lives and the KGB methods used by the Russian Government to respond to the attack on the Moscow theatre."
"We are extremely concerned at the arrest of Akhmed Zakayev in Copenhagen and the laws restricting the freedom of speech recently adopted by the Duma."
"We hope that the forthcoming EU-Russia Summit on 11 November will focus on these issues."
"Mr President, over the last month, serious momentum has been building up with regard to the process of EU enlargement and the fulfilment of our political vision in this respect."
"In fact, a trinity of events has taken place which has guaranteed that the pace of EU enlargement has accelerated and is now an unstoppable process."
"Firstly, on 9 October 2002, the Commission concluded that 10 candidate countries were in a position to accede to the European Union."
"Secondly, on 19 October 2002, the Irish people approved the provisions of the Treaty of Nice, which ensure that EU enlargement can take place within an agreed timeframe."
"Thirdly, the EU leaders in Brussels on 24 October 2002 endorsed the findings of the European Commission that 10 countries fulfil the necessary political and economic criteria to assume membership of the EU by 2004."
"I welcome the Brussels Summit decision to allow the European Union to present negotiating positions to the candidate countries on all outstanding issues by early November."
"This will ensure that enlargement negotiations can be concluded by the Copenhagen Summit of EU leaders in December 2002."
"A target date of April 2003 has also been set for accession treaties to be signed in Athens under the presidency of the Greek Government."
"There are now elements of both legal and political certainty with regard to the enlargement negotiations."
"We are shortly going to cross the final hurdles so as to bring about the accession of 10 new Member States to the Union."
"The momentum towards EU enlargement is bringing real challenges to the EU institutions in terms of implementing the internal changes as laid down in the Treaty of Nice."
"This includes a range of issues including the extension of qualified majority voting at Council level, the re-weighting of votes in the Council, the extension of codecision measures to the European Parliament and the reform of the European Commission."
"The future financing of EU enlargement was a centre-stage issue at the Brussels Summit."
"It is clear from the Presidency Conclusions that the financial perspective, as laid down in Berlin in 1999, is going to be respected in its entirety."
"The cost of the EU enlargement will be borne from within the budgetary parameters of the Berlin Agreement."
"It is also clear that programmes such as the present CAP arrangements for the period 2000-2006 are not going to be affected by the decision of the EU leaders in Brussels."
"This is only right and proper because our farmers, their families and rural communities were all given legitimate expectations by the CAP deal of spring 1999."
"They were told how the common agricultural policy was going to operate for a seven year period until 2006 and they were basing their commercial decisions on this framework as laid down in the Berlin Agreement."
"As the corollary decision to this decision taken by the EU leaders, the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy will be just that - a review of the CAP rather than a reform."
"This may not be music to the ears of the proponents of sweeping CAP reform but that is the reality of the conclusions of the Brussels Summit."
"In conclusion, when it comes to addressing the challenges of EU enlargement, certainty, determination and commitment are all words that can be used to sum up the opinions of the vast majority of the people living in Europe as well as those of legislators working on these important issues within the different EU institutions."
"Mr President, the Brussels Summit was above all about enlargement of the European Union."
"The British Conservative Party has argued strongly and consistently in favour of the enlargement eastwards of the EU since the Berlin Wall fell some 13 years ago."
"Indeed, the manifesto on which I and my colleagues were elected in 1999 states quite clearly the reasons why we support this process so enthusiastically."
"It stated that enlargement is an historic opportunity to advance the principles for which Europe should stand: free trade, free markets, deregulation and cooperation."
"It would also mean more trade, more stability and more prosperity for the existing Member States of the European Union."
"Furthermore, the European Union simply cannot ignore the moral duty that it owes to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"At Brussels, significant progress was made towards achieving agreement on the entry of 10 applicant states at the Copenhagen Council in December."
"My party warmly welcomes this."
"Europe will be a better place as a result of enlargement and I congratulate the Danish Presidency on the skill and the commitment it has displayed in reaching this point."
"However, given the fact that we have waited 13 years for this historic moment, I want to reiterate that there must be no foot-dragging, no more delays and no more last-minute vested interests should be allowed to stand in the way."
"On no account should we allow budgetary discussions to be derailed by reopening issues that have been long settled, in particular, the continuation of the British budgetary abatement, which was agreed unanimously by heads of government at Berlin in 1999."
"This budgetary abatement is both fair and justified and any attempt to use it as a smokescreen to disguise unwillingness to reform the CAP must be dismissed as political opportunism."
"I regret the fact that those Member States which most actively promote CAP reform, including the British Prime Minister, were so comprehensively out-manoeuvred at Brussels."
"I hope they recover their negotiating skills by the time we get to Copenhagen."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the Danish Presidency for being able to keep hold of the big picture and not allowing the summit to be side-tracked by arcane details and what are relatively small amounts of money."
"We must never lose sight of the fact that the benefits of enlargement far outweigh the costs."
"The costs of not enlarging are far greater than the costs of enlarging."
"You may recall that at a previous debate I took inspiration from the late, great Elvis Presley when he said 'it's now or never'."
"I would like to take inspiration today from a rather lesser personage, Mr Iain Duncan Smith, who yesterday said to the Conservative Party 'unite or die'."
"The same principle of course applies to the European Union."
"I am glad to see the Brussels Summit demonstrate that Europe is more capable of learning that lesson than the British Conservative Party."
"I recognise the Danish Presidency's enthusiasm for wishing to carve out a road from Copenhagen to Copenhagen, but I want to be clear that Copenhagen is not the end of the process - hopefully it is the beginning of the end of the process."
"There is still a lot of work to be done by the candidate countries, we still have a ratification process, and this Parliament will take its assent powers very seriously indeed."
"We will only vote 'yes' if we are clear that a proper deal has been done."
"So we must not allow the candidate countries to think the process is over."
"I would like to remind everyone that the Commission will be producing a further progress report six months before the date of accession."
"I would also like to congratulate the Danish Presidency for establishing an indicative framework for further agricultural spending which in no way prejudices future reform of the CAP, nor future discussions on financing the European Union, nor our international trade commitments in the Doha round."
"It allows us to move forward but still leaves this discussion open for us to reach a sensible conclusion to that debate."
"I am also pleased with the wording of the resolution on Bulgaria and Romania."
"I recently represented the Socialist Group in Romania, and was singularly impressed by the progress that is being made under the current government, which has finally got to grips with some of the issues."
"I welcome the decision of the Council to increase the safeguard clauses from two years to three years, although I am concerned by the wording which says that these could apply from day one of accession."
"I assume that relates to the Commission's report six months before the date of accession, but I must say it would not give a good impression to the voters, either in the accession countries or in the European Union, if we start to apply safeguard clauses from day one."
"Quite frankly, if those are necessary, those countries should probably not be coming into the European Union at that point."
"Finally, as a former chairman of the Lithuanian JPC, I would remind the Council that Russia is not a Member State of the European Union, it is not a candidate country, it does not have a veto over European Union affairs."
"Therefore, our number one priority on Kaliningrad is to guarantee the sovereignty of the Lithuanian State and its ability to enter Schengen."
"I would also like to congratulate the Council on resolving the issues relating to the financing of the closure of Ignalina power station."
"This shows a remarkable sign of solidarity from the existing Member States towards a small candidate country."
"Mr President, it is truly wonderful to know that enlargement is so well on track and that common agricultural policy reform will not hold up the entry of the fast track ten."
"The European Commission's regular report marks a critically important step for Romania, and, I would guess, for Bulgaria as well."
"Yet Romania has concerns that her own entry date may somehow be held up by the energy and commitment that we are putting into the first ten."
"From Parliament, we can send a clear signal of our intent by endorsing Romania's chosen target date of 1 January 2007."
"Yesterday, in the Foreign Affairs Committee, we agreed to do just that."
"I hope that this will be passed by Plenary too."
"After all, we in Parliament thought of the date of 2004 in the beginning, and the same date is appropriate for Bulgaria."
"Turning to Turkey, the EU is a secular group of institutions and therefore religion is no barrier to membership."
"I believe it would be a right and proper endorsement if we were able to send a signal to the new Turkish Government that if it fulfils the Copenhagen criteria of democratic values deeply entrenched and implemented in law, then perhaps the date of June 2004 would be appropriate for negotiations."
"My congratulations go to all of those concerned in the work to date."
"Mr President, at the Brussels European Council, the Chairman of the Convention presented the preparation of what he called a 'constitutional treaty'."
"Three days later, however, before the Convention, he presented a preliminary draft entitled the 'Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe'."
"There is a very considerable shift between the two meetings and it is a shame that this was not discussed at the Council meeting."
"The shift is even more marked when compared to the Laeken mandate, which simply raised the question as to whether the simplification of the treaties that it called for might not - and I quote - 'lead in the long run to the adoption of a constitutional text'."
"I stress the words 'in the long run'."
"And what is more, the Laeken mandate was itself developing in line with the Nice mandate, which did not even mention any possible constitutional element."
"These successive shifts can be easily explained by the backstage manoeuvring of the federalists and by the lack of any opposition within the Convention, based on the defence of national sovereignty, that is proportionate to its influence on the general public."
"A lack of realism can thrive when there is no one to question it."
"Mr President, the process of the accession of ten new Member States is now nearing completion."
"We are excited about it and would like to congratulate the Commission and the Council on this."
"It fulfils the fondest wish of the vast majority of European citizens, as it was, in the past, far from self-evident that this wish would be fulfilled."
"Unfortunately, many have already forgotten this."
"Enlargement became to them a question of money and some politicians speculated on fear, self-interest and other negative traits which they believed to be widely present at grassroots level."
"They knew very well that it is our security and prosperity that will benefit from enlargement."
"To my chagrin, the Dutch parliament, in particular, has been guilty of this type of behaviour, even as recently as this week."
"Since the Dutch Government was sensible enough to take the right decisions, a majority in the Chamber suddenly extended an invitation to the government right at the end to examine the options of a referendum on accession after all, although the formula is such that the government has still been given time to respond negatively."
"Domestic opportunism has prevailed over clarity and responsible policy in this case."
"Could the Council and the Commission, for their part, comment on the options and advisability of referendums on enlargement in the current Member States?"
"Also, could you indicate the principal difference between referendums in the current Member States and those in the states that are candidates for membership?"
"What would be the effect of a negative outcome of a referendum in a Member State or in one or more candidate countries, respectively?"
"I should like to receive a response to this from the Council and, if possible, from the Commission, because this is, of course, of major importance for the purpose of publicity and information provided to the Dutch people."
"Finally, a word on Chechnya."
"The group chairman has already commented on this, and rightly so."
"This is a fight against terrorism, but we could employ diplomatic means to find a solution."
"I would also ask the Council whether the EU has a policy on Chechnya."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the undoubted success of the Brussels Summit was primarily brought about, of course, by the compromise that was reached on agricultural funding."
"This is a compromise with which it is possible to live, but many speakers have already alluded to the fact that it is no substitute for reform of European agricultural policy."
"I wish to call upon you, Mr President of the Council, to do something that is made urgent by the decision we are to take tomorrow, namely, to maintain dialogue with Parliament on agricultural policy reform, without leaving out the Commission or, when he comes up with sensible proposals, Commissioner Fischler, who is responsible for these matters."
"Secondly, the safeguard clause, to which reference has already been made, is an important factor in building our countries' confidence that reforms and the reform process in the candidate countries will be continued with."
"I would ask you, Mr President of the Council, to see to it that this safeguard clause also includes consultation with the countries concerned, so that the procedure may be one on which there is general agreement."
"In third place comes the issue of Turkey."
"Both of you have let it be known that we can look forward to decisions specifically relating to Turkey being taken in Copenhagen."
"It is my opinion that any response to the new government has to be a cautious one."
"There is no need for it to be met with mistrust, greeted with premature praise, or declared to be whiter than white."
"This government must first demonstrate its ability to implement the decisions taken by the previous parliament, to recognise human rights and the rights of minorities, and Turkey has to show its ability to handle a change of government without military intervention."
"Any promises we make to Turkey must be ones that we are prepared to keep over the next few years."
"Our actions in this area will be judicious if we bear that in mind."
"There is no doubt that it is tactically astute not to discuss further steps towards enlargement right now, but I would like to emphatically underline what was said by the President of the Commission."
"Particularly as regards the Balkans, it is important to indicate by word and deed - as Brussels has done - that when these countries are prepared to implement economic reforms, when they are ready to give recognition to human and minority rights, when they are ready to take the road that leads to full democracy, then the Balkan countries can join the EU - not today, not tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow."
"This is a clear signal that they should take the road to democracy and the acknowledgement of human rights, and an incentive for them to do so."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Danish Presidency for the conclusions of the Brussels Summit in preparing the way for these ten countries to begin to assume obligations of membership by the beginning of 2004."
"But I have questions on budgets, on Cyprus and on further enlargement on which I would like further clarification."
"Firstly the budgets: we welcome the overall approach agreed between the institutions on budgetary and financial issues but, as a parliament, we would like to be fully informed by the Commission on the stage of negotiations and set up a process of dialogue with the Council so we can come to conclusions at the end of the year."
"In so doing, firstly, we would like some clarity about potential new obligations on foreign policy which could arise as a result of enlargement."
"We have asked for a report from the Commission regarding this which we are awaiting."
"Secondly, agricultural reform: in the House of Commons, upon his return from the European Council, Mr Blair said that he was fully supportive of the first point of the agreement on additional limits on expenditure; he was not in support of the price for it - no CAP reform."
"That was defeated at the summit."
"The question to the President of the Commission is whether this reform is still on course and what has now happened to the mid-term review."
"Looking to the future, I would like to pick up Mr Barón Crespo's point."
"It is not usual for us to be in agreement, but certainly when it comes to financial perspective of 1999, I was against it for precisely the same reasons that he mentioned - how can you plan so far into the future?"
"And, at least until 2013, the Parliament itself must be involved in the negotiation of this financial perspective once the negotiations are under way."
"In terms of Cyprus, I would like a clear statement that neither the Commission nor the Council intends to set a date for the opening of negotiations."
"We must have the full and fair implementation of the Copenhagen criteria in political and economic matters."
"Perhaps, above all, it is a decision for the Member States and not for other countries to take a decision as to when a date should be set for Turkey to start negotiations."
"Lastly, on the point raised by Mr Swoboda, it is critically important that we set out a strategy for a 'new neighbours' initiative and that Copenhagen should provide a mechanism whereby we can really come to terms with those countries which could be potential candidates."
"We need a strategy on how to handle the demands which we will face in the months and years ahead."
"It is not sufficient that we should simply say everybody is welcome, because I believe there is a limit to the matters of EU enlargement and this should be thought about now."
"Mr President, I also congratulate our Danish colleagues on the way in which they have handled enlargement."
"But, obviously, I have completely misunderstood the fact that we have resolved overnight the issue of the common agricultural policy."
"The President of the Commission said that the common agricultural policy has been solved."
"I feel that what has actually happened is that the agreement between President Chirac and Chancellor Schröder went in some way to undermine the way in which Commissioner Fischler was proposing his reforms."
"The other day when he spoke to the Agriculture Committee I felt very much that he will be a strong leader in his mid-term review and will carry the reforms through."
"I also noted that one of the proposals is that we reform the Agriculture Committee and go for codecision."
"I hope the Council and the Commission will support this because it will help to reform the common agricultural policy."
"We would have a totally different agricultural policy if the Agriculture Committee had codecision."
"We have also heard many vague ideas about how we are going to reform it and I put to you one or two ideas that I believe to be important."
"I ask the Commissioner, how will modulation work?"
"How are we going to cope if we do not really reform the common agricultural policy in Commissioner Fischler's mind when we come to discuss the WTO negotiations?"
"There has been talk about capping the common agricultural policy and yet there has been no mention of how we are going to use the funding from Pillar One to Pillar Two."
"How are we going to fund the new proposals in Pillar Two?"
"Finally, I wish to speak particularly for my constituents in East Anglia, many of whom have not drawn on the common agricultural policy because they grow crops which have never been subsidised by this Union."
"They are going to be disadvantaged because, under the new proposals, there will be a payment on historical claims."
"I urge the Commission to rethink that and look at the old IACS forms."
"You have the measurements, make sure you look at those before you take a final decision."
"Let us make sure we have an agricultural policy which helps our farmers, helps the budget and helps the new democracies."
"Mr President, it was a remarkable Summit with a remarkable result, because the ten candidate member states nominated by the Commission have passed this stage, so that the negotiations can now be completed and we can remain on schedule for 2004."
"I am also pleased that the Dutch Government did not put a spanner in the works."
"This is mainly thanks to the opposition in the Dutch parliament, who were aware of their enormous responsibility."
"Further to what Mr Oostlander said, I am secretly hoping that the Netherlands will not raise any more unnecessary obstacles on the path to completing the enlargement process."
"Slovakia, the country for which I am responsible, has reacted with great relief to the events of the past few weeks, including, of course, the referendum in Ireland."
"After a tumultuous start in the 90s, Slovakia has managed to catch up with those in the lead in the negotiating process, for which it deserves a huge compliment."
"However, as for the other candidate member states, it is too early for them to rest on their laurels."
"A great deal of work needs to be done before 2004."
"In my view, the Heads of Government were right to adopt the Commission's recommendations about creating guarantees with regard to the implementation of EU rules, including the recommendation to shorten the duration of the safeguard rules."
"We would also draw your attention specifically to the fight against the corruption that is still too widespread in many candidate member states."
"Thanks to enlargement, we will be getting new neighbours, countries that are also knocking on the doors of the EU."
"We cannot deal with their questions now as we are now focusing on the forthcoming enlargement."
"However, we do expect the Commission and the Council, at the end of the negotiations and after the Copenhagen Summit, to table specific proposals to strengthen relations with those countries."
"In this connection, we will also need to address the question as to what prospects we can offer countries such as the Ukraine."
"As President Prodi rightly stated a moment ago, enlargement should not lead to exclusion."
"Mr President, the Danish Presidency is indeed to be congratulated on its skilful handling of the negotiations which resulted in a successful outcome to the two-day summit in Brussels."
"Agreement on the financial aspects of enlargement has removed the last major obstacle which stood in the way of concluding the accession negotiations with ten countries at the December Copenhagen Council."
"I welcome the fact that in relation to the sensitive area of the future financing of the common agricultural policy that EU leaders agreed that direct payments to farmers in current EU Member States would remain stable until 2006."
"This will guarantee the continuing goodwill of current EU farmers towards enlargement."
"If this is to be maintained, it is important that degressivity is not introduced after 2006."
"On a related issue, it is important to note that some concerns had been expressed that the applicant countries would have been able to export food products which were not up to current EU food safety standards."
"I should add that these concerns were not necessarily motivated by opposition to enlargement."
"They were rather more influenced by a wish to prevent any repetition of the BSE and foot and mouth disasters."
"I am therefore pleased that one of the important declarations at the Summit confirmed that there would be a safeguard clause on food safety included in each of the accession treaties."
"Under it, if a candidate country does not meet EU safety standards, it will not be allowed to sell food products in the internal market."
"As well as reassuring consumers, it will also remove another weapon from the armoury of those who have reservations about enlargement going ahead as quickly as possible."
"I would like to conclude by not only congratulating the Danish Presidency once again and welcoming the fact that its confidence proved to be right, but also by wishing it a similar success at the Copenhagen Council."
"Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union in terms of numbers is now a fact of life."
"It is also a fact of life that geographically - apart from a few missing enclaves - Europe is turning into a huge entity with massive economic and political clout, the future of which is beginning to look interesting."
"The single currency, enlargement, efforts to bring about a common defence and security policy and the work being carried out by the convention clearly show that Europe is moving and is moving dynamically."
"Enlargement is without doubt a positive development on the road to European unification."
"However, it still has problems to resolve and questions to answer."
"There are matters which need clearing up in the agricultural sector, for example."
"And it is the agricultural sector, the CAP, with its massive fund of experience and coherence, that has been the common reference point for European as opposed to national policy from the birth of the EEC through to the present day."
"Enlargement must help strengthen this common policy, not upset the balanced compromise achieved, be it between the 15 or the 25 Member States of the Union."
"Numerous candidate countries are behind economically and do not have the administrative wherewithal to apply the acquis communautaire efficiently and these too are problems we need to address."
"Do these or other problems detract from the huge, positive contribution of enlargement to the future of Europe?"
"No, they do not."
"Enlargement makes a most positive contribution to the future of Europe, the importance of which will become more and more apparent with each passing day."
"I must stress how important it is that Cyprus has been included as a new Member State."
"By integrating Cyprus into the European Union, the outermost point of Europe and its Mediterranean dimension have now been covered."
"I am positive that at some point - be it before or after integration - this development will help resolve the political problem that has beset Cyprus for years."
"Mr President, the European Council has taken an historic and welcome decision on enlargement of the European Union, but what a pity that it did not seize the opportunity to take another historic decision in radically reforming the common agricultural policy."
"The EUR 40 billion a year that the European Union spends on the CAP is an expensive way to distort our farming industry."
"British citizens, who already contribute disproportionately to the EU budget, pay twice for the CAP: once through their taxes, and again in the supermarket."
"An opportunity for early reform has been lost."
"The question of European defence policy was also addressed by the European Council."
"The United Kingdom has a special interest and responsibility in this area."
"After all, it was the British Prime Minister who gave the green light to this misguided policy in 1998 and now he has promised significant elements of Britain's already over-stretched armed forces to fill any capability gaps given the complete lack of willingness on the part of most other European countries to upgrade their defence capabilities in any meaningful way."
"At the very moment when we should be concentrating on meeting the terrorist threat and on possible conflict with Iraq, the defence annexes to the Presidency Conclusions are Ruritanian in their complexity and in their irrelevance."
"To add to the confusion and waste, European allies are now toying with two separate sets of military capability improvements: those for NATO and those for the European Union."
"Resources are scarce and the last thing we need is two different sets of capability goals."
"For over a year now, diplomatic and military staff energy has been wastefully expended on negotiating EU access to NATO resources."
"This is an entirely self-generated problem which, furthermore, raises unnecessary difficulties for key allies such as Turkey."
"We now have the very dangerous involvement of the European Convention in defence matters."
"One of its working groups is examining ways in which even collective defence, a core task of NATO, might become a European Union responsibility."
"What signal does this send to our American allies?"
"Perhaps more significantly, what signal does this send to potential enemies?"
"What a pity it is that the Council and the Commission do not focus their efforts on putting the European Union house in order before enlargement instead of grandiose political schemes."
"Mr President, I will be very brief, for the Danish Prime Minister has given an exhaustive illustration of the key points of today's debate and I fully agree with what he has said."
"I would just like to make a general comment regarding some of the points raised."
"It is interesting to see that the entire House - like the Council - is in agreement on enlargement."
"The debates and questions have focused on minor issues and on the progress we need to make on these issues in the future."
"This kind of consensus really is extremely rare."
"I would like to mention a number of points which have not been addressed in the other replies."
"The first is the point raised by Mr Swoboda concerning the Balkans."
"I fully agree: we did not spend a great deal of time talking about the Balkans, but our policy of association and stabilisation processes and ongoing relations and assistance is part of a strategy for achieving a long-term goal precisely of making the Balkans part of the Union too."
"It will take time and, above all, the process will differ from country to country - close monitoring of these countries has shown that some move faster than others - but the Balkans are becoming increasingly our responsibility, and we are aware of this and taking appropriate action."
"As regards Turkey, I have nothing to add, apart from a consideration which I feel I must point out to the House. We based our report on practical criteria."
"In this respect, the change in government does not introduce any new factors because we will have to see what practical measures it takes to implement the Copenhagen criteria."
"The Commission report is very specific and very clear on this point and the position we take must therefore be consistent with it."
"I have no comment to make on the subject of Kaliningrad, other than to say that we will respect the position of Lithuania and its rights as a new Member of the Union."
"All our work, including the difficult negotiations, has taken such a long time precisely because of the need to respect these principles."
"Chechnya has been mentioned by a large number of speakers today."
"Although Chechnya is not part of the subject of this debate, I do feel that the question is closely related to the issues we are discussing."
"The Commission vehemently and unequivocally condemns all terrorist acts, starting with the tragic incident of the hostages in the Moscow theatre."
"It affirms equally explicitly that the fight against terrorism cannot be pursued at the expense of human rights."
"This applies to Chechnya, where our human rights agencies working in situ are constantly reporting incidents of failure to respect human rights and violation of human rights by both Russian military operators and Chechen rebels."
"In my view, the best way to prevent further violation of human rights is to pursue the investigations currently being performed by the Russian military and civil prosecutors who have undertaken to carry out these inquiries."
"There is also a Russian undertaking to take certain steps to improve human rights in Chechnya, which include reducing the number of troops present, putting an end to what are known as round-ups and, as I said before, allowing prosecutors to observe military operations."
"There have been countless statements made to this effect and we must ensure that this, at least, does happen."
"Then there is a further matter in which the Commission is directly involved and that is the provision of humanitarian aid to the people of that country, who have to endure the suffering and problems caused by the difficult living conditions."
"Furthermore, two NGO workers - one European and one local - who were taken prisoner some weeks ago, have still not been released."
"We are pushing for urgent resolution of this matter."
"Lastly, we must constantly and insistently make it clear that a political solution is the only way to resolve the Chechen question."
"This is our message, the stance we will adopt at the bilateral meeting with the Russian authorities in Brussels."
"As I said before, political dialogue is the only way forward."
"Otherwise, there will be no end to this conflict."
"My final point concerns the CAP, which has been mentioned a number of times with comments being made which are not consistent with what was decided at Brussels."
"After Brussels, the reform of the CAP is still on the table."
"Moreover, Commissioner Fischler is going to take part in a debate on the matter in this very Chamber."
"I am not going to go into details but I can assure you that the Commission is working long and hard on pursuing its recent proposal."
"Mr President, I asked a very specific question on the subject of this referendum that was still hanging over us in the Netherlands and what the effects of a possible negative outcome will be, compared to those in the candidate member states."
"Given that the Treaty has to be ratified by all the Member States, a referendum means that the Netherlands are not ratifying it and are therefore holding up the whole process."
"That is clear. The case is very similar to that of Ireland."
"In any case, under the current procedure, all the countries have to subscribe."
"That is what appears to emerge from any legal analysis of the situation."
"I received five motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The next item is the statement by Mr Solana on the situation in the Middle East and Iraq."
"I understand that Mr Solana will mention Chechnya in his opening remarks."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission and standing in for Commissioner Patten, who sends his apologies, I would like to make a statement on the current situation in the Middle East and on what the Commission is doing about it."
"Mr Solana has already spoken at length concerning the progress of the discussion on the road map being planned by the international community, represented here by the international quartet."
"The work you have done, Mr Solana, has been done under the most adverse conditions imaginable and no doubt also against the clock; I wish to congratulate you on it and promise you the Commission's continued support."
"The road map towards which we are working must incorporate a specific timetable and have as its objective the outcome outlined in the Seville Council Declaration, that is, the creation of a viable Palestinian state."
"I am confident in the future success of the efforts of the Presidency and of Mr Solana to this end, which involve agreement with the other international partners in the quartet on a workable solution."
"Yet before the road map is laid down, which it is expected to be in December, there are aspects that could even now help to reduce the tension in the situation."
"These are the unreserved confirmation of the two-state solution that we seek, and even more so the ending of all use of force and provocation by both sides."
"This would include vigorous action against terrorist organisations alongside the immediate halting of settlements and the bringing under control of settlers' incursions into land owned by Palestinian civilians."
"It is equally important that the Palestinians should persevere with their efforts at reform, and the Israelis with the implementation of symbolic responses to them, such as the resumption of regular transfer payments, which they have already announced."
"The relaxation of restrictions on movement and easier access for humanitarian aid organisations could accentuate this positive trend."
"The most recent Israeli Government reshuffle has resulted in a marked shift to the right."
"It remains to be seen, however, whether the effect on the peace process will actually be as is feared."
"In any case, the road map remains an international initiative with the prospect of long-term success in the form of a two-state solution."
"It is to be hoped that the new Palestinian cabinet will continue with the reform work it has started and will, with the help of the international community, not only intensify it, but also use it to bring about marked improvements in the people's conditions."
"It is precisely here that there are difficulties."
"It has been primarily in the area of financial management that the reform process has met with its first successes."
"The conditions attached to the use of EU funds to support the budget have brought about consolidation and resulted in Palestinian financial arrangements becoming better controlled and more transparent."
"The Commission will continue to work closely with Salam Fayad, the new Palestinian Finance Minister, and will use further conditions to exert a positive influence on the reform process."
"In other fields, regrettably, the reform process has come to something of a halt."
"This is true, specifically, of reform of the administration and of the justice system, both of which play an important part in establishing a democratic state, and preparations for the elections announced for mid-January have not got very far either."
"Although a chairman of the electoral commission has been appointed, many Palestinians, and also representatives of the international donor community, believe that postponement of the elections can no longer be ruled out."
"One of the tasks of the international Task Force will be to bring obstacles to the election preparations to the quartet's attention and suggest ways of dealing with them."
"Together with Member States, the Commission continues to be fully involved in preparations for the elections, and is endeavouring to ensure that all necessary support is given when they are actually held."
"Neither international efforts at laying down a promising road map, nor the Palestinian Authority's efforts at reform have, however, been able as yet to bring about any improvement in the situation on the spot."
"On both sides, innocent people are still dying."
"Daily life is lived in fear of the terrible suicide bombers and of reprisals and against a backdrop of frustration and despair."
"So far, it has not been possible to meet the Israeli people's need for security, or to satisfy the Palestinian people's demand for a more normal everyday life, to put an end to the restrictions on freedom of movement, or to improve the atrocious living conditions."
"It is the human needs involved that give great cause for concern."
"International observers on the spot are all agreed that the restrictions on freedom of movement and the lack of access for aid organisations have helped to bring about the present humanitarian crisis."
"It is quite simply not acceptable for aid missions financed by the EU to be turned back or prevented from doing their work."
"Twenty-three instances of this have occurred in the last couple of weeks alone. To give just one example, on 17 October, two Commission officials were stopped on their way out of Israel, and the documents and laptops they were carrying were taken off them, being returned to them only after some considerable time."
"You will no doubt be well aware that the Commission has sought to have EUR 50 million released from the emergency reserve in order to be able to make additional aid available to towns and villages cut off from the outside world."
"Additional financial resources are also required for the preparation of elections, and, in this regard, I hope that the Commission can count on Parliament's support."
"This is of great importance in terms of the ad hoc liaison meeting that is to take place in December, at which the international donor states will be discussing the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territories and the state of the reform process, as well as the need for measures of support and financial aid."
"Mr President, the events of the last few days served to justify, perhaps more than ever, the presence of Mr Solana here this evening, and on behalf of the European People's Party, I would like to thank the High Representative for attending this session."
"These ten days, which began with the shocking hostage siege in Moscow, came to a tragic end on 26 October and were also marked by increasing concern regarding the growing political instability in the Middle East and by the possibility of war with Iraq which is still being discussed in New York."
"As far as Chechnya and our relations with Russia are concerned, we have just heard Mr Prodi express his commitment, and we are asking you, Mr Solana, to speak on our behalf and, I am sure, on behalf of the entire House, and condemn in the strongest possible terms the cowardly and criminal act of terrorism which took place in Moscow. At the same time, however, you must warn against the response in Russia by the public and by some of those responsible for combating terrorism who could confuse the ordinary Chechen population with the extremists who are guilty of preparing and carrying out this crime."
"This is precisely the trap that the terrorists wanted the Russian people and government to fall into."
"And if they do, there is a danger that they will prove the terrorists' action right."
"At the same time, in the Middle East, we have seen political chaos increasing over recent days and almost with each passing hour and this obviously cannot serve the cause of peace."
"In this respect, Mr Solana, I do not share your optimism."
"This is because, first of all, on 29 October, the new government of the Palestinian Authority, approved by the Palestinian Legislative Council, was presented with, as you said, a broad majority. President Arafat was still, however, the target of severe criticism even within this House, due to the ineffective reshuffle which kept most of the ministers axed by the same Council in their posts."
"And the fact that, on this occasion, the Minister of Finance was able to keep his job - you welcomed this - but that the former Interior Minister, who had the courage to call for the end to the violence perpetrated by both sides, was able to be axed, seems, in our view, a very worrying sign that, in this new Cabinet, the hawks may have prevailed over the artisans of peace."
"Next, a crisis ensued within the government in Israel which led to the Knesset being dissolved and early elections being called. These could take place even before the date of 28 January that is currently predicted."
"We welcome the fact that, when this crisis broke out, the Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon did not give in to a far-right majority which intended to condemn the Oslo Accords, expel Arafat and reject the creation of a Palestinian State."
"We must fear, however, that this majority will continue to rage throughout the upcoming election campaign, but we also hope that the Israeli people, most of whom are still passionate about peace, will not allow themselves to be carried away by the far-right action."
"In this respect as well, we are counting on you and on your representative, Ambassador Moratinos, to try, against the backdrop of increasingly uncontrolled violent outbreaks, to make the conciliatory voice of Europe heard."
"Lastly, we hope that the same conciliatory voice will also be heard within the United Nations Security Council, by those who have been involved in tough negotiations, as you said, for six weeks, to redraft a resolution which places Iraq squarely before its responsibilities, but which still offers the prospect of a solution that does not inevitably involve the use of weapons."
"(Applause)"
"As a former President, Mr Barón Crespo, I am sure you know the conventions of this House."
"Mr Solana and the Commissioner have as much time to speak to the House as they wish."
"Both of them, however, held very closely to the time that they were allocated."
"I do not think there is any cause for complaint."
"Mr President, my group unconditionally condemns all violence in the Middle East."
"Victims among the civilian population are always unacceptable, whether they are at the hands of suicide attacks or the army."
"For years, Europe has tried to play a significant role in the conflict, but we are mainly fighting the symptoms rather than the root causes of the disease."
"What needs to happen is for people to start believing in the future again."
"People who have hope in the future have something to lose and are therefore prepared to fight for peace instead of plodding along in the status quo or, even worse, thinking that violence is the answer."
"In order to guarantee a promising future, we demand serious efforts from both sides."
"The Palestinian Authority must, in the first instance, adopt a much tougher stance with regard to suicide attacks."
"Terrorists are not heroes, but killers, and must be approached accordingly."
"In addition, the Palestinian Authority must reform, and stamp out corruption, so that the Palestinian population can have confidence in their leaders."
"Secondly, we ask Israel to call an end to the policy of using closures as a means of economic strangulation and humiliation."
"Payments to the Palestinians must also be resumed so that European money can once again be used for development projects in education and care rather than payment support."
"In addition, it remains unacceptable that settlements are still allowed to expand."
"The occupation and the settlements remain the biggest obstacle to real peace and security for everyone."
"I am ashamed of the lack of European resolve in the area of the Middle East."
"Every day, innocent people die, and all we do is settle for declarations and meetings."
"As Palestine's largest donor and Israel's biggest trading partner, we should surely be able to do something more to accomplish our own European goals."
"I should like to conclude with a comment about the forthcoming elections."
"Unfortunately, neither of the parties has put a sound peace plan on the table."
"It is really time that this was done, so that in January, Israelis and Palestinians will be able to vote for peace for themselves and for their neighbours."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, I believe that we can establish a link, not only a philosophical link but also a political one between the problem in the Middle East, Iraq and Chechnya and the role of Europe."
"I think that our role is to be clear-headed and to state the truth."
"Mr Wurtz is right in saying that twenty years ago we condemned, twenty years ago we ?We say this to the Israelis."
"That is right and it is true."
"And to the Palestinians we must say: twenty years ago, we said you must acknowledge not only the State of Israel but also that there would be no mass return of Palestinians to that State of Israel."
"Both these things are true."
"If we want to give some hope to the Israeli population, we must eradicate the fear."
"They fear the attacks, the fatal, suicide attacks, which above all mean that those who carry out these attacks do not recognise the State of Israel."
"The Palestinians fear occupation by the Israeli army."
"The two things are very closely related."
"And then in Iraq, the truth is straightforward."
"We say that Iraq must recognise the UN resolutions, in other words, all weapons, if they exist that is - and I know nothing about that, I had never been an inspector, nor have you, nor have any of us, no one here in fact - must be destroyed after they have been inspected."
"The way in which Saddam Hussein conducts politics and has conducted politics in the past is a danger to other nations."
"Therefore, we must also call for weapons inspectors and for non-governmental organisations to be allowed in to inspect the democratic situation and the relationship between the Iraqi people and Saddam Hussein."
"The same applies to Russia and Chechnya."
"It is quite incredible that Russian women and children were indeed taken hostage, and we condemn this. It is even more incredible that Mr Putin then took the hostages hostage, failing to say how they were, which gases were to be used, and failed to communicate the information at his disposal to the families."
"It is equally incredible that the entire Chechen population can be taken hostage by a former KGB man who is acting as if the Bolsheviks and Communists were still in power, as a KGB agent, in other words."
"Europe must condemn the attacks, Europe must take part in anti-terrorist actions and Europe must say no to all totalitarian impulses, even if a power such as Russia is involved."
"The Duma voted in favour of restricting the right to information which is tantamount to restricting democracy."
"If Europe remains silent in the face of Putin's actions, then Europe will not have had the insight or the strength to safeguard democracy."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, I will be very brief for I believe we are going to have the opportunity to hold an in-depth debate on the issue of Russia and therefore on Chechnya too in Strasbourg."
"It is clear that we are creating a new Afghanistan with the Taliban, but I would like to focus on a very specific point."
"A few days ago, Mr Akhmed Zakayev, the deputy prime minister of the Chechen Government, was arrested in Copenhagen, where he is still being detained, and all attempts to make it possible for Ilias Akhmadov, the Chechen Minister for Foreign Affairs, to return to the European Union from the United States are being blocked."
"Therefore, in addition to turning a blind eye to the events in Chechnya, we are preventing the few democratic interlocutors who are in a position to discuss and propose democratic solutions for the country from getting on with their job."
"My question, Mr Solana, is the following: you took the initiative of drawing up black lists of those implicated in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia."
"Could you not now take the initiative of drawing up a positive list of people whom we consider to be essential for dialogue, so that these people can obtain visas without hindrance and without injury to a small country which is then subjected, as is the case of Denmark and Belgium, to intolerable pressure from the Russian Federation?"
"Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, as has already been said, the next couple of hours will see the Security Council coming to a decision on the Iraq resolution."
"Let there be no doubt about the fact that Iraq must unconditionally comply with all the requirements made of it."
"Such is the EU's position, and it is one with whose substance I agree wholeheartedly."
"There is now justifiable concern about the way Iraq deploys weapons of mass destruction and makes them widely available."
"Saddam Hussein has already, on several occasions, demonstrated his readiness to deploy such weapons of mass destruction against his own people."
"The memories of all of us are still scarred by the Kurds of Halabja, who were killed by poison gas."
"The brutal persecution of the Shiites in the south of the country is no secret either."
"Weapons of mass destruction are in the hands of the most diverse regimes and countries, whether one thinks of India or Pakistan or, lastly, of North Korea, which has, indeed, admitted diverting fissile material for nuclear weapons, a breach of international undertakings that amounts to an offensive aimed at getting the pressure off Iraq!"
"In any case, weapons of mass destruction will only become an incalculable menace to the international community if the rulers with control of them are themselves unpredictable and menacing, as is without doubt true of Saddam Hussein."
"That is why the Security Council resolution must spell out the necessity of the UN inspectors being able to perform their duties unhindered, of the monitoring teams' powers being extended and of there being no repeat of the cat and mouse game we have seen before."
"If anyone is to make political visits to Iraq at this time, then it should be international weapons inspectors and nobody else - and I say this with reference to the visit to Iraq of the provincial governor of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, which is his third, and is superfluous and contrary to Austrian interests."
"Iraq is far too hazardous a minefield and also deserves better than to be used to satisfy neurotic political egos."
"Rather than solo acts, what is needed here is concerted action at EU level, which should be undertaken in partnership with the USA."
"The risk should also be calculable."
"We must avoid any escalation or any security vacuum affecting the whole of the Middle East."
"Looking further ahead, there is a need to work at removing the causes of crises, whether they are in Chechnya or in the Middle East, and you have my full support in doing that."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists heartily supports Mr Solana and Mr Patten in their attempts to restrict the permanent state of war in the Middle East and to bring the parties concerned back to the negotiating table via the 'quartet approach'."
"Mr Joshi Belin, one of the well-known brains behind the Oslo Conventions, assured me only the other day that, despite the fact that the conventions had been seriously undermined by the Sharon regime on the one hand and by Palestinian suicide bombers on the other, what the citizens of both sides need more than ever at this very moment are structural political proposals which offer the prospect of peace."
"He emphasised once again that European action is essential to this process."
"I would like to remind you that this Parliament once adopted a resolution which said that the trade clauses in the association treaty must be applied, if necessary, to ensure that settlement policy is brought to an end, which will otherwise continue to form a structural barrier to peace."
"As far as Iraq is concerned, the Group of the Party of European Socialists would like to emphasise once again that neither the US, nor China, nor any other country has, therefore, the unilateral right to begin a large-scale war, wherever in the world."
"Our approach is by way of the Security Council, a route which, fortunately, we have managed to make binding on a multilateral basis."
"However, that also means that we may not have any pronouncements that might lead automatically to war."
"I am really pleased with Mrs Morillon's statement, which has emphasised that once more on behalf of the PPE-DE."
"What we need is not war as a reflex response but to bring massive pressure to bear on Saddam Hussein via weapons inspections."
"The weapons inspections must be effective and, if anything is going on, action can be taken."
"What we do not need, however, is to go down the road leading to unilateral war."
"Our first task is to strengthen the coalition against terrorism."
"This coalition must be our top priority, both from the US side and the European side."
"Our joint effort must be tied up with this."
"In my opinion, the role of the European Union in the Middle East peace process is still too limited."
"The United States calls the tune and we are merely supporting players."
"Given our position, this is wrong."
"We are, after all, Israel's largest trading partner."
"Our contribution of EUR 14 billion also makes us the biggest provider of humanitarian aid."
"The European Union also makes by far the biggest contribution towards technical and financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority, estimated at EUR 10 million per month."
"It is therefore high time that Europe stopped being just a payer and became a genuine player in the peace process."
"We have a duty to Israel and Palestine to do so, but also to ourselves for reasons of a historic, cultural, geographic, economic and political nature."
"From our European tradition, we must stress that violence is not a solution and that peace must not come directly from the top but rather must start at grass roots level."
"Terrorists follow no political agenda."
"We must therefore ensure that every example of senseless violence is condemned by public opinion, so that terrorist acts will no longer thwart peace negotiations."
"Europe can and must play an executive role in this."
"We must persevere with the democratisation and economic development of the region."
"We must add a more political dimension to our extensive humanitarian aid by making the Palestinians and Israelis realise that they cannot be at enmity with each other for evermore."
"A greater and more regular political presence in the region is therefore required more than ever."
"Mr President, Mr Solana, Commissioner, I do not believe these reassuring words on the situation in Palestine because, on the one hand, the new appointments in the Palestinian Government do not appear to increase the influence of those working sincerely for peace and, on the other, there is a risk that it is imperative that Europe avoids."
"I hear talk of very large sums of money that the European Union is about to appropriate in further aid."
"There needs to be the greatest possible transparency in the distribution of this aid and its management, for the experience of previous situations teaches us that such aid is very often appropriated for specific objectives - and if they are humanitarian objectives I endorse them, we all endorse them - but then it goes off track."
"The situation of these countries, particularly the ongoing situation in Palestine - a political and social situation in which there are opposing groups and feuds - is such as to suggest that such aid might be used for the activities of groups such as Hamas, for example, with the result that funds donated as humanitarian aid end up being aid to terrorism."
"As regards Europe's policy on Iraq, however, I feel that we must not confine ourselves to purely diplomatic measures but, mindful of the commitments made after September 11, exploit all the possibilities offered by intelligence in order to get to the heart of the matter and tackle the roots of terrorism, which are in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States."
"That is where we need to attack the ideological roots of Wahhabi fundamentalism."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to have the opportunity today to present to you my assessment of the decisions on agricultural policy taken at the Brussels Summit."
"As long ago as July, the Commission, by opening the mid-term review, prompted a wide-ranging debate on the future of the agricultural policy."
"Now, in addition, the European Council has answered a number of budget questions relating to the common agricultural policy."
"The summit decisions are, in the first place, significant in that the way ahead is opened up for the Member States to conclude the enlargement negotiations, and in that the fifteen Heads of State and Government have accepted the Commission proposal for the phasing-in of direct payments in the agricultural sector for the new Member States."
"If the candidate countries demonstrate the same realism, then it should be possible to conclude the enlargement negotiations at the Copenhagen Summit, but the Brussels decisions will also have substantial effects on the agricultural policy of the future."
"The primary consideration here of course is that we should have, for the period from 2007 to 2013, a Budget framework predetermined by the EU Fifteen for the costs of market regulation and the direct payments."
"This framework consists of the EU Fifteen's planned expenditure for 2006 on the one hand, and the ten new members' financial proposals for 2006 in nominal values on the other."
"These will be increased only by 1% each year."
"Initially, this will mean that, in 2007 and 2008, two thirds of the implementation of the Agenda 2000 reforms in the milk sector will have to be funded below the new upper limit, as must 70% of the phasing-in of the direct payments and all the reforms that the Council has already heralded, by which I mean such things as sugar or olive oil, tobacco, wine or cotton."
"This, then, at last means that the old agricultural guideline - which had already ceased to have any effect - is no longer in existence."
"What now matters is that this new financial framework should serve as a basis for giving the common agricultural policy for the next ten years a clear perspective for planning and development."
"What does that mean for the mid-term review in the first instance?"
"The Presidency's Final Conclusions establish that the Brussels decisions should no more prejudice the mid-term review decided on at Berlin than the international commitments we made at Doha and elsewhere, any more than any other future decisions on the common agricultural policy."
"These committed us to continue to take account of the decisions taken by the Heads of State and Government in Berlin and Gothenburg."
"It is, in this context, noteworthy that the Brussels Summit set no limit to the funds for rural development."
"Quite on the contrary, it reminded us of the importance of the less favoured regions and of the multifunctionality of agriculture, in effect, then, of the development of the second pillar, for which Parliament has called on many occasions already."
"I am therefore working on the assumption that Parliament will be firm in stating its intentions when setting down the new Financial Perspective for the post-2006 period, on which, in contrast to the common agricultural policy, it has full power of codecision."
"The fact that the Final Conclusions expressly refer to the European Union's undertakings resulting from the start of the Doha Development Round is taken by some to mean that the proposal to decouple the direct payments is dead and buried."
"I warn against adopting any such interpretation, as, if the international negotiations produce any commitment to make blue-box reductions - something that the European Union, like all the WTO members represented at Doha, has declared itself prepared, in principle, to do and to which the Council re-committed itself at the sustainability summit in Johannesburg - then that would mean at least partial abandonment of direct payments, as the option of decoupling would then no longer be available."
"This issue will be discussed in March at the latest, when arrangements for the agricultural sector are put on the WTO table."
"What will be the effects of the mid-term review on the agricultural sector?"
"This question is often asked, and, in its communication entitled 'Auf dem Weg zu nachhaltiger Landwirtschaft - Eine Zwischenübersicht über die gemeinsame Agrarpolitik' ('Towards sustainable agriculture - a mid-term review of the common agricultural policy'), the Commission has subjected it to an initial qualitative evaluation founded on internal analyses, which concentrate on the ways in which farmers, consumers, taxpayers, the public, the food industry and governmental authorities will benefit, and on the contribution the proposals would make to the enlargement process and to the EU's position on the international stage."
"This analysis was also supplemented in the communication on the mid-term review by medium-term prognoses for agricultural markets and reports on the rice, nut and milk sectors, which were published by the Agriculture Directorate-General in June."
"An internal investigation into EU enlargement's effects on agricultural markets and incomes in the candidate countries was published in March."
"Work is currently in progress, under the aegis of the Agriculture Directorate-General, on comprehensive analyses of the potential effects of the actual policy proposals, the results of which will be presented at the end of the year along with the draft legislation."
"In this, we will of course be taking full account of the Brussels decisions."
"Let me add something on the subject of Parliament's draft resolution."
"I share your view that our policy objectives require us to satisfy ourselves that our policy instruments are balanced and uniform."
"I welcome your offer of cooperation with the aim of guaranteeing that, in an enlarged Europe, the European agricultural model will be not only further developed and enhanced, but also safeguarded."
"You and I are at one in the belief that matters other than trade have to be better integrated into multilateral agreements, but, as negotiators for the European Union, we can achieve this only if we have enough bargaining counters to negotiate with."
"We acknowledge, secondly, that greater quality, certifications, audits and so on will entail additional costs for our farmers, particularly the smaller ones."
"These considerations make our proposals for decoupling and strengthening the second pillar crucially important in terms of the maintenance of the European agricultural model."
"I am also very receptive to Parliament's proposals for giving women a greater role in agriculture."
"I see clearly defined conditions for farm management, in the form of cross-compliance, as an essential factor in getting the common agricultural policy back in line with what the public wants, and I also absolutely share Parliament's desire to provide for straightforward and efficient procedures for these audits."
"Simplification in general will remain a key objective, but quality must be capable of being demonstrated and attested if it is to remain credible."
"As I said earlier, I expect Parliament to be emphatic in specifying how it wants the second pillar to be equipped."
"Conversely, I support Parliament's concern that it should be accorded rights of codecision in agricultural policy as well, which would significantly enhance the common agricultural policy's standing in the public eye."
"We must now seize the opportunity to build up a sustainable agricultural policy, to bring it into line with society's expectations, and to give farmers a long-term political perspective."
"I am counting on your support in this!"
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to give an account to the European Parliament of the Council's work on the mid-term review."
"As agreed in Agenda 2000, on 10 July this year the Commission submitted the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy."
"One of the main priorities for the Danish Presidency has been to ensure as much progress as possible in the discussions concerning the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy."
"Commissioner Fischler presented his discussion paper on the future development of the common agricultural policy at a Council meeting on 15 July."
"On this occasion, there was an open debate in the Council, in which the Member States had opportunity to make known their immediate opinions on the Commission's thoughts."
"The Danish Presidency has had discussion of the mid-term review on the agenda of all the Council sessions in July, September and October, and the Council has thus had a thorough debate on the main topics in the Commission's discussion paper."
"The paper has also been discussed within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and in a number of relevant working groups."
"The conclusions of the Brussels Summit emphasised, as the Commissioner mentioned in his contribution, that this was without prejudice to future decisions on the common agricultural policy and the funding of the EU after 2006, nor to any result following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the conclusions of the Berlin agenda, that is, Agenda 2000, nor to the international commitments entered into by the EU, inter alia in the launching of the Doha Development Round."
"In other words, the mid-term review continues directly as part of Agenda 2000."
"I would like to emphasise that, like the European Parliament and other institutions, we knew from the start that our discussions on the discussion paper were to form a basis for the Commission's submission of legal proposals at a later point in time."
"The Presidency has therefore organised general discussions at which ministers were given opportunity to express their various attitudes to all aspects of the Commission's communication."
"Before I start my review I would like to thank the European Parliament for its discussion of the matter."
"We look forward to Parliament's final decision tomorrow, and it is obvious that the decision will be extremely important and an important contribution to the debate."
"There is no reason to hide the fact that the ministers' reactions to the mid-term review have been divergent from the start, with regard to both the timing and the framework, and of course also as regards the content."
"In general, however, as Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Fisheries I have been able to establish that there is broad agreement on the fact that rural policy should be strengthened and that greater emphasis should be placed on food safety, on protection of the environment and on animal welfare."
"Ladies and Gentlemen, I will now contribute some comments on the main elements of the Commission's communication in the light of the discussions that we have had in the Council."
"The mid-term review contains two entirely fundamental horizontal aspects, namely the decoupling of direct subsidies and dynamic modulation."
"The Commission's ideas in this area have been more wide-ranging than has been seen previously."
"The Council held its first overall discussion of these aspects in July and has yet to hold more technical discussions regarding the individual elements."
"As far as decoupling is concerned, I can say that the delegations have expressed a great need for further information from the Commission in the form of impact assessments of the financial, social and regional effects of the proposal before a final position can be taken."
"On the other hand, some delegations support the fundamental principle of decoupling."
"They believe that it will allow farmers to focus on products that give them the best return on sales without having to keep an eye on the size of the subsidies given to the various products."
"At the same time, it is regarded as being an effective signal to send, both to consumers and to tax-payers."
"Finally, the countries also point out the negotiating advantages in a WTO context of the transition to a decoupled system."
"It could also be an important step towards obtaining understanding of the EU's other negotiating aims."
"As far as dynamic modulation is concerned, a number of ministers have welcomed the proposal in principle."
"They consider it to be a good way of securing the necessary funding to strengthen the priority objectives of food safety, quality, the environment and animal welfare and other important areas."
"Other ministers have criticised dynamic modulation on the grounds that in reality it means a progressive reduction in subsidies in real terms and because the model - apart from franchising and capping - does not take sufficient account of existing regional differences."
"Similarly, opinion varies between the delegations regarding the reduction of the first pillar subsidies and regarding how the modulated resources should then be distributed and the criteria according to which this should take place."
"I would like to comment on the more specific market sectors."
"We had a full debate on the main crops at the Council session in September and, although the Commission's overall direction was able to be supported to a certain extent, there were very clear specific proposals which met with substantial opposition."
"Various groups of delegations thus expressed strong arguments against a reduction in the intervention price for grain, removal of the monthly grain supplement, abolition of the intervention scheme as far as rye is concerned, the proposed changes to the arrangements for durum wheat and the proposed environmentally-friendly agricultural set-aside, as well as the Commission's proposed adjustment of subsidies for energy crops."
"The Commission's communication was also accompanied by detailed reports on rice, nuts and milk."
"The Council again had a full debate on these areas at its October meeting."
"With regard to rice and nuts, opinions were clearly divided along the obvious lines of whether or not one was a producer of the products discussed."
"As far as rice is concerned, however, there was initially broad agreement on the need for change in the sector - the adoption of the 'Everything But Arms' initiative makes this inevitable."
"However, a number of ministers from producer countries expressed dissatisfaction with the specific measures proposed by the Commission, while the non-producer countries regarded the Commission's proposal as a step in the right direction."
"With regard to milk, the Commission presented four options for the dairy sector for the period 2008-2015."
"The options were discussed with the result that it is unlikely that any of them - apart from option 3, i.e. that concerning a and c quotas - can be considered due to the uncertainty regarding compatibility with the WTO rules."
"In view of this it was deemed appropriate to consider the situation further."
"Where nuts are concerned, the producer countries clearly expressed a need for special subsidies in this sector."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's initiative to strengthen rural policy is welcomed by the Member States."
"As I have mentioned previously, however, there is no agreement on the choice of tools for achieving this objective and the debate in the Council revealed divergent attitudes on matters such as the choice of instruments and distribution of the resources."
"Nonetheless, the debate was extremely positive in the sense that there is broad agreement that something must be done in this area, including the fact that there is a great need for simplification of the arrangements, and the delegations have a number of ideas for improvements and for new measures in the slightly longer term."
"With regard to the farm audit, many delegations have generally expressed great interest in the Commission's ideas, again in principle."
"The majority of the delegations however feel that in the first instance it should be a voluntary system that is attractive to farmers, so that we can get as many as possible to use the scheme."
"We in the Council have thoroughly examined the Commission's communication on the mid-term review."
"The delegations have been given opportunity to ask questions, make comments, contribute new ideas, support or criticise all aspects of the Commission's communication and the reports accompanying the communication."
"In the light of this the Commission now has a solid basis for considering the Member States' wishes as regards future development of the common agricultural policy and also for drawing the necessary conclusions."
"Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, in view of all the decisions being made during this key phase of the enlargement process, I would like to support you in your call for us to continue with the reform of the common agricultural policy."
"However, and this is an important distinction, we are now talking about reforming the common agricultural policy as from 2007, which means that we will continue with the present policy up to 2006 and that Europe's agricultural sector will move forward on the basis of a reformed policy as from 2007."
"Commissioner Fischler, I think you need to assume that neither the timing nor the content of your proposals will be viable if we have correctly interpreted the compromise on direct agricultural payments negotiated in Brussels by the Heads of State and Government."
"In other words, it is now clear that the agreements reached at the Berlin Summit will remain in force until 2006, and that the most recent decisions provide a firm basis for planning by the EU's farmers up to 2013."
"This means that the candidate countries can certainly rely on increases in direct payments as from 2004."
"That, incidentally, formed part of the proposals presented by the Commission back in December 2001 on the financing of direct agricultural payments for the enlargement countries."
"The only difference, and this was already clear to us back then, is that the 100% compensation payments for all EU Member States in 2013 will no longer be matched by 100% financing capacity as in 2006."
"I think it must be clear to everyone that this will be lower by then."
"Every farmer in the enlarged European Union must be aware of that."
"In order to prevent mistakes, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats are, in a motion for a resolution tabled by all the groups in the European Parliament, requesting, for this reason among others, that unlimited budget rights and full codecision should be transferred to this House for agricultural matters."
"Mr President, I wish to table a point of order to ensure that note is taken of my indignation at the undemocratic method that the Presidency has pursued in this debate."
"We have been waiting here since 5 p.m. to start this debate, but the time management of the various presidencies has been thoroughly incompetent."
"And now you announce, Mr President, that the coordinators are to have the floor, followed by Commissioner Fischler and then the debate will be suspended, which means that the other Members who are scheduled to speak will have to do so after dinner."
"This, Mr President, is highly undemocratic and unworthy of this House."
"I wish my views to be recorded."
"Mr President, I would like to know whether I have understood you properly."
"The Group Chairmen will speak, then we will have the Commissioner's and the Minister's replies, and then the debate will be resumed at 9 p.m. without the Commissioner and without the Minister."
"Is that right?"
"Mr President, this is in no way a criticism of you personally."
"I would like to thank the Minister for his availability but I am going to withdraw my speech, for two reasons."
"Firstly, this Chamber has a certain dignity, and that dignity is manifested in the way we work."
"Secondly, agriculture is going through an extremely delicate period."
"We are a political assembly and, with my farming background, I find it absolutely unacceptable that we should deal with agricultural issues in this way."
"We will decide as a group how best to bring tonight's situation to the attention of President Cox."
"Mr President, I am sure there is not much we can do about tight schedules and fixed commitments, but if you had explained to the House from the Chair that Commissioner Fischler would have to be on board a plane by a certain time and for certain reasons, I am sure we could have avoided this conflict, because everyone would have seen sense."
"However, if you simply inform us that is how things are, you are bound to provoke some resistance from Members of this House, and quite rightly so, because it is an offence to our dignity!"
"We are not content for our views to be put to one side - we want to be involved in this decision, and we want to know what is going on."
"If you can take that on board, then I think we can have a reasonable dialogue with each other."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, whom I thank for her willingness to attend this sitting, I must say that I am one of those who believe that the Brussels Summit had the undeniable merit of unblocking enlargement's financial procedure and of setting the rules for agricultural funding for the next ten years."
"It would be a mistake, however, to confuse this funding stability with the status quo of the CAP."
"There are four reasons for this:"
"the first is that the CAP in its current form runs counter to the multifunctional approach to farming, which requires a substantial strengthening of its second pillar."
"And, unless this is achieved by means of transferring funds from the first pillar, I fail to see where we will find the resources to pay for this in the context of enlargement to 25, 27 and later perhaps even to 28 States;"
"the second reason is that defending the status quo of the blue box in WTO negotiations will cost us very dear."
"The price we might have to pay could be to make concessions on issues as important as access to the market, the protection of denominations of origin and even our own aid from the blue box;"
"the third reason is that we have, under the CAP, a system of aid that is truly schizophrenic."
"In other words, it provides aid for some farmers but denies it to others."
"This is unsustainable in the long term and must be changed for a system of aid that does not discriminate between products and producers and which remedies this imbalance;"
"the fourth reason for taking action is that the current system of aid is too complicated to be applied in a Union of 25 or 27 members."
"I believe that it would be preferable to undertake a balanced reform now, before 2004, which guarantees that the markets and their regulatory instruments will be managed, which guarantees Community preference and which guarantees aid for farmers, rather than to do so after enlargement, with the inherent risks of uncertainty about the negotiating and decision-making procedures in the first few years of the enlarged Union."
"Mr President, the common agricultural policy is out of date."
"It is urgently in need of reform if we are going to make a success of enlargement and of our commitment to open our markets to under-developed countries."
"Given the recent attitudes of the Council, the European Parliament has a heavy responsibility to give strong support to the Commission's proposals for a mid-term review."
"These, though not perfect, point in the right direction."
"Further market reform, with the decoupling of direct payments from production and the reinforcement of rural development, is most welcome."
"The proposals will put us in a stronger position in the World Trade Organisation negotiations."
"However, our Agriculture Committee is dominated by farmers and farmers' interests and it is blinded by two obsessions."
"The first is for protection against imported food and the second is for a guaranteed annual subsidy to be available to the farming industry as a whole."
"The concept of a really competitive European agriculture in the world market without subsidy is far from the Committee's thinking."
"The resolution pays lip service to reform but attaches so many conditions that I doubt whether the needs of enlargement, nor our obligations under the WTO, could be met."
"The agricultural policies should be redirected so that they encourage farmers to be more enterprising."
"Whatever financial assistance is given should not be seen as a right."
"It must be earned and in a manner that the public can accept."
"I would have liked to have seen the Commission proposals go further."
"We need to move towards world market prices by progressively reducing direct payments, we need to end quotas and make sure that the annual budget actually starts to reduce."
"It is ridiculous that 50% of our Community budget should be spent on a declining contribution to our GDP."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"President-in-Office of the Council, the Commission's draft mid-term review of agricultural policy is a sound basis for embarking upon the discussions of a future reform of the EU's agricultural policy."
"The decision on long-term funding, taken at the Brussels Summit, creates the background for enlargement."
"That is good and is something on which the Presidency should be commended."
"Any reform should be centred on farmers and consumers."
"It should be dynamic, and it should be a continuation of the liberalisation begun at the Berlin Summit in 1999."
"It should cover adjustments in response to the market economy and to world market prices and also, therefore, a curtailment of, and change to, the familiar policy of subsidy."
"The period up until 2006 should therefore be used for preparing a reform of the EU's agricultural policy that makes European farmers competitive in the future world market."
"Mr President, the reform process set in motion by the 1992 agricultural reform and continued by Agenda 2000 is to be carried forward and adjusted to reflect changing circumstances."
"The Commission's proposals are a basis for discussions after 2007, as a whole raft of issues and problems correctly identified in the paper remain to be resolved."
"Nevertheless, the common agricultural policy was successful, and those elements that made it successful still need to be defended."
"I am quite convinced that there will be major debates on the decisions reached by the Heads of State and Government in Brussels as regards how to deal with future expenditure under EU agricultural policy within the predetermined financial framework and including the ten candidate countries."
"Looked at in that light, the motion for a resolution is just a snapshot and not a reform paper."
"Freezing the agriculture budget at its 2006 level as from 2007 means an annual cut in agricultural support for farmers in the existing Member States, which will be hard or even impossible to achieve in 2003, the year before the elections."
"It will not be possible to reach a consensus to the effect that farmers should meet the cost of enlargement, yet it looks suspiciously as if that is what is intended."
"In her speech, the President-in-Office mentioned that there are proposals on the table for the milk sector."
"I would like to ask you, Madam President-in-Office, when you think these proposals will be implemented."
"Before 2008 or not?"
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate our committee chairman, Mr Daul, on what he has presented to us."
"However, this is not just Mr Daul's resolution, it has the support of the entire Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and I hope that tomorrow it will have the support of the entire European Parliament."
"Your personal achievement has been to bring together the various different tendencies in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and to document the European Parliament's desire to have a voice in the reform process."
"I would ask you, President-in-Office, to convey this to the Council, please."
"The European Parliament wants codecision here."
"It wants codecision as regards debates about content and form, and it wants codecision as regards financial resources."
"We do not want to end up with the sort of strange decisions made at intergovernmental conference level, with us being informed how much money is to be devoted to the agricultural policy, without anyone ever seeking to establish a link between the substantive reforms needed and their financial impact."
"We want codecision for both agricultural policy and finance."
"You were wise enough not to cap pillar two, because we would not have found that acceptable, but we need to achieve a situation in which the European Parliament also has sovereignty over finances in pillar one, and can also decide what the basic features of the agricultural policy are."
"I am pleased that we have support within the Commission and that in Commissioner Fischler we have someone who will advance the reforms in the direction this House has in mind."
"Mr President, I too acknowledge the presence of the President-in-Office and I want to thank the Commissioner for his openness and willingness to engage in continuing debate on the future of European agriculture."
"His proposals for reform were complemented by an equally thoughtful response from Parliament's Agriculture Committee and I join the previous speaker in complimenting the Chairman of our committee."
"To some extent this debate has now been superseded by the decision of the Heads of State to adhere to the decisions taken in Berlin."
"I have made the point on the number of occasions in this House that one of the greatest difficulties experienced by farmers is uncertainty - not being able to plan, even in the short term, for the development of their farms."
"Berlin was interpreted by farmers as setting the agricultural agenda, without adjustment, to 2006, and for this reason I believe the recent decision by the Heads of State was correct and restores to some degree of normality what was becoming a contentious issue for farmers."
"I welcome, in particular, the more long-term budgetary assurances to 2013 but feel that the 1% inflation provision should at least be index-linked."
"I am satisfied that the EU is committed to safeguarding the interests of its farmers and in this regard I believe that Commissioner Fischler has shown credible leadership."
"I would like to ask the Minister to clarify, in the light of recent decisions, the position with regard to decoupling and compulsory modulation."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy has given rise to enormous debate in Europe's farms."
"I welcome the fact that the Commission has presented this review on schedule, and I would specifically like to express my thanks for its forward-looking nature."
"However, I would like to stress and reiterate what the Commissioner told us - we should view this paper as a basis for a debate, a debate which we are all called upon to participate in."
"The Commission has proposed a broadly based approach to reform."
"There is still a substantial need for clarification and debate in many areas."
"The Brussels Summit on 24 and 25 October set the financial framework up to 2013."
"We now need to establish in good time what shape the agricultural policy of the enlarged Community should take."
"Mr Daul's motion for a resolution was voted on in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development after lengthy discussions between all the groups and many amendments."
"I would like to thank Mr Daul for his outstanding work and for his willingness to compromise."
"That is why I ask my fellow Members to vote for this motion for a resolution."
"We do not need to go into all that much detail today."
"I hope we will have sufficient opportunities to do that at a later stage."
"However, there are a few important points I would like to touch upon briefly."
"The idea of decoupling aids and cutting red tape sounds appealing."
"However, I cannot imagine either working in practice."
"We are talking about money for farming families and that means that there must be fair and measurable criteria for distribution."
"It seems to me that basing the future of our agricultural policy on historical values, as the Commission is proposing, is not very forward-looking."
"As regards rules, commitments and audits the Commission should be proposing a simple and efficient procedure for such audits."
"The idea of burdening farms with new and unnecessary formalities and costs is not acceptable."
"I hope that in December we will have an opportunity to discuss concrete proposals from the Commission on market organisations."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, I too should like first of all to offer my heartfelt thanks to the Chairman of the Committee, as he was able, in very special circumstances, to create a unanimously agreed and comprehensive basis on which to work such as this."
"My sincere thanks to you, then, Mr Daul."
"The EU's agricultural policy is now in a very special and difficult situation, in turmoil, in fact, with the approach of enlargement and in the context of the current WTO negotiations."
"For that reason, it is very important for us to be able to establish a very stable agricultural policy, one that trusts in and has faith in the future, especially as enlargement is also now a key issue."
"In their future proposals for regulations, the Commission should present criteria that take account of impediments due to difficult natural conditions as well as what is needed for the implementation of environmental programmes."
"The basis of environmental action, in particular, must be the reinforcement of existing programmes."
"The programmes need flexibility, for example, in determining levels of financing, so that Member States can decide how much funding they need for different actions with reference to their own individual circumstances."
"Mr President, farmers in the Member States of the European Union, especially the Mediterranean, are being called on to foot the bill for reform and enlargement, in that present hardships, miserly quotas and exorbitant levies will be compounded by dramatic cuts in what are already depressed prices for basic agricultural produce, with no compensation in return."
"This will have a tragic impact on the already severely eroded income of small and medium-sized producers, who will be forced to abandon the sector, causing agricultural production to shrink and eroding standards."
"The decision by the Brussels Summit to freeze EU agricultural expenditure at pre-2006 levels until 2013, enhanced by 1% per annum in inflation provision, translates directly into a reduction in appropriations."
"This is because they will be divided between 25 countries and because the allowance for inflation has deliberately been pitched low."
"Inflation is already twice that and is expected to rise once the 10 new countries join."
"The way in which the CAP is being applied to the candidate countries is totally discriminatory, with direct subsidies being meted out at a rate of 25% in the first year, rising to 100% in 2013, in other words when subsidies will be worthless."
"Finally, as a member of the GUE/NGL ..."
"(The president cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, President-in-Office, I would first like to sincerely thank the rapporteur, Joseph Daul."
"Like many of the previous speakers, I fundamentally welcome the fact that the European agricultural model is to be extended to a multifunctional agricultural sector in the enlarged European Union."
"This requires qualified external protection, and within the EU we still need markets to be regulated."
"However, although I fundamentally view the Franco-German unity that has emerged in the run-up to enlargement as a good thing, it does raise some issues for me."
"Although taxpayers and farmers already know how much money is to be spent up to 2013, they do not know on what."
"Germany's position as a net contributor will worsen simply because Germany's Federal Chancellor has locked us into the agreed financial framework for the agricultural policy from 2006 to 2013, with 25 countries."
"As we have heard again and again, and as the Commissioner has also told us, the reduction in compensation payments needed after 2006 will mean that less money will go to the agricultural sector than does now, and that applies particularly to Germany."
"I simply want to make that criticism clear."
"Incidentally, our Chancellor is not renowned for being the German farmers' friend!"
"The Commissioner for agriculture has put the net contribution to be made by the EU's farmers to financing enlargement at EUR 500 million in 2013."
"This amounts to the difference between the additional costs resulting from direct payments for the new Member States and the increase in agricultural expenditure approved by the EU Summit."
"This Commission calculation indicates to me that Europe's farmers will have to pay the lion's share of the burden of enlargement."
"The Commissioner for agriculture has repeatedly presented it as something positive that the Brussels Summit did not cap resources for rural development - that is to say, for the second pillar - but he can also tell us ?"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, we genuinely greatly appreciate the work of the Commissioner and the Commission in general on enlargement and rural development policy."
"It is a courageous undertaking, and the transfer of some of the resources supporting the market precisely to the poorer rural areas is timely and positive."
"As always, when one person benefits, many others suffer."
"The previous speakers have already mentioned the reasons for regretting decoupling and other technical aspects, which I will not repeat."
"I would, instead, like to focus on the positive side of these innovations, this courageous step, to address a point which is, I am sad to say, too often disregarded."
"In actual fact, this openness bodes extremely well for all those who are advocates of development in the outermost regions, particularly mountain regions."
"This section on rural development is extremely important but its importance is equally greatly overlooked."
"The word 'mountain' does not appear in the Commissioner's mid-term review, even though, just a couple of weeks ago, he dedicated a two-day seminar to mountain issues."
"As always, however, the debate was opened and closed without any progress being made."
"The word 'mountain' does not appear in the document we are discussing either, but mountain issues can quite easily be identified in Mr Daul's document."
"I congratulate Mr Daul heartily. For example, paragraph 1 of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's motion for resolution calls for the development of multifunctional farming."
"Mountain farming is a diverse and multifunctional typical form of farming."
"Paragraph 3, which calls for a more precise definition of the objectives of protection of the environment, public health and animal welfare, describes what have always been the parameters of mountain farming, what I would call endemic mountain farming."
"Above all, however, mountains are implicit in the section on rural development."
"Paragraph 17 calls for a range of measures differing according to the different types of farming regions. Again, paragraph 18 states that it is essential to preserve traditional family farms and support young farmers in less-favoured areas and the outermost regions."
"I regret to say that the remote location of mountain areas means that they are always outermost regions and certainly less favoured than the plains."
"Lastly, paragraph 20 calls upon the Commission to give priority in the distribution pattern to the less-favoured regions, to the regions which are most vulnerable and in need - I would add - not just of development plans but of an investment of trust."
"This is the situation of the European mountain regions, which make up 30% of Europe's territory and are home to 5% of its population."
"The mountains do not want to be a problem. They want their great potential to be a major resource for the whole Union."
"We must decide to call them by their name. We must have no hesitation in acknowledging their specific situation and, what is more, mention them by name in the new Treaty to give them an anchor and provide a legal basis on which to draw up an ad hoc directive."
"We must start work on a document which provides specifically and exclusively for the needs of the mountain regions."
"This could be the start of a radical reform which would improve the situation of the mountain regions and all the less-favoured regions, giving them the same opportunities for life and growth as the rest of the Community."
"I would like to thank our chairman, Mr Daul, once again, not least for giving me the cue to make these observations on a very important matter."
"Mr President, when Mr Fischler, the Commissioner for agriculture, tried to sell his reform proposals to professional associations and politicians in Luxembourg in September, he showed a great deal of understanding for the Grand Duchy's situation, which he classed as a special case, and stated, amongst other things, that if such special situations were to be reflected in the policy, which he wished to see, then it would be necessary to draw up tailor-made plans for Luxembourg, and his proposals made this perfectly feasible."
"Commissioner Fischler also assured Luxembourg on that occasion that he considered we had implemented the concept of rural development in an exemplary fashion, and in this respect he even said that nowhere else had EU resources been better invested."
"That is all very well and good."
"Of course, once the legislative proposals reflecting these ideas for reform are on the table, we will find out just how much we can rely on those statements."
"In Luxembourg, 70% of farms would be affected by the modulation proposed, that is to say by the progressive reduction in compensation payments by one-fifth, in addition to the expected drop in income because of cuts in producer prices and because of the mandatory 10% 'environmental set-aside'."
"This is unacceptable and would lead to the socially and environmentally unacceptable demise of family farms."
"Proposals that would achieve eastward enlargement by wiping out farmers belong in one place - the rubbish bin."
"I am able to vote for the compromise resolution that Joseph Daul has invested so much time and understanding in, even if it is with a heavy heart, Joseph!"
"The summit on 25 October agreed, thank goodness, that the common agricultural policy agreed in 2000 in Berlin up to 2006 would not be undermined by any radical changes before then."
"So we and the Commission have time to reflect."
"In any case, less favoured regions should be exempt both from the modulation and also from mandatory environmental set-aside."
"In conclusion, I would like to ?"
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, I should like to thank you very much for this opportunity to take part here today in the debate, which I have found both interesting and very constructive."
"I want also again to thank the European Parliament for its reading of the Commission's communication, and I understand that a decision may be made at the meeting tomorrow."
"I do not know if I might be permitted to concur in the praise accorded at the meeting here this evening to the chairman of Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development."
"I of course appreciate from the debate that the European Parliament has just as many approaches to European agricultural policy as I encounter in the Council of Ministers, and I therefore fully appreciate the difficulties that Mr Daul has been so extremely good at negotiating, as is apparent from the proposal now due to be voted on."
"Many people touched upon the issue of the prospects for reforming agricultural policy following the Brussels Summit."
"How will the policy eventually look? How long will the reforms take?"
"There are many outstanding issues but, with the conclusions adopted at the Brussels Summit, the European Council has clarified matters regarding the maximum expenditure on the market-related area and direct payments for the budget period up to 2013."
"In this context, I should like to draw attention to section 12, generally, of the conclusions, which in actual fact says three different things."
"First of all, it anticipates ceilings set for expenditure for market-related expenditure and direct payments, and not future decisions on the common agricultural policy."
"Secondly, it does not anticipate possible results following the implementation of paragraph 22 of the Berlin European Council conclusions."
"Paragraph 22 of the conclusions is the background to the mid-term review of agricultural policy, which we discussed at the most recent meetings of the Council of Ministers."
"Thirdly - and as a response, too, to some of the questions raised this evening - what is stated is without prejudice to the international commitments entered into by the European Union, for example in the launching of the next Doha Round, the ways and means of which are to be in place before the end of March of next year."
"As I also said in my first contribution, the negotiations in each of the three areas mentioned are continuing and will not necessarily be influenced by the fact that the European Council has now set a ceiling for the expenditure up until 2013."
"I shall not at this stage weary MEPs with a report on the Council's view of developments, but how far we get - and that is of course what is exciting and interesting: how far will we get in the individual areas? - completely depends upon the wishes of the individual Member States and upon what we can agree to in the Council of Ministers."
"Exciting tasks still lie ahead, therefore, and we look forward to completing these."
"I should like, however, again to say thank you for the sound cooperation we have had with the European Parliament. I hope that this will continue in the further discussions of the development of a European agricultural policy, to the satisfaction and benefit of both producers and consumers."
"Thank you very much, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Not only did you make an effort to remain in the House, but you also kept well within the speaking time allowed."
"That is quite extraordinary for the Council."
"You did not even use the full five minutes you were entitled to, which is greatly to your credit."
"Pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received one motion for a resolution."
"It is hardly surprising, given how the new common agricultural policy is taking shape in the run up to enlargement, that the rural population in the EU, and in Greece in particular, is gripped by anxiety, wondering whether they will be able to continue in their chosen profession, a profession which is so necessary and of such capital importance to the European economy and European society."
"And why?"
"Because overall subsidies in the agricultural sector will increase by 8% between 2006 and 2013, in the form of a minimal inflation provision."
"I should like to set this disturbing increase against a number of other post-enlargement increases in the EU, so as to give a more in-depth picture of future developments."
"Increase in Member States 65% (from 15 to 25)"
"Increase in Population 25% (from 370 to 470 million)"
"Increase in Rural land 43% (from 140 million to 200 million hectares)"
"Increase in Cultivable land 55% (from 77 million to 120 million hectares)"
"Increase in Farmers 165% (from 6 to 16 million)"
"And in return: I repeat, total agricultural subsidies will increase by a mere 8% up to 2013, not counting the integration of Bulgaria and Romania scheduled for 2007."
"What, one may ask, can our farmers expect ..."
"(Statement submitted in accordance with Rule 120 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"I think that first of all we must try to understand why North Korea decided to admit that it is producing nuclear weapons."
"What lies behind this declaration?"
"Is it an act aiming at dialogue as some seem to think?"
"Or is it a provocative act, an attempt to blackmail in order to get money in exchange for a behaviour - renouncing nuclear power - that it should adopt in any case?"
"Moreover, yesterday, North Korea reinforced its blackmail through another threat: it will re-start missile testing if it feels the negotiations with Japan are unsatisfactory."
"This is to say that, if North Korea does not obtain millions of dollars in exchange, it will not respect its promises, as it has already demonstrated on many occasions."
"How should we behave towards North Korea now?"
"It seems to me that, above all, we should have sent a clear message - things have changed and nothing will be the same."
"This is why I was against the decision to send a letter to North Korea to reconfirm the invitation for the Parliamentary delegation to come to Brussels this week."
"Maybe we should not have sent it since the invitation was turned down."
"The EU has little influence on North Korea."
"As we heard from Mrs de Palacio, our monetary contribution to KEDO is minimal in comparison with that of other partners."
"I think that the Commissioner was right to say that we must aim to develop cooperation between the actors in the area so as to oblige North Korea to respect international rules, although I doubt this will happen with the current regime still in power."
"The resolution which we are presenting today is built on those premises and is a result of a compromise reached by the major political groups in Parliament."
"I would have preferred it to be tougher on North Korea, but it still represents an acceptable compromise between the need to maintain an open dialogue and the necessity to press Pyongyang into giving up its nuclear and missile programmes."
"I hope that everyone will agree that it would be useful after yesterday's developments to move an oral amendment strongly condemning the new threat of renewed missile testing."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group welcomes the statement from the Commission."
"There is no final proof that they have weapons-grade plutonium available and, of course, I support the compromise resolution between a number of groups in this institution."
"We fully and firmly agree with the trilateral statement made by President Bush, Prime Minister Koizumi and President Kim Dae-jung at the APEC Summit meeting at the weekend calling on North Korea to dismantle its admitted uranium enrichment programme in a prompt and verifiable manner and to come into full compliance with all international obligations in conformity with North Korea's recent commitment in the Japan-North Korea Pyongyang Declaration."
"Nevertheless, we cannot be entirely blind to the fact that the 1994 framework agreement has not been fulfilled in its entirety by the US either."
"The first reactor from KEDO scheduled to be online by the end of next year is currently running seven years late."
"Deliveries of heavy fuel oil, the US contribution to KEDO, have, in the past at least, been sporadic."
"Most importantly, the US commitment in 1994 to normalise relations, lift the embargo on North Korea - which has been in place for 50 years - and lift the nuclear threat have still not been fulfilled."
"We welcome the North Korean offer to engage in dialogue on all outstanding issues, which may mean that this becomes an opportunity rather than a threat."
"We need to look at the issue of missile sales and testing, and the linked inevitable missile exports."
"We must look at the signing of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Convention by North Korea and outstanding problems around the issue of abductees from Japan."
"Also, of course, we must look for a continuation of the human rights dialogue."
"In the meantime, I hope that the EU, as the only entity with diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea, Japan, the US and with the DPRK, will help to initiate such a dialogue, if possible in concert with the other key actor in the region - China."
"We must maintain humanitarian aid and continue the training of North Korean technicians in Europe if only to take this opportunity."
"Two small corrections: firstly, Mr Gawronski said the North Koreans refused our invitation."
"This was not the case."
"They only had four days notice and asked for it to be postponed until a later date."
"Secondly, the meeting scheduled for 11 November 2002 will not now take place and I hope we can move an oral amendment to make the point more general in terms of wanting EU involvement at all levels in these discussions."
"Mr President, North Korea is a brutal, secretive communist dictatorship."
"It has a history of political assassination, blowing up the South Korean cabinet in Rangoon a few years back."
"It has blown up a South Korean civilian airliner. It has kidnapped innocent Japanese civilians, most of whom have died in mysterious circumstances."
"Most recently, it has starved many of its people to death due to its disastrous isolationist economic policies."
"It remains a failing and rogue state which means that the West, including the European Union, must tread very carefully in its attempts to engage with North Korea and bring it out of the cold."
"The DPRK agreed in 1994 to freeze and dismantle its nuclear programme, and by its recent admission of possession of nuclear weapons it has clearly breached the non-proliferation treaty and the agreed framework of KEDO."
"I believe it is right to call this regime part of the axis of evil."
"Unlike Iraq, which has yet to acquire nuclear weapons, it is now too late to do anything militarily to prevent its nuclear proliferation."
"Every pressure must be brought to bear to allow International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors back in."
"Pakistan, our ally in the war on terrorism, should also be challenged on its role in this weapons programme, as it allegedly provided an exchange for North Korean missiles to weaponise its own nuclear bomb."
"China's role needs scrutiny and that country must be reminded that it is officially opposed to the nuclearisation of the Korean peninsula."
"If the DPRK does not agree to reverse its policy and disarm in terms of its nuclear weapons then the whole KEDO contribution by the European Union should be terminated."
"I support placing the budgetary line as a first step in the reserve to be released according to diplomatic progress."
"Nevertheless, humanitarian aid must continue through the World Food Programme and ECHO."
"The European Union is one of the few bodies to have formal relations with this country and must use its leverage and access to its government to resolve this situation satisfactorily."
"Pursuant to Rule 37(2)"
"Commissioner, as you and the House are aware, the assembly of the 'Community of Democracies' will be held in Seoul from 10 to 12 November next, with the participation of government delegations from over 100 countries."
"It follows on from the first assembly of this group in Warsaw two years ago."
"This initiative seeks to promote political democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"The European Union, which dedicates a large section of its budget precisely to democratisation initiatives and initiatives seeking to promote human rights and the rule of law, has or is supposed to have a strategic line of upholding democracy as a guarantee of freedoms and of the best possible prospects of prosperity for entire peoples throughout the world."
"As we know, the Seoul assembly is a meeting of governments. The Commission will participate as an observer."
"Our question, Commissioner, is as follows: what contribution does the European Union - the Commission and the Member States - intend to make to the success of this assembly?"
"The Transnational Radical Party dedicated an entire congress to this issue last weekend, identifying two possible goals which I would like you to make your own."
"The first goal is to create a Secretariat for the Community of Democracies which will have the task of preserving and furthering the growth of this Community with a view to it becoming a genuine world democracy organisation."
"The second goal is for a Community of Democracies group to be created within every UN body, alongside the regional or other formal and informal groups of countries. This group would work to safeguard and promote democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights."
"For example, one subject for debate could be the progress of the Libyan Presidency in democratisation and respect for human rights. The next debate could be a similar debate on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights."
"Mr President, the Community of Democracies is a forum which was created in 2000 and, I am pleased to say, relaunched at the last Transnational Radical Party congress."
"It is a project in which the Group of the Party of European Socialists is greatly interested too, and we therefore want to emphasise the need for the Commission and the other Union organs to play an active role in the next conference, which, as you are aware, is due to take place in Seoul between 9 and 12 November 2002."
"In a world in which the threat of terrorism is increasingly accompanied by the danger that combating terrorism will lead to new cases of imperial dominance, it would appear essential that the alliance which the USA is attempting to build to fight what has been described as the axis of evil be opposed, although not necessarily antagonistically, by the Community of Democracies, an international body promoting peace and respect for freedoms which condemns all authoritarian tendencies on any side."
"The Community of Democracies is not another UN, for the UN has a different sphere of operation and different tasks. Nor is it an imitation of what is known as the coalition against terrorism, which, I am sad to say, includes some States which are not democratic."
"We call for the European Union to be more explicitly involved and for this Community, which seeks to promote democracy and freedoms, to become not just a forum for debate but a genuine international institution based on a binding agreement laying down, inter alia, clear criteria for accession."
"These criteria must include the respect for human rights by the 'good' States involved in combating terrorism too and the practical recognition of fundamental freedoms, starting with the equality of citizens before the law and the freedom of the press, which are currently being violated extensively even in the different Member States of the Union - a prime example being Berlusconi's Italy - and they must, in any case, be in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights which the European Union approved at the Nice European Council."
"Mr President, in light of the horrendous passenger ferry disasters which have taken place recently in the European Community, such as the Estonia and the United Kingdom cross-channel ferry tragedies, these reports are a very constructive and welcome step forward."
"I would like to thank my colleagues, Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya and Mr Poignant for all their hard work on these sister (or in this case brother) reports and in drawing up sensible conclusions for improved safety standards for ro-ro passenger ferries servicing European ports and domestic voyages within Member States."
"The time is clearly right to bring forward these directives, stability requirements and technical updates for these ships."
"Key to these directives is that the requirements we are now laying down are stricter than those laid down by the SOLAS 90 Convention, thereby ensuring that accidents of the magnitude we have experienced in the European Community will be much less likely to happen again."
"We must also endeavour to ensure full implementation of the directives."
"Alongside the proposed technical improvements, I particularly welcome measures to improve the safety of persons with reduced mobility."
"I support Mr Ripoll y Martínez de Bedoya's proposal for a narrower definition of the term 'reduced mobility'."
"I also welcome the proposed improvement and accessibility of signs aboard ship and the provision of alarm systems which are not only accessible to all passengers but which can be seen and heard by all passengers."
"Furthermore, I believe we must ensure that the crew manning these vessels are highly trained and able to brief passengers on safety procedures in more than one language so that unnecessary loss of life is prevented."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0338/2002) by Mr Lagendijk, on behalf of the Committee of Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy on the Commission's report on 'The Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe - First Annual Report'."
". (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me just begin by briefly outlining the most important points of my report again."
"I would like to say straight away that these points are nothing new."
"Many of these have already been discussed here before, but there are a number of issues that deserve additional emphasis."
"In the first place, aid granted to the countries of the Western Balkans needs to be linked to support."
"This is not the first time that this has been said, but I believe that it has to be stressed again."
"Cooperation with the international war tribunal at The Hague is not something which all countries can simply agree to and subsequently act as if that agreement does not exist."
"That is, and that ought to be, a genuine concrete condition which must be in place and continue to be for the granting of support."
"The same applies to another subject - the return of refugees - to which everyone agrees, but where practice has shown in this respect too that many countries do not deliver what they have promised or do not do what they ought to be doing."
"Finally, let us look at the fight against corruption and crime."
"Many fine words have also been uttered in this context, but unfortunately in practice it is shown that corruption continues to occur as far up as at government level, for example the last government in Macedonia."
"The European Union cannot continue to inject money into that region while that is going on."
"Another point in my report is the need to gain an insight into what will be the future of Kosovo."
"We cannot have the situation where Kosovo continues to exist whilst the Kosovans want something else, but we just hang onto the 1999 UN resolution."
"I do not have the solution, I do not know whether I am for independence or self-reliance, but I think that it is up to the European Union to start the discussion."
"Finally, two more points which Parliament is absolutely right to ask for, time and again, and which need attention."
"The first is the necessity to prepare education at all levels for a non-ethnic future."
"The school books are nothing to write home about."
"They are continuing to repeat the old patterns."
"That is not acceptable; it is the breeding ground for fresh conflict."
"Secondly, it is clear again, from all the elections, how important it is for the media to be independent."
"In almost all of the countries, the media play a disappointing role in the establishment of democracy and that must be brought to an end."
"I am going quickly through the points because I feel they are important issues - that have already been brought to the fore earlier by Parliament but not, unfortunately, looked at in sufficient depth."
"I am aware of the dangers to some extent and I would be keen to have an open discussion about these points with other Members and also with the Commission."
"We all, including the Commission and Parliament, run the risk of being hidebound by a pattern, a way of thinking and working with the Balkans which arose in the nineties, based on the greatest dangers which existed then."
"These were extreme nationalism and ethnic hatred."
"Although these problems have not yet disappeared, I believe that the situation has changed so much that the greatest problems now in our considerations and our way of thinking about the Balkans are not getting the attention they deserve."
"In my opinion, the relevant problems are economic and social crises, stagnation and a growing disappointment with the effects of democracy."
"At this very moment, there is the risk that our interest in the Western Balkans is waning."
"I only have to point out that we are sitting here in a Chamber that is almost empty."
"When we discuss enlargement, the room is full, when we discuss the Western Balkans, there is just a handful of people, the usual suspects, who are prepared to speak on this issue - and Europe simply carries on."
"This cannot continue; the European Union can no longer afford this."
"The budget for the Balkans is falling, from 900 million a few years ago to 500 million in 2005."
"This is why I was so impressed with a report which I have just received, entitled Western Balkans 2004 from the European Stability Initiative."
"This sets out in minute detail what the problems are now and what potential solutions the European Union should find to deal with them."
"One crucial observation is that the period of reconstruction is over."
"This has been reasonably successful and the EU has achieved a certain amount of success with it but now something else is needed."
"Industry has been decimated or allowed to decay."
"Many small businesses have grown in its place but have not been able to solve the problem of unemployment and there are absolutely no prospects for large sections of the population."
"Pursuant to this report, which I broadly support, what should that mean for the European Union, the Commission and Parliament?"
"I think that we must learn from the successes of the structural and cohesion funds."
"These have been successful in southern Europe and I think that the time has come to apply the methodology and the approach of the structural and cohesion funds also to the countries of the Western Balkans."
"For example, this would mean that the agency for reconstruction that we have had up until now ought to be turned into an agency for development."
"This will also have to mean that, after the current enlargement by ten countries, the remaining candidate member states and the countries of the Western Balkans will be brought together into one DG, because the problems of Bulgaria and Romania are not essentially any different to those of the Western Balkans."
"It will also have to mean that part of the pre-accession monies, which is soon only available for Romania and Bulgaria, can also be spent on the Balkans."
"More of the same is no longer enough."
"There is no point in having more and more sessions with the same people discussing the same policies."
"A genuine change of direction has to take place and this has to happen quickly."
"I am strongly in favour of such action and I make an appeal to the Commission and to each of us, the Members of this Parliament, to sit with each other and see what is now necessary for the Balkans."
"What we have done up till now has been successful but it is not sufficient for the future."
"Mr President, I too would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that this report emphasises, once again, that it is in the European Union's interests to proceed with all the policies which are useful and necessary to achieve integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European structures. I too believe that we must proceed with a policy which has yielded good fruit in recent years in terms of reconstruction and, in addition, consider the next step, which is the issue of democracy and legislation in those places."
"These countries lie at the heart of Mediterranean Europe, and it is therefore in the common interest of all the Community institutions, as well as our duty to the peoples living in the area, to provide the aid, decisions and related measures necessary to help these countries address what we feel are the current fundamental problems: problems in the field of education and training, combating organised crime, and, in particular, the endeavours to achieve democracy."
"The report highlights these problems clearly. It underscores them and emphasises the role of the European Union."
"It also highlights the attempts - hesitant but clearly being made - to establish greater legal protection, particularly where women are concerned - which I welcome - but that is not enough."
"This report displays the European Union's interest: it must be followed by more practical measures than those hitherto provided for."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, whenever we debate the crisis in the Balkans, which of course has now become a gentler, more correctly defined form of crisis, we are all the wiser for it."
"In this sense, today's report by Mr Lagendijk is a good report and we are all the wiser for having debated it."
"The situation in the region is indeed complicated, complicated from the political standpoint, from the social standpoint, and from the developmental standpoint."
"Our intervention in the Balkans, therefore, is not technocratic intervention, it is political intervention, because new institutions need to be built."
"Now that every institution has been destroyed, nations which have been in conflict need to be encouraged to communicate and the entire social, political and developmental environment needs to change."
"So our efforts have to be unwavering, they have to take an unwavering approach which avoids controversy and they have to be in keeping with UN resolutions."
"Any philosophy of change could give rise to renewed crisis."
"Secondly, the nations in the area need to make an effort to communicate with each other again; this will also foster economic development because these countries all used to support each other's economies."
"Thirdly, it is good that the countries in the area as a whole will soon all be members of the European Union, from Romania to Bulgaria, Austria, Greece and so on; in other words, there will be a positive impact on developments in these countries from all sides."
"And then we shall need to do our utmost, politically, to help these nations, which lived in peaceful coexistence for hundreds of years, to regain their historic foothold, to rediscover their modus vivendi, to rediscover the political union and common way of life which, unfortunately, have been upset over recent years by untimely movements and careless initiatives."
"Mr President, I find myself particularly irritated by the sections about Kosovo in Mr Lagendijk's substantial report."
"For instance, Paragraph 4 rightly calls for attention from the Council and the Commission for the political future of ancient Kosovo Polje."
"In this connection, the negative contribution from Belgrade is disappointing."
"According to Michael Steiner, UN representative for Kosovo, this city is like a hot potato which the Serbian leaders pass quickly on."
"I would be pleased to learn from the Council and the Commission of their experiences and of the efforts they have made."
"Meanwhile, the local elections of 26 October in Kosovo offered little encouragement as regards the Serbian contribution."
"A heavy price was paid for Belgrade's conflicting appeals for very limited participation on the one hand or, on the other, for everyone to turn up and vote."
"In fact, the boycott of the elections by the Serbian population of North Mitrovica meant a complete rejection of the very generous seven point plan proposed by UNMIK chief Steiner - a proposal that, however, actually wants to go a long way towards meeting the interests of the Serbian minority in a predominantly Albanian Kosovo."
"In the light of this, I find myself struggling with the highly idealistic composition of the rapporteur's amendment to Paragraph 40."
"Very sensibly, the original text of this paragraph urges a rapid end to the actual situation whereby the town of Mitrovica does not fall under the authority of UNMIK and the interim government of Kosovo."
"In concrete terms, that means the disappearance of parallel Serbian security and administrative structures, financed with Serbian money."
"And that is totally along the lines, and in the spirit, of Steiner's seven-point plan."
"In short, with a brief, factual addition - which referred to the seven-point plan - the rapporteur would have lent the paragraph more power of expression, for clarity and decisiveness on the part of the international community is for the benefit of all Kosovan inhabitants for the sake of their collective future."
"How do the Council and the Commission feel that they can, within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe, lend support to Steiner's noble efforts to make Mitrovica into 'a normal European town'?"
"Mr President, Joost Lagendijk's report covers a great many issues, and we cannot comment on all of them here."
"However, I would like to start by saying that I totally support it, and that applies equally to my group."
"This part of Europe is a multi-speed region."
"Some countries, such as Macedonia and Croatia, already have agreements; theirs are stabilisation and association agreements, although that does not of course necessarily mean that all the conditions are being complied with in detail."
"Joost has already listed the deficits."
"It is, however, with some satisfaction that we can consider Albania, a country which has managed to make up for the fraudulent elections held in 2001 by electing a consensus president, something very few people expected, including the Commission."
"We would now like to see an early start made on the negotiations around this process, although we know that it will not be concluded rapidly, as there is still a lot of homework to be done."
"Turning to Bosnia and Herzegovina, it has to be said that this country is struggling to square the circle."
"I am referring to the Dayton Agreement."
"I simply wish to say, for example, that 67% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's entire budget is spent on ministers' salaries. There are over 120 ministers who only exist because they are virtually stipulated in the Dayton Agreement."
"Something has to be done about this and the last elections were a warning signal."
"Serbia and Montenegro's President and Prime Minister are squabbling with each other instead of jointly fighting for their country."
"Serbia and Montenegro should now be finding a joint path towards European membership, and the Solana proposal, no matter how limited it may be, is at present the best and the only way forward."
"With regard to Kosovo, which I visited again just last week, I can only say that we should be able to make sure that its peoples can coexist, thus making Serbian enclaves unnecessary."
"They have many problems in common."
"There are ethnic tensions in some countries, there are unsatisfactory refugee return arrangements, there is the battle against trafficking in human beings, which is also unsatisfactory, and there is corruption."
"Only one thing is clear, and that is that we must not back off from our commitment."
"That is the litmus test for our credibility."
"As Joost has already said, we need to have a precise idea of what we wish to achieve in this region in the near future."
"Mr President, as always Mr Lagendijk's report is excellent, comprehensive and prudent."
"I genuinely believe that the Stability Pact and the Stabilisation and Association Process have chalked up a lot of successes overall."
"Some of these have already been mentioned, such as the elections in Macedonia and developments in Albania, although I have to say that I have heard that the consensus reached between the major political groups in Albania is now at breaking point."
"I would, however, like to comment on some of Mr Lagendijk's fundamental observations, because they seem very important to me."
"You mentioned the debates on enlargement and the debates on the Balkans."
"I was present at both debates today, and I was also at the enlargement debate, at which President Prodi made a statement that I consider to be very important."
"He pointed out that the enlargement process with the ten new countries and also with the subsequent applicant countries has not yet been completed, and that this gives an important signal to the Balkans in particular."
"I believe, and I also stated this in my own speech, that our experience with preparations for enlargement must act as a signal - and this applies to the Balkan countries too - that countries that advocate democracy, the rule of law, protection of minorities and human rights have a chance of joining the European Union at a later date."
"I believe that we need to consider now how we are to manage the organisational requirements."
"As I see it, the Stability Pact - and this is Mr Bussek's intention in his role as Special Coordinator - needs to become more focused, with a reduced role and tasks being increasingly transferred to the Commission. This should not, however, take place outside the enlargement process, but should come in at the latest with effect from 2004/2005, when the new Commission will meet in accordance with the enlargement process."
"I accordingly believe that we in this House need to give the Balkan countries a signal, or rather hope, that they too have a place in Europe, bearing in mind the Zagreb II Summit also."
"It will then be up to them to decide if they wish to do all this so as to effectively secure a place in Europe."
"Mr President, South Eastern Europe, or if you like the bankrupt estate of the former Yugoslavia, which was torn apart by bloody ethnic conflicts, putting Albania to one side, is essentially the parade ground for the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"It is also its most severe test."
"Our efforts to provide these countries with economic and political support are much needed."
"We certainly should not put them on the back burner because of the enlargement of the European Union."
"In fact it is that very prospect of a future in Europe that we need to hold out to them."
"That is the purpose of the Stabilisation and Association Process for South East Europe."
"I consider the rapporteur's proposal that priorities should be set an extremely sensible one."
"Kosovo's final status needs to be clarified as a matter of urgency, as does the structure of Serbia and Montenegro in terms of constitutional law."
"Until we have done that, it will simply not be possible to enter into negotiations on an association agreement."
"The ill-defined status of Kosovo is a latent source of uncertainty."
"It means that business has no trust whatsoever in the situation and that there is inadequate investment."
"This leads in turn to an increase in corruption and to a growing trend towards emigration, in other words migratory pressure that we in Austria are particularly, but not exclusively, sensitive to."
"One of the most important conditions, and this applies to the entire region, is to impose the rule of law, and to fight corruption and organised crime."
"One very positive step here has been the creation of the Regional Centre for Combating Transborder Crime in Bucharest, and this centre will be represented at the relevant conference in London on 25 November."
"We visited this centre in Bucharest together with Dr Swoboda, and I should perhaps mention that those who work there include Austrian customs and police officials."
"It would be good if this centre had more input from Europe and not just from America."
"Another point I consider important is that under its Special Coordinator, Erhard Bussek, the Stability Pact has taken a great many political initiatives."
"It should be possible for this work to continue, and we need to achieve rapid agreement both in the Council and in the Commission on appropriate budgets for and extension of the Stability Pact."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0354/2002) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the first progress report on economic and social cohesion (COM(2002)46 - C5-0198/2002 - 2002/2094(COS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic and social cohesion is at the very heart of the European Union."
"It offers the prospect of sustainable, harmonious and at the same time policentric development for the EU as a whole."
"The current debate is about the European Union of the future, be it a Union of 25 or even 27 Member States."
"This Union's commitment to integration will only continue to be credible if there is a corresponding willingness to jointly accept responsibility for the European social model in a spirit of solidarity."
"Our starting point has to be the assumption that the public's view of Europe does not depend on their regional and social position and is being tackled as a joint political exercise by all the Member States. We further need to assume that all our citizens are being given comparable opportunities and that we are not living our lives at the cost of the next generation."
"Nevertheless, it would be an illusion to believe that we have substantially more money available for this task than is currently the case."
"That is why it is our job to develop a concept which will function in line with the basic principles I have mentioned and which can at the same time manage with the same financial resources, in relative terms."
"While my report was going through its various stages in this House, I found I received different answers to these questions."
"One group says we should fight to make sure that everything is acceptable to everyone, and that everything will resolve itself later on."
"Others say that everything is acceptable as long as their own constituency does not lose its privileges."
"They demand solidarity for their constituency but they are not willing to participate in a wider solidarity."
"There are others again who do not accept the European social model anyway, and who welcome this dispute."
"And there are those who dare not tell the truth and accept the consequences."
"The truth is that we need to start to plan now if we want to make the first payments to the regions on 1 January 2007."
"No one can talk their way out of that one, because we know that two years are tight enough as it is."
"Everyone knows what the central issue is: how do we define the poorest regions of the European Union?"
"The main principle of economic and social cohesion is that those areas that have the most catching up to do should receive the most support."
"However, as I see it, the concept of solidarity becomes meaningless if we repeatedly invent new criteria in order to ensure that our own constituency receives the support that is really intended for the poorest regions."
"In any case, that is short-term thinking."
"Widening the criterion in force and recognised up to now, according to which any regions with a GDP below 75% of the Community average are considered the most needy regions, will have a number of consequences. Firstly, it will mean that everyone will receive less money, that the phasing-out process will not continue, and that special regional support for the unemployed or for rural areas will no longer be possible."
"Another consequence will be that we will simply have to pump support into genuinely disadvantaged regions like those in Eastern Europe over a longer period."
"Another possibility is that constituencies that require intervention at present will suddenly become net contributors."
"The study by the German Institute for Economic Research indicates that this would happen in three years."
"The worst consequence of this plan and of this short-term thinking would be that it would mean the end of solidarity."
"In that case we would have nothing left at all, because we would have no plan and economic and social cohesion would be an empty cliché."
"I come from an Objective 1 region that would lose its status for statistical reasons if we strictly observed the 75% criterion, and yet I am convinced that generous phasing out would make it possible for that region to solve its development problems."
"If we in Parliament establish a cornerstone for the Structural Funds of the EU of the future, with clearly defined Objective 1 regions, we will on the one hand oblige the Commission to follow where we lead and on the other hand we will be issuing a challenge to the Council."
"I would like a roll-call vote on this tomorrow."
"There are two things on which we can agree."
"One principle we agreed upon was that of 'one programme - one fund'."
"This is an effective concept for simplifying the management of the Structural Funds."
"We have also agreed to support the Commission's idea of tripartite contracts with the regions and Member States for the implementation of structural policy measures, so as to facilitate the participation of local stakeholders."
"I hope that this means we will be supporting an efficient and successful concept and not undermining solidarity within Europe."
"Mr President, the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy focuses on the need to examine cohesion policy in terms of its effect on intergovernmental relations and on how countries view the European Union."
"Obviously, what is most important is that the economic and social imbalances between the new and the old Member States can be effectively diminished."
"Enlargement, however, must not lead to a situation where regional policy in the most disadvantaged regions of the current Member States is wound down."
"Other factors besides figures for GDP have also to be taken into account, such as regional climate, remoteness, sparse population and the unemployment rate."
"At the same time differences in living standards on the Union's new external borders must also be reduced."
"The Committee on Foreign Affairs would like to remind everyone that every European state that meets the conditions of membership has the right to join the Union and would like to stress how important it is to assist them in preparing for membership."
"As the European Parliament's northernmost Member, I know how important these proposals are in practice."
"EU enlargement will do nothing to improve the relative position of Lapland or other peripheral regions of Finland and Sweden."
"Actually, it is more likely to weaken it, as the wealthiest regions will reap the benefits of enlargement."
"The northern areas of our neighbour, Norway, are now experiencing vigorous economic development as a result of investment in energy and sound regional policy."
"In circumstances such as these EU regional policy must not be watered down, but should be strengthened in accordance with the principles underlying the Northern Dimension."
"Our other neighbour, Russia, has many problems that threaten our wellbeing and security."
"The EU therefore has to become more effective beyond both the current and the future external border, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs suggests."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group on the report on economic and social cohesion, I would like to thank Mrs Schroedter for her work, although there are still a number of points which, by agreement with my group, I am seeking to modify by tabling a series of amendments which I hope the rapporteur will be able to accept."
"In particular, I feel that it is premature to ask the Commission to produce a proposal on the future of the Objective 2 regions and the future of Community initiatives even before the third report on economic and social cohesion is published, not least in that the time frames necessary for an in-depth analysis to be carried out by December 2003 - Commissioner Barnier's deadline for presenting the report - have not been established and we have not been provided with the necessary information."
"We would prefer to be able to take the time necessary to work on reforming cohesion policy, in other words to work according to the time frames specified by the Commission, avoiding, above all, hasty conclusions being drawn which will not benefit the regions and will benefit the new Member States still less."
"Next, I would like to point out that, in an enlarged Union, some of the Objective 1 regions will automatically statistically exceed the threshold of 75% of the average Union GDP without this representing any genuine increase in development."
"In this respect, in line with what was decided in the second report on economic and social cohesion, for which I was the rapporteur, I feel it is inadequate to take GDP as the only indicator."
"Other criteria, including, in particular, the unemployment rate, should be taken into account."
"We also believe that the Union's policies and the sectoral policies of the Member States must focus on the achievement of cohesion objectives and sustainable development plans for the regions."
"Lastly, we will vote against paragraphs 16 and 22, for they are repetitions of paragraphs already included in the rapporteur's text."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that this report, for which I would like to thank the rapporteur very sincerely, is a refinement of the Musotto report that we adopted at the beginning of the year."
"To be more precise, this report is about the direction Parliament wishes to go in."
"I am quite willing to admit that we have not totally achieved that, because there is still too much in this report, but I still think that it is a good one."
"All in all, I do not think the picture is as black as the rapporteur has painted it."
"In this report we have once again emphasised certain points that have already been identified, such as our rejection of any renationalisation of structural policy."
"We have also once again made it clear that regions currently benefiting from support will have to accept cuts; we do not want to pull the wool over anyone's eyes about this."
"However, we have also managed to clarify some points in this report."
"I disagree totally with the previous speaker on this, because I think it is very important for the Commission to make proposals at this stage about how it will move forward with Objective 2."
"People are waiting for a signal in Objective 2 regions too, and we cannot just concentrate on Objective 1 in our discussions."
"The same applies to Community initiatives."
"This is also an important area where we need to either clarify matters or at least identify a recognisable direction."
"How will the Community Action for Border Regions be continued?"
"And how will action on cities move forward?"
"And rural areas?"
"I would like to stress two more points of great concern to me."
"One is that the programme must be scheduled to start so that funds are actually available on 1 January 2007, and, equally important, we need a more coherent approach, and in that regard we need to send a signal to the Commission that it should at long last achieve greater coherence between individual policy areas."
"My final point is this: I believe, and my group has also taken a decision to this effect, that for Objective 1 we should neither establish a fixed criterion nor a fixed percentage."
"We need to make a decision on the basis of concrete proposals, and the Commission is in the process of drawing something up."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, even if this is just an interim report to be produced every three years, it should be used not just to take stock, but also to give an overview of the next planning period."
"It is quite right not to go into detail and not to give precise figures, but the key points need to be identified and central issues need to be resolved in good time."
"One of these central issues is the 0.45% share of the Union's GDP set aside for cohesion policy, which may not be exceeded even during EU enlargement."
"Another central issue is treating the regions as a reference unit for cohesion policy tasks and not nation-state criteria."
"Anyone who would like to see anything else is missing the point."
"A further central issue is the concentration of support on disadvantaged regions in an enlarged EU with clear, transparent and quantifiable criteria for the concept of 'poor regions'."
"These and these alone can be dependent on the 75% criterion."
"Any other factors taken as a basis for measurement cannot be clearly quantified and open the way to arbitrary decision-making."
"This even applies to a criterion such as unemployment, for which there is no EU-wide definition and which is therefore bound to lead to inaccurate estimates."
"When it comes to supporting disadvantaged regions, we first need to consider those regions with less than 75% of EU GDP."
"But those regions that will be lifted over the 75% threshold after enlargement, becoming 'statistically wealthy', also need to have a more generous phasing-out arrangement."
"We wish to see regions receiving more support the closer they are to the 75% threshold."
"In this respect I agree with the rapporteur, who has tabled an amendment on this point."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the final version of Mrs Schroedter's report, as adopted in committee, throws up some interesting views and proposals."
"I am thinking in particular of the extended partnership which the report supports in the form of tripartite contracts with the regions and Member States."
"I think this proposal is a daring move; it will make it easier to apply the principle of subsidiarity and cut out a lot of unwanted red tape."
"We should also be encouraged by the fact that the most efficient programmes have been those based on maximum participation."
"Any innovation, however, needs to be introduced carefully, under some sort of failsafe procedure, if we are to avoid rocking the boat and ensure that financial prudence under the Community budget is left well alone."
"I therefore think it would be advisable if the Commission were to fine tune this proposal, so that we can evaluate how and to what extent it can be implemented in the initial phase and then go on to examine application guidelines for it."
"We shall also have to monitor the implementation of this extended partnership closely, in tandem with the potential for decentralisation of each Member State, both old and new."
"I should also like to point out that, despite the simplifications and changes decided under Agenda 2000, there is still a serious take-up problem and appropriations are not turning into payments."
"So what do we conclude from all this?"
"Do we need to keep simplifying procedures or is there perhaps a deep-seated structural problem which the Commission and Member States need to address?"
"Has Community funding perhaps become so complicated that it no longer holds any attraction for investors?"
"To close, may I point out that this matter deserves our serious attention, especially in the run up to enlargement, which will obviously exacerbate the take-up problem in that our new partners will also have to deal with difficulties caused by their lack of experience in applying the acquis communautaire."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Mrs Schroedter for drawing up an important report."
"Measures to achieve economic balance have been inadequate."
"Differences in levels of prosperity between regions have even increased to some extent."
"Differences in levels of unemployment have also to be taken into serious consideration when planning regional and structural policy."
"Commitment on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises to projects, and targeting structural actions at the most disadvantaged regions are important areas of emphasis."
"Furthermore, regional development must be supported by other areas of policy, such as agricultural, taxation and transport policy."
"I agree with many of the other speakers that GDP is not the only criterion to use when determining eligible areas."
"Permanent handicaps due to difficult natural conditions must equally be taken into account."
"For example, an exceptionally sparse population, migration, an ageing population, long distances, and a cold or hot climate cause permanent problems."
"In the future we shall have to pay very special attention to the issue of strengthening rural vitality and diversity."
"If Union enlargement is to take place, cohesion policy will need to be strengthened."
"At the same time we have to remember that regional differences are not going to disappear because new poor regions will be joining the Union."
"Enlargement must not come about at the expense of the more disadvantaged areas but through united efforts."
"As Mr Caveri said, the simplification and clarification of regional and structural policy also remain a continual challenge."
"The administrative load must be lightened, for example, by switching to the 'one fund' principle."
"It is important that all the Union's resources should be efficiently utilised, even in the remotest regions."
"Together we must ensure that the whole of the area of the Union is included in the single market and enjoys the benefits which that brings with it."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, this report forms a link between three major processes: the revision of cohesion policy, the reform of the CAP and the completion of the process of unifying and enlarging the Union."
"The future of Europe will depend to a large extent on how the three major processes interact, and the extent to which the European Parliament succeeds in influencing these processes will determine the extent to which its role of codecision is a proper political role rather than just a formality."
"The debate has only just begun, and I am pleased to say I have just three points to make today."
"Firstly, cohesion policy must remain one of the driving forces of the European Union. Secondly, the need for cohesion support cannot be determined on the basis of the unfair, unreliable, misleading parameter of GDP."
"We call upon the European Commission to specify new parameters - unemployment, infrastructure and quality of the environment - which are more correct indicators throughout the Union."
"We in this House want to help you."
"Thirdly, the implementing phase of Agenda 2000 must be monitored carefully, not just as regards quantity and expenditure but also as regards quality."
"Preparing our regions for enlargement means also and above all using these funds to increase the competitiveness of our human and social capital."
"Mr President, Madam Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, in this speech, I shall restrict myself to discussing the key political issue underpinning the future of cohesion policy."
"This, as I am sure you can work out, concerns the amount of funds to be allocated to this crucial pillar of the process of European integration during the period 2007 to 2013."
"This is a key political issue because Europe will only be viable if it is founded on a project of solidarity towards its most disadvantaged regions; the European Union will not succeed on the basis of excessive regional disparities."
"By subscribing to the Franco-German agreement on the freezing of common agricultural policy spending until 2013 on the basis of spending in 2006, the last European Council, held in Brussels, makes the assumption that the same principle of freezing could also be applied to funds earmarked for cohesion policy."
"In other words, the same Union budget that has served a Europe of fifteen countries will also have to serve a Europe of twenty-seven."
"To this we can add the end of the illusion that the savings made from the CAP could be channelled into cohesion policy; not forgetting that strengthening the rural development of the CAP has been extremely difficult and the CAP, as we know, has a cohesion-based approach."
"It could be said that a cohesion policy that is funded to an approximate value of 0.45% of Community GDP would already be a major achievement."
"At least scenarios of renationalisation, which have been brewing in some countries where cohesion policy is concerned, would be averted."
"Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise the lack of resources, which endangers the future existence of a balanced cohesion policy that on the one hand does not ignore the cohesion deficit that still exists in today's European Union of fifteen and on the other, that is equal to the task of the greatest challenge ever set for the process of European integration."
"I would also emphasise, with regard to this matter and in conclusion, the contrast with the recent past, when financial resources for cohesion have been doubled where other major challenges have arisen."
"Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on this very important report."
"The RETT committee amendments are in line with the conclusions of the Musotto report, particularly on the need for a cohesion policy which will improve existing and future disparities between European regions in an enlarged Europe."
"In this context, I would highlight and support Amendment 12 which recognises the need for a generous phasing-out period for those regions which may no longer qualify for Objective 1 support but which may still need this level of funding."
"My own peripheral region has received only 10% of all EU funding to Ireland over the past 30 years and is therefore still seriously under-developed in terms of infrastructure."
"I cannot, however, support paragraph 16, nor part of paragraph 17."
"I believe they could lead to a by-passing of national government responsibilities and duties."
"Finally, in the context of enlargement, the EU must ensure adequate aid for family farmers - the backbone of our rural communities - and, in addition, specific aid to young farmers to ensure the survival of our rural communities and our agricultural sector."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m."
"Completing the internal market"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on completing the internal market."
"I suggest we begin with the Commission. We shall now hear Mr Bolkestein."
"Mr President, it is sometimes easy to forget what has been achieved since 1992."
"Many of us no doubt remember the sight of lorries being stopped at our internal borders, their loads inspected and paperwork stamped."
"The chances of winning a public procurement contract in another Member State were then about as high as winning the national lottery."
"Setting up a European banking or insurance network was virtually impossible because of different regulatory requirements."
"The cost of a telephone call was extraordinarily high, and the quality of service was often poor."
"Cross-border banking fees were astronomical."
"Consumers simply got a bad deal."
"Our citizens were continually frustrated in their efforts to obtain residence permits to live in another Member State or to have their professional qualifications, for example as a doctor, recognised."
"More competition and productivity gains have helped to create many new jobs that would not have been created without the internal market."
"The Commission will soon publish figures on the employment gains and growth effects of ten years of the internal market."
"These gains have been achieved even though important gaps remain within the legal framework."
"We face a choice as we look towards the future."
"The choice is between an ever more dynamic internal market, which will remain an engine for more jobs and affluence in both the old and the new Member States, or an internal market which fires on only one or two of its cylinders, and which will be increasingly exposed to corrosive forces."
"If we choose the latter, we might just as well give up on our Lisbon objectives."
"A decade ago, there was much steam behind the internal market programme."
"Today, there seems to be far less appetite for taking difficult political decisions."
"Even during the last two years, when times were good, we have accumulated a delivery gap."
"The Community patent, COMPAT, is perhaps the best example."
"How can the Council seriously say that it wants Europe to become the most competitive economy in the world if it is not willing to adopt this critical measure for innovation and growth?"
"The Competitiveness Council will have another go at resolving COMPAT's problems next week, but my patience is wearing thin."
"We need to create an internal market worthy of the name also in services."
"The services sector constitutes a full 70% of all our economies and unfortunately it is still rife with barriers."
"Make no mistake, once we tackle these barriers, the vested interests will again make themselves known and call on Members of Parliament and ministers to defend the status quo."
"We shall need the Parliament's strongest support to overcome that resistance to change."
"Some erosion has also slipped into our framework for the free movement of goods."
"Mutual recognition, one of the bases of the internal market, is not working as well as it ought to."
"National marking often acts as a hidden barrier to trade."
"In some important industrial sectors, there are not nearly enough European standards."
"These weaknesses in the foundations of the internal market will be exposed even more strongly after enlargement."
"We need an integrated capital market that is capable of channelling today's savings into tomorrow's investments."
"We need to strengthen corporate governance, taking due account of the ideas expressed in the recent Winter Report of high-level company law experts chaired by Professor Jaap Winter."
"We must offer our companies the flexibility to organise themselves on a continental scale, including through takeover bids."
"We need to remove tax obstacles, which add unnecessarily to the costs of doing business."
"We need to open up further the network industries."
"We need to deal with the pension time bomb."
"We need better and simpler rules."
"Rules need to be transposed on time and correctly."
"We talk about biotech as one of the growth sectors of the future of Europe. But only six Member States out of fifteen have now transposed the directive on the patentability of biotechnological inventions."
"This transposition was due 18 months ago, so nine Member States have stepped out of line and are lagging behind in this area."
"Overall, the transposition deficit for internal market directives is moving away again from the 1.5% target set by the European Council."
"We have our work cut out. I know that none of this is easy."
"Taking decisions will probably become even more difficult in an enlarged European Union."
"There is a real risk that the delivery gap will grow wider unless we begin to act strategically by putting the European Union's long-term interests before narrow sectoral interests, which oppose change."
"We have the strong support of our citizens and businesses."
"Next week, the Commission will publish the results of a major survey on ten years of the internal market."
"I can already tell you that the survey shows that 77% of our citizens and 84% of our businesses feel that the internal market has been a very positive force in their lives."
"They want the internal market to serve them even better in the future."
"At the level of the Parliament, the Commission is eagerly awaiting the forthcoming report on the internal market strategy, for which Mr Harbour is the rapporteur."
"I expect the report to be ambitious and hard-hitting."
"The recent creation of the Competitiveness Council also represents a welcome opportunity to make progress."
"Ten years after the removal of our internal borders, one year into the euro, and on the eve of enlargement, now is the time for a major new push to improve the internal market."
"I count on the Council's and Parliament's support to work towards an ambitious medium-term internal market strategy, which the Commission aims to present by next April."
"If we act decisively, the best is yet to come."
"- (DA) Mr President, Commissioner, it is a great pleasure to have this opportunity to discuss the state of affairs regarding the internal market, and the impetus behind it, with the European Parliament."
"I am sorry that I was a little late."
"The EU is currently facing great challenges."
"We have to manage the forthcoming enlargement by ten new Member States, and at the same time we still have to carry out a number of reforms in order that the EU is able to function as an economically robust global player."
"As President-in-Office of the Council, I have chosen to discuss the state of affairs regarding the completion of the internal market with you today, as I consider it crucial that we have a true internal market encompassing all of the new countries, and, at the same time, an economy which can compete at external level: in the spirit of the ambitious Lisbon vision."
"The European Parliament of today is a major co-legislator in matters concerning the development of the internal market."
"As President of the Competitiveness Council, therefore, I feel that this is a natural and particularly necessary topic for discussion with Parliament today."
"It is 15 years since the idea of an internal market was put on the agenda."
"It is nearly ten years since the wheels were set in motion."
"The internal market is one of the most ambitious goals ever set in the history of the EU."
"In the sectors in which we have reached our goals, the benefits for European consumers and businesses have been tremendous."
"The internal market has brought more and better products at lower prices, freedom of movement across borders, and especially an increase in competitiveness."
"At the same time, however, we note that there are unfortunately still many difficult issues that need to be resolved before the internal market is complete."
"The Danish Presidency has chosen to accord this area top priority."
"This is firstly because a fully operational internal market is a key element in the EU's competitiveness, economic growth and employment."
"Secondly, the development of technologies and markets necessitates the removal of the remaining barriers to cross-border trade."
"Thirdly, increased economic globalisation requires swifter action on structural reforms."
"It is of crucial importance to have product and capital markets which function well."
"The internal market must be able to deliver what our citizens expect of it: a wide selection of products and services that are of high quality, safe, and reasonably priced; and also freedom of movement across internal borders without unnecessary red tape."
"The forthcoming enlargement is vital."
"The candidate countries are working hard in order to be ready for accession."
"I am fully confident that they will do their utmost to cope with the legislation we have adopted over many years, and it is our responsibility to assist them as best we can - even after their accession."
"There is great potential in a newly enlarged internal market - for both citizens and businesses."
"An internal market with 100 million more consumers in fast-growing economies will mean faster economic growth and more jobs in both the present and the future Member States."
"A 2001 study by the Commission shows that enlargement will lead to an increase in the candidate countries' GDP of between 1.3% and 2.1% per annum."
"For the existing members, the overall increase in GDP will be 0.7%."
"The growth potential of the forthcoming enlargement will depend on whether we can push through the structural reforms which are still lacking."
"One of the greatest challenges we face is the completion of the internal market in the areas in which it is not functioning as intended."
"The services sector is vital to European growth: two out of three jobs are in this sector, and the private and public service industries account for 70% of EU GDP."
"The Commission's report on barriers in the internal market for services shows that there are many barriers of both a legislative and a non-legislative nature."
"We must find a solution to this."
"As soon as the Commission has submitted its proposals, the Council and Parliament must consider how the remaining barriers can be removed as quickly as possible."
"The internal market for financial services is also extremely important."
"In the face of global financial markets, regulation must take place at EU level."
"The economic benefits of the implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan have been analysed by the so-called 'Gyllenhammer group', amongst others."
"The analysis suggests that financial integration will bring about an annual increase in growth of up to half a per cent of GDP."
"I note with pleasure that 30 proposals have now been adopted, including four of the eight proposals mentioned in the conclusions from the European Council meeting in Barcelona."
"Freedom of movement for persons and businesses is also essential."
"Increased mobility is crucial to maintaining a good rate of growth while at the same time avoiding bottlenecks in parts of the European Union."
"Many changes to company law, among other things, have been implemented, but a need for further harmonisation has become apparent in the light of such things as the Enron scandal."
"The package concerning the internal market for electricity and gas is also an important element in the completion of the internal market."
"The Presidency attaches great importance to ensuring impetus in this matter."
"It is the intention that political consensus be reached on the whole package concerning the internal market for electricity and gas at the meeting of the Energy Council on 25 November."
"A dynamic consumer policy in an enlarged EU must take account of market developments and the real level of consumer protection needed."
"In this connection, it is crucial to have common rules on the marketing of goods and services in the EU."
"The Green Paper forms a good basis for continued work in this regard."
"Lastly, it is more important than ever that we simplify and improve our rules, to make life easier for citizens and business in the EU."
"At its meetings in May and September, the Council reached agreement on the amendment of the public procurement directives, and the Presidency is now working towards communicating a common position to Parliament as quickly as possible."
"We must work together to ensure the simplification and improvement of EU legislation by means of effective implementation of the Commission's action plan."
"Studies carried out by the Commission show that better lawmaking could save businesses approximately EUR 50 000 million per annum, corresponding to 4% of GDP."
"The Presidency accords high priority to the matter."
"In the Council's conclusions from its meeting on 30 September, priorities included the work on simplification of EU rules, and also impact assessments and methods for following up the implementation of the action plan."
"Our goal is to adopt the interinstitutional agreement before the end of the year."
"This depends, of course, on the course of the negotiations currently taking place with the European Parliament and the Commission."
"It is impossible to meet everyone's wishes if the agreement is to be concluded by the end of 2002."
"The Competitiveness Council, together with the European Parliament and the Commission, has a responsibility for ensuring that we give an impetus to the work on boosting growth and competitiveness in the EU."
"We must bear in mind that we have to work together closely if we are to meet these challenges."
"Achieving competitive businesses and securing continued economic growth are tasks requiring a concerted effort."
"It is in everyone's interests that we work together as effectively as possible in order that progress can be made quickly in those areas of legislation in which we, the legislators, have joint competence and a joint responsibility."
"Mr President, I am delighted to welcome the statements of the Commissioner and the President of the Council both on behalf of my Group and as the Legal Affairs Committee's rapporteur on the internal market strategy."
"These statements are very important and very timely."
"From my own point of view as a British Conservative Member who joined this Parliament three years ago and who has been consistently engaged in internal market activities since then, it is the first time we have had a statement of this kind."
"It does mark something of a milestone for me, and I hope for the Parliament."
"We must ensure that we do not have such a long gap between these sort of engagements and discussions about future strategy."
"I also hope, on the tenth anniversary of the 1992 programme, that colleagues will not mind me mentioning that it was a British Commissioner, Lord Cockfield, who was responsible for pushing that programme through with the active encouragement of the British Conservative Government under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher."
"This tenth anniversary provides us with an important opportunity to launch a new initiative to push on further and faster with the drive towards completing the internal market, shifting it into higher gear."
"That can only be done by engaging all of the European institutions, business and consumer organisations in a much more powerful coalition."
"There is a sense in which we have taken the internal market too much for granted."
"As both the Commissioner and the Minister said this morning, that certainly is not the case."
"I want to say to Commissioner Bolkestein that, as the rapporteur for the committee, my draft report is certainly going to be hard hitting and ambitious."
"I hope my colleagues will support me, and I think they will because the Legal Affairs Committee has been a strong supporter of internal market policy."
"We have had lively debates, but the general direction will move towards the sort of programmes that the Commission wishes to encourage."
"We are certainly prepared to rise to the challenge of creating the internal market for services."
"That is going to be difficult and will need a lot of political support, which, Commissioner Bolkestein, we will give you."
"As for the Council, I would like to commend Mr Bendtsen very much on his leadership on this issue and on launching the Competitiveness Council."
"You do not need to wait for the Commission to take initiatives to move this forward."
"Looking at this report about the barriers to services in the internal market - which, colleagues, I urge you to read - it is clear that Member States could now get on with the task of freeing up business establishment, removing the bureaucracy about the launch of small businesses and encouraging service businesses to establish in other countries."
"Those of you in the Competitiveness Council could take that initiative next time you meet."
"You do not need to wait for the Commission."
"This is the sort of positive approach that we want to see the Member States making and clearing up the sort of deficits in transposition that Mr Bolkestein identified earlier."
"So, please, Council, take the initiative."
"In conclusion, a few months ago Mr Bolkestein published an article on the Parliament's work on sales promotion directives, which was headlined 'Parliament comes to the rescue of the internal market'."
"We are not here just to rescue it, we are here to drive it forward and that is what we intend to do over the next 12 months and beyond."
"Mr President, I am very grateful to both the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their statements today, which remind us of the tenth anniversary of the internal market."
"This is a special date for me, as it was in the final analysis the European Union's internal market project that sparked debate in Austria, Sweden and Finland as to whether we too ought to join the European Union, and I am very glad that we took this step and can take part in today's event, which is in part a review."
"I believe it is the imminent risks and historic projects of the European Union - the forthcoming great enlargement and the Convention's fundamental reform of the EU - that make it necessary to consider whether yesterday's objectives have been achieved."
"It is also right that we should be proud of what we have achieved and constantly remind ourselves of it."
"The internal market is already regarded as all too self-explanatory, yet it is all the more painfully apparent that it still has loopholes resulting from the deficient or delayed transposition of directives in the Member States, and my own country, alas, lags behind significantly in this respect."
"These loopholes and obstacles came about, though, because we did not have enough success at European level in taking the necessary action to harmonise and coordinate."
"Commissioner, you adduced some very pertinent examples of loopholes and obstacles that still remain, mainly in the area of the provision of services and the movement of goods."
"I believe that, where this is concerned, we also have to very strongly highlight the area of the free movement of workers, where obstacles to the internal market still persist, affecting the truly mobile elements in the population."
"One aspect needing to be addressed here is the situation of third-country nationals, both in their role as workers and in the provision of cross-border services."
"I believe that, even if we review the objectives of the internal market and are willing to do everything to ultimately achieve them, we should also recall that our concern must be with guaranteeing a high standard of protection for consumers and the environment."
"Let us not be concerned only with the range of goods and services available, but also with their quality."
"I will conclude by asking all those who are working on the final realisation of the internal market to help prevent its legal basis from being put at risk by the debate on the future of the European Union, its competences and the principles by which they are exercised."
"It is particularly with reference to the subsidiarity principle that the occasional tendency in that direction is noticeable in the Convention."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his wake-up call on the internal market, which is to be congratulated on its ten-year anniversary."
"We sometimes forget that the internal market is still a process and represents a lot of unfinished business and you were right to remind us of this, Commissioner."
"If we look at our committee's agenda, most of the work has as its basis the good functioning of the internal market."
"Still, sadly, as you reminded us, with issues like the Community patent, those big decisions are still being flunked, sometimes, it has to be said, in the Council."
"It is strange because the internal market has been such a success story for Europe, a vision that we managed to sell effectively to our citizens in the run-up to 1992."
"Maybe it is drifting a bit and it really is time to re-engage our citizens, and particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in what we are doing."
"What is in it for them?"
"How does the market work for them?"
"It is again a paradox: with the euro and with e-commerce, the internal market really ought to be taking off."
"Although you mentioned a survey which showed so much support for the internal market, I really do not think we can take that for granted."
"I and my colleagues on this committee were glad to be a part, some months ago, of an internal market forum that was organised in this parliament."
"We should do more of that to re-engage with our citizens and businesses about what the market is there for."
"If we achieve that, and if citizens and businesses are engaged, the level of implementation and excitement in Member States will be much greater and much more complete."
"I would like to echo Maria Berger's concerns about the European Convention."
"The internal market must find a key place in those discussions, or we risk losing what we have created and made such a success of."
"Mr President, I want to put my voice mainly on the side of what Mr Harbour, Commissioner Bolkestein and others have said about the need to develop and improve the single market, particularly in the context of services and patents and other matters which have been discussed."
"We must, however, bear in mind that the confidence of our fellow citizens in this process also depends on proper observation of what you might call boundary conditions."
"For example, the single market could clearly be pursued in a way which ignored environmental side constraints."
"That is not happening, but it is vital that this situation be sustained."
"The same applies for certain social conditions and constraints."
"In relation to services, there is a nervousness among our citizens about public services and services of general interest."
"To what extent are these fully exposed to the single market conditions and to what extent are they properly kept aside?"
"I was looking today at Commission document COM(2002) 208 and just reflecting on what we mean by services of general interest."
"I note the following definition, at 3.1.5: 'services of general interest are defined in the Commission Communication on 'services of general interest in Europe' as being services which the public authorities class as being of general interest and subject to specific public service obligations'."
"I do not think I have ever come across such a fine exercise in tautology in a public document."
"A service is a service of general interest if the public authorities say that it is in the general interest, and that is how they define it."
"Now, what that suggests is a certain conceptual lack of clarity."
"We have a notion that there is an area here which is subject to different conditions and constraints from that aspect of the market in services which lies fully in the private sector."
"If we do not get that right, we will definitely lose the confidence of our citizens."
"I have a large mailbag dealing with the fears people are now expressing about the way in which the general agreement on trade and services might be likely to go and the effect that could have on public services in Europe."
"As well as being clear about the need to extend and improve the single market and what the limiting conditions are, let us try to get out of the realm of tautology and into clear thought."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"I should like to confine my speech to the European Patent."
"This is in line with what Commissioner Bolkestein and the majority of speakers here have said - although the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention it in his speech."
"We should give the Council a firm push and urge it to implement a European patent as quickly as possible."
"The problem that the Council faces, as we understand it, is the language regime, but this must not get in the way of a competitive economy, as the President-in-Office emphasised in his speech."
"When we take out a patent in the EU, we usually take it out in the USA as well, which means that we have to translate it into English, so why not decide once and for all that a patent taken out in the EU only needs to be issued in English? This would be simpler and would save enormous expense, and would be in keeping with the way inventors work."
"They say: I have an innovative idea, I can sell it worldwide, and therefore I have to translate it into English."
"It would increase competitiveness, and would be in keeping with the costs we have to incur in any case. It would seem to me that the Council should now make an effort and push this through."
"Mr President, I would like to express my support for Commissioner Bolkestein's analysis, ten years after the creation of the European internal market, which originated in the Single European Act, which first amended the Treaties, in the belief that we needed to create an economic area that matched our economic capacity and European companies' development possibilities."
"Unfortunately, a number of aspects, which have just been listed, are as yet unresolved - the lack of agreement on the European patent, takeover bids, tax obstacles, financial services - and these should drive the Council to make good its commitments and effectively implement all the agreements and commitments instigated in the Lisbon process so that we do not have to wait another ten years for the entire European internal market to become a reality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the internal market probably got its best birthday present today in the form of the Commissioner's words that, despite its achievements, his patience is wearing thin."
"I thank you for your impatience, hoping that, for the good of the internal market, all who operate in it and especially all who impede its progress will be made increasingly aware of how impatient you are."
"Europe must become a continent, and the EU must become a political union."
"We therefore give an unreserved 'yes' to an internal market that is developing fully and is able to give full expression to its dynamism for the good of Europe."
"We have only a year left to implement the internal market strategy for 1999/2004, a year in which we will need greater seriousness of purpose in place of half-heartedness, more speed in place of hesitancy and greater responsibility for the whole rather than parochialism."
"There is no mistaking the internal market's significance, which became apparent in the aftermath of 11 September."
"The stronger our internal market, the stronger is Europe's position in the world, and the more independent we are."
"This, then, makes me very glad that we are now discussing enlargement, as enlargement will extend our internal market and thereby strengthen Europe."
"The euro has made the internal market into a domestic market for many countries and thus strengthened it overall, so I also want to expressly welcome the internal market safeguard clause in the accession treaties."
"Directives need to be transposed with greater speed."
"We need the decision-making process to be speeded up, rather than have it take twenty-eight months as it did with company pension schemes."
"We need a debate to get the regulation of competences revised in the light of the internal market strategy and of the Lisbon strategy and made the basis of the work in the Convention."
"So what I expect of you - even bearing your impatience in mind - is that you avail yourself more of your right of initiative and name names rather than keeping quiet about those who are blocking progress."
"Mr President, just now in his introductory speech, Commissioner Bolkestein mentioned two directives which are of great importance for the implementation of the internal market - the directive on public procurement and the directive on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications."
"I am the rapporteur for these directives. Both directives address matters which are of considerable direct or indirect importance to the self-employed such as the implementation of free movement, freedom of establishment, citizens' security, health and freedom in general and, of course, the safeguarding of civil rights."
"It would appear quite clear that the Commission is not taking sufficient account of the needs of the self-employed."
"The self-employed are the providers of intellectual services, not entrepreneurs, and they cannot easily be made subject to competition."
"There must be a definition in the Treaties, minimum rates must be established and the self-employed must be recognised on the basis of the training they have received rather than on the basis of their qualifications, which, moreover, differ from State to State."
"The associations and societies must be given due importance."
"The Commission's plans for legislation in this area are inadequate and the self-employed are being penalised by this bureaucratic approach when they have the right to a social approach."
"The Commission and the Council are pressing forward in leaps and bounds with little consideration for the political positions of Parliament."
"I hope that what Commissioner Bolkestein said just now is a true reflection of the situation and that a proper dialogue is taking place involving the millions and millions of self-employed individuals, who are, I reiterate, the providers of intellectual services, not mere administrators."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament's Kangaroo Group has made an essential contribution to making the European internal market a reality."
"Many of the Members speaking today belong to the Kangaroo Group."
"It is this group that is today presenting you with an initiative demanding the further development of the internal market as it is today into a true European home market."
"Over recent months, we have had talks with a large number of people in the business world in order to analyse where we have got to, what progress we have made in making the European internal market a reality, and it is the results of these that we are presenting to you today."
"For a start, the European internal market is a success story."
"A fundamental change occurred in the realities in Europe when the borders between the countries belonging to the European Community were thrown open."
"Standardised entry requirements then made European firms substantially more competitive, and the creation of new instruments, among which I will mention only the European Patent Office, makes it very much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular to gain access to the European market."
"We have, though, at the same time discovered that there are many areas in which no internal market exists, where we have fifteen domestic markets within a European internal market that does not really work."
"We all know, for a start, that this is true in financial services."
"It is the case in the life sciences, pharmaceuticals and other areas in which there is no internal market either, and it is true in the defence field, where the first hesitant moves are being made towards the creation of common policy and a common internal market."
"Last but not least, the leap from internal market to domestic market demands of us - and I say this also for Mr Harbour's benefit - that we should have a common European currency in all the countries of the European Union, and this development also requires us to work on the basis of a common economic model."
"This must, in my view, be that of the social market economy."
"We now call on the Commission to come up with a coherent concept for introducing this new stage in the development of the European home market."
"- (DA) Mr President, I am very pleased that so many interesting views have been put forward in today's debate."
"As I mentioned in my opening speech, we are together making decisions on many proposals affecting the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness of the EU."
"It is also important, therefore, that we debate the essential issues of the internal market on an ongoing basis, especially in order to focus on the areas in which it is not working, often to the detriment of the EU's competitiveness."
"I have noted the views expressed today."
"Many people have given examples of areas in which the internal market is still stalling."
"I can say that I agree with several of these views, and I should like to make the following comments on them."
"First of all, I agree with Commissioner Bolkestein and Mr Karas that it is decisively important for the functioning of the internal market - for the benefit of both citizens and businesses - that directives are implemented on schedule."
"I support the Commission's work in keeping an eye on this area."
"The implementation of directives has top priority in the Council, especially in the Competitiveness Council, which is responsible for legislation on the internal market."
"We must of course achieve the goal - set by the Heads of State and Government at the Stockholm European Council and then in Barcelona - of implementing 98.5% of the directives by the 2003 spring summit."
"As regards the Community Patent, in particular - which of course many have mentioned today - I can only share the widespread concern."
"It is an extremely important matter."
"The absence of a breakthrough in the negotiations at the Council meeting on 21 May made it necessary to rethink the strategy in relation to the Community Patent."
"It was concluded that the Danish Presidency should focus on the judicial system, and we have therefore held discussions in this field on the basis of a consultative document from the Commission that we received in September."
"The issue of the judiciary, together with other essential parts of the proposal for the Community Patent, constitutes a so-called 'package solution', according to the principle that nothing is finally agreed until everything has been agreed."
"In this connection, I have of course noted Parliament's position as regards the judicial field."
"We have included Parliament's proposals in our deliberations on possible solutions."
"The Community Patent is a high priority for the Danish Presidency, but despite strenuous efforts it has not been possible to create the necessary basis for a joint draft compromise."
"The countries are still too far apart, and I should like to say to the Members here that I too am very impatient in this matter."
"At the meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 14 November, therefore, it will be a case of reviewing the status of the negotiations and working out how we can make headway in this extremely important matter."
"Political consensus has now also been reached in the Council on both of the public procurement directives."
"A technical examination of the proposals is currently taking place, so that they can be forwarded to Parliament together."
"A number of Parliament's proposals have been incorporated into the text, including on the possibility of incorporating environmental and social considerations into public procurement contracts."
"It is my hope that Parliament will approve of the proposals, so that we can see the new, improved, public procurement rules in the EU as soon as possible."
"With regard to the internal market for services, in particular, I can tell you that it is anticipated that the Council will adopt conclusions regarding the report on barriers at the meeting of the Competitiveness Council on 14-15 November 2002."
"There is political support in the Council for the Commission following up the conclusions, and a work schedule has been drawn up under which the Member States and the Commission are committed to a number of supply contracts in 2003."
"Amongst other things, the Commission will launch a legislative initiative on a system for removing the barriers."
"The Member States undertake to actively comply with and implement the judgments of the Court of Justice."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to express my thanks for the inspiring debate."
"The Danish Presidency accords the completion of the internal market a very high priority."
"It is the basis for our being able to realise our Lisbon vision."
"We are looking forward to continuing our good working relationship with the European Parliament in order that we can succeed in completing the internal market, especially on the basis of enlargement."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply to all the Members that have spoken this morning."
"May I begin by agreeing with Mr Harbour when he said that Lord Cockfield played an important role in constructing the internal market."
"This is perfectly true."
"He added that this happened with the support of the British Government, and may I say that it is all the more regrettable that Lord Cockfield did not return to Brussels as a Commissioner for a second period."
"Mr Harbour commented on services."
"Indeed, since our economies are roughly 70% service-based, he is quite right to raise the point."
"This point has also been mentioned by others."
"In reply, it cannot be right that companies are subjected to a number of requirements which they have already fulfilled in their home country."
"To do so would add considerable cost to doing business in the European Union and would not be compatible with calls for less red tape."
"It is vital for Member States to press ahead with action to modernise and simplify their legal framework."
"In many cases, the removal of barriers requires much improved administrative cooperation between Member States or, where necessary, harmonisation."
"That action will necessitate involvement of Member States, and in the light of the report on services, the Commission intends to propose both a legislative initiative to remove unnecessary legal barriers, and also non-legislative actions to address non-regulatory barriers."
"The Commission will certainly keep this uppermost in its mind and intends to return to Parliament as the occasion requires."
"I also agree with Mr Harbour that the transposition deficit, which is now creeping upwards again, is a most serious matter."
"May I appeal to all Members of Parliament to use such influence as they have with their home governments to stress the absolute need for a transposition deficit that is as close as possible, if not identical to, the 1.5% which was set as an aim by the European Council."
"Mrs Berger mentioned the need to look after and improve the mobility of employees."
"I agree with her and that is one of the reasons why the Commission is at pains to see to it that in the area of pension funds, when employees contribute to a certain pension fund in their own country, they can then go and work in another country and contribute to the same pension fund, retaining their rights to tax deductibility on their contributions."
"Recently, there was a case involving a citizen of Finland who contributed to a pension fund which was not Finnish."
"The tax deductibility of the contributions was not allowed by the Finnish authorities."
"After recourse to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, this error was redressed and we now have the possibility of retaining such fiscal advantages."
"That is a good thing in defence of the mobility of employees."
"Mrs Berger also drew attention, as did Mrs Wallis, to Article 95, which is one of the bases, if not the basis, of the internal market."
"There have been noises in and around the European Convention that Article 95 should be amended."
"The latest comments that have reached me on that point assure me that this is not the intention and that the Convention does not want to change Article 95, which would be a very bad thing."
"Mr MacCormick drew my attention to services of general interest."
"It is obviously a general term but what is meant are public services which not only at national, but often also at regional or local level, have until now been shielded from competition."
"The Commission is favour of liberalisation."
"I would like to make the distinction between liberalisation and privatisation."
"Privatisation is not the concern of the Commission."
"In fact, Article 295 of the Treaty says that nothing in the Treaty should have any impact on the ownership of whatever it may be."
"Member States' governments are free, according to the Treaty, to nationalise, de-nationalise, privatise, expropriate or whatever. Privatisation is not the concern of the European Union and is not the concern of the Commission."
"However, liberalisation is indeed our concern."
"Liberalisation means opening up to competition and it is my view that if such services of national interest, otherwise known as network services, are open to competition, the ordinary citizen stands to gain from that."
"Mr Rovsing spoke on the Community patent and suggested that such patents should be expressed in one language only."
"He may be right but I know at least one Member State which would be strongly opposed to such a proposal."
"I wish Mr Rovsing the best of luck in trying to persuade that Member State that all patents should be expressed in English."
"Mr Karas said mehr Tempo statt Verzögerung - more speed rather than delay - and I cannot agree more with him."
"He also said that the stronger our internal market is, the stronger Europe's position in the world will be and, of course, he is right."
"Economic clout is necessary for political clout."
"That is one of the reasons we should all support the internal market."
"He also agrees with the Schutzklausel, the guarantee clause in the accession treaties about the internal market in its widest sense, encompassing energy, transport and so on, not just the areas under my portfolio."
"An important part of the accession treaties, the guarantee clause works for two years as from entry, but under the guarantee clause, measures may be proposed which go beyond this two-year period."
"We have the possibility, should the need arise, to impress upon accession countries the need for a period longer than two years."
"They should do whatever needs to be done to bring them into line with the internal market thus defined."
"To Mr De Clercq, who also spoke, perhaps I may answer in the language which we have in common."
"The next item is the report (A5-0342/2002) by the Earl of Stockton on behalf of the Committee on Petitions on the petition declared admissible on discrimination towards priests in the UK by Reverend Owen (Petition 395/2001)."
"Mr President, the case of the Reverend Raymond Owen raises a number of interesting, not to say esoteric, points."
"Members may feel that whether a priest is employed by his or her church or by God is a question that must have been decided decades, if not centuries, ago."
"In preparing this report, I took informal advice from leading churchmen, but have only received a formal submission from the Archbishop's Council of the Church of England on 4 November 2002."
"Not surprisingly, there are certain parts of the report with which they do not agree."
"I will come back to them shortly."
"However, the fundamental questions of principle thrown up by this case include whether members of the clergy should enjoy the same rights as other citizens."
"As I have made clear in the report, while Directive 2000/78/EC establishes a general framework, I accept that certain types of worker must be dependent on definitions in national legislation and implementation."
"I also accept that Directive 91/533/EEC, while applying to clergy in some Member States, does not apply in the UK, and that the various directives are vague and imprecise in their reference to workers, employees and the working population."
"Who falls into which category is frequently left to be defined by national law."
"Members may be interested to note that while our staff and assistants are clearly employees, we are not covered by any of these definitions."
"The conclusions of the report accept and include those of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which is the committee with the competence and expertise on most of the issues raised by the petitioner."
"I have to say that my opinions, and those of my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation, are somewhat at odds with some of the conclusions reached but after exchanges of views, however, it was clear that the report faithfully reflects the consensus of the committee."
"The submission presented by the petitioner highlighted prima facie evidence of shortcomings in the Church of England's procedures."
"In fairness, I must tell the House that since the committee adopted the report, the Church of England has pointed out that the decision taken was not to terminate Reverend Owen's tenure of office. Rather, it was a decision not to grant an extension beyond the 18-month extension allowed in Section 20 of the 1983 Pastoral Measure."
"I should remind the House that as the Church of England is an established church, its rules and regulations form part of the canon of the law in England, although not in the rest of the United Kingdom."
"It is clearly not the role of either the committee or this House to adjudicate in questions of fact."
"Equally, it is accepted that the Petitions Committee is not a judicial body and nor should it exercise or try to exercise a quasi-judicial function."
"Nevertheless, it is clear that the directives in the area of employment, and in particular the aforementioned Directive 91/533/EEC, are confusing and even inconsistent."
"Accordingly, the report calls for a review to clarify this position."
"In parenthesis, this only serves to underline the wisdom of the former Conservative government in opting out of the Social Chapter."
"Finally, while we accept that where protection is afforded to workers by European legislation, it should extend as widely as possible. It would be quite wrong for the European Union to try to impose a monolithic structure that would not allow for diversity in cultural, religious and social customs in Member States."
"This is a sentiment that I am sure will be heartily endorsed, not just in Lambeth Palace, but also in the Vatican."
"Therefore it is my sincere hope that, as pointed out in paragraph 12 of the report, the Commission works with Member States to find the means of securing for workers with distinct constitutional status all the employment rights consistent with their national policies as soon as possible to avoid further such confusion."
"Thank you, Lord Stockton."
"Commissioner, what shall we now do about the Church of England and Reverend Owen?"
"Can Europe help this clergyman to remain employed, or can it not?"
"Mr President, I do not know whether Europe can always assist but at least it tries."
"I would first like to thank the rapporteur and the members of the Committee on Petitions and the members of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee for their excellent work and analysis."
"As reported by the Earl of Stockton, Reverend Owen alleges that his fundamental rights have not been respected and that European directives have either been breached or incorrectly applied by the United Kingdom authorities."
"In his petition, he refers in particular to the fact that he has been discriminated against, contrary to Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and contrary to Articles 48(2) and 112 of the Treaty of Rome."
"He furthermore claims that Council Directive 91/533/EEC concerning information on individual employment conditions has not been properly incorporated into UK law."
"It is true that we have been dealing with this issue for more than one and a half years and a lot of legal and other work has been done."
"As mentioned in the Commission Communication of 13 December 2001 on the case, and in my letter of 11 January 2002 to honourable Members Ford, Cashman and Hughes, the Commission could not identify any breach of European law, nor any failure by the British Government to transpose properly the relevant European legislation into UK law."
"I do not believe I need to add anything to what I have already communicated in my letter, but I will attempt to explain and analyse some of the aspects of the directives and the articles of the Treaties."
"Council Directive 91/533/EEC applies to every paid employee having a contract or employment relationship defined by the law in force in a Member State."
"It does not, however, provide an EU definition of an employee, which is left to national employment legislation."
"The United Kingdom confirmed that members of the clergy, in respect of their core duties as clergymen, are officeholders and not employees under UK employment law."
"As clergy are not employees for the purpose of the scope of this directive, it was not necessary to specifically cover or specifically exclude them."
"As regards the issue of discrimination, Article 13 of the EC Treaty allows the Community to take action but has no direct effect."
"It does not, therefore, grant individuals any rights which can be enforced by national courts or the European Court of Justice."
"Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishes a general principle of prohibition of any direct or indirect discrimination."
"However, the directive does not need to be transposed by Member States until 2 December 2003 so we cannot apply it to this case at present."
"Article 48(2) of the Treaty of Rome (now Article 39(2)) refers to the treatment of workers of different nationalities within a Member State, and not to differences in labour law and employment rights between countries."
"It is therefore not obvious that Article 39 is relevant in this case."
"Article 118 of the Treaty of Rome (now Art. 137), which I suppose the Reverend had in mind as regards the harmonisation of working conditions, gives the Community a number of competences in the social field, including the issue of working conditions."
"On the basis of these considerations I cannot identify any breach of European law nor any failure by the British Government to transpose the relevant European legislation."
"I hope that this clarifies the issue."
"Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"The reverend gentleman is not getting a great deal of help from you, then."
"Mr President, it seems clear that the Reverend Owen's situation does not involve any breach of the letter of European Community law, contrary though it may be to its spirit."
"The European Parliament is therefore grateful for his petition since it draws attention to a problem with the law."
"As the Earl of Stockton has already pointed out, because directives use a variety of terms to identify the range of working people they cover, and because that range is often left to be determined by national law, certain groups may fail to benefit from the protection they afford."
"It is of course accepted that there can be some differences, both in the extent of employment rights, and in the means of redress in the event of breach."
"This is particularly so where those involved have a particular constitutional status."
"Members of this or any other parliament would not, for example, be expected to be able to appeal to an industrial tribunal against the decision of the electorate not to return them for a further term."
"That said, all those in a working situation should have the fullest possible set of rights with deviations permissible only where these can be fully and objectively justified."
"In the case of the clergy, such rights may not be for the secular authorities to determine, but surely in such instances the churches themselves should aspire to the highest possible standards, particularly where avenues of redress and issues of discrimination are concerned."
"Following the petition we are asking the Commission to review European employment legislation to ensure that it is as comprehensive as possible."
"It is good to know that, in the UK, such coverage is something to which the Department of Trade and Industry is already directing its attention."
"We are also asking for constructive dialogue across the European Union to secure for all those in non-typical but economically dependent working situations - including, where necessary and by appropriate means, the clergy - all the employment rights, both substantive and procedural, that must be regarded as fundamental to a dignified working life."
"Mr President, as you suggested this may seem something of an obscure and even idiosyncratic issue to reach the floor of the European Parliament."
"For the Reverend Owen, however, it is anything but obscure."
"It is his livelihood, his home and I suspect even more than that, it is his belief that right will be done, that justice will prevail."
"It would seem that the legal system cannot defend him, although he has done no wrong."
"Increasingly, I fear that appeals to a moral principle do not work, although one might have hoped that within the Church of England, and I am myself a communicant member of that church, such an appeal might get some countenance."
"I am afraid that once the lawyers of the consistory courts don their wigs and gowns it is the letter of the law that will prevail, rather than moral justice and still less Christian spirit."
"I hope the publicity of this case is making the bishops of the Church of England feel just a little ashamed."
"If the Church cannot set an example of Christian charity, understanding and fair treatment towards its servants, who can?"
"The Church should not be surprised if its pews are increasingly empty."
"It is a clear tribute to the democratic procedures of this House, and to the work of the Petitions Committee, that the Reverend Owen has at last found one public body which is at least ready to listen, one that does not require expensive lawyers."
"I trust that His Grace, the new Archbishop of Canterbury will carefully consider this small and obscure case and show that the Church has not totally lost its belief in Christian charity, and might accord to his rector the rights that other European citizens enjoy as employees."
"Thank you, Mr Perry."
"Please allow me to make a personal comment."
"It is indeed noteworthy that the European Parliament should take the time to deal with the problems of an individual citizen, but this is precisely what democracy is about - the ability of every citizen to bring his personal problems to the attention of a great Parliament."
"Thank you for your observation."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group and as a member of the Petitions Committee I welcome both the report from the Earl of Stockton and the opinion from the Employment and Social Affairs Committee drafted by Mrs Attwooll."
"The Reverend Owen is actually in the gallery today listening to this debate."
"His case is very simple."
"He was employed as a team rector in Stoke-on-Trent for a number of years."
"There was a secretive and flawed review of his work in the post and a decision was made at a meeting, without proper notice, that he was to be sacked."
"He was given no reasons for his dismissal."
"Like any employee he believed he had the right to an independent appeal against this casual ending of 30 years' work with the Church and a threat to his tied accommodation."
"Without a post in the Church he would be evicted from his family home."
"To cut a long story short, he was refused access to an industrial tribunal in the United Kingdom because of a 1911 judgment that members of the clergy have no terrestrial employer, that is, he is employed by God, although God does not sign his stipend cheques at the end of the month."
"However, employment legislation and the world have moved on since 1911."
"For example, women even have the right to vote, and, in the United Kingdom, female teachers no longer have to resign on getting married."
"Even in the EU, we have legislation that should apply in this case."
"No longer when you join the Church should have you have to leave your basic civil rights at the door."
"The Employment and Social Affairs Committee backs that argument, the Petitions Committee backs that argument."
"We believe that clergy throughout Europe should have the same employment rights as millions of other workers, the same rights as they enjoy already in Denmark, and in the United Kingdom if they happen to be hospital or prison chaplains."
"So there is even an anomaly within the United Kingdom."
"We hope the UK Government and the Commission will look again at this matter."
"I still believe that the directives have not been properly implemented in UK law."
"The Reverend Owen seems to meet all the criteria for being an employee."
"That the Reverend Owen has been badly treated by the Church of England seems very clear, and we hope that on the basis of this particular case, which is illustrative of a much more general problem affecting hundreds of clergy in the United Kingdom every year, the Commission will press the UK Government to close the loophole for future cases."
"In the United Kingdom, there are 30 000 clergy treated in this feudal manner: more than the number of those employed in the mining industry."
"Across Europe, close to a quarter of a million clergy, encompassing all faiths and religions, are employed and at the moment have some doubts as whether they are covered by this legislation."
"Finally, while we do not expect miracles, we ask that the Church authorities in the UK practise some of the Christian charity they preach in this particular case."
"Mr President, I would also like to thank the rapporteur and Mrs Attwooll for providing the opinion for the Employment and Social Affairs Committee."
"It is a pity that this is beginning to sound like a British debate, because a number of the issues here actually apply right across the European Union."
"As we have heard, the case provides an example of just one of the many anomalies which occur in employment law in many of our Member States."
"Generally of course these only come to light when people want to cross borders to work and find that their employment status changes and thus their rights to social security and employment-related rights change as well."
"In this case, as we have been hearing, we are looking at a national situation in which historical anomalies, and to some extent theological anomalies, have led to an unacceptable situation which has already been clearly outlined."
"We found that the Reverend Owen discovered that the means open to him to seek adjudication of his case lay either within the body against which he wished to complain - thus making this body judge, jury and defendant, one of the minimum standards that we do not want to see applied across the European Union - or with a judicial review which can examine the process but not the content of the complaint."
"As the Commissioner has already pointed out, it appears that the situation is legally correct."
"Morally, however, it is certainly is not correct."
"The European Union seeks to establish at least satisfactory core standards in its employment law and expects Member States to implement these standards, and the spirit of them, across the board."
"My group therefore fully supports the call for Member States to review their employment practices to ensure that situations where individuals are denied access to normal dispute resolution procedures in employment are as few as possible, can be fully and objectively justified, and that redress is available in other forms."
"We also support the call for clear definitions of employment status to be used."
"We raised this issue in the discussions on the insolvency directive and will be doing so again in connection with the coordination of social security systems."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the Earl of Stockton on the production of an excellent report and also Elspeth Attwooll for the very clear opinion she produced for the Employment Committee."
"I would also like to congratulate the Reverend Owen for the courage and determination he has shown in pressing his case this far."
"Those attributes, together with his communication, advocacy and other skills, really make me wonder why the Church of England wanted to terminate his services in the first place."
"I think he would be a considerable asset to any organisation and I hope they will think again."
"There is no doubt in my mind that he has been given a raw deal."
"Either he had an employment relationship with the Church of England - in which case he would have had the protection of well-established procedures in UK employment law - or he was an office-holder who should have had the protection of the Church of England's own code of recommended practice, including the right of appeal."
"He seems to have fallen completely between these two stools and therefore a real injustice has been done."
"It is in that context that we need to read paragraph 2 of the Earl of Stockton's report, where it mentions an unacceptable situation in terms of the spirit of Article 136 of the Treaty of Rome, Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms on the right to a fair and public hearing by an independent, impartial tribunal, and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is quite right to underline those references."
"There are broader implications arising from this case, as Jean Lambert has said."
"There are increasing numbers of workers right across the European Union who find themselves totally dependent upon one source of income but who are not regarded in their national law as having an employment relationship."
"These quasi-forms of independence and self-employment are spreading."
"We have been working with the Commission on this for some time and most recently in relation to the latest review of the insolvency directive."
"The Commission has commissioned a study as a result of our work on that review and it has also committed itself to holding a joint hearing with the Employment Committee to seek to establish common definitions."
"Without such definitions, it is increasingly clear that larger numbers of workers will find themselves outside the protection of the law."
"We need to establish definitions which will apply across the European Union."
"Finally, I would like to echo the sentiments of other Members in expressing the sincere hope that even at this late hour all of the parties involved in this dispute can get back around the table and, in a Christian manner, right the wrong which has been done to the Reverend Owen."
"Mr President, I think we all agree that God has no employees and there are no labour market rules in our holy books."
"Of course, He has left us the task of organising our labour market and of course clergymen have their civil and social rights."
"I would like to make two points."
"The first one concerns the definition of employees."
"This is a very difficult and sensitive issue, and we know that in the majority of directives the Member States are left to define what employees are."
"There are many problems, and, as Mr Hughes has already said, we are moving forward with amendments to two directives in order to define, in a more effective way, the protection of employees and the definition of an employee."
"I would like to refer to the questions mentioned in Lord Stockton's report."
"We have carried out a new study which concerns economically-dependent workers, and a public hearing will be organised with the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We believe that after this discussion and after the report, the Commission could draw some new conclusions in the light of the results."
"This is why I believe that there is always an opportunity after an individual case to move forward and to take into account the particular needs of groups of workers across Europe."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 10.44 a.m. and resumed at 11 a.m.)"
"I am pleased to announce that Mr Christopher Smith, Member of the United States Chamber of Representatives and Chairman of the War Veterans Parliamentary Committee, is in the official gallery."
"Mr Smith is going to meet with a large number of the Members during his time here and we hope his visit to Parliament will be fruitful."
"Mr President, our first report is from the Petitions Committee by the Earl of Stockton on the case of the Reverend Owen."
"It is unusual in that it is a report on the fate of a single individual within the European Union."
"Members may be interested to know that the Reverend Owen is with us today in the public gallery."
"Thank you Mr Ford."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, an oral amendment has been agreed on, which now reads: 'reiterates its call for a negotiated solution and urges the Council to take a strong political initiative in this sense.'"
"The remainder is deleted."
"Mr President, the day before yesterday North Korea threatened to resume missile testing if relations with Japan did not develop in the way that it wanted and expected."
"This threat is unacceptable."
"I presented an amendment on behalf of my group, which has been accepted by Mr Ford and the Socialist Group, and which reads 'condemns the new North Korean threat of resuming missile testing'."
"Mr President, the meeting mentioned on 11 November 2002 is now no longer taking place, so we would like to amend paragraph 6 to read 'expects the EU to be invited as a full member to all meetings discussing the future of KEDO'."
"Mr President, I wanted to propose deleting the last sentence of my own amendment which starts with the words 'stresses that' and ends with 'Association process' because it is very harsh, in my eyes too harsh, on the Croatian Government and its efforts."
"Mr President, I would just like to say that, because of problems with the electronic voting system, I have had, on a number of occasions, to put my card into the machine on the desk next to mine."
"Considering, not least, the disputes which have arisen in Italy, I would not want this to be interpreted as sleight of hand."
"I did, in any case, only use my own card."
"Mr President, my group is not satisfied with the resolution that was passed today."
"It is actually well over a year since the resolution on Echelon was passed by this Parliament."
"It seems that very little has been done to ensure the public's right to privacy within the European Union."
"Also, if we actually look at what the Council has been doing recently with a view to bringing telecommunications interception capabilities in line with new technologies, this is also an infringement on the individual's right to privacy."
"What is most disappointing is that the Council has not acted on what the Parliament said in its initial report after the temporary committee of enquiry."
"It is completely unacceptable that European citizens are exposed to such sweeping interceptions of communication."
"The Council should actually do something about it."
"The resolution passed this morning was much too weak and we are very disappointed that the points that our group proposed were not included in that resolution."
"The fundamental right to privacy and, in particular, the right to confidentiality of communications, are now under threat."
"In combating terrorism, the States have reduced - or are gradually preparing to reduce - the safeguards protecting citizens provided for by law, particularly by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and related case law, by Article 7 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights and by Directives 95/46/EC, 97/66/EC and 2002/58/EC."
"The idea that terrorism can be combated by restricting citizens' freedoms and rights is nothing but an illusion, as is shown by the Echelon case."
"Not even the systematic interception of the contents of all communications by Echelon - a system which is now being enhanced by the rules being drafted on the gathering of data on insider dealing - succeeded in preventing the terrorist attacks of 11 September or the other tragic events which followed, since, in practice, it focuses wholly on industrial espionage."
"The only effect of Echelon - which is clearly and indisputably illegal - has been to make a mockery of the law and the Courts, to distort free market competition and to jeopardise democracy and citizens' rights and freedoms."
"(FR) The tragic events of 11 September 2001 provide yet another opportunity to address the subject of Echelon: even though on this occasion the system showed its extraordinary ineffectiveness in the only field that could have justified its continued use - security and the fight against terrorism - a certain amount of confusion over type is leading the Commission and Council to pretend they believe that the answers to the problems are essentially technical and can be solved within the context of the CFSP."
"The problem, however, is political - the umbilical cord between NATO and European security, defence and information systems - and the CFSP does not exist, and, moreover, will only ever be able to make its point through silence, because, although we all fiercely oppose terrorist barbarity, we are not, however, all prepared, on the pretext of economies, affinities or an absence of any alternative policy, to place ourselves fully in the hands of the United States in the field of defence and foreign policy."
"That is where the problem lies, and this is not, therefore, a matter of cooperation in the field of security, which obviously goes without saying."
"That is why the French delegation of the UEN Group voted against this useless text."
"There continues to be a storm of incomprehensible hypocrisy on the subject of Echelon and the interception of citizens' communications: hypocrisy on the part of the Member States of the Union which are part of the Echelon system and yet remained silent as to its existence, hypocrisy on the part of those Member States - Holland, France and Germany, in particular - which, although not part of the Echelon system, have developed and implemented systems which perform exactly the same functions of intercepting the international and national communications of citizens through the recognition of key words, and hypocrisy on the part of the European Parliament, which decided not to furnish itself with the powers of inquiry which would have enabled it to carry out a proper investigation into the existence and functioning of Echelon."
"Although Echelon is a completely illegal system under international, European and national law, no European institution or Member State is taking any steps to protect citizens' rights by instituting a lawsuit for violation of the right to privacy."
"If - as regards Echelon and interception of communications - the aim is to produce a European intelligence system, this system must be subject to the basic rules of democracy: the law must be genuinely transparent, it must be clearly regulated, it must be subject to democratic and judicial control and there must be guarantees for the citizens."
"- (FR) We voted for this report because it criticises the fact that some categories of employee are not covered by 'employment protection afforded under European Community law' and calls upon the Commission to '[ensure] that existing rights are extended to the widest possible range of workers'."
"Having said that, we thoroughly disagree with paragraph 13, which claims that 'the spirit of reconciliation and understanding which is the way of the Church [?] corresponds to the basic principles on which democracy is founded and preserved within the European Union'."
"Religion must remain a private affair and secularism must be the rule in public affairs."
"- (ES) This parliamentary vote has fulfilled the commitment imposed on Parliament by Parliament itself and by the European citizens to create, as quickly as possible, a legal measure to allow the EU to mobilise the necessary funds to help disaster-stricken areas."
"We must congratulate ourselves on this."
"In my opinion, however, the result could have been even better."
"First of all, greater transparency."
"What was adopted today should have been annexed to the existing interinstitutional agreement, not a new standard."
"Secondly, a matter of rigidity."
"Item 2 states that, in October, 25% of the Fund must be available as a matter of obligation."
"This is too rigid."
"If, in a given tax year, 75% is spent in spring, would the Commission have to make a recommendation that we all avoid bringing disasters on ourselves until the beginning of October?"
"Lastly, an inconsistency on the part of the Council."
"In order to make the best use of appropriations, the Council asked to be able to redistribute existing appropriations, but only in the amended spending categories: Internal Spending and Pre-accession."
"In Internal Spending, however, there is not a single euro left to spend."
"Redistribution in the event of a disaster can therefore only apply to pre-accession countries."
"Would it not be possible to use any agricultural appropriations that are not spent during the year?"
". (PT) I have voted in favour of this report because I consider the legislative process that has now ended to be exemplary, not only because it remedies shortcomings that have been tragically demonstrated in the past, but because it is underpinned by a process of drafting laws that is duly proven and consolidated."
"In fact, following the terrible disaster of the Estonia in 1994, eight Northern European countries decided, in 1996, to adopt and implement stricter standards than those laid down previously, so as, by means of special technical requirements for ships, to guarantee greater resistance and to improve the stability of passenger ships, thereby making them safer in the event of an accident, delaying their capsize and enabling all passengers to be evacuated in good time."
"It is precisely the evaluation of the effectiveness of this agreement and, at the same time, its extremely positive impact on safety that the Commission has highlighted, considering - quite rightly, in my opinion, in the framework described - that a legislative initiative in the form of a directive, intended to extend this legal step forwards to all the Member States of the European Union is justified."
"It is, therefore, a matter of adopting a set of measures designed to improve Community legislation on the safety of passenger ships, in full accordance, as a matter of fact, with the political objectives outlined in the White Paper on the matter - which obviously warrants my full support."
". (PT) I have voted in favour of this report largely for the same reasons I agree with the Poignant report on specific stability requirements for ro-ro passenger ferries."
"With the Stockholm Agreement, the countries of Northern Europe committed themselves to adapting their passenger ferries to more rigorous safety criteria than those currently in force, in order to make the ferries more stable, by means of certain construction measures, in the event of an accident at sea."
"This basically involved enabling ships to float longer in the event of a shipwreck."
"Since some of these measures were considered to be effective and their validity was also acknowledged for seas other than those in Northern Europe, the Commission is now proposing to revise Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998, extending these safety measures to passenger ferries operating in European national waters too."
"In a parallel directive, the Commission is proposing to extend these measures to ships undertaking international journeys in all European seas."
"I agree with this range of concerns and, at the same time, especially welcome the particular importance this report attaches to promoting actions to improve access for passengers with reduced mobility."
". (FR) The Treaty of Nice, which has just been adopted, is already out of date on certain points."
"This is what we can glean from the conclusions of the Brussels European Council, from which we learn in particular that:"
"the Treaty of Nice only stipulated the new weighting for votes in the Council as of 1 January 2005 (Article 3 of the enlargement protocol)."
"As enlargement will take place during 2004, however, what will happen in the meantime?"
"it seems preferable to lay down a derogation to the rule of the Treaty according to which Member States hold the presidency in turn, in order to enable the new Member States to better prepare themselves for their turn;"
"lastly, the rules on weighting and qualified majority and on the number of MEPs should be adapted to take account of 10 new Members, rather than 12."
"I shall confine myself here to making two general comments."
"Firstly, these are not the only points on which the Treaty of Nice is already out of date."
"We shall see this more clearly tomorrow."
"Secondly, as it now needs revising, what do we do about the rules laid down to this end by Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union, the aim of which, in particular, is to ensure debate and transparency?"
"The Brussels Council did not say a word about this."
"I abstained from the vote on the compromise resolution concerning the results of the Brussels Summit."
"First of all, I do not believe we should congratulate ourselves on Mr Giscard d'Estaing's progress report on the Convention."
"So far, the Convention is off to a poor start, focusing as it does on the renationalisation of certain policies and a more intergovernmental approach, thus weakening the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Furthermore, the European Council has not regulated the future funding of enlargement in any way."
"In fact, the problems remain."
"In 2006, at the latest, the European Union will face an agonising debate over the solidarity required with the candidate countries."
"The Brussels European Council confirmed our worst predictions."
"The powers that be took a colonial stance towards the candidate countries; they set accession terms and conditions, limited funding between 2004 and 2006 and reduced funding in real terms under the ?U budget for 2007 to 2013, a move that will affect all the members of the enlarged ?U."
"Yet again, the main victims of these decisions are the workers, who are expected to bear the entire cost of enlargement, in that appropriations for so-called real cohesion have vanished into thin air."
"They are closely followed by farmers in the Member States and candidate countries, who will see their income eroded as the result of cuts in agricultural spending."
"Negotiations with ???? on a European army are in keeping with the plans of the imperialist warmongers."
"The ?U is being placed under ???? without any guarantee as to the inviolability of its Member States' borders, it is bowing to pressure from the USA and it has appointed Turkey to judge developments in south-eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, 'washing its hands' of any conflict which this may provoke between Turkey and the Member States of the ?U."
"The people of Europe have woken up to the negative implications of these developments and are reacting against these prospects, refuting these options and fighting against the new order, war and imperialist plans."
". (NL) I am in favour of a speedy EU enlargement by the twelve countries with which negotiations are now under way."
"In my opinion, the Commission's assessment that ten of those countries will meet the prescribed criteria by 2004 is doubtful."
"It is because the resolution supports this assessment that I cannot endorse it."
". (NL) I am in favour of enlargement but against this resolution because I regret the absence of a critical approach to various areas."
"First of all, many of the candidate countries do not meet the Copenhagen criteria."
"Problems involving corruption, detention without trial, discrimination and administrative capacity are still too widespread."
"Secondly, the accession of new countries has been announced to coincide with a 'big bang' in 2004."
"It is not the criteria, but the date, that has become decisive."
"It has therefore become politically impossible to delay the accession of a country until such time as it fulfils the criteria, the underlying message being that the criteria are actually unimportant."
"Thirdly, it is acceptable to admit countries even if they do not yet meet the Copenhagen criteria, but proper testing mechanisms (accompanied by penalties) should ensure that these criteria, and the acquis communautaire, are adopted as soon as possible."
"Such mechanisms (which should also apply in the current Member States) are put in place for the economic criteria, but not for the rule of law, democracy and human rights."
"The Dutch D'66 party sees these last shortcomings as even more serious than the economic ones."
"Finally, we are still waiting for the reforms to the disastrous agricultural policy."
"Recent agreements between Germany and France do by no means serve this purpose."
"Introducing the old, failing agricultural policy in the new Member States first only makes it less likely that there will be genuine reform in 2007."
"- (SV) We Moderates have today voted against the resolution concerning the mid-term review of the common agricultural olicy."
"We have done so because we believe that it is of the greatest importance that expenditure on the common agricultural policy should not increase in the manner proposed in the resolution and that the current interinstitutional agreement should be respected."
"Nor are we able to support a resolution recommending customs duties in the agricultural sphere."
"The ways in which the resolution is worded impair the Commission's proposals."
"We regret that we are unable to support this resolution because, by broadly supporting the Commission's proposals, it recommends commendable changes to the common agricultural policy."
"The Commission's prime objective is to create a competitive agricultural sector that is of benefit to consumers, taxpayers and the agricultural sector as such."
"- (DA) Firstly, we should like it to be noted that we strongly support revision of EU agricultural policy, that is to say, the actual aim of the report."
"As we believe that the revision has crucial shortcomings, however, we have chosen to vote against it."
"We should like the revision to incorporate the 'Sustainable CAP Initiative' declaration, which has been approved by 85 environmental, developmental, agricultural and consumers' organisations across Europe, including the Danish Society for the Conservation of Nature."
"The European Parliament must oppose any amendment of the common agricultural policy that would break the terms of the contract which, until 2006, links European power and the agriculture sector, particularly as all the signs indicate that European agricultural spending is still substantially lower than the amounts laid down in Berlin in 1999."
"The common agricultural policy must, as a matter of priority, ensure both food safety and food security, and the European Union must therefore impose the same quality and health requirements on agricultural products imported from third countries as on European products."
"Furthermore, given that agriculture is extremely important in maintaining economic activity in rural areas and in achieving balanced land use, we need to establish and maintain specific measures."
"In fact, regulatory stability and the maintenance of income policy guarantee investment choices and the continued operation of farms and agricultural businesses."
"We must prevent restrictions on aid to farmers from encouraging large undertakings to expand further, to the detriment of the family farm model, which is environmentally friendly and which has a human aspect."
"- (SV) We welcome the resolution's focus upon wanting to reform the common agricultural policy, as well as its emphasis upon the place of the environment, food safety, health and animal protection within that policy."
"It is also encouraging that the European Parliament wishes to support young farmers and traditional family farms, above all in less favoured areas."
"We also wish to argue that, as a general principle, food production cannot be placed on an equal footing with industrial production and must therefore be safeguarded by special trade conditions, especially with a view to taking full account of environmental considerations."
"We welcome the fact that the original paragraph 21, expressing the view that the Commission's proposals require the EU budget to be increased up to the ceiling of 1.27% of GDP, was voted down (356 'yes' votes to 135 'no' votes)."
"That would have meant an increase of a good SEK 150 000 million, something which is unacceptable."
"Nowhere in the resolution is it stated that current agricultural policy is protectionist and hits many of the world's poorest countries very hard."
"On the contrary, the impression conveyed is of a defensive policy, with the European Parliament expressing the view that agriculture must benefit from qualified external protection, that is to say be protected against unfair competition from outside."
"We have therefore chosen to vote against the whole of paragraph 21 of the resolution and to abstain from voting on the resolution as a whole."
". (NL) The common agricultural policy needs to be reformed on account of the high costs, environmental damage and the disastrous impact it has on developing countries."
"European agricultural policy must also be acceptable at international level, actually achieving the objectives of the Doha round."
"This resolution, however, pleads in favour of an outmoded system."
"It still underlines the need to guarantee prices, while for years this has proven to be fatal to the sound functioning of the market."
"This resolution does not sufficiently emphasise the need for far-reaching reforms and settles for the marginal reforms before us."
"Consequently, we are unable to support Mr Daul's resolution on any count."
"D'66 demands democratic control over European agricultural policy."
"In this connection, the European Parliament must be given the right of codecision and full budgetary authority."
"Instead of policy reform, the European Parliament today is consenting to more money for agriculture and a continuation of the present disastrous policy."
"We are shocked that our Dutch Christian Democrat counterparts in this House should agree to the removal of the budget ceilings in the field of agriculture."
". (PT) The admission by the North Korean authorities that they have been developing a secret nuclear weapons programme requires the European Parliament to adopt a firmer stance than that contained in the joint motion for a resolution, which has just been voted on."
"Specifically, its text should include a demand for this programme to be terminated and for the activities concerned to be inspected in accordance with the safeguard rules set by the International Atomic Energy Agency."
"Furthermore, the position of the European Parliament should seek to ensure that further dialogue between the EU and North Korea in the fields of cooperation, humanitarian assistance, investment and support for democratic institutions is dependent on the clarification of this issue."
"This is why I had no alternative but to abstain from this vote."
". (PT) I have supported this report because I believe that, without a genuine stabilisation of the European territorial area as a whole, it will be hard to address the concerns and the expectations of the European peoples for a lasting peace and the consolidation of a dynamic, competitive and socially fairer economic area throughout the continent."
"We all know that the strategy pursued by the European Union towards the five countries of the Western Balkans - Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo - has been undertaken within the Stabilisation and Association Process and that this strategy is intended to develop, in that particularly sensitive region, forms of democracy and solid market economies similar to those in the EU."
"Consequently, in terms of promoting a European area in which the Rule of Law and economic progress prevail, I must highlight some of the points referred to by the rapporteur, specifically: the clarification of the status of Kosovo; the clear application of a policy for the return of refugees and an active policy to combat organised crime and corruption; strengthening the Rule of Law, specifically by means of creating an independent judiciary system proper to democratic models; improving the educational system in order to consolidate peace between peoples, promoting the objective knowledge of history, mutual understanding and respect for other nations and their cultures and the promotion of the role of a credible media, independent from all and any political control, which is able to function as a genuine form of opposition."
"- (SV) We have chosen today to vote in favour of Mrs Schroedter's report."
"We disapprove, however, of recital B, which sets the appropriations to the cohesion policy in stone."
"Against the background of enlargement, it is difficult to know exactly how much will be needed in terms of resources for various forms of regional aid."
"That is why it would be better not to decide in advance what maximum and minimum levels are to apply to the cohesion policy."
"Otherwise, we believe the report to be sound."
"I can only add my final support to this report which emphasises how pivotal and crucial cohesion policy is for all those who want the European model, based on integration and solidarity between the richest and poorest regions of the European Union, to be more than just a pious hope in the enlarged Union."
"As this policy is crucial, it therefore needs to be reorganised, to be adapted to and meet the specific needs and socio-economic reality that will result from enlargement."
"We now need to transform the economy in a way that is ecologically and socially sound and direct it towards sustainable development."
"Sustainable development must become the goal of the steps we take with regard to cohesion, as Jacques Delors emphasised as long ago as 1993."
"In order to identify regions in need of aid, therefore, the per capita GDP criterion should no longer be the only indicator used."
"We need to supplement this with other regional statistical indicators. That is why I shall support Amendment No 10."
"I shall therefore give this report my full backing precisely because it strongly reiterates the fact that tomorrow's cohesion policy must be based on the principles of solidarity, partnership and additionality."
"I voted in favour of this report, together with my group, because I believe that, overall, the cohesion policy is a good one."
"We must, however, note that EU State primacy has meant that it is the States with no significant regional problems that have benefited most of all, such as Ireland and Portugal."
"Furthermore, the concept of region, which is often technocratic, applies to situations that are often entirely different from a human perspective."
"Nations such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, therefore, often contain regions which are not recognised as such by the respective States that could benefit from these funds and are unfairly excluded."
"Lastly, it should be pointed out that cross-border policy not only brings together different nations, but sometimes also brings together fragments of the same nation that have been unjustly separated."
". (PT) We support the statements contained in this report declaring that 'cohesion policy must be based on the principles of solidarity, partnership and additionality' and that 'the most remote regions must be given priority in the new regional policy'."
"We also agree that 'EU policies must be made considerably more consistent, to the benefit of economic and social cohesion'."
"And for this reason, we can only condemn the damaging effects that the proposals we are debating on the mid-term review of the CAP and the common fisheries policy would have on the Union's cohesion policy."
"Nevertheless, with regard to the funding of cohesion policy in a future enlarged Europe, the mere acknowledgement that it is impossible to drop below the current share of 0.45% of the Union's GDP is inadequate."
"Given the implications of the restrictions imposed by the Stability Pact on the least-developed countries - not least Portugal, where the draft budget proposed by the government, in the aim of complying with the convergence criteria, will considerably accentuate regional imbalances - this answer will have to be given on the basis of a real evaluation of cohesion policy needs and with a revision of the financial perspectives with a view to enlargement."
". (PT) In its analysis of this report, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism did well to highlight some important aspects relating to economic and social cohesion policy, including, amongst others, its acknowledgement of the effectiveness of the Structural Funds system in aiding the economic growth of the developing regions, its opposition to the attempt to rationalise this policy and its recognition of the specific characteristics of the outermost regions."
"The report omits one fundamental principle, however, that would enable us to give it our unreserved support."
"This is the principle that implementing European cohesion policy in an enlarged Europe will consequently be much less balanced from the point of view of regional development, and cannot be achieved at the cost of the solidarity that we still owe to the cohesion countries, in the first rank of which is Portugal."
". (DE) This report points out once again the grave deficiencies in the Structural and Cohesion Policy."
"I have for years been reading these reports with very great attention to detail, and always the same deficiencies are enumerated: unemployment continues to rise, and the cohesion policy interventions must be considered as having missed their targets."
"The present report highlights the fact that 24.2% of EU aid does not even reach the recipient regions, being diverted instead to richer ones."
"Faced with these facts, we cannot evade the question as to whether the policy we are applying is the right one."
"I also regard the candidate countries with concern."
"The Commission's progress reports show that action is urgently needed to develop their administrative capacities and coordination mechanisms."
"Mrs Schroedter's report must be a warning to us."
"The prospect of imminent enlargement means that a change of direction can be delayed no longer."
"It is precisely because I stand by the fundamental European ideal of solidarity that I demand a far-reaching reform of regional policy, one that will at last make this ideal into a lived reality."
"Mrs Schroedter's report contains good ways of going about this, and the Freedom Party delegation has therefore adopted it."
". (PT) I have abstained from the final vote on this report primarily because of the vicissitudes that have characterised its progress and because of some of the resulting ambiguities."
"In fact, the original version of the text proposed by the rapporteur was rather vague and some parts of it even contradicted the previous resolution of the European Parliament, which was adopted by a large majority last February."
"The final text has therefore led to various amendments being tabled by practically all the political groups, which has achieved some improvements, although, as always happens in these situations, the final mosaic is not characterised by any great quality of form."
"It is true that some fundamental points on which agreement has been reached with regard to the principle of economic and social cohesion and to some of the relevant policies have ended up being reaffirmed - including the defence of the specific characteristics of the outermost regions - but the text does not ultimately have the vigour that I would like to see, especially in the context of the changes that are appearing on the horizon: enlargement and institutional reform."
"For this reason, my final vote, in conjunction with the various partial votes, is an attempt to express the fundamental value that I attach to this Community principle (see Article 158 of the EC Treaty) as a fundamental founding principle and permanent guiding principle of the European Communities and of the European Union."
"This point cannot be overstated or given too much consideration."
"Only the continuity of cohesion policies can lead to the much hoped for reduction in economic and social disparities and the strengthening of common values within a European Union."
"The discussion about how the European policy of economic and social cohesion should be shaped after 2006 is far from being completed."
"It is not the moment for the European Parliament to lay down any clear criterion."
"The aim of this report is to indicate the direction which the Parliament wants the discussion to take."
"As long as we do not have more detailed information about the future needs of the regions lagging economically behind the average of the Union, it would be a political mistake to say that we want exactly the same criteria that apply now."
"That is why the PSE group voted against the rapporteur's Amendment 12."
"That concludes voting time."
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 a.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 7 November 2002."
"The final draft agenda, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday, 14 November 2002 pursuant to Rules 110 and 110a of Parliament's Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"Monday:"
"Mr President, this matter concerns the agenda in general - I do not know if it affects Monday."
"As you are aware, the Prestige, failing to live up to its name, spilt several tonnes of oil off the Spanish coast, which not only created an oil slick more than 200 kilometres long, but is also a source of great environmental concern and great economic concern for the families affected, which number over 5 000."
"Therefore, Mr President, as I understand that Parliament must be sensitive to our citizens' concerns, I would ask you to include in our agenda a Commission statement, followed by a debate, so that we can examine the circumstances in which this incident took place, the causes, the measures that the European Union needs to take in order to prevent a recurrence and possible terms for European Union solidarity."
"Mr President, I do not know whether this can be done on Monday or on Thursday, due to the Commission statement on climate change, but I would like to establish it clearly now, so that if the rest of the political groups agree, we can include it in our agenda."
"Mr President, on a point of order, I wish to ask whether you can confirm whether the reindeer were on the ground or in the air at the time."
"If I were to answer it might introduce too much levity to the situation."
"I should like to remind colleagues that these speeches should be limited to one minute."
"Mr President, as a Galician and as fisheries coordinator of the majority group in this House, I welcome the decision we have taken for the Commission to attend on Thursday in order to explain to us in the finest detail - because we are going to require the finest details - how this extremely serious accident could have occurred."
"Mr President, Galicia is black: its beaches, its coastline, its fauna, its fish, its birds ? and the people are facing a black future."
"I would like to ask you, Mr President, to declare your solidarity, on behalf of this House, with the Spanish and Galician authorities and to address them directly."
"On Thursday we shall call for aid and an enquiry from the Commission."
"I would also like to announce, given that this House, in accordance with the new Rules of Procedure, does not allow us to table resolutions, that through the Committee on Fisheries I shall propose a resolution to establish protected European sea-fishing zones in susceptible areas, which will increase the required distances to be maintained between these zones and ships carrying dangerous goods and bring forward the obligation for this type of ship to have a double hull, which is currently laid down for the year 2015, and I shall call for it to be brought forward to the year 2005."
"Mr President, I am telling you this as an Irishman and a Celt: we cannot allow another disaster of this kind to occur in Europe."
"We must increase control and prevent our environment from being destroyed."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group and also as the Socialist coordinator of the Committee on Fisheries to draw the attention of the House to the oil spill from the Prestige, to which previous speakers have also referred, which took place last week near the coast of my region, Galicia."
"On Thursday - the accident happened on Wednesday - I tabled a motion for a resolution before this House and also tabled two motions for resolutions, because I understand there are common interests here: environmental interests, fisheries interests - which the Committee on Fisheries will have to pursue - and interests relating to the maritime transport of dangerous goods, which the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism will have to pursue."
"The tanker has already left an oil slick 37 km long which is spreading towards the coast, paradoxically, despite being named Prestige - and you can see that this will indeed be a European problem - it is Bahamas-flagged, with a Philippine-Romanian crew, it was travelling from Lithuania - a candidate country - to Gibraltar, which involves a European Union country, a Member State, in this case the United Kingdom, and was under the command of a Greek captain."
"I would call on the Community institutions to strengthen legislation in this field, comply with existing legislation and devote their attention to this kind of disaster by means of European solidarity, such as that provided, for example, in the cases of the natural disasters that have taken place in four Member States over the summer."
"Mr President, on a point of order, you are aware that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is due to begin next Monday in the Hemicycle in Brussels."
"I understand that the Conference of Presidents has sent quite a strongly worded letter to the Belgian authorities concerning the prospect of two members of the Zimbabwean delegation being on the visa ban list."
"I understand that visas have now been granted to those two ministers from Zanu-PF and they are due to arrive in Brussels tomorrow."
"Mr President, could you give us some indication what action the European Parliament will now take on this very serious matter?"
"In the light of Parliament's resolutions which we conveyed immediately after the Conference of Presidents to the Belgian authorities - who had already issued visas and did not wish to withdraw them - I propose that the Conference of Presidents should again this week appraise the current situation."
"We should discuss Parliament's options consistent with its resolutions and consistent with the necessity to be coherent in following up its resolutions and consider declaring these two persons personae non gratae with regard to access to the Parliament itself."
"Should the Conference of Presidents make such a decision, it will then convey that decision to the Belgian authorities and to the authorities in Zimbabwe."
"That would be my personal preference."
"In any event, I guarantee that the matter will be raised in the Conference of Presidents."
"It will be for the majority will of the Conference to determine the appropriate action to be taken and then to convey that decision to you and colleagues, and also to those outside the House."
"I will pass on that observation to the relevant authorities in the Commission."
"I shall say for the record that after the debate on this matter on the last occasion, I communicated on behalf of Parliament our sincere condolences to the relevant authorities, which was the request made of the presidency at that time."
"In the light of your request the best thing I can do is to say that I will take personal steps to communicate with the Members before we have these debates."
"In the interim, I can tell you that I had an opportunity for the first time to report back to the Conference of Presidents on the results of exploratory discussions on the Statute for Members which I held on behalf of the Conference of Presidents with the relevant Council authorities."
"A decision was made last Thursday at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents to invite the rapporteur, Mr Rothley, to again develop our thinking and his report before the Committee on Legal Affairs and Internal Market, with a view, at a date yet to be determined, to discussing the matter and voting on it in plenary."
"In the interim period, we could contemplate an oral question or invite the Council to make a statement at the first part-session in December."
"When I have had the opportunity this week to report to the Bureau, which is the next body in sequence, having reported to the Conference of Presidents, I will then try to take some steps to ensure that all Members have their own appraisal of the state of the exploration as we made it."
"That is a very wise observation on your part, Mr Fatuzzo."
"Mr President, on a point of order, because of the historic debates that will take place this part-session there is no Question Time."
"I had submitted a question to the Council on the legislative process and the way in which this House is potentially being treated in relation to the proposed directive on legal aid."
"The Council intends to adopt this measure at the end of the month on the basis of a different text to that on which Parliament was consulted."
"This will avoid the codecision procedure, which would kick in after the end of the month, and it also avoids the strong advice of the Commission that the Council should reconsult Parliament."
"I should like to know, on behalf of this House, why the Council feels it has no obligation to reconsult us."
"Does it not agree that this action runs absolutely counter to the principle of mutual respect and good faith between these institutions in the legislative process, as set out in the Treaties and endorsed by the Court of Justice?"
"Mr President, this is serious and I would ask you to look into it."
"Mrs Wallis, in the absence of Question Time, your question is noted."
"Let me take up your request to see whether we can have some indication from the Council as to its response on the question of substance you have now posed."
"Mr President, on a point or order, I am following on from what Mr van Hulten said concerning Wednesday, 4 December."
"As a member of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I am well aware of the constitutional and practical importance of moving forward with the Statute of Members - even though I would not myself have chosen this particular way of doing it."
"However, I note that on the agenda for that day there are major debates on fisheries - the first for ten years - looking at the fisheries industry of Europe at a critical time."
"Constituents all over Europe will wonder what the European Parliament is thinking and doing about that."
"What the newspapers will tell them is that Parliament delayed discussing it until it had talked about its own pay."
"This is a scandalous state of affairs."
"I hope that if the Conference of Presidents persists with this agenda in this form it will change the order and bring the fisheries matter - which is of utmost importance - before and ahead of the debate on the Statute of Members."
"If colleagues wish to discuss this issue they could raise it at the Conference of Presidents on Thursday."
"I remind you that we have just voted on the adoption of the December agenda for Brussels without any discussion or contradiction or proposals from the floor."
"I take note of what you have said."
"It is still open to the groups to look at the order of discussion on that day."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I welcome the recent acquittal of the British and Dutch plane-spotters on spying charges in Greece and the fact that the appeal court had the integrity to put right the original miscarriage of justice that the conviction represented a year ago."
"I recall that it took many years to right similar wrongs in cases in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, so I am pleased that, although a year is an ordeal for the defendants, it was no longer."
"But the fact is this prosecution should never have happened and the way it developed raised a lot of concerns about the treatment of defendants and trial standards."
"It is therefore essential that we progress the agenda for ensuring high minimum procedural standards of justice for persons accused in criminal proceedings which the Commission will be putting forward in a proposed framework decision next year."
"We also need to put flesh on the bones of our human rights commitments in the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Perhaps we could ask the Commission to take note of your question in advance of the statement which will be made by the Commission on Thursday."
"Mr President, today we saw at the airport that nature can sometimes turn against technology."
"To avoid deliberately upsetting nature, we must draft effective climate policy."
"The emission of CO2 must be drastically reduced."
"A majority in this Parliament has been pleading for years that environmental costs should be passed on to the consumer."
"Environmental tax must be incorporated into air fares, especially in the air transport sector."
"So far, however, the European Union has failed, for there is no climate tax."
"Fortunately, there is also some good news."
"For a fee, the organisation Trees for Travel plants trees after each plane trip you make."
"Every time you fly, you can buy a climate certificate to balance out the emission of CO2 from your trip."
"Despite a lack of legislation, we can at least put our money where our mouth is."
"The Dutch delegation in the Group of the Party of European Socialists has decided to back this initiative and to buy climate certificates in Strasbourg this week for their plane trips."
"I urge the President and all the other fellow MEPs who travel regularly by air to do the same."
"Mr President, as a Member for a peripheral maritime region, I would also like to express my solidarity with the Galician fishermen affected by the Prestige ecological disaster."
"Secondly, I would like to say, as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and a substitute member of the Committee on Fisheries, that four aspects are significantly affected by this disaster."
"I would therefore like the Commission and in particular the rapporteur, Mr Izquierdo Collado, to ensure that this White Paper on transport takes into account, for the year 2010, something that concerns me and that a Member from the Canaries, Mr Medina, mentioned to me today: the failure by many ships, both Community and other, to follow routes which avoid the exclusive economic zones in certain regions, such as Galicia."
"That concludes the item."
"Mr President, in 1997 the process by which fixed and mobile telephony and television and the Internet were increasingly coming together was known by the buzz word 'convergence'."
"The Commission adopted a much heralded Green Paper on this subject which promised a brave new world of horizontal regulation across platforms."
"The reality was much more prosaic."
"Convergence did not happen quite to the extent predicted and the Commission confined itself largely to revising the telecommunications regulation package to take account of new technology."
"Since that time, however, we have witnessed a wave of mergers and take-overs in the media with the emergence of vast conglomerates such as AOL Time Warner, CBS, Viacom and Vivendi Universal."
"Yet the Commission has not explored the idea of cross-media ownership and media concentration in any detail since its 1994 follow-up to the Green Paper on pluralism and media concentration."
"The Commission's silence on such an important issue seems particularly strange because the European Parliament has been calling for a directive on a level playing field and media pluralism since the 1990s."
"I recognise that regulating the media is a highly sensitive issue."
"The media is not like any other industry as it lies at the heart of our culture, our way of life."
"A diverse and pluralistic media is fundamental to democracy, freedom and cultural diversity."
"But in view of the trend towards media concentration, towards the dominance of certain media conglomerates, my group believes it is high time that we come back to this issue."
"What are the principles which should underlie our approach?"
"First of all we must recognise that a thriving media is the hallmark of a free society."
"If control of the media becomes too narrowly restricted in the hands of a small number of people this poses a danger for democracy."
"The media needs to be sufficiently diverse for all important points of view in society to be effectively presented."
"Otherwise there is a danger that dominant media players can restrict access to information and thereby move public opinion."
"Avoiding media concentration is also important to our economy."
"Some have argued that with the explosion of different types of media, including digital, satellite and cable television, as well as the Internet, monopolistic control is impossible."
"However, many of these different channels of communication are now controlled by the same media conglomerates, which can thereby cross-promote these services and provide incentives or pressure advertisers to buy space or air time in other media they control."
"Last but not least, media concentration has implications for our cultural diversity."
"A Europe in which the media is dominated by a few major players risks being one in which certain regions, cultures and minority groups are granted less access to the media."
"A diverse media is likely to result in more home-grown original content, whereas large media groups may not resist the temptation to fill their air time with cheap imported programmes and repeats."
"For the ELDR Group there is a clear case to look again at this issue."
"My questions to the Commission today are: what action does the Commission propose to take?"
"If the Commissioner takes the view, as I suspect he may, that there is no legal basis for action, I would remind him of the articles of the Treaty governing the single market."
"I would remind him too that Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees media pluralism and if that Charter is integrated into a new constitutional treaty, as Liberal Democrats hope it will be, would that not provide a necessary legal base for action?"
"Will the Commission undertake to bring forward a White Paper updating its 1994 communication in the light of technological change and developments in the industry?"
"It seems to me that we cannot ignore the dangers that media concentration poses to our society."
"The power of media ownership now frequently extends across national borders."
"Given that a free and diverse media is essential to our continent's democracy, prosperity and cultural vitality, it is high time that politicians face up to their responsibilities and return to this issue."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my group has tabled this question on media concentration and I must say I am very happy that the initiative has spread throughout the House, because we consider that this is not a single-party or single-group issue, but a concern over a matter of constitutional importance to the Union."
"We did this because, ten years ago, the Commission put forward a Green Paper on pluralism and the internal market, and proposed - and even drew up - a preliminary draft directive to harmonise national legislation on media ownership."
"Since then, nothing has happened, and the Commission, which has the monopoly on initiative, should also show that it deserves this right."
"Many things have happened over the past ten years."
"Significant technological progress has been made - the Internet over written media, cable, satellite television, digital technology - which have transformed the landscape."
"A concentration process has also taken place which goes beyond our borders and means that certain names have spread and now represent the media throughout Europe, such as Murdoch and Berlusconi."
"Others have fallen by the wayside, such as Messier and Kirsch, and others are arriving, such as Bloomberg."
"We must also take account of the developments that are taking place in the United States, where the federal authorities are making changes in order to increase US technological capacity."
"In any event, however, Mr President, my group thinks this is above all a democratic issue, because it refers to one of the bases of the system we live in, namely the protection of freedom of speech, which is one of the cornerstones of a democratic society."
"I am not only referring to freedom of speech as we politicians defend it, but also to freedom of speech for all citizens and also for workers in the press and the media, because it does not make sense for us always to advocate greater democracy for workers in other sectors but not in this one."
"This should also be extended to the candidate countries, where concern is spreading over the loss of the national character of the media."
"Therefore, Commissioner, allow me to play devil's advocate."
"I said that no progress had been made in ten years."
"Why has no progress been made?"
"It would be interesting to analyse the matter."
"Is it because it is very complicated?"
"European construction has always been a challenge and what I would therefore say is that if the directive was necessary, and it was necessary to address this issue, in 1992, it is all the more necessary now."
"Secondly - and this is another of the questions we posed - it could be considered that the legal basis is insufficient."
"Ten years ago, however, it would appear that it was sufficient."
"It would be interesting if the Commission were to explain this to us, or otherwise tell us whether it would be appropriate, for example, for this issue to be considered as a matter of fundamental rights in the Commission proposal to the Convention."
"Lastly, Mr President, we are aware that this is what is known as a cross-cutting issue."
"I must say that I am very happy that it is the Commissioner responsible for the protection of consumer rights and health who is to respond to this question, because we are always told that this issue concerns the internal market or competition."
"It is more than that."
"It concerns competition, the internal market, culture and fundamental rights."
"There were four Commissioners I was thinking might appear, and it was a pleasant surprise to see Mr Byrne, who also has to defend us as consumers against this uncontrolled invasion not only of audiovisual messages, which are frequently subliminal, but also against uncontrolled advertising and the monopoly in the field of advertising."
"I therefore hope that today's debate, in which all the parliamentary groups are participating and showing interest, will be a step forward, breaking this ten-year silence and allowing the Commission to exercise its monopoly on initiatives in this fundamental area responsibly."
"Mr President, these debates on the hot topic of media policy have been going on since 1992, and Parliament had always taken a democratic approach to the issue."
"Since 1997, though, silence has reigned, but now it seems that I can congratulate Parliament on having, like Sleeping Beauty, woken up."
"I would like now to speak on behalf of my group."
"I cannot but underline the arguments of those who have spoken before me, and I would like to pick up two of the significant points they made."
"Entrepreneurship, on the one hand, has become out of balance with journalistic activity on the other, as it now is also with those who produce creative material."
"It is for us to restore this balance."
"The EU, which announced the creation of the internal market as one of its priorities, must assume its political responsibility in this process involving consolidation and concentration."
"We did not liberalise a few years ago by breaking up media monopolies simply in order to create new media monopolies."
"Both economic diversity and pluralism in the media are equally under threat."
"The wide-ranging nature of concentrations merits particular attention."
"My second point is that one of the pillars of democracy is the separation of powers, something that is of especial concern to my group."
"Having successfully accomplished the separation of church and state, I believe we ought now to devote our energies to separating political power and the media."
"I am speaking here of a European official culture, especially on the eve of enlargement."
"One more practical question for the Commission: in 1997, the directive on media ownership disappeared back into a drawer, quite possibly as a result of political pressure, although we cannot be certain of that."
"We need a better legal basis at European level, but then we know that; it is a statement we heard all of five years ago, and we do not need to have it repeated."
"Why, then, has the Commission only now started to do something about it?"
"We are all aware of these problems; they are not new, and we do not need to reinvent the wheel."
"Action is needed, O esteemed Commission!"
"I repeat that I support the arguments of those who have preceded me on the floor, and, as Mr Barón Crespo said, media policy is not a party issue."
"We must not let it become one."
"Mrs Fraisse is absent, probably due to transport problems, which we are all suffering today."
"Mr Segni therefore has the floor for two minutes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union's core concerns include the safeguarding of freedom of information and the freedom and diversity of opinion."
"These are among our fundamental values, to which, it is to be hoped, the Convention will give a prominent place in the constitution that will be our common possession."
"That being so, Parliament has, over past years, repeatedly done in-depth work on these issues and taken actual developments in the European Union and the Member States as a yardstick when measuring the extent to which these things have become reality. I do not think one can say that Parliament has been asleep."
"It is not only 1997 that should be mentioned here;"
"I would like to remind you all of what we decided together in 2000 with our position on the fundamental questions relating to the communication and information society in the European Union, and would also refer you to our common position on the revision of the television directive in 2001."
"That was something on which we did not yield."
"The only thing is that we have to take a realistic view of how things stand."
"So far, the results are clear and unambiguous: we have no option but to draw distinctions."
"The media markets continue largely to be the national markets that they were previously, as is unmistakeably clear in the case of the print media."
"Secondly, it is the case that in the electronic media field, the television markets are still predominantly national in character."
"It must, thirdly, be clear to us that development has progressed further."
"Cross-border developments are increasingly taking place in the electronic media, especially where digital technology is brought into play."
"This is a question on which we have to focus, examining very carefully what consequences this development is having for the safeguarding of freedom of opinion and information and pluralism of the media in the European Union and in its Member States."
"That is why my group, that of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, has put to you a question with reference to this specific development."
"We are asking the Commission to draw up a Green Paper on the current situation to take up the question of the structural developments observable today in Europe's political, economic and legal media."
"We additionally ask you to table a proposal for our consideration on what you consider to be appropriate action in order to achieve the objective, which it is to be hoped is shared by us all, of safeguarding the pluralism of the media and of opinion in the European Union."
"I do think that, if we travel together in this direction, we will together take a significant step along the road towards guaranteeing diversity of opinion in the European Union."
"Mr President, one of the crucial principles of a properly functioning democratic society is freedom of expression and access to information."
"In this Chamber, we have again and again emphasised the importance of openness and transparency."
"Citizens must have access to information affecting their lives so that they can take part in the democratic debate and make their choices."
"The media have a central role to play in this process."
"If they do not operate properly, then neither does democracy."
"At present, there are media trends that give rise to concern."
"The consolidation we have witnessed may lead to less pluralism in the media."
"We combat monopolies because they reduce the supply of goods, with a consequent decrease in prosperity, and the same applies to the media market."
"Monopolies undermine democratic pluralism and lead to a decrease in democratic prosperity."
"Previously, party political media such as newspapers were only able to exercise political criticism within their own medium."
"They had no control over what other media put out."
"The threat we face today is one of potentially powerful consolidation, which may mean certain points of view not being represented in any medium."
"As legislators elected by the people, we are faced with striking a sensitive balance."
"To what means can we have recourse to ensure free and diverse media without at the same time setting aside another cardinal principle of a democratic society - that of the distribution of power."
"We want to set up basic rules that guarantee a level playing field without tampering with the actual content of the media."
"We need, in this Assembly, to comply with our democratic responsibility and make sure that the media comply with theirs."
"Mr President, as has been stated repeatedly in this debate, there is undoubtedly a link between freedom of information and democracy, and I feel that this debate must serve, not least, to make Parliament and the European institutions more aware than they have been hitherto of the link between democracy and suppressed freedom of information, of the way the media is used to suppress democracy."
"This is the case in many countries with which we have economic or commercial relations and countries such as Iraq, China, Cuba, Vietnam and so forth."
"Certainly, safeguarding freedom of information as a guarantee of genuine democracy is a problem for Europe too."
"There are two or three points I would like to make in this regard."
"Firstly, in my opinion, we need to be very sparing in our calls for European legislation, in our calls for the Commission to impose some sort of constraints on a market - the merging telecommunications and media markets - which, we must not forget, has to be able to withstand the challenges of the international markets inasmuch as European undertakings have to be able to withstand the challenges of the international markets."
"Now then, overloading a market which is already struggling - there are linguistic and cultural barriers, for example, which make it difficult for companies to grow - with the additional burdens of constraints and restrictions could be dangerous."
"There is, however, a paradox which I would like to point out in this debate."
"It is absurd that we who, although not members of national parliaments, are representatives of the European institutions, focus a great deal on market dynamics and concentrations but fail to even mention the powerful force of state media companies in Europe."
"Take Italy, for example."
"It is right to put the spotlight on the situation and it is right to be concerned, as it is always right to be concerned about the relationship between the media and democracy, but what is not being said is that half the information sector is in the hands of the state, in other words in the hands of the parties."
"This is the case almost throughout Europe."
"Do we really think that the parties are using their television networks with due respect for the pluralism of information and due respect for the citizens' right to be informed, or are they serving their own interests and putting across specific information?"
"There is another dimension to this, and here I pay tribute to the work of Commissioner Van Miert in the previous Commission."
"The existence of state television networks is detrimental to the media and information market."
"State television networks take up space which could be used for the creation of competing firms, possibly even European firms, and the charges, licence fees and funding associated with them siphon off resources which could be redistributed in the market and used to create a plurality of competing companies."
"We must reflect on all this."
"I feel that a comment from the Commission on these matters - state aid, competition, the abuse of dominant positions and so forth in the internal markets - would be appropriate too."
"Mrs Fraisse has managed to arrive at Parliament from Basilea and I give her the floor on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, media freedom and independence do not go well with accumulated economic power, not to mention monopolies."
"This is especially true when one is dealing with political power wielded by a head of government."
"The name to mention here is Berlusconi."
"The Italian media tycoon and, in one and the same person, prime minister, along with Mr Murdoch and Herr Kirch, have given the champions of unfettered press freedom a lesson in fear."
"That the Kirch empire has collapsed can be of little comfort in view of the pressure exerted on public service broadcasters by commercial enterprises - I am referring to the cost of rights to sporting events among other things - and in view of an increasing concentration of regional, national and worldwide media with growing cross-border involvements."
"Media concentration to an illicit degree endangers diversity and pluralism of opinion and the promotion of cultural diversity."
"Volume 44 of 'Media Research' a series of treatises published by the North Rhine-Westphalia Media Institute, has come out in the last couple of days; it gives a powerful description of media concentration's adverse effects on society's democratic and cultural foundations."
"It also has to be said without equivocation that the rule of law in Italy is in danger."
"It has already had the worst of the fight."
"All this leads to only one conclusion, namely that European regulations are needed to limit concentration in the media, because national law does not apply outside the borders of states, or also because - as in Italy - the effort is not even being made."
"Reference has already been made to the way the Italian State President's profound concern has led him to call for an Italian law to deprive the prime minister of practical political control over the services of the public-sector broadcaster RAI, and to restrict his power as a private individual over the media."
"Berlusconi is in every respect a special case, and one that it must be hoped will remain unique, involving an array of legal actions relating to tax evasion, forged documents, perjury, payments from slush funds, the bribing of judges and similar things, not all of which have been brought to a conclusion."
"We therefore call on the Convention to impose a constitutional ban on any such agglomeration of power, which is positively indecent."
"Even the Pope - or so we have heard - is advocating regulations to safeguard pluralism and freedom of opinion."
"That, Mr Prodi, Commissioners, is why I say it is now time for you to take some action!"
"Mr President, I take issue with most of my colleagues who have spoken in the debate so far, as regards their desire to rush into some form of undefined new directive or regulation on so-called concentration and media ownership."
"As Mr Byrne pointed out to us in an admirably clear intervention, there is no treaty base for it."
"How is it going to be defined?"
"How far do you intervene politically in issues of media concentration in areas that, as the Commissioner pointed out very clearly, cut across a whole range of other weapons the Commission has at its disposal to regulate monopoly power, a word that has been freely bandied around this Chamber this evening?"
"If there is monopoly power commercially, then the instruments are there to tackle it and they should be used."
"I wonder how many colleagues who have contributed to this debate this evening have actually bothered to read the new package that regulates electronic communications."
"Mr Watson, who opened the debate, probably has not, because if you look at that regulation - and I was one of the colleagues that worked on it very closely - you will see that it anticipates the fact that we will have convergence and that the big issues that are opened up in the world of convergence are about controlling access to channels."
"There are provisions in this regulation to open up access, to make access available on fair reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, again key words we should be thinking about in any context, particularly in media."
"It also makes provision for public service broadcasting, an issue that we ought to be discussing more in this context, to allow governments to open up channels where they feel that public channels should be conveyed to the market place."
"Those issues are already there."
"Do not ignore them."
"I agree with what Mrs Hieronymi said."
"Certainly we should invite the Commission to look at this problem, but the last thing we should do is to anticipate the results of that analysis."
"Mr President, the question of media pluralism is an important subject, which affects the very essence of the values that provide a basis for our work in Europe. This is for reasons that all of us have very much in mind obviously."
"Without pluralism, there is no opposition, no freedom and, therefore, no democracy."
"Without pluralism, the freedom of audiovisual and cinematographic creation would be jeopardised and therefore the cultural identity of Europe would be at risk."
"It is crucial, therefore, to ensure that the principles of diversity, pluralism and independence of the media are applied in the Member States and in the candidate countries."
"Media pluralism concerns the broadcasting of information, television and the Internet as well as audiovisual creation."
"In a constantly changing media environment, the presence of public service television channels and private television channels, as well as restrictions on mergers and acquisitions between commercial players, are essential in order to maintain audiovisual pluralism and cultural diversity."
"Equally, we must ensure that sufficiently diverse information is broadcast from both public and private sources over all media platforms."
"That is why the Commission should carry out a thorough assessment of the media situation in each candidate country and in each Member State."
"A Green Paper was drafted on this issue in 1997."
"Today, developments in communication technologies, the key role played by the Internet in spreading information and cable television are phenomena which are pushing us to look again at the issue of media concentration."
"It is very important, for example, that the Commission begins work as soon as possible on resolving the problems raised by the lack of transparency in granting television licences in the Member States and in the candidate countries."
"Once this assessment has been carried out, the Commission will be able to decide to establish competition rules ensuring media pluralism in the event of this proving necessary."
"Freedom of expression is fragile and can only be guaranteed if genuine media plurality exists, and this is something we must all monitor on a regular basis."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we were to accept the suggestions made in this Chamber by speakers such as Mr Segni, for example, and hold one particular person responsible for all the evils of the media sector, we should somehow have to conclude that the deer and other animals which invaded the runway at Strasbourg airport today were, in actual fact, extras from the Mediaset networks which had been recruited and enlisted to prevent this debate from taking place!"
"That is not the case!"
"The matter we are discussing is so much more complex and problematic that we must rather be aware that the speed of technological progress is leading, particularly in the field of communications, to the development of new ways of transferring knowledge, new forms of peaceful coexistence of peoples and new lifestyles and mentalities."
"In other words, communications generate culture, and culture is transmitted via communications."
"One might say that all our lives are now locked in a communication mechanism requiring a complete reassessment of all our basic points of reference."
"The huge increase in information sources and the failure to distinguish between their levels of authoritativeness, the progressive replacement of interpersonal relations with a mediated approach and the expression of opinions on the basis of opinion polls which are not founded on fact, are all factors which ultimately lead to various forms of dissociation, which influence our very beliefs and lives."
"The recent events in Italy were not the result of this very complex issue of the media."
"Rather, what happened was that the left, which had controlled state television in recent years, went so far as to attempt to influence the last elections and, in its endeavours to hold the sword of Damocles over its political opponent's head, put off the issue of regulating the media sector indefinitely and made it very difficult for the matter to be resolved."
"Absence of control and supervision has never brought guarantees or freedom, as many would have us believe."
"It ultimately fosters the indiscriminate use of extremely powerful tools which, if abused, have devastating effects on people's consciences and society."
"I therefore call upon the Commission to be the guarantor of this principle of freedom and to propose an appropriate course of action to Parliament and the Council, which could, for example, be the subject of another Green Paper."
"Mr President, we pride ourselves on the way in which the principle of competition oils the wheels of the economic system and it must not be allowed to weaken the most vital component of democracy, by which I mean sources of information, and undermine the principle of political competition."
"Secondly, in this age of electronic democracy, we should all be investing in guarantees to safeguard our long tradition of democratic values and, first and foremost, the separation of media power from economic power."
"May I, therefore, say that this motion should be adopted unanimously and point out that passing legislative and other support measures is a top priority for the democratic future of Europe, that there has been an unwarranted delay in taking action since the Green Paper was published, that the measures required need to be incorporated into general policy on audiovisual media, that we must accept that the traditional rules of market competition are inadequate and that we need an independent competitive network with its sights set on real pluralism and that, for these purposes, restrictions on concentration are compatible with Community law."
"All the speakers present in Parliament have now spoken."
"I have received six motions for resolutions"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0344/2002) by Mr Medina Ortega, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products (COM(2001) 283 - C5-0274/2001 - 2001/0119(COD))"
"I hope the Members who were still on their way here will be able to attend."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I am pleased to be here today to present the Commission's proposal for a directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship."
"It has been a long time since the Commission adopted this proposal - 18 months to be precise."
"It would be an understatement to say that I am disappointed with the slow progress on this proposal so far."
"There have been delaying tactics, misinformation and, very often, misleading statements."
"It is a great pity that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was unable to work more quickly, in contrast to the much quicker response from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, whose members are the true experts in the European Parliament on public health and consumer protection."
"They at least clearly understood the importance and urgency of this proposal."
"Worldwide, almost 5 million people die every year from tobacco-related diseases."
"This is two and a half times the number of deaths from AIDS."
"Of those 5 million half a million are European - the equivalent of the population of Copenhagen."
"Advertising plays a major role in promoting tobacco use, especially amongst young people."
"The tobacco industry needs new recruits to replace those whose consumption of the deadly product has caused their early deaths."
"It is against this background that I invite you to look at the present proposal."
"This directive is important for the operation of the single market."
"Without it the single market for print media, radio and the Internet cannot be guaranteed on account of variations in national legislation on tobacco advertising across the Member States."
"The proposal is intended to replace the previous directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship, annulled by the European Court of Justice two years ago."
"The previous directive included a ban on all forms of tobacco advertising and sponsorship."
"The Court considered that this general ban did not have the legal support of the Treaty."
"However, the Court was not entirely negative in its ruling."
"Far from it."
"It helpfully confirmed that a directive prohibiting certain forms of advertising and sponsorship could be adopted on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty."
"The new proposal therefore follows very closely the guidelines set out in the Court's ruling."
"The logic behind the present proposal is clear: all Member States have adopted national rules to regulate the advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products."
"These regulations, unsurprisingly, vary considerably between Member States."
"This divergence has, ironically you might say, been exacerbated by the annulment of the previous directive."
"This gives rise to increasing barriers to the free movement between Member States of products and services that serve as support for such advertising and sponsorship."
"We aim to eliminate these barriers by harmonising the rules relating to the advertising of tobacco products and related sponsorship to the extent possible in the light of the Court's ruling."
"The proposal foresees a general ban on tobacco advertising in the press. This is an important vector for tobacco promotion, and one that has strong cross-border implications."
"The proposal also includes a ban on tobacco advertising on the Internet."
"Advertising of tobacco products via radio and the sponsorship of radio programmes by tobacco companies would also be banned on the same lines as television advertising under the television without frontiers directive."
"Finally, the proposal deals with sponsorship - banning this for events or activities with cross-border implications."
"Overall, the proposal has a much more limited scope than the previous directive."
"I know that many of you regret this and I sympathise with this view."
"I make no secret of the fact that I would have preferred to present a proposal for a complete ban on advertising for tobacco products."
"But, unfortunately, the legal framework does not allow us to go that far."
"We have to live in the real world."
"We have to recognise the legal constraints."
"Our common concern must be to ensure that this new directive can and will stand its ground against any possible future court challenge and to eliminate the market distortion by harmonising current national rules, whilst at the same time promoting public health."
"A final thought for now."
"This proposal has been very carefully constructed."
"Any weakening of its legal position would open the door to challenge which, if successful, would play directly into the hands of the tobacco industry."
"We simply cannot afford to let that happen."
"Mr President, Commissioner Byrne has made an enormous effort to bring forward a proposal for a directive in a field in which the Court of Justice had rescinded the previous directive on the complete prohibition of tobacco advertising."
"In terms of health, I believe that the Community is in a situation worthy of Kafka, because, although we have competence in the field of animal health - from stabling to feedingstuffs and transport - in contrast, in practice our competences in the field of health are minimal."
"In other words, the European Union has hardly any competences in the field of human health."
"It is able to adopt certain measures, certain recommendations, certain promotional initiatives, such as cooperation between States and with international organisations, but when it comes to legislative harmonisation, in practice we are faced with deadlock."
"The Commission has been intelligent enough to try to take maximum advantage of the conclusions of the Court of Justice, what I would call the obiter dicta of the Court of Justice, in the judgment which rescinded the previous Directive on tobacco advertising."
"And from the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, the rapporteur in particular has had the greatest sympathy for the efforts of the Commission and Commissioner Byrne to bring forward this proposal for a directive which, as he has said, is much more modest than the previous one."
"Nevertheless, the rapporteur must acknowledge that there have been enormous difficulties within the Committee on Legal Affairs and, in order to make the negotiation of this directive possible, has had to accept a series of compromise amendments that make up the current text, which has been adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"We do not yet know what the result of the votes next Wednesday on this issue will be."
"My impression is that, at the moment, this House is very much divided, since, as some Members claim, certain amendments may even weaken the legal basis proposed by the Commission and, at this moment, specifically, the opinion, for example, of the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy - who I believe we will hear next - is, of course, opposed to the introduction of amendments."
"I have the impression that certain of the amendments, at least, are justified, since they are intended to correct some of the aspects of the directive which would benefit from improvements."
"For example, a generalised extension of the prohibition of the use of certain trade marks could prejudice companies which, in reality, do not produce tobacco; all that happens is that some of the trade marks coincide with those of other companies who do produce it."
"I believe that each of these amendments will have to be studied carefully."
"I share Mr Byrne's concern at the delay which has taken place within the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"We felt obliged to hold a hearing as a result of the enormous disparity in opinions which had been expressed in committee and, at that hearing, I must acknowledge and point out that the majority of the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs were critical of the Commission's proposals."
"The rapporteur has therefore felt obliged to do some rather deft work, trying to bring together positions in order to produce a first text that would reach the plenum in this House."
"It will therefore be this House which really decides next Wednesday on the fate of each of these amendments."
"Certain subsequent amendments have been presented, which the rapporteur considers to be acceptable in principle - the amendment by Mrs Hautala, which is intended to strengthen the Commission's legal basis by means of a recital."
"I hope that, next Wednesday, regardless of what happens with each of the amendments in the different votes, the text of the directive as a whole can be approved."
"In other words, I hope that the report is adopted so that the negotiation may continue."
"Since we are undergoing a co-decision procedure, we all have the opportunity to carry on correcting the deficiencies which may be contrary to the objective of being sure that this new proposal for a directive may pass the test of a further hearing before the Court of Justice, which will undoubtedly take place, because in the field of tobacco there are always hearings before the Court of Justice."
"The Commission can rest assured that I have an entirely constructive approach towards the object of achieving a final result in relation to this."
"But I will say again that this is a democratic House and the opinions of the Members vary widely."
"I even have the impression that there are significant differences between the national delegations within the various parties."
"The task of the rapporteur in this case must therefore be one of coordination, of good will, if you like, and above all of coordinating the results obtained next Wednesday in this House with the good intention of the Commission and the Commissioner of adopting a Community regulation in the field of health."
"In any event, it should be remembered that the inclusion of a clause on health in the forthcoming European Constitution is still to be dealt with, and I have the impression that the work of the Convention is not moving in that direction at the moment, which is rather worrying."
"Mr President, our draftsperson, Mrs ?alliori, has been held up by fog at Strasbourg airport and has asked me, with your permission, to stand in for her."
"Every second, someone dies as a direct result of smoking."
"This adds up to over 3 million victims a year worldwide, 500 000 of whom are European citizens."
"Forty-two per cent of the Community population smokes and they are starting younger and younger."
"Sixty per cent of smokers start smoking at 13 and 90% start before they are 18."
"The gender gap between smokers is narrowing, with an increase in the number of girls smoking and 500 000 babies are born prematurely and underweight because their mothers smoke."
"Children in homes in which both parents smoke run a 72% greater risk of respiratory diseases such as asthma."
"These are just some of the reasons why legislators in the Member States of the European Union have felt compelled to restrict tobacco product advertising rights, in order to protect public interests in general and the health of European citizens and young people in particular."
"The World Health Organisation framework convention currently being negotiated, which should be completed within the next few months, takes the same approach, stressing that a tobacco advertising and sponsorship ban is one of the most urgent political rules which needs to be applied internationally."
"As the House knows, this Commission proposal replaces Directive 43, the directive which, albeit after ten years' negotiations, was finally passed by the European Parliament and adopted by the Council in 1998 but, unfortunately, annulled by the Court of Justice in October 2000."
"The purpose of the directive being debated today, eighteen months after the Commission submitted its proposal, is to approximate the various laws, regulations and administrative provisions adopted by the Member States, in order to remove obstacles to the internal market and safeguard the free movement of goods and services and this is in keeping with the rules set out in the directive."
"The present directive, which takes account of current legislation in the Member States and the case law of the Court of Justice, adopts parts of the previous directive and bans advertising in printed media, on the Internet and on the radio, together with sponsorship of events with cross-border effects."
"It also bans the free distribution of tobacco products, but does not cover indirect advertising."
"However, unlike the previous directive, it is not based on the principle of a total ban on all forms of advertising and sponsorship."
"I should point out here, however, that the Commission has submitted this more restricted proposal, which takes account of the legal framework set by the Court of Justice, in tandem with a proposal for a recommendation containing the elements which, as I said, have been excluded from this directive."
"Unfortunately, the Committee on Legal Affairs has adopted 25 amendments which could lead to further annulment by the Court of Justice and which restrict the scope of the directive still further."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the other hand, agreed with my proposal not to submit any proposed amendments and voted unanimously in favour of the Commission proposal."
"Ladies and gentlemen, our decision on Wednesday will have tremendous political implications because it concerns an issue on which the European Parliament and the Council have already expressed a view and taken a decision."
"I therefore call on you to vote against all the amendments by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"This is the only way to guarantee a fast procedure and, more importantly, to ensure that we take a decisive, firm, legally tenable step towards a Community policy to control smoking."
"According to the scientific data available, this will promote high health standards, especially among the young, who are not just the main target group; they are the very future of Europe."
"Mr President, measures taken by the European Union to combat the spread of smoking go back a long way, as do the legal wrangling and the case law of the Court of Justice and I think we should make sure we learn from these experiences."
"The proposed directive seeks to protect public health but takes the ban on the distortion of competition as its legal basis."
"This ambivalent situation needs to be borne in mind by everyone championing more effective ways of protecting health from the spread in the use of tobacco which, unfortunately, does not have its own article in the Treaty."
"It is therefore only logical that the new proposal should be more modest when it comes to protecting public health than the annulled directive, which also included indirect advertising."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs felt the ban needed a cross-border dimension, not just for sponsorship, but also for the press, in order to strengthen its validity."
"By definition, national advertising and sponsorships do not affect the internal market."
"The legal basis selected only allows advertising to be regulated where it impacts on the internal market."
"Consequently, printed matter circulating solely within the territory of one Member State has no cross-border effects and cannot create any obstacle to the internal market or serious distortion of competition."
"This is clear both from the proposed arrangements for event sponsorships and from the fact that the proposal for a directive makes no reference whatsoever to outside advertising of tobacco products or advertising in cinemas."
"We know that the Committee on Legal Affairs has expressed reservations about certain amendments from the purely legal standpoint."
"Mrs Hautala, on the other hand, is operating on a different wavelength altogether and has called for health protection arrangements to be strengthened."
"Given that no one here is against health protection measures, the bottom line is that the two sides have to calmly decide which amendments are needed in order to rescue this as a valid directive."
"Mr President, there are mainly two elements of relevance here: one is content and the other is procedure."
"Let us focus on content first, because it is obviously all too easy to overlook this aspect in a legal discussion of this kind. Is a ban on tobacco advertising effective if the aim is to prevent its use?"
"Yes, of course it is."
"Hardly anyone takes up smoking because they like it."
"They do so for other reasons."
"They may take it up because of peer pressure in the playground, children of parents who smoke take up smoking, and people take up smoking because they associate it with a certain image."
"They want to emulate the man making his way through the jungle in a rowing boat, for example, or that other man on horseback somewhere in the wild west with pleasant music playing in the background."
"This is why people take up smoking."
"Image has everything to do with it."
"This is why a ban on tobacco advertising is good."
"It is a legitimate product, so why should you ban it?"
"Last month, an overwhelming majority of people in this House voted in favour of banning advertising for pharmaceutical products, but, unlike tobacco, these are produced to make people better."
"I am in favour of legalising cannabis, but I would not dream of allowing this product to be advertised."
"So the problem is more complex than at first sight."
"As it happens, there was already an opinion from the European Parliament - and also from the Council, in fact."
"In 1998 we stated that we were in favour of a ban on tobacco advertising."
"In this connection, the Court said that we had gone too far, with good reason, in my view."
"This was completely unrelated to tobacco but had everything to do with the question how far we, as a Union, could go in respect of the Member States."
"I believe that the Commission was right to say: okay, this is what Parliament and the Council wanted, they wanted to go as far as possible."
"The Commission subsequently consulted the judgment by the Court, and also the opinion of the Advocate General, and copied almost verbatim what was suggested."
"I therefore believe that the Commission has done a sterling job, and I shall therefore advise the majority of my group to reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"These do not appear to be essential in order to make the directive more acceptable."
"I should like to make two final observations."
"First of all, I do think we ought to be careful not to start a smear campaign against the use of tobacco, for example by introducing a complete ban on smoking in public places, or by banning children's toys, chocolate cigarettes, liquorice pipes and suchlike."
"This is taking matters too far, and by doing so we would also lose our allies in the fight against tobacco."
"Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to once again draw your attention to an unacceptable anomaly, namely that we are discouraging the use of tobacco products on the one hand and are continuing to heavily subsidise tobacco production in Europe on the other."
"Mr President, the problem we have when we talk about tobacco is that we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy speak from the point of view of public health and not from the point of view of the possible disadvantages of banning tobacco advertising for the internal market."
"We therefore prefer the directive which was approved in 1998."
"As the Commissioner has already said, five million people die each year from diseases related to smoking."
"Other Members have said thousands of young people start smoking every year, with all the consequences that addiction has in store for them."
"Several studies have demonstrated very clearly the effects of this advertising and the sponsorship of certain sporting events in terms of young people starting to smoke earlier."
"In fact, 60% of smokers, according to the statistics, begin before they reach 13 years of age and around 90% before 18 years."
"We therefore much preferred the 1998 Directive, which unfortunately was rescinded by the European Court."
"In the case in hand, various Members in the Environment Committee have decided that they are not going to present amendments to the Commission's proposal because it is better to have a limited directive than no directive at all."
"We are therefore only presenting one amendment, which proposes that, in accordance with the Treaty, the Member States should retain competences and be able to regulate this type of issue and even go further."
"Furthermore, the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment points out very clearly that this is one step and that surely, in the future, the European Commission will be able to present proposals on indirect advertising, on the control of expenditure on advertising and on tobacco vending machines."
"In short, Mr President, it is better to have a limited directive in this area than no directive at all."
"Mr President, it was mentioned here that the previous attempt to achieve a wholesale ban on tobacco advertising at European Union level was overturned by the Court of Justice and it is indeed interesting to read that when this decision was given Advocate General Fenelli said that there was good reason to suppose that a ban on advertising would save around 38 000 lives in the European Union every year."
"We might also say that there are very good grounds for bringing in this directive now, even though it is rather less comprehensive in its legal scope than before."
"We must proceed in such a way that the Commission's original proposal is approved in its entirety as far as is possible, and I was very glad that the Commission has shown its support for the cross-party amendment to Recital 1 which we have proposed in this House."
"Its purpose is to clarify the fact that indirect advertising remains within the competence of the Member States and that they may enact advertising bans in this area."
"In general we want to protect the national bans on tobacco advertising."
"It is with great sorrow that it has to be said that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have watered the Commission proposal down totally."
"It is also to be hoped that every single amendment accepted by the Committee on Legal Affairs will be rejected in this House, because they complicate the issue in many ways."
"They obscure the proposal's legal basis."
"They completely rule out the possibility of restricting tobacco advertising in the press and on the radio."
"They hamper global efforts to achieve a ban on tobacco advertising, and they also allow the possibility of the indirect advertising of tobacco."
"I would especially like to focus attention on Amendments Nos 17 and 24, which are extremely dangerous."
"Hopefully, too, the rapporteur will return to his original position and reject these amendments, which were accepted as compromises by the Committee on Legal Affairs, as they are not compromises at all: they just make this directive utterly pointless."
"Mr President, this new directive outlaws tobacco advertising in the printed media in the whole of Europe and will also prohibit the advertising of tobacco products on radio and on the internet."
"Equally, sponsorship by tobacco companies of events or activities involving several Member States will be outlawed."
"As EU legislators we must bring forward proposals which will help to protect the health of our citizens and I believe that the dangers for our health from cigarette smoking must be vigorously highlighted at every opportunity."
"In fact we have a moral obligation to do more than to warn young people, in particular teenagers, of the acute dangers of cigarette smoking for our health."
"A recent survey has suggested that child smoking in Germany alone has increased by up to 50%."
"The cigarette industry claimed that their cigarette products are for adults, yet every piece of practical evidence suggests that clever marketing and advertising only results in recruiting the next generation of smokers, who are teenagers."
"The budget for the European Commission to highlight the dangers of cigarette smoking is only EUR 6 million and this pales into insignificance when one looks at the staggering levels of money available to the tobacco lobby to put in place innovative pro-tobacco marketing and advertising campaigns."
"We need to do more to spell out clearly to young people the brutal consequences for one's health from cigarette smoking - that three thousand people in Europe die every day from cigarette smoking."
"This means that a half a million citizens die needlessly in Europe each year because of an addiction to tobacco products."
"Cigarette smoking is the single biggest cause of premature death and illness in the whole of the European Union."
"A recent study shows that American male smokers lose 13 years of life to the habit of cigarette smoking and that woman smokers lose 14 and a half years of life from smoking."
"If we are going to put in place comprehensive marketing campaigns to warn young people of the dangers of smoking, we need the necessary financial resources to oversee such a programme."
"The Commission, Parliament and the EU governments must substantially increase the financial budget for public health campaigns which highlight to teenagers the real dangers of smoking."
"Preventing tobacco-related illnesses would do more to help the citizens of the Union than any other life-saving measure, and tobacco companies are wrong to claim that advertising does not promote smoking but only promotes brand loyalty for a legal product."
"Advertising does have an influence in promoting smoking; that is why all Member States in Europe have rules which restrict or ban tobacco advertising in some shape or form."
"Advertising for other legally sold products including pharmaceuticals and alcohol is similarly restricted."
"This directive does not mean that Member States cannot bring in more stringent measures to curb cigarette smoking if they so wish."
"Matters falling outside the remit of directives, such as indirect advertising or billboards and cinema advertising, remain within the competence of the individual Member States."
"Mr President, it is a fact that tobacco advertising encourages young people to take up smoking and stops people who already smoke from giving up."
"Customer relations of this kind do, however, take their toll."
"Given the harmful effects smoking has on health, including for non-smokers due to passive smoking, our group is in favour of a total ban on advertising for tobacco products."
"These products are dangerous and can, upon lighting up and inhalation, cause serious diseases which can even prove fatal."
"We are therefore very disappointed with the Commission's new proposal."
"Although we realise that, given the judgment by the Court of Justice, the Commission's options are very limited, this proposal largely overshoots its goal, namely to protect public health."
"I shall thus reluctantly endorse the Commission proposal without any further amendments."
"This is at present the most viable option in the fight against tobacco advertising."
"Six months ago, we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy held an extensive discussion on this topic."
"It is therefore beyond me why the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market should still be tabling all kinds of amendments which will ultimately frustrate the coming into being of this legislation."
"If these amendments are adopted, the chances are that the Court will once again declare the directive invalid."
"I should, however, like to urge the European Commission to continue its search for ways of reducing the use of tobacco, particularly where young people are concerned."
"It is incomprehensible that we should remove all kinds of less dangerous products from the market, but not tobacco."
"Once again, the use of tobacco is a euphemism for the injudicious incineration of dangerous carcinogenic substances."
"If this involved other products, we would have banned them a long time ago."
"I cannot imagine that we would bring toys into circulation which claim 5 million victims annually."
"Or that we would accept other products in food which result in 5 million deaths annually, but we do turn a blind eye where tobacco products are concerned."
"This is an example of extreme inconsistency."
"This is nothing to do with the precautionary principle."
"We know that smoking has harmful effects such as these, and this is why we should simply introduce a complete ban on this advertising."
"Mr President , Mr Medina Ortega's report, although insufficient, does in fact review the decision to cancel the 1997 directive on tobacco, and we welcome this."
"Tobacco, which kills hundreds of Europeans every day, is a scourge that we must combat in the name of protecting the health of our fellow citizens."
"We will not be satisfied with half measures."
"Either tobacco is a deadly poison and everything must be done to reduce its use, even eradicate it totally, or tobacco is - mistakenly - believed to be like any other ordinary consumer item and so, there are no grounds to legislate."
"In fact, because of the persistence of these opposing views, which Mr Maaten pointed out, people are now beginning to say that Parliament is supporting the growth of a product that it is repressing in other ways."
"The text presented by Mr Medina Ortega is heading in the right direction, but the proposed amendments weaken it considerably and we reject them."
"It is heading in the right direction because it has been proven that the ban on advertising helped to cut smoking and that there is indeed a link between advertising and excessive consumption."
"Strangely enough, the amendments give cross-border problems more attention than is their due."
"Thus, some Members seem to think that the existence of borders can have positive economic effects, whereas in many cases, it is the same individuals who are recommending the same borders be broadly opened up, regardless of the consequences."
"Today, given our extensive knowledge about the damaging effects of tobacco, it would be criminal to make no attempt to deter increasingly young consumers from becoming addicted to a product the advertisements for which boast of its benefits."
"Negligence, indifference and a lack of political courage in the area of public health sow the seeds of crimes against humanity."
"It is this irresponsibly lax approach that caused the contaminated blood scandal in France and the mad cow disease scandal in Great Britain."
"Today, no one can say that they are not aware and this means that everyone is to be held responsible."
"That is why we shall support Mr Medina Ortega's report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, every time we discuss tobacco in this Chamber all hell is let loose."
"There are divisions within groups, relations between committees are soured and Members who are usually friends treat each other with mistrust."
"Tobacco is a divisive subject for debate because of the many different sides there are to the argument."
"There is the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, which, it would seem, is not particularly concerned with public health and gives more importance to the internal market rules."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would appear not to be aware of the fact that there is no legal basis for proposing a public health policy."
"It is all a pretence."
"In actual fact, both committees are quite aware of all the facts, but this has now degenerated into role playing."
"In any case, whatever line we take, we cannot disregard the fact that Directive 98/43 was annulled by the Court of Justice because it lacked an appropriate legal basis."
"Therefore, we now have the chance to remedy the situation, if only in part."
"Indeed, as the Commissioner himself admitted with great frankness a few minutes ago, the Commission's latest proposal is decidedly inadequate to provide the kind of protection of public health demanded by the Committee on the Environment."
"In any case, as it stands, it seems to be limiting its demands, to be prepared to settle for very little in order to avoid another rejection by the Court of Justice because of the innovations it proposes, although they are very well balanced."
"As others have said and I want to reiterate, it would still be an appreciable result if we were to go home with the Commission's proposal."
"As on past occasions, a little is better than nothing."
"As shadow rapporteur, I too have recommended that my group vote for the Commission's proposal without amendments."
"We will see what happens tomorrow."
"The important thing is that we do not start proposing once again to cut Community aid to tobacco growers on the pretext of protecting their health or, now, to ban advertising."
"It is the smokers - and I stress, the smokers - not the growers who must be the targets of these measures to persuade people to give up smoking."
"Indeed, the strange thing is that even if the entire Community production were to be terminated, the number of smokers would not have fallen at all; on the contrary, the smokers would just switch brands and start buying products from third countries."
"This change would not bring any improvement at all in conditions of public health, just an increase in the revenue of extra-Community companies, and, worst of all, it would have a considerable negative impact on employment levels in European tobacco-growing areas, in other words in the south of Europe, where more unemployment is the last thing they need."
"To sum up, it is right to oppose advertising in the interests of public health but, for goodness' sake, let us not start proposing once again to cut aid to Community growers."
"Mr President, we at the European Parliament must respect the principles of the rule of law, which means that we must uphold judgments of our European Court of Justice."
"As we know, with regard to tobacco advertising, this court of law has previously nullified a directive on account of there being an incorrect legal basis."
"That does not surprise me, because during the debate of this first directive, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, under my chairmanship at the time, had clearly stated that the European Union had no powers to issue a directive of this kind."
"In short, the law has rights too."
"I should therefore like to thank Mr Medina Ortega warmly on his achievements as rapporteur on this occasion."
"I should like to stress straight away that I shall be backing him during the vote."
"After all, the rapporteur has ensured that the directive to be issued now is legally watertight."
"It is true that the European Union can impose a ban on tobacco advertising on the Member States if there is a clear cross-border effect."
"However, I should like to add that it seems to me to be necessary that the ban on tobacco advertising, if it has a cross-border effect, should be put on an equal footing across all Member States."
"Member States that take their own initiatives at present distort the internal market's organisation and often cause a competitive disadvantage for themselves."
"I would take the example of my own country, Belgium, and the sponsoring of major sports events in Belgium."
"Our country has already issued a law which bans any form of tobacco advertising from 2003 onwards."
"As you can see, this goes much further than the currently proposed European regulation."
"Is this wise?"
"I think that a general European regulation, as proposed by our rapporteur, should, on account of its general application, ensure that unilateral measures with often unfortunate consequences are avoided in future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I shall not repeat what my colleague Mrs Hautala has already said."
"It is clear that my group and I share her point of view."
"I would simply like to add to what Mrs Berger said."
"I feel that the Commission should put forward a proposal to the European Convention to change the Treaty's existing legal bases in the area of public health."
"Mrs Berger was right to stress the fact that the working group to the Convention has submitted its conclusions which attracted severe criticism in the Convention's plenary session."
"I feel that we absolutely must be able to legislate in the area of public health, as the arguments put forward here regarding subsidiarity do not hold water."
"On the one hand, the Council and the Community institutions are preserving their powers of appreciation as to whether or not it is appropriate to legislate."
"On the other hand, if we look at the studies carried out by the World Health Organisation, it is evident that in order for a ban on advertising to be effective, it must be applied thoroughly and comprehensively."
"The solution to be followed is that of global legislation in this area."
"We must at least have the means to pass European legislation, without which - and I refer back to the previous debate on media concentration - what will happen is that economic players will play the national legislation card against the others."
"This argument also puts the case for European legislation."
"Mr President, while I listened to the Commissioner as carefully as I always do, in my mind was the thought that this is another case of a never-ending conflict between our desires and our capabilities."
"Indeed, it is easy to let emotions take over when we discuss matters such as this, but I would remind you that this is a legislative House and that we have to respect the rules we make."
"I therefore agree with the position expressed by Mr Medina Ortega in the conclusion to his speech to the effect that, when we draw up the new version of the Treaties, we must reflect once and for all on the European Union's competences in this field."
"The lengthy analysis in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was a very serious process."
"With the first advertising directive having been annulled, the second proposal, although less comprehensive, is still wide-ranging and, in our opinion, it still leaves ample room for further recourse to the Court of Justice."
"In terms of primary law, the draft presented does not fully respond to the issues arising from the Court decision."
"I feel that, if we are to do the job properly, two minutes are not enough to go into the complexities of legal issues."
"I will therefore limit myself to two very brief points."
"The first concerns the prohibition on advertising in the press, with regard to which the general statement deriving from the decisions of the Court of Justice on the advertising of tobacco products to the effect that a ban on advertising can be contemplated, in principle, on the basis of Article 95, should probably be understood according to the very narrow Court interpretation of the Community's competences in the area of the internal market and not as a kind of carte blanche for the issue of a general ban on the advertising of tobacco products in the press."
"This is as the current legislation stands."
"The second point is the ban on Internet advertising."
"As regards the ban on tobacco advertising through information society services, it is difficult to perceive any potential future barriers to the freedom to provide services or distortions of competition."
"At best, such a ban can be based on the need to avoid the possibility of a further ban, and at this point, this means that the principles of Community competence and responsibility are being overturned and reduced to competences in principle, and that is extremely dangerous from a legal point of view."
"Mr President, Commissioner, just how harmful tobacco is can be judged, for example, from the fact that people say that if tobacco had been discovered now it would definitely have been banned because it causes so many public health problems."
"It does seem strange that we appear to be finding excuses for how we might continue advertising at European level to make this product, as wretched as it is in terms of public health, more tempting for people."
"We are now in a situation where we have to pass a directive that is unsatisfactory, but we have already heard the history of this matter."
"It was unfortunate that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market got no further in this: we have had to accept a very unsatisfactory outcome as a compromise."
"On the other hand, this directive is being dealt with under the Hughes procedure with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and the Commission proposal was unanimously supported by that committee, so we might say that, as a result, the majority strongly back the Commission proposal."
"These unfortunate decisions, which the Committee on Legal Affairs has arrived at, can certainly then be amended in the vote on Wednesday."
"As, however, we cannot be satisfied with this proposal, even though it is all we now have, it is vital that we should accept Amendment No 26 tabled by Heidi Hautala, which would make it possible to preserve legislation in those countries where it has advanced further."
"Mr President, Mr Maaten was right to focus on the content of the debate."
"In this connection, I regret that his report is not being debated together with that by Mr Medina Ortega today."
"I think that this would certainly have benefited the scope of the debate."
"As Mr Tsatsos pointed out, tobacco kills."
"In Europe, it claims 548 000 victims a year, or one every minute."
"Mr Maaten was right in saying that a tobacco advertising ban works and is lawful."
"May I add a few examples?"
"Norway has had an advertising ban in place since 1975."
"This has led to a drop in consumption by 31%."
"There have been similar trends in Finland and New Zealand, where a ban since 1978 and 1990 respectively has led to a drop in consumption by 34% and 33% respectively."
"We should also condemn the anomaly that, although we give tobacco growers EUR 1 billion every year, we find it difficult to produce a comprehensive strategy to restrict the use of tobacco."
"Finally, I should also like to draw your attention to the link between the tobacco lobby and politicians."
"I would ask you to endorse the amendments by Mrs Stihler and others, also backed by myself, which call for the introduction of a registration system of donations from the tobacco industry to political parties and politicians."
"Mr President, I would like to contribute to the debate this evening on behalf of my colleague, Lord Inglewood, who is a victim of the famous deer incident which has extensively been referred to already."
"I would like to focus on the principles behind the proposal, rather than the detail, which has been covered very comprehensively by colleagues."
"This is a long-standing issue and it arouses understandable emotions."
"It is perfectly reasonable that Member States should wish to control tobacco advertising and sponsorship and the Commissioner was quite right in his opening statement where he particularly focused on directing advertising to young people, to try and control new smokers coming into the smoking market."
"But I would argue still that the zeal to do this must not override the principles of the European treaties."
"We all know that the first time this was tried the Commission was too greedy."
"It exceeded those treaty powers and it lost the entire directive."
"In the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market - and I remind colleagues that this committee was right the first time round - this proposal runs the same risks."
"That is why we invite you to support our amendments."
"If you do not support them, you carry the risk of the whole directive falling."
"The second point I wish to make concerns the whole question of subsidiarity."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's proposal ensures that Member States take that responsibility."
"It derogates those powers to Member States."
"Mr Fiori said earlier on that it is not what we want to do, it is what is appropriate in the circumstances."
"There is a lot of talk about subsidiarity at present."
"Many colleagues are engaged in debates on subsidiarity in the ambit of the convention."
"This is a real test of that."
"You may want to do something, but it is not necessarily in the competence of the European Union to do it."
"That is what we are saying in this case."
"That we should not discourage Member States from doing it."
"This is the real test of how serious you are about the principles of subsidiarity."
"That is why you should support the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market's line when we vote on Wednesday."
"Let me first of all deal with some of the technical issues."
"Looking at the important question of the Commission's attitude to the various amendments, there are 26 amendments being proposed."
"The Commission can accept amendments 3, 10, 22 and 26 in full and amendments 8, 11 and 17 subject to some minor rewording."
"All the others, the Commission rejects."
"Throughout this debate, we have heard from many speakers and it is quite clear there are different views."
"Indeed there are different views in Member States."
"They have in fact sought to regulate the advertising of tobacco products."
"I am convinced that there is a correlation between the legal rules in Member States on advertising and the figures for adult consumption of tobacco in those Member States."
"If you look at one of the Member States with the highest level of tobacco consumption, Germany, with 37%, it has a fairly lax approach to advertising in its national law, as compared with Sweden, one of the Member States with the most restrictive advertising legislation."
"Sweden's rate of adult tobacco consumption is 19%."
"So there is quite clearly, in my view, a correlation."
"A number of you spoke about that in your contributions."
"It is a question of attacking the image of smoking."
"Mrs Alvarez Gonzalez referred to the different views of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Environment Committee's desire for public health to be promoted as an important basic consideration in determining these issues."
"Those who spoke on the other side of the argument, if I might describe it as such, are seeking to have legal certainty, which, as a lawyer, I would say is not at all unreasonable."
"It is an objective that I would seek to pursue myself, not just as a lawyer but as one of my responsibilities as a Commissioner."
"We have done that."
"We examined very closely the judgment of the Court of Justice in the first advertising directive case."
"When the Court looked at the facts of that case and gave its judgment, it clearly said that there were good parts in the legislation and bad parts."
"It went on to say that because they were so inextricably bound together, to attempt to extract the good from the bad, to retain the good and eliminate the bad, would amount to legislating by the judiciary and that cannot be done."
"That is why the legislation was annulled."
"I brought the judgment back to Brussels."
"I told my staff to follow it closely and we brought a new draft regulation."
"Referring only briefly to one part of the Court's judgment, paragraph 98 says in principle that a directive prohibiting the advertising of tobacco products in periodicals, magazines and in newspapers could be adopted on the basis of Article No. 100a - now Article 95 - of the Treaty with a view to ensuring the free movement of press products on the lines of Article 13 of Directive 89/552, the television without frontiers directive prohibiting television advertising of tobacco products in order to promote the free broadcasting of television programmes."
"The Court has spoken clearly on the subject."
"We have followed that carefully in our drafting."
"In response to Mr Lechner, who said earlier that there was no evidence of a distortion in the market, I must say that there is plenty of evidence of this."
"In the Commission we get letters regularly from people complaining from both sides of the argument, indeed even from the industry, about a distortion in the market because of the different regimes in Member States in relation to this issue."
"Mr De Clercq made reference to the movement away from Spa of the Formula 1 championship race."
"That is another clear distortion of the market, because Belgium brought in a law which they are saying forces them to move away from Belgium."
"That supports my argument that we need to have a level playing field in Europe."
"We need to have harmonised legislation on this issue throughout the European Union so that one Member State cannot be played off against another."
"This is also my answer to Mr Harbour."
"It is not a subsidiarity issue for the very reason that a Belgian has been pinpointed in a particular way and has suffered a loss."
"So not only does the Court say it can be done, the Commission says it ought to be done."
"But do not just take my word for it."
"The Committee on the Environment Committee says that we should have this legislation in the way I have described and I am sure it would agree the few amendments that the Commission concedes."
"Even when we look at the first report from the very hardworking Mr Medina Ortega, the rapporteur, there were three suggested amendments and I would have accepted any one of the three."
"If I read between the lines of what he has said, and forgive me if I misinterpreting him, I certainly got the impression from his reference to the compromised amendments that he was not speaking with great enthusiasm but was identifying the fact that this House was divided."
"Of course, it is."
"So maybe we can draw the conclusion that the first thoughts of the rapporteur on this issue, which are closer to those of the Committee on the Environment and to mine, might well be the ones to follow in this debate."
"Let us not leave it there."
"We have had a number of discussions on tobacco in the Council, including the preliminary discussions on the framework convention on tobacco control, and the breakdown there is 14 to one."
"One Member State takes the view that this legislation either should not go through or it should go through in such a form and with such amendments that in my opinion the heart is cut out of the legislation or amendments are added that leave it vulnerable to challenge in the Court of Justice yet again."
"So what do I say to those Members of Parliament who are undecided about this? I would say to them they should follow the views that are expressed by the Court."
"Follow the advice of the Commission. Follow the views of the experts in this House, the Committee on the Environment, and follow the first thoughts of the rapporteur."
"Think to what extent will Parliament be on its own if it either votes down this legislation or votes it through with the kind of amendments that are being proposed."
"It might not be quite alone, but it will be alone with one Member State, the Member State that happens to have the highest consumption of tobacco amongst adults in the European Union."
"That is the choice and therefore I would suggest to those who are undecided on this issue how you should cast your vote."
"I would suggest you cast it in a way that puts people's health first, rather than becoming engaged in a pointless debate about the legal niceties when the issues have been resolved by the Court of Justice and those who have examined this issue closely and believe that legal certainty does exist, to the extent that is necessary to support legislation designed to protect public health, as Articles 95 and 152 say."
"Both the Commission and Parliament have a duty and an obligation, in this decision-making and law-making, to promote the highest levels of public health."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I am taking the floor instead of Mr Lipietz, who should have been presenting this report on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, with his customary flair."
"Unfortunately, Mr Lipietz was unable to come to Strasbourg for this sitting for pressing personal reasons. I am therefore taking his place, being a member of the same committee and of the same group."
"We are all aware that financial conglomerates own a substantial proportion of the domestic financial markets of many Member States."
"Some of them belong to bigger groups that are present on the EU's financial markets."
"If the businesses belonging to conglomerates of this type were to face financial difficulties, they could seriously affect the overall financial system."
"At the present time, these cross-sector financial groups are not adequately regulated by current legislation."
"Therefore, we can only welcome the fact that the Commission, in the spring of 2001, presented a proposal for a directive to bring in the supervision of financial conglomerates such as these."
"The events of the past year, such as the collapse of e-commerce, numerous financial scandals, including the highly publicised collapse of Enron, and also increased pressure on insurance companies in the wake of 11 September, have inevitably highlighted the need for better regulation of this sector."
"The Commission proposal and the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs received Parliament's firm support at first reading stage at the beginning of this year."
"The Council also made swift progress on this dossier by reaching a common position shortly afterwards."
"The outcome of the Council's deliberations is also extremely encouraging. Parliament can most certainly welcome the fact that the Council has retained almost all the elements contained in the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading and that the common position has taken sufficient account of the main concerns expressed by Parliament."
"Despite the fact that there are a few areas where the common position could have been improved further, your rapporteur's major concern is to see this new and enhanced regulatory framework implemented as soon as possible."
"He therefore proposes - and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved this position almost unanimously - that the common position be adopted in its current form."
"This will enable us to ensure that European conglomerates will, in the very near future, be governed by the most up-to-date, most efficient and most effective regulation and controls possible."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by paying tribute to the speed and quality of Parliament's work."
"I must also commend the rapporteur on his excellent work."
"Financial conglomerates are important players in European financial markets."
"A significant number of them are also systemically important groups."
"If such a group were to face financial difficulties it could seriously affect financial markets and people's savings."
"Currently the supervision of such groups is not adequately regulated in European financial legislation."
"The directive will therefore address an important loophole in our financial legislation."
"Its adoption will contribute to financial market stability, the need for which has been demonstrated dramatically over the past months."
"The Council has also recognised the importance of this directive and has unanimously agreed on a common position."
"The common position has taken into account Parliament's main concerns expressed at first reading and is faithful to the objectives and the spirit of the Commission proposal."
"For all these reasons, I commend the Council common position to Parliament and urge its rapid adoption."
"Mr President, if the Council is concerned about the collapse of e-commerce, financial scandals and the resulting deterioration of the situation, there is good reason to be!"
"The people who have good reason to worry are the employees who have already been made redundant or are about to be made redundant by the companies concerned, even though they are in no way responsible for the anarchy of your economy, which is as unfair as it is irrational."
"Confronted with this genuine evil, however, the only solution being proposed is to strengthen prudential rules or to improve supervision, as if the financial conglomerates could be supervised from above by the political authorities responsible for protecting them."
"So as to prevent the mere sound of the word 'supervision' from angering the financial conglomerates, the report promises them that the directive will respect the need for confidentiality."
"And so, those who pretend to believe that a few prudential rules and a few coordinators who have no real power can eradicate speculation, scandals and financial crises from the capitalist economy will be those who therefore vote in favour of this report."
"Even a vote by the European Parliament cannot turn an insipid recommendation into a magic potion to ward off the evils of capitalism."
"Your economy based on the quest for private profits and on competition is even more unpredictable than the weather."
"Although we can predict unsettled weather three days in advance, who can predict the ups and downs of the stock market from one day to the next?"
"By voting against this text, we are expressing our opposition to an economic system which is stupid and dangerous for society."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, greetings from the United States of America, from where I returned yesterday from a meeting of the delegation responsible for Parliament's relations with the US, where we had further in-depth discussions with representatives of the US Congress and the US Securities and Exchange Commission specifically on the issue of regulation of the financial markets."
"This Directive on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate has been something that has been of immense interest to companies in the United States too."
"Enron and similar finance-sector scandals shook the confidence of investors and market operators in the stability of financial conglomerates on both sides of the Atlantic."
"Events in the past few years have undeniably shown that the financial services sector needs to improve its regulation and supervision."
"The business and financial markets are global markets."
"European legislation thus also has an obvious impact on how financial conglomerates operate in third countries, and vice versa."
"For this reason it is absolutely vital that legislators and regulating authorities in the European Union and the United States hold ongoing, intensive talks with one another on how workable the regulations and laws are and the need for change."
"For example, many of us Members of the European Parliament have taken a critical view of the securities legislation package passed at the end of October by the US Congress, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and in particular the additional obligations it places on companies in the EU."
"We still have much work to do to make the mutual recognition of systems possible and stop a jungle of multiple regulatory systems from spreading."
"In return, companies in North America must make their views known with regard to how EU legislation affects them."
"Many of them opposed this proposal for a directive because they considered it would make things unnecessarily difficult for them in the EU."
"The final outcome will hardly satisfy all parties, but we can at least be satisfied that the debate on both sides of the Atlantic has been conducted openly."
"In the future too we must take account of all legitimate points of view in order to ensure that global markets operate seamlessly."
"The Council has now arrived at a common position."
"It is a positive sign that the Council accepted almost all Parliament's amendments at first reading."
"I tabled some amendments at second reading that would have brought the legislation on threshold values in the directive closer to the realities of the market."
"Our rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, however, is proposing that the common position should be approved without amendment so that work on implementation might begin without delay."
"I am prepared to accept this proposal and I shall support the rapporteur provided that the provisions of the directive can be assessed regularly in terms of their viability and revised if need be."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"report (A5-0380/2002) by Mr Stevenson, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the Commission communication on the reform of the common fisheries policy ('roadmap') [COM(2002) 181 - C5-0330/2002 - 2002/2174(COS)]"
"report (A5-0360/2002) by Mr Souchet, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the communication from the Commission setting out a Community Action Plan to integrate environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy [COM(2002) 186 ? C5-0331/2002 - 2002/2175(COS)]."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as deadlines draw near that are decisive for the future of the CFP - leading to its objectives, terms and conditions being redefined - I feel it is crucial that Parliament firmly reiterates the five principles which served as the main theme of my report and which the Committee on Fisheries wanted to highlight with a view to fully integrating environmental protection requirements into the new common fisheries policy."
"The first principle is that nothing will be done without the fishermen."
"Those working in the fisheries sector are the first to be concerned about the protection of the marine environment and the first to be aware of the need to safeguard it."
"They are also the first victims of any impairment of the environment as shown unfortunately by the latest oil spill, which has today caused despair amongst the fishermen of Galicia."
"Three years after the Erika disaster, which struck the Vendée region and Brittany, it should not have been possible for the Prestige, an out-dated, dilapidated vessel, to be allowed to sail Community waters."
"Our report stresses the need to implement swiftly and comprehensively the packages of directives specifically named Erika I and Erika II."
"We refuse to consider fishermen to be predators, to which they are occasionally likened - I might add, wrongly so."
"On the contrary, this committee grants fishermen the status of wholly legitimate players in environmental protection and stresses that any measures taken without their backing are more than likely to be inappropriate and ineffective."
"The second principle is that we should base decisions regarding the management of fish stocks on scientific knowledge that is as sound and accurate as possible."
"The economic and social consequences of these decisions are so great that they cannot be taken lightly."
"That is why I welcome the fact that the Committee on Fisheries has retained the request to instruct the Commission to draw up a precise action plan with a view to improving the current but very inadequate system of stock evaluation by integrating into it the practical, empirical and pragmatic knowledge of fishermen, as well as checks on landings and by placing the interdisciplinary nature of biological and socio-economic sciences at the very heart of the process of formulating scientific opinions."
"The third principle proposes to retain flexible, reversible management instruments such as TACs and quotas, so that the fishing effort can be adjusted to match the state of resources, in preference to rigid instruments that have an irreversible and socially dramatic impact such as the scrapping of vessels."
"The fourth principle calls for fishing gear and techniques to be improved with a view to reducing discards, by-catches and the impact on habitats."
"Of course, such measures cannot be adopted in a uniform and centralised manner but must leave enough scope for initiatives from professionals working in the sector."
"Fishermen, their professional organisations and coastal communities must be given a right to experiment."
"Initiatives in this area must be recognised and encouraged."
"This is how very promising experiments on the Atlantic coast came about."
"I shall mention, by way of example, those experiments aiming to adapt fishing vessels and gear so that they may be used to collect marine debris or oil spills or even the creation of artificial reefs to facilitate the development of breeding or rest areas for maritime fauna, or even artificial fertilisation techniques in the open sea for sea bass."
"My report proposes that such experiments should be eligible for state funding."
"The fifth and final principle states that state aid for fleet modernisation, the aim of which is to improve working conditions, on-board safety, energy savings and the quality of fisheries products, is perfectly compatible with the protection of the marine environment."
"I am pleased to have been broadly supported by the Committee on Fisheries, which retained all of these positive and constructive proposals, thus rejecting the very negative vision of fishery activities, which strongly permeated the Commission communication."
"I hope that Parliament, by voting overwhelmingly in favour of this report, will make it clear to all that the protection of the marine environment will be achieved by working with the fishermen rather than against them."
"That is why, instead of adopting accusatory positions, instead of speaking constantly about an industry in decline and of a makeshift policy, the Committee on Fisheries preferred to send a message of confidence and hope to those working in the industry to consolidate their growing respect for the quality of the marine environment, a quality that is one of the crucial objectives that the new common fisheries policy is bound by duty to pursue."
"Madam President, I read with attention the report adopted by the Committee on Fisheries on our action plan on environmental integration."
"We are happy to note that our views are rather more convergent on this issue of environmental integration than on other reform aspects."
"We clearly share the same goals in respect of such important fields of action suggested in the report as environmental protection, improvement of research, including the integration of fishermen's experience, specific measures for specific problems, the implementation of an ecosystem approach, aids to modernisation, industrial fisheries, sustainable aquaculture and so on. In fact the Commission has already started or planned several initiatives to respond to these requirements."
"Allow me to outline some of them."
"We have requested the ICES to study in 2003 the possibilities for operational procedures to integrate fishermen's experience and knowledge in the assessment and advisory process."
"We agree that specific situations require specific measures."
"We do not apply the same combinations of management instruments in the Baltic as in the North Sea or the Mediterranean."
"We do not intend, either, to set the same targets for different fleets."
"To achieve the targets set out in Johannesburg, we are in the process of implementing the bio-diversity action plan with a view to halting bio-diversity decline by 2010 and it is through the reformed CFP that we intend to rebuild stocks sooner than 2015."
"We have recently co-financed an FAO expert meeting to develop operational guidelines to implement an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management."
"In our reform proposals we have excluded the mandatory scrapping of vessels and given more emphasis to multiannual plans using flexible instruments such as TACs, effort regulation and technical measures as main regulatory elements."
"We have proposed to maintain aid to modernisation of vessels for reasons of security, working conditions and hygiene, provided that there is no increased fishing efficiency in order to prevent increases in fishing pressure."
"We are promoting the elaboration by the main stakeholders of a European code of responsible fishing practice."
"The first drafts are already under discussion in the context of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture."
"We have requested that the ICES study the ecological consequences of industrial fisheries and the effects on non-fishery activities, as well as the threats, including global warming, to commercial stocks."
"The Commission has initiated debate to promote a coordinated protection of the marine environment."
"The recent communication on a strategy to protect and conserve the marine environment gives the main elements of the policy advocated for a holistic treatment of the problem."
"We have addressed the Erika oil spill by completing most elements of the package, namely the rules on port state control, certification and checking of security measures and bringing forward the phasing out of single hull tankers."
"The creation of an EU compensation fund for oil spills is expected to be finalised by 2003."
"We are constantly putting as much pressure as we can on Member States for a better implementation of the habitats directive in the marine environment as completely and as soon as possible."
"Finally, as you have already had the opportunity to study our communication on sustainable aquaculture, you may have noticed how much our intended policy in the area takes into account environmental protection requirements."
"As far as fisheries agreements are concerned, you will soon have an opportunity to confirm that the Commission shares your environmental concerns."
"The announced communication on partnership agreements will be presented shortly."
"Generally speaking, the Commission is on your side regarding the main resolutions of the report."
"However, I wish to comment on several statements in the explanatory memorandum."
"Firstly, while I recognise the shortcomings of scientific advice, I strongly disagree that this is the main problem of fisheries management."
"We all know that the main problem is too many fishermen chasing too few fish."
"Secondly, the rapporteur states that it is the Commission is pursuing a policy of capacity reduction."
"As I have said before on many occasions, this is simply not correct."
"It is not correct, either, that the Commission has proposed the abolition of public aid for modernisation of the fleet."
"Finally, I would not agree that industrial fishing has a much greater environmental impact per euro added value than fisheries for human consumption, mainly because I find it odd to measure environmental impact against monetary units, but also because the environmental impact of this kind of fishing has yet to be determined."
"To sum up, I do not agree totally with the form but will support the substance of the report and in particular the motion for a resolution."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work he has done and to thank him for this."
"Next, I should like clearly to emphasise that reform of the common fisheries policy must be based upon the sustainable development of fisheries."
"The sustainability in question must be defensible from an environmental point of view and be conceived in both economic and social terms."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is able to support the Commission's proposals for reform, which contain a number of features aimed at sustainability and, therefore, the balance needed if the stock of fish is to be adjusted to the existing number of fishing vessels."
"We would remind you that it is very important to secure the fishermen's understanding for, without that and without cooperation with the fishermen, we shall not be able to achieve the necessary results."
"In that connection, we must respect the fact that fishermen all around the EU attend to their tasks in different ways."
"It is absolutely crucial to the common fisheries policy that decisions be made on the basis of very clear scientific data."
"The Commission must gather this data from the Member States and, at the same time, have the necessary technical and, especially, human administrative and supervisory resources available to it."
"We should also very much like to emphasise that the EU must participate more in the development of the international fisheries policy."
"It is important for our third-country agreements to be given a central place in this connection."
"Madam President, I could almost echo the words of the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, Mr Busk, when he states that fisheries policy is, above all, a matter of international treaties and everything that takes place outside these."
"If we consider the maritime environment - and I am also speaking here in the capacity of shadow rapporteur for Mr Souchet's report, whom I should at any rate like to warmly congratulate on his report and the balanced way in which he has presented it - it appears that, where the implementation of environmental requirements in the fisheries policy is concerned, only a very small proportion is determined by fisheries policy."
"It struck me that the Commissioner said that if we consider the problem from different angles, then what it comes down to is that there are too few fish and too many fishermen."
"I wonder if, with regard to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, this situation is so cut and dried, particularly in the light of the recent disaster with an oil tanker off the coast of Galicia."
"If we consider the maritime area covered by European fishermen, then this is only a very small fraction of the total area in the world that is used for fishing."
"As Mr Busk has already stated, this also means that it is of key importance for us to conclude sound treaties, particularly outside of the European Union, in order to find the right solution."
"At the same time, the Committee on Fisheries and also my own group, of course, recognise the importance of the fishing environment, especially since the environment, including the maritime environment, is decisive for the fishing industry in terms of what can be caught."
"This means that if the maritime environment is in a bad state, the fishing industry, in particular, will bear the brunt of this."
"At the same time, this sector feels under pressure and the difficult bit is to strike the right balance between economic and ecological aspects."
"It would be nice if the Commission's public statements gave more evidence of this very balance."
"A properly motivated fisheries sector can contribute quite easily to a better maritime environment, and this also applies to the legislation needed for this."
"On this score, I am pleased that Mr Souchet - and indeed the Stevenson report, which was formerly the Noriega report - devotes particular attention to aquaculture."
"There are probably also good opportunities for Europe here, provided that we get the chance on this score to let legislation in this area run parallel with the economy on the one hand and ecology on the other from the word go."
"I have to say that the Souchet report has been particularly well received in our group."
"We will therefore warmly advise Parliament to vote in favour of the report, assuming that, as the rapporteur has observed, it is essential to take sufficient account of the economic and social aspects of fishing in order to encourage the fisheries industry and environmental legislation."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Souchet on this."
"Mr President, within the framework of the reform of the CFP which the Commission has decided to present to us in small doses, today we are debating the reports on the 'guideline' document and the protection of the environment."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Souchet on his excellent work because the environment is a fundamental aspect of the CFP, and fishing is the sector most affected by the attacks on the marine environment, as highlighted by the oil slick that is currently threatening the coasts of my region, Galicia."
"We know little about the sea and the fragile situation of the resources cannot be explained entirely by over-fishing, as Mr Souchet has rightly said and as the oil slick caused off the coasts of Galicia by the oil tanker Prestige dramatically demonstrates."
"I would like to believe that the fishermen and shellfishermen of my region are not going to face this terrible situation alone, but that Europe is going to show solidarity with them and that the European Commission will fully support them."
"And I would like to say to the Commission that, since it presented these proposals in May, it has received sufficient messages from this Parliament, from the Council and from the sector to redirect this reform in a different way, bearing in mind that it will always have to be gradual, be provided with sufficient resources and be agreed with the sector, with the Member States and with this House."
"I believe that the Commission is hearing this message."
"It is a shame that in May, on presenting its proposals for the reform of the CFP, the Commission should have ignored the resolution approved by this Parliament in January on the Green Paper, in which this House urged it to present a proposal for reform to create a sustainable and more Community-focused CFP, in opposition to attempts at renationalisation; a CFP that is fairer, eliminating the discrimination against certain fleets, showing more solidarity and supporting regions dependent on fishing, basically by means of Community co-funding of the restructuring of the fleet."
"Madam President, towards sustainability, that is the future of the fishing industry."
"It is important not only to draft these reports, but also to consider aquaculture and safe conditions within the fishing industry."
"It is unfortunate that the report was late, although this was followed by very fast work."
"Truly impressive."
"Further to the votes in the committee meetings, there are now sound reports before us."
"Despite this, we should, in addition to the precautionary measures that need to be observed, also consider the situations we are facing."
"ICES, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, is keen to reduce the catch quota of flatfish even further, while the safe margin is in sight."
"This cannot be completely justified."
"We should, however, ensure that we do justice to historical catch rights in the new common fisheries policy; these should not be jeopardised."
"Moreover, we should think very carefully about access to the seas."
"I am, of course, thinking of the North Sea, but the point I am trying to make is that fishing unquoted species is dangerous, because quoted species are caught along with these."
"It is at present extremely difficult to check whether the quoted species are left alone."
"Should they be thrown overboard or taken somewhere?"
"It has in any event a huge impact on those keeping track of the quotas and is important for the valuable species."
"In my view, this additional burden on the stocks is unacceptable, certainly if quotas were to dwindle even further."
"People have already taken the pressure off on their own initiatives."
"It will therefore be very difficult to sell this."
"Policy and management are dependent on the support base within the sector."
"In my view, we should prevent the sector from straying too far, and we will also need to involve it in creating and thinking of new solutions."
"This is why it is also extremely important for control and sanctions to be harmonised at international level."
"As for international fishing, I condemn unilateral measures, for they do not have a positive bearing on sustainable fish stocks."
"My final comment is: thank you, rapporteurs who have written the reports."
"I think that we have a sound basis to vote on this report in Parliament."
"Madam President, it is not by chance that the reform of the CFP is being undertaken in 2002."
"We must adopt it now precisely because, in accordance with their Accession Agreements of 1986, the transitional period established for the Spanish State and for Portugal are about to expire."
"From now on, therefore, these States must have the same rights in Community waters as the nine Member States that established the common fisheries policy at the start of the 1980s."
"Despite these obvious statements, Madam President, a majority in the Committee on Fisheries refused, in a totally unacceptable decision, to grant the Spanish and the Portuguese equal rights."
"The new CFP ought to acknowledge that the fleets of the fifteen Member States all have the same rights, thereby putting an end to the privileges and discriminations between the citizens, fleets and countries of the European Union."
"This pro-European - and I must say also Galician - position that my country has adopted inspired the report that I had the honour of drafting on the policies to be implemented for the reform of the CFP."
"Nor did we reject temporary restrictions based solely on the need to conserve fish stocks being established or maintained in this equal treatment of access to Community waters."
"We argued for the need to review or, where necessary, replace the principle of relative stability with a principle that is fairer and more consistent with the Treaties in this field."
"We argued for international fisheries policy and also joint ventures to be strengthened, and for public aid from the European Union for investment intended to improve conditions on board ships, which are currently very poor, to be maintained."
"For these and other reasons rejected by a majority in the committee, I cannot accept the report that now bears the name of the chairman of the Committee on Fisheries."
"The report nevertheless upholds some principles with which I agree, which survived the destructive offensive against the amendments tabled and adopted by the majority."
"This means that dialogue and a new compromise on the part of everyone where the reform of the CFP is concerned are still possible."
"In any event, they are still necessary."
"Madam President, I fundamentally disagree with many of the aspects of the European Commission's proposals on the reform of the common fisheries policy."
"However, it is true that a more balanced approach is needed."
"The current COM on fisheries policy has not been a success."
"It has not done any favours - and in some cases has been discriminatory - to Irish fishermen."
"The opportunity must not be missed to redress the current imbalance during this reform process."
"That is what Irish fishermen are asking for at the moment, and that is what I am asking for."
"One of the issues which is currently being discussed relates to the issue of access to the Irish Box."
"The Spanish Government, for example, is claiming that it is entitled from next January to even greater access to the Irish fishing waters."
"This simply cannot be allowed to happen."
"It would have absolutely disastrous consequences for Irish fishermen, their families and Irish fishing communities."
"Fish stocks in the Irish Sea at the present time are at a precariously low level."
"Opening up our waters to more Spanish vessels than is presently allowed will only result in a decimation of our stocks."
"The Irish Sea is a biologically very sensitive area."
"It is the spawning ground for many of our fish species."
"Only last week Parliament's Committee on Fisheries passed an amendment stating clearly that fish balances shall not be disturbed in western waters and therefore it is in this context that relative stability must be understood."
"We must protect fishing regions where our fish stocks are under threat and the Irish Box and the Irish Sea is one such region."
"The last thing we want is to have our waters opened up to more effort by Spanish fishermen, or indeed any other fishermen."
"We need to protect our fish stocks and not decimate them."
"Any new conservation measures which are introduced at European Union level must be brought about in consultation with all interested parties involved in all Member States in order to protect what is a very valuable natural resource for all of us."
"Madam President, it is on record that the outline regulations on the common fisheries policy were not agreed until eight hours after the Community had opened the accession negotiations with the United Kingdom in 1971."
"The head of the British delegation, Sir Con O'Neil, remarked that these two events were not unconnected."
"Prior to that there had hardly been any interest in a Community fisheries policy because the founding six had virtually no fishing resources."
"Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway all had rich coastal fisheries and they had been kept in good condition by effective conservation measures."
"O'Neil attests to this; experts from the British Ministry of Agriculture produced a report showing that British waters were literally teeming with fish, whilst there were very few within the fishing limits of the present Community countries."
"The main evidence for this is that Community waters did not attract foreign fishermen, while British waters most certainly did."
"After 30 years of the CFP, Britain's waters no longer teem with fish."
"To paraphrase Sir Con: 'These two events are not unconnected'."
"Yet still members of the Committee on Fisheries seem unable to make the connection."
"They call for more technical and human resources."
"They want more money for research."
"They want management plants, sustainable development, integrated policies, multiannual plans, the application of the precautionary principle and, wait for it, target reference points for biomass and fishing mortality."
"If jargon were the solution, Member State waters would still be teeming with fish, the CFP would be a world-beater."
"But all that jargon does is to hide an uncomfortable truth: the common fisheries policy has not worked, does not work and cannot work no matter how much reform is dressed up in flowery words."
"As long as fish are considered to be a common European resource, there will be no sense of ownership or responsibility."
"Predatory fishing becomes the norm."
"It is an inevitable consequence of the policy and leads to the depletion of stocks."
"Reform is not the solution."
"The CFP cannot be reformed."
"It has proved to be incapable of reform."
"It should be scrapped and fisheries should be managed once again by national governments."
"Madam President, I am beginning my speech in this debate on fisheries very moved, as you know, by the events that have taken place in Galicia."
"I remember that, while I was chairman of the Committee on Fisheries, the tragic accident involving the Erika took place, and our committee put an oral question and adopted a resolution."
"At that point we were all united, and I hope we are in this case as well."
"I would like to stress - and you know this - that Galicia is the region most dependent on fishing in the whole of Europe and is extraordinarily rich in seafood and fish, which, following the Prestige accident, is going to take many years to recover, above all in the areas most directly affected by the oil slick."
"I am going to prepare a motion for a resolution and I believe that the political groups must be united, so that this House can issue a political opinion, so that events of this type never happen again."
"I believe that we have a very important political responsibility."
"It is terrible to see fishing resources covered in petrol, dead sea birds and the fishermen who live exclusively from the sea."
"Sometimes over-fishing is discussed but these issues are not."
"I believe it is very important to bear it in mind and I hope, as I have said, that all our colleagues will show solidarity."
"With regard to the reports before the plenary, there has been no mention of the Busk report, and I would like to congratulate him, because there is no need for either a debate or for amendments since we have all agreed on the issue of illegal fishing and also the fight against it; it is therefore important to point it out."
"I believe that the report by Mr Souchet has worked out well."
"It is a reasonable and positive report, and there are no amendments to it in this House either."
"With regard to the report by Mr Stevenson, everybody knows what happened and I am not going to go into details; today we are dealing with the report which carries the name of the chairman of our committee."
"I would simply say to you that my political group has presented certain minimal amendments; we have tried to clear up certain issues."
"I would like to say, and I say this in general, that we are dealing with a communication."
"In other words, we are not dealing with a legislative document, but the report by Mr Jové will be, and we will examine that report during the next part-session."
"I hope that we can focus all our efforts and use the balanced approach indicated here, in order to adopt the commitments in this report, which will have to be debated, as I have said, at the next part-session in Brussels."
"With regard to the amendments we have presented, we have tried to remove the word 'permanent' from the twelve miles, because the Legal Services of the Council and the European Parliament, as well as the Commission, accept that, since it is a derogation from the Treaty, it cannot be permanent, because that would amount to a modification of the Treaty itself."
"Therefore, it is simply a measure that requires a time limit."
"Since we are not in agreement on whether it is five, ten, fifteen or twenty years, we have simply asked that we may adopt an agreement on this during the debate on the Jové report."
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the common fisheries policy has made some at times majestic waves of argument."
"Some of the arguments are reasonable and justified, whereas others are hasty and disproportionate."
"The reform of the common fisheries policy is necessary, and no sensible person would deny this."
"The depletion of fish stocks is not a fantasy or an exaggeration by ecologists, by those seeking to protect marine life or by pessimistic scientists."
"It is a tragic reality for many species."
"In the past, we also saw the collapse of some population units, but it was then possible to rebuild them by shifting the fishing effort to other species and to other latitudes."
"Today, this is all but impossible."
"The example of the collapse of the Newfoundland cod banks, the source of so much history and so much legend in Portugal, my own country, should serve as a warning to us."
"Of the more than 35 000 species that populate the seas, only one hundred are of commercial and consumer interest."
"This is a fact!"
"Today, however, we are seeing an impoverishment of biological diversity in the marine environment and the gradual destruction of habitats and ecosystems."
"The situation has reached this disturbing point not only as a result of the pressure exerted by fishing; but other well known reasons have also contributed to this phenomenon."
"Fishing is now subject to a dual requirement: the ecological requirement to preserve fish stocks and the political and social requirement to maintain the economic activities of the maritime fishing sector."
"Linking the Souchet report on the Community Action Plan to integrate environmental protection requirements into the common fisheries policy with the Stevenson report on the reform of the CFP and the Busk report on monitoring and eradicating illegal fishing was, consequently, an inspired move."
"The reform of the common fisheries policy must necessarily be a compromise that balances all strands: the social, the economic, the cultural and the ecological."
"Those Members who are most in favour - as they claim - of fishing, should therefore be mindful of the de la Palissian truism: without fish, there can be no fishing."
"Madam President, I also support the report by Mr Souchet and am extremely sorry to see the pollution caused by the oil tanker in Galicia."
"With regard to the Stevenson report, although it is somewhat contradictory, it does take account of many of the proposals and positions that we called for and which are important to Portugal, specifically the installation of 12-mile coastal zones as a permanent feature of the CFP, the participation of fishermen's organisations in the decision-making process, socio-economic measures to compensate for the effects of the reform, which must take account of past efforts, greater investment in research and ensuring that there is no legal vacuum."
"Two of our proposals that we felt were of the utmost importance were also accepted: the extension of the derogation concerning free access to 50 miles in the case of the most remote regions, as laid down in the Treaty, and strengthening the support mechanisms for the processing industry, specifically the canning industry."
"Nevertheless, we disagree with the proposals that are intended to change the report, with some that were rejected in the Committee on Fisheries and which run counter to the positions and proposals that we tabled once again being adopted."
"We shall, however, be voting in favour of the proposal which is comparable to an amendment of ours, which is of enormous importance to Portugal, and which has already been adopted in the other report, stating that the six-twelve mile zones should be maintained and defined as a feature of the common fisheries policy, for an unlimited period of time, in order to promote conservation and to encourage the local development of small-scale fishing."
"Madam President, I wanted to comment briefly on the report by Mr Stevenson."
"I welcome the fact that it calls for the system of access to waters and resources to be maintained as well as the fundamental principle of relative stability."
"I regret, however, that the original proposal by Mr Nogueira Román, who wanted to re-focus attention on the economic and social dimension of the common fisheries policy and, therefore, study it at the same time as the issue of fishing effort, has not been retained."
"What struck me is that the proposal by the European Commission on the roadmap on reform of the common agricultural policy reflects the lack of priority that the latter gives to the social impact of its plan since this impact only features in seventh place in the list of proposed measures."
"As for the Commission communication of 6 November on the measures intended to soften the impact of the reform, it confirms the plan to do away with 28 000 jobs over three years, between 2003 and 2006, due to the mass scrapping of vessels as predicted by the Commission."
"We are naturally waiting for an appropriate time to question the Commission on these dramatic figures, Madam President, which will be when we study this communication."
"Madam President, it is unfortunate that we have had to make substantial alterations to the Souchet and Nogueira reports."
"The whole scenario is depressing enough already: here we are, sitting in a warm room and endlessly talking, not only with each other but often, alas, at odds with each other."
"Out there, though, our environmental accidents and overfishing are making conditions catastrophic for more and more fish stocks."
"In here, or so it seems, we prefer to stonewall rather than work on a genuine reform, and the image of the European Union suffers."
"We should start by sorting out our own environment, and do it at once."
"The Commission proposals may have been late in landing on the table, but they got there well before the summer."
"Now that the first snows are falling, we are talking; but it is only today that we are discussing the timetable for the reform, which is due to enter into force on 1 January of next year, which is only a few weeks away."
"Quite apart from the Gallic bias of its content, this timetable started out as a tall order in linguistic terms."
"By dint of great efforts and 258 amendments, the Committee on Fisheries was then able to make the timetable readable with a view to genuine reform."
"It is curious, though, to take one example, that the committee voted to safeguard the twelve nautical mile zone - and now I am supposed to vote against it on Wednesday!"
"That I will not do."
"Am I a puppet; are we marionettes?"
"Granted, we all want to be re-elected."
"Is that why the spirits invoked by the Committee on Fisheries have proved so remarkably changeable?"
"We all know that without fish, the fishing industry will die out."
"What this is about is protecting the fleet and protection of resources, which are fundamental principles; there can be no deviation from them and no softening-up of them."
"I want the fisheries industry to be economically successful, socially balanced, and to make sense in environmental terms."
"We have to face reality and cannot set sail in an ever-increasing fleet in search of the mirage of stocks that last for ever."
"I appeal to my fellow-MEPs to break free of their national interests and support me in maintaining our fish stocks!"
"Madam President, I would like to begin by echoing the comments made by my fellow Members from Galicia and to say that I shall support all their initiatives."
"My region was affected by the Amoco Cadiz and Erika disasters; their region has been struck by the sinking of the Prestige, but the ship's name does nothing to ease the problems of those living in the region and of the Galician fishermen."
"Commissioner, the conception of the new fisheries policy is problematic but the fledgling policy is due to come into force on the evening of 31 December."
"I think that the Committee on Fisheries has worked hard to restore a balance between the exploitation of fishery resources and the protection of these resources for future generations, without forgetting the economy of coastal regions."
"In any case, we are seeking a better balance between these two areas than that put forward in your proposals, one that corresponds to sustainable development in the correct sense of the word."
"This applies, of course, to fish stocks, where this balance is needed, but it also concerns coastal economies."
"And we tried to draw your attention, in these three reports and in others, to the implications of the political decisions regarding employment in regions that are dependent on fishing, to the consequences of scrapping boats, since of course, if we scrap them and fish levels increase in the future, there may not be any fishermen left to fish them."
"We must keep our heads."
"We must also ensure that our fishermen do not use boats that are too old, which they make last longer and that they overload with equipment, thus running all kinds of risks."
"Our committee, in all its debates and through its rapporteurs, is seeking to influence the final decisions of the Commission and the Council."
"Of course, there are good decisions and we should highlight them, such as controls and sanctions, involving the relevant parties in the decision-making processes, improving knowledge of fishing techniques and resources."
"In short, if all this is done, if the balance is maintained, our fishermen will be able to continue to have faith in their work, in their business and we in our regions."
"Madam President, the management of EU fisheries is at an important juncture with key stocks in the North Sea and elsewhere in decline and the future of fishing and fish processing industries therefore under threat."
"So it is essential that the Commission gets it right, proposing a management system which ensures sustainable fisheries backed up by up-to-date independent and verifiable scientific evidence involving stakeholders and installing confidence in the system."
"However, as the first set of CFP reform proposals nears a conclusion, I find myself more cynical about the process and less optimistic about the future for Scotland's fishing-dependent communities than ever before."
"Why should this be so?"
"Is a workable EU fisheries policy achievable?"
"I have always believed that the only way to succeed in achieving the necessary balance between resource, harvesting and conservation and to better encourage compliance with any management regime is to have a regime with which the stakeholders can have some faith."
"That is why I have welcomed the Commission's support for regional advisory councils as a step in the right direction, towards a much-needed new and better way of doing things."
"Actions, however, have to accompany words and I have been shocked by the attitude displayed by the Commission recently in relation to cod and other white fish quotas for next year."
"To announce the possible closure of the Scots fishing industry with the 'we know best' and 'it's all your own fault' statements attributed to Commissioner Fischler seems to fly in the face of the stated intention to involve stakeholders more."
"This 'tough guy' approach, presumably designed to make the actual outcome for next year seem relatively palatable, should have no place in a new CFP."
"The sad truth is that irreparable damage has been done by the Commission in the last six months to the Scottish confidence in Europe being capable of managing fisheries at all."
"With Mr Fischler's about-turn on deep-water management, followed by the insensitive presentation of the ICES's advice on cod and its repercussions for Scotland, it is little wonder that conspiracy theories abound."
"Does Commissioner Fischler want to be remembered as the architect of a new and successful EU fisheries policy?"
"Or the one who brought desolation to communities and destruction to a way of life?"
"Sadly at this moment, he seems to me more likely to achieve the latter."
"I and the leadership of the Scottish fishing industry have played a constructive role, working with environmental organisations in the consultative process towards CFP reform."
"I would like to see the Commission and the Council taking due account of that and giving some return and not penalising the Scots for their efforts."
"This Parliament report on the reform of the CFP remedies some of the shortcomings in the Commission proposal, but is remiss with regard to others."
"With regard to its positive points, I would highlight three main aspects:"
"the first is that sustainable fisheries management must be based on a balanced range of measures, not only on the simplistic solution of fleet reduction, but also on a greater selection of fishing methods, on the proper use of the MAGPs and of the TACs and quotas."
"Most of all, the recommendation that in any reduction of the fishing effort, lower targets are set for Member States that have already undertaken fleet reduction;"
"the second aspect is the clear recommendation that fisheries agreements with third countries, which, if properly implemented are of mutual convenience for both parties, must continue to be an integral part of the CFP."
"For this reason, it is right that ships removed from the Community fleet can continue to be included in fleets belonging to joint ventures;"
"the third aspect is the desire to find a specific solution to the problem of access to the waters of the outermost regions, which have very delicate balances and ecosystems, such as the Azores, the Island of Madeira and other regions in the European Union."
"The aspect that I feel is most negative is the report's total omission of the structural component."
"There are two main reasons for not changing the rules laid down at the Berlin European Council on the funding of fisheries structures."
"The first is that fleet modernisation is in itself a priority matter, because otherwise the Community fleet will become uncompetitive: where Portugal is concerned, 40% of our fleet is over 25 years old and therefore, unless it receives support, it will be unviable."
"The second reason is that since appropriations were set in Berlin for fleet modernisation by 2007 and since various ship owners have placed orders on this basis, it is politically unacceptable to now change the rules in mid-stream."
"Madam President, we make this subject sound very complicated but for me it boils down to two questions: how much fish can we take, and who can take them?"
"If we could agree on those two questions, we would have an amicable solution to all the other questions that arise."
"I do not agree with those who say that the common fisheries policy is responsible for the present state of stocks."
"The reason the stocks are in their present state is because the scientists were not heeded."
"When the Commission took the scientists' message to the Council of Ministers it was not heeded and its advice was not put into effect."
"I do not agree with the present policy, but within its framework stocks could have been conserved if the advice of the Commission had been taken through the years."
"The other problem with the common fisheries policy is that on the one hand the Commission has the responsibility but can merely give advice."
"The Council of Ministers and the individual states are the people with the ultimate responsibility."
"There is a lot of evidence that in the past they did not discharge their responsibility, without fear or favour, in a manner which ensured that every fisherman took what he was entitled to take and every ship got its quota and no more."
"The common fisheries policy goes too far."
"There was never any need to take fish into common ownership."
"It does not make sense."
"We have a common agricultural policy."
"It does not give me the right or an Irish farmer the right to pick grapes or olives in the south of Spain."
"It does not give us the right to harvest forests in Finland or Sweden."
"Neither should the common fisheries policy include the common ownership of stocks."
"It makes no sense."
"As far as I know, nevertheless, there is only one country which loses out and gets less than its natural share."
"You will not find a more convinced European integrationist than I am, so I can say that there is one region in the Union, the west of Ireland, that does not get its natural share."
"I have no special quarrel with the Spanish, French or British fishermen who come into what are natural waters."
"However, in other areas - oil and minerals - and in every form of jurisdiction Member States have over their oceans, natural resources fall within the remit of the national governments."
"That should also apply to fish."
"It would make a lot more sense."
"Madam President, the CFP has totally failed."
"It has not maintained the fishing stocks or fishermen's jobs."
"Discarding nearly two million tonnes of healthy fish each year is absolutely ridiculous."
"Fish do not swim separately in the sea."
"They swim together and the sooner we work that out the better."
"The 6- and 12-mile limits must be confirmed permanently."
"I am not convinced by the argument that we cannot do it and I shall be voting firmly for the fact that these limits should be etched in stone."
"Not only must those 6- and 12-mile limits be there, but they must be managed at a local level and properly devolved from Brussels, not just some token gesture."
"If local fishermen have proper ownership of these waters, the conservation measures will work."
"In the North Sea cod is disappearing."
"Is it a coincidence that the cod are disappearing in the areas where the industrial fishing takes place?"
"We take out millions of tonnes of sand eels and scour the sea beds, and the cod eat sand eels."
"It is not a coincidence."
"We must do something about it."
"Norway and Iceland have good fishing stocks and they are not part of the common fisheries policy."
"Again, is this a coincidence?"
"I would agree here with Mr McCartin."
"Do we need to make fishing resources part of the common fisheries policy?"
"I will say this quite bluntly: if the Commission cannot run the common fisheries policy properly, then send it back to the Member States and let them do it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the recent tragedy involving the Prestige, I believe that these are worrying times for both the Galician fishermen, who are awaiting the Commission's response, and who do not want these terrible events to happen again anywhere, and for all good people who defend the environment and sustainable development."
"I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Souchet and Mr Busk on the quality of their reports; and with regard to the report which in the end the chairman of the committee has taken charge of, I will comment on recital K and Amendment No 23."
"The area reserved for traditional fishing within a band of 6 miles - which was subsequently increased to 12 and extended to all Member States - was extended, for the last time, within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy of 1992, for a period of ten years."
"We have therefore been in a provisional situation for thirty years."
"It appears that the aim was to allow for a progressive adaptation of the small-scale coastal fleet. And if they have not carried it out, I do not know when they are going to do so."
"The European Commission's proposal on the timetable for the reform of the common fisheries policy advocates permanently maintaining the prohibition of fishing within 12 miles - a proposal, by the way, whose legal validity has been called into question."
"I believe that, at a time when we are facing enlargement and we have a Convention under way, paradoxically, this proposal would mark the beginning of a period of renationalisation of Community waters contrary to the principle of equal access for fishing vessels to all European Union stocks, which would also involve the additional risk of a possible future increase of this restricted area if it is adopted as a permanent exception."
"Madam President, the Europeans in general and the people who live from the sea, in particular, will not understand why the waters are not communitarised, why we have this restriction - an exception to the principle of free access - why this sector is not being communitarised while the others are."
"Therefore, from a strictly legal point of view, the establishment of a permanent exception should be ruled out forever."
"I would like to encourage Members to vote against Recital K and Amendment No 23, which, in my humble opinion, are contrary to Community law and European common sense."
"Madam President, thank you for extending the debate to give me a chance to get here and participate."
"It took me 16 hours to travel here to Strasbourg today."
"Two weeks ago I went to Hobart in Tasmania in less time than it takes to get to Strasbourg."
"When I find out that part of the reason for the delay is reindeer running on the runway of the international airport in Strasbourg, I find that utterly incredible."
"Firstly, I understand that during the debate a great deal of concern has been expressed about the wreck of the Prestige off the coast of Galicia."
"I hope that from what has been said in this debate my colleagues will agree with me that we should be calling for the Commission and the EU institutions to take all possible steps to aid Galicia in dealing with this horrendous problem."
"The newspapers in Scotland today were calling it the 'Costa del muerte' and saying that 3 000 tonnes of oil had already been spilled."
"I understand that the tanker contained 70 000 tonnes of oil and the idea of a spillage on that scale is absolutely horrifying."
"We are dealing here with a debate in which you have heard Mr Parish expressing a great deal of anger."
"You have heard Mr Hudghton also expressing anger from a Scottish perspective."
"Part of this debate deals with the Commission's roadmap."
"I should say at the outset that the recent scientific advice from ICES, which recommends the complete closure of the whitefish sector in the UK and Ireland, points to the fact that to have a roadmap is superfluous."
"As far as the common fisheries policy is concerned we are on the road to nowhere."
"What is the use of debating future fisheries policy in this Chamber tonight if for British and Irish fishermen there is no future?"
"What is the point of discussing multi-annual management plans if tax and quotas in the North Sea, the west of Scotland, the Irish Sea and the Kattegat are to be set at zero for at least the next five years?"
"What an indictment of the common fisheries policy!"
"What a sorry state of affairs that after 20 years of failed policies we are now looking at the destruction of an industry that is as old as mankind itself."
"In the name of conservation our fishermen have been forced to dump millions of tonnes of prime fish back into the sea dead to comply with the lunatic quota scheme."
"In the name of conservation our fishermen have suffered tie-ups, lay-offs, emergency closures, decommissioning, job losses and plunging incomes and now the message from the scientists appears to be that everything they have advised in the past has failed - all the technical conservation measures, all the increased mesh sizes, the square mesh panels to allow young cod to escape, all the emergency closures of cod spawning grounds, the 40 000 square miles of the North Sea closed for 12 weeks last year without one penny of compensation paid to the fishermen, the three years in a row that the Irish Sea has been closed for cod fishing, the massive decommissioning round that took over 100 demersal vessels out of the Scottish fleet alone."
"All of these measures recommended by the scientists and ordered by the Commission have apparently failed."
"It beggars belief."
"There is no place in the common fisheries policy for our roadmap if 20 000 fishermen, fish processors and harbour workers are facing the closure of their industry and the loss of their jobs."
"There is no justification for closing the whole whitefish sector."
"Seven hundred thousand tonnes of cod were caught in the Northeast Atlantic last year."
"That does not sound like a species on the verge of collapse."
"Tens of thousands of big mature cod are being caught around the Faroes and Iceland where they have no CFP."
"If the cod have migrated northwards due to global warming, pollution or the North Atlantic drift, then no amount of draconian measures will make them return."
"It is true the cod have gone from the central part of the North Sea."
"Nobody is disputing that."
"But their place has been taken by prawns, now one of the biggest fisheries around the British Isles."
"We know that cod is a key predator of prawns so it is not surprising that when the cod decline the prawns thrive."
"But it is also a fact that prawns feed on cod larvae, so once the cod have gone they may never return."
"That has certainly been the case in Canada."
"I do not accept that the possible recovery of cod stocks is in any way an adequate justification for the sacrifice of the prawn, haddock, whiting, plaice, and flatfish fisheries."
"Nor do I accept that there are anything like sufficient funds in the budget to even meet a fraction of the likely socio-economic impact costs which this catastrophic proposal implies."
"So there is no point in discussing a roadmap tonight."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Madam President, Commissioner, in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority of the committee, I would imagine, the two related reports before us this evening have been prepared with undue haste."
"Their quality is certainly not in keeping with the legal traditions of Europe and its Member States."
"The two reports focus in particular on the approximation of laws on the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property."
"They specifically concern the possibility of extensive powers of confiscation, in other words the confiscation not so much and not only of the proceeds of the crime itself but also of all the other property in the possession of a person sentenced to a very long prison sentence who cannot prove that the property is of lawful origin."
"This part of the report, Commissioner Vitorino, was deleted by the committee, and what remains is therefore the possibility of confiscating crime-related proceeds."
"However, a framework decision is not necessary to achieve this result in the European Community, for the legislation of almost all the European countries provides for the compulsory confiscation of crime-related proceeds or, at least, makes this possible."
"Precisely in order to overcome the committee's difficulties in accepting the inversion of the onus of proof - Amendment No 11, amending Article 3(1) - I suggested, by means of an amendment which is very reminiscent of the Italian legislation on the subject, the possibility of confiscating additional property - the property subject precisely to extended powers of confiscation - only where the prosecution has proved that the property possessed is disproportionate to the activity pursued or, in any case, exceeds the person's income as declared for tax purposes."
"The person convicted would then have the chance to prove the lawful origin of the property."
"The provisions were therefore toned down but the onus of proof not actually inverted."
"The committee was disconcerted, surprised, confused by this, and therefore rejected my amendment."
"I therefore call upon the House to adopt this amendment, for this is the only way to include in the legislation extensive powers of confiscation, which is one of the goals of the proposal and, in my opinion, also a useful tool for combating organised crime."
"It is based on a dual principle."
"The prosecution has to prove that the person's property is disproportionate: in other words, it has to prove that the value of the property exceeds the person's real activities and their income as declared for tax purposes, while the person convicted has the option to prove that this property is of lawful origin."
"If, however, the report remains in the form adopted by the committee, it will be absolutely useless, for - I stress - the European countries already have similar legislation in place and do not need a European Parliament framework decision."
"Madam President, Commissioner, unlike our esteemed rapporteur - the basic approach of whose text I do, however, appreciate - I am convinced that our work is neither superfluous nor useless."
"It is an appeal, a valuable reminder precisely for all the Member States, which are called to harmonise their legislation or, in any case, cooperate in the field of justice, in this very sensitive area - the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property - too."
"It is without a doubt an important instrument because, as we know from daily experience, it is that instrument which will strike at the financial sources supporting organised crime, particularly crime organised on an international scale."
"At the centre of this fight is the fight against what is known as money laundering between the international organisations, which now know no bounds either in Europe or worldwide."
"I want to tell you something which the unforgettable Italian judge, Giovanni Falcone, said, which is relevant to this aspect of the matter."
"As you will remember, he was subsequently assassinated by the Mafia."
"At a hearing, ten years ago now, he said: the Mafia have not waited for the completion of the internal market to internationalise their activity."
"That is why it is important to provide an international response to this internationalisation of crime from those in charge of the legal systems in the Member States."
"It must be said that, in this, we have been preceded by both the United Nations and the Council of Europe, which have produced conventions which are a valuable point of reference for the subject we are debating too."
"It must also be said, however, that the proper legislative basis is the action plan endorsed by the Amsterdam European Council of June 1997 and drawn on by the Vienna European Council of December 1998."
"These action plans specify the procedures for implementing international confiscation measures, which are, clearly, intended to supplement the various national measures."
"The Council stresses the importance of each Member State- and I quote from the Council text - 'having well-developed and wide ranging legislation in the field of confiscation of the proceeds from crime' and of 'introducing special procedures for tracing, seizure and confiscation of proceeds from crime'."
"As regards the debate on Mr Di Lello's report in committee, we tabled a number of amendments which were all adopted by the committee."
"Our rapporteur is of the opinion that these amendments impair the original text but we, of course, feel that they enhance it."
"I will mention just one in particular - the amendment seeking to invert the onus of proof and transfer it from the defendant to the prosecution."
"Madam President, everyone is aware of my group's reservations about the Member State initiatives concerning the judicial European area."
"The most effective and consistent method, in most of the matters that this involves, is the Community initiative, which we hope will be, following the work of the Convention, the prime working method, precisely because only the Commission is in a position to defend and promote the balance of values and principles that are not depleted by the construction of Europe's security, which is drifting away from the Europeans' deep-rooted component of rights and freedoms."
"The history of the construction of the area of freedom, security and justice is still made up much more of isolated initiatives by the Members States, which make specific contributions concerning security as they see fit, given the concerns of their citizens."
"Instead, we are seeing the dissipation of Commission initiatives to approximate legislation, in which efforts to prosecute crime are tempered by the protection of individual values. This is not the Commission's fault, but a result of differences between the various Member States."
"Furthermore, although there is no proof that the national area is the best suited to combating international organised crime, nor will it ever be proven that freedoms are best protected within the strict framework of national borders."
"Take for example the motives for requests for accession and the examples of Spain and Portugal, which quickly became part of the European framework, and consequently, stable and deep-seated democracies."
"This initiative and this report by Mr Di Lello, which adopt similar mechanisms for the freezing of property and evidence that I myself covered in this Parliament and to which the Council has still not given its agreement, deserve a better fate than the one befalling my report."
"Therefore, regardless of the method and some points of relative disagreement, we are voting in favour of this initiative and this report as a sign that Parliament is pursuing its efforts to support the Tampere Council and the Commission's sensible and genuinely European interpretation of the promises made at the European Council."
"Because, Madam President, the electors do not want crime to go unpunished, specifically international crime, for the sake of the judicial sovereignty of each Member State."
"Madam President, I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his work."
"The seizure or confiscation of the proceeds of crime is indeed, as has been pointed out by the rapporteur too, a genuinely effective tool for combating organised crime."
"I would add that the confiscation of goods is also a valuable way of building up compensation funds for the victims of organised crime, victims of heinous crimes which can be linked to terrorism, child abuse, the trafficking of human beings or the trafficking of arms or drugs, victims who - it is worth pointing out - are often victims twice over, firstly because, through no fault of their own, they are the victims of a crime, and secondly because they do not subsequently receive sufficient, timely compensation for the damages suffered."
"Approximation of the rules and procedures governing the matter is therefore urgent and essential, especially where cross-border criminal activities are concerned."
"With regard to the Kingdom of Denmark's proposal, I agree with the rapporteur that its scope should be restricted to organised crime offences, and I also support his proposal to place the onus to prove the unlawful origin of property upon the prosecution rather than the defendant."
"Last but not least, although I feel it is essential for it to be possible to confiscate crime-related proceeds, where these have been fictitiously transferred to the spouse or cohabitee or to another legal person, the prosecution must prove that the property of the spouse, cohabitee or other legal person does genuinely belong to the convicted person and that the other persons therefore only have fictitious title or access to it."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Di Lello Finuoli, for his very comprehensive and helpful report on the two Danish initiatives on confiscation."
"First, I shall address the framework decision on the confiscation of crime-related proceeds, instrumentalities and property."
"As the rapporteur said, it is essential that all Member States adopt rules providing for confiscation in general."
"The added value of this initiative, however, is that it addresses extended powers to confiscate the property of a person convicted of a serious crime, especially when the convicted person was involved in organised crime."
"The problems that this initiative raises, as the rapporteur has said, are mainly concerned with the idea of extended powers of confiscation which consist essentially of extending confiscation measures to property which is not linked to the crime for which the person has been convicted, permitting confiscation of property belonging to a convicted person if the person cannot prove that he obtained the property through legitimate means, and permitting confiscation of property belonging to the spouse of the convicted person."
"In my view, it should be possible to break the link between the offence for which the person has been convicted and the property to be confiscated, especially if that property is itself of illegal origin. However, the scope of application should be limited to serious offences linked to organised crime."
"In addition, it is not the relationship between the convicted person and the third party which is important, but the fact that illegally obtained property was transferred to a third person."
"So, like the rapporteur, I agree with the general approach adopted by the Danish Presidency."
"I also support most of the amendments by the rapporteur, in particular the amendment which introduced the notion of proportionality, so that confiscation does not result in a loss of property disproportionate to the offence committed; and the amendment which limits the scope of application of extended powers of confiscation to organised crime."
"I have some doubts about the amendment the rapporteur has just mentioned, which demands that Member States avoid a reversal of the burden of proof in their legislation."
"I sincerely do not see the need to include such a provision in this specific instrument on confiscation as this could be interpreted as conflicting with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Danish initiative envisages a certain flexibility concerning the burden of proof."
"In this area, as Mr Di Lello Finuoli mentioned, we have to find the correct balance between combating organised crime on the one hand and on the other respecting the fundamental rights of the accused."
"It is not necessary, therefore, to reverse the burden of proof."
"However, we should consider the fact that the person convicted in connection with organised crime who cannot justify his lifestyle should face the prospect of confiscation of property unless this person demonstrates that he obtained the property by legitimate means."
"As for the second Danish initiative for a framework decision on the execution in the European Union of confiscation orders, this second initiative deals, as Mr Marinho has just said, with the mutual recognition and execution of confiscation orders in the European Union."
"It is closely connected with the initiative that has been presented on the freezing and confiscation of property, for which Mr Marinho was the rapporteur, and the Commission intends to maintain the overall coherence between the two initiatives."
"Some of the issues raised by the second initiative are now under negotiation in the Council, with regard also to the framework decision concerning the mutual recognition of financial penalties."
"We are therefore pleased that the rapporteur shares the positive view of the Commission on this framework decision."
"Most of your amendments seek to ensure that decisions are recognised only when issued by judges."
"We agree that it is important to be clear about the status of the issuing authority."
"The initial text as you have mentioned confused judicial authorities, courts and judges."
"This needs to be ratified."
"We support your view that it is not appropriate for orders issued by investigating magistrates and prosecutors to fall within the scope of these instruments."
"The rapporteur also suggests that the issuing state should be prohibited from imposing a custodial sentence as an alternative to confiscation."
"Although we agree with the objective of this amendment, it seems to us that this issue might be better addressed in the first framework decision on the approximation of national rules on confiscation."
"I would conclude by thanking the rapporteur and also the House for its patience during this late-night debate."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 10.09 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting"
"Mr President, I was scheduled yesterday to speak in the debate on the media but, unfortunately, because of problems getting to Strasbourg, I was unable to make my timeslot."
"I simply want to say that coming from the United Kingdom - renowned for its fogs, not to say for its smogs - I can in no way criticise the climate of Strasbourg."
"Indeed, I want to congratulate and thank the airport staff for putting safety first."
"I simply want to apologise to the presidency and to the House for missing my timeslot."
"I had left my home at 6 a.m. in a brave attempt to be here."
"In addition to your comments, which will go on the record, I would point out that you have the opportunity under Rule 120(7) to make a written statement that will be appended to verbatim report of the debate in question."
"(The Minutes of the previous sitting were approved.)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0371/2002) by Elmar Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on enlargement: progress report (COM(2002) 700 - C5-0474/2002 - 2002/2160(INI))."
"Mr President, we are now approaching the crucial date."
"In 23 days' time in Copenhagen, we shall hopefully conclude the accession negotiations with 10 candidate countries, give impetus to the negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania and take a decision about the next phase of Turkey's candidacy."
"In that way, we shall approach the objective towards which we have been striving, namely a single, reunified Europe."
"That is something which, today, we have anticipated."
"We have carried out a trial run, and it emerged that having such a large Parliament with MEPs from 27 countries present here in Parliament is perfectly possible, as is the task of interpreting into 23 languages, as has been done."
"Many doubters must now recognise that these things are perfectly possible."
"It was an historic event we experienced this morning, and I think Parliament deserves to be applauded for having in this way demonstrated what we shall all be embarking upon in a year and a half's time, as well as for having demonstrated that the process is feasible and for having in this way helped make the whole process irrevocable, so that there is no way back."
"Yesterday was also historic in a way, however."
"Yesterday, a ministerial meeting was, for the first time, held in Brussels with the participation of all 25 Member States."
"It was, of course, an informal meeting."
"It took place directly before the ordinary meeting of the General Affairs Council, and what we decided was of course what we had discussed with the new Member States."
"We agreed, for example, that the new countries should accede on 1 May 2004."
"That will provide time for the ratification of the accession treaty and, at the same time, enable the new Member States to participate on an equal footing in the elections to the European Parliament."
"It was also agreed that they will be able to have their own Commissioners in the present Commission as from the date of accession, that is to say from 1 May 2004."
"This naturally presupposes an understanding with this Parliament to the effect that 10 Commissioners will be able to accede without portfolios and, presumably, without being approved by Parliament, its being specified however that, when the new Commission is appointed, presumably as per 1 November, all the Commissioners will naturally have, as always, to be approved by Parliament, which by that time will have been newly elected."
"We must particularly express our thanks, and demonstrate our respect, for the candidate countries' contributions."
"They have done an impressive piece of work in adjusting to all the criteria we have set."
"That, as I understand it, is also the message of the report we are today debating."
"The Copenhagen criteria have been the yardstick for measuring the countries' political and economic reforms."
"Radical reforms have been carried out."
"Democratic structures have been developed."
"Legislation has been introduced to protect human rights, and major progress has been made where minorities are concerned."
"In the economic sphere, there has been an impressive transition from the planned economies of the past to market economies."
"Price formation has been liberalised, privatisations have been carried out and there has been comprehensive restructuring within industry, agriculture and the financial sector."
"Public administration has been reformed so that the EU's acquis communautaire can be implemented."
"When one considers how much effort has been expended in every single one of these areas, one cannot help but admire the candidate countries."
"That is why we must not disappoint their justified expectations of now shortly being able to become fully-fledged members."
"This impressive progress can be read about in the Commission's progress report and strategy paper for enlargement, submitted on 9 October."
"These described all 10 countries, and the Commission judged that the latter are ready to pursue membership."
"Before they become Member States, however, further efforts are of course required."
"The Commission has not said that the work has been done and that they are ready."
"It has said that they can be ready in time."
"As a reaction to the Commission's progress reports, the candidate countries have clearly intimated that they will step up their efforts in those areas pointed out by the Commission, and these efforts will be supported with EU funds."
"Some work remains to be done in the accession negotiations."
"The Brussels European Council took a number of important decisions concerning the outstanding financial issues."
"Intense negotiations are currently being conducted with the candidate countries on these matters."
"Clearly, moreover, a successful outcome demands both effort and a willingness to compromise on the part of everyone involved - the present, as well as the future, Member States."
"We are all aware that a certain economic framework has been set, but there is naturally room for negotiation within this framework."
"The concluding of the negotiations in Copenhagen in 23 days' time will be an incredible breakthrough."
"There will then follow the work of preparation, signature and ratification."
"Parliament will have to give its consent before the treaty can be signed, and Parliament's statement to the effect that it wishes to approve the treaty as quickly as possible merely illustrates once again Parliament's role as a driving force for rapid enlargement."
"The Copenhagen European Council will not just concern itself with the 10 countries concerned."
"Important decisions concerning Bulgaria and Romania, which still have some way to go, will also have to be taken."
"In Brussels, clear support was expressed for these countries' efforts to achieve membership by 2007."
"In response to the conclusions from Brussels, the Copenhagen European Council will have to make decisions concerning detailed timetables, including schedules and increased pre-accession aid, so that the accession process involving these countries can be taken forward."
"The decisions taken in Copenhagen will, then, be designed to strengthen Bulgaria's and Romania's membership prospects."
"With regard to Turkey, the Commission concludes that, since the last progress report, great progress has been made towards fulfilling the political Copenhagen criterion."
"That is a gratifying development that must be maintained."
"Developments in Turkey over the last year show that the decision taken in Helsinki in 1999, when Turkey was accorded the status of a candidate country, was a correct one."
"At the same time, it is noted that there is still work to be done on the road towards fulfilling the political Copenhagen criterion."
"In order further to increase its membership prospects, Turkey was encouraged by the Commission to adopt further reforms and to implement those already adopted."
"In view of the Seville conclusions, the Copenhagen European Council will be the key moment in the development of relations between the EU and Turkey."
"That is why it is important to keep all the doors open in the run-up to the decision to be taken in 23 days' time in Copenhagen."
"I should like to conclude by thanking Parliament for its clear and unqualified support for enlargement, expressed this morning and reflected in the report submitted. It will also be reflected in the forthcoming debate."
"Parliament has been involved in establishing the background against which the whole of the enlargement debate will take place."
"It is of course MEPs' and the people's support that is so fundamental to the enlargement process."
"We must ensure that this is maintained by creating the framework for a thorough and sober debate on enlargement, both in our own countries and in the new Member States."
"The European Parliament's debates on enlargement have an important role to play."
"It is in the course of these that the signals are sent to the people of Europe concerning the significance of the decisions we are to take."
"That is why I should like again to thank Parliament and the President personally, and also Commissioner Verheugen, for the huge amount of work done by the institutions of the European Union on various fronts."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first to express very warm thanks to Mr Brok and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy for the report that has been presented, which demonstrates that the matter in hand has been gone into in considerable depth."
"I would also like to express my gratitude for the very good cooperation that we have built up over the years."
"It is a bit like the mood before Christmas, in which season we find ourselves, when you know you are doing something for the last time, and this is probably the last time that I will be able to thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs for its cooperation, at any rate as regards the big enlargement package."
"I want to include in this expression of gratitude Parliament as a whole and in particular its President, Pat Cox."
"I regard the initiative that Parliament has devised today as truly worthy of a European Parliament and a demonstration of the fact that those who represent Europe's citizens here do not take enlargement to be a technical process, but rather a crucial part of giving our continent political unity."
"It has also been made clear today that this process of enlargement has, if I may say so, a soul as well."
"It has to be said that 2002 was a race over hurdles."
"If I may be permitted a brief reminiscence, the problems that we were faced with at the beginning of this year, and the things that have passed before our eyes, included the acquisition of land in Poland, the decommissioning of the Ignalina power plant, the Bene? decrees in the Czech Republic, elections in Slovakia, the Irish referendum, the Kaliningrad issue, and, finally, the financial package."
"We really have gone from one obstacle to another, but we have been able to surmount them all."
"Only one single hurdle still lies before us, and that is agreement on the final negotiation package."
"Yesterday, the General Affairs Council gave the Presidency and the Commission a clear mandate, along with the required flexibility and the necessary powers, to conduct substantive and immediate talks with the candidate countries, which will involve submitting to them final packages tailor-made for each individual country."
"There will be no package of proposals applying to all of them, but we will be meeting each country halfway and attempting to give sufficient attention to those of each country's problems that are still on the table."
"We are able to do that because we had two rounds of intensive discussions with the candidate countries immediately following the Brussels meeting of the European Council, and these were concerned with putting on the table everything that is as yet undecided."
"I have already reported on this to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"A large number of bilateral issues remain to be sorted out directly with the countries concerned."
"These range from extraordinarily difficult issues such as, for example, the whole Polish and Hungarian problem with competition, to this or that rather bizarre special case, which has to be taken into account under the circumstances, as it can have an influence - a very great influence, moreover - on public opinion."
"On the other hand, this round has taught us that the horizontal issues are in fact seen in the same light everywhere."
"Here we are dealing with familiar topics, of which there are, in essence, four, all of them closely interconnected."
"In the Budget chapter, there is the cash flow problem, especially in the first year."
"There is the issue of the pressure that the financial package as a whole will put on the candidate countries' budgets in 2004, 2005 and 2006."
"Let me say this in order to clarify what I mean: the rules under which European funds are made available very definitely amount to an imposition on these countries' budgets."
"In one instance or another, this imposition results in the need to make substantial cuts in areas where I am sure nobody in this House would be happy to have cuts made."
"Nevertheless, the country has no other option available to it if it wants to make full use of the funds available."
"We are trying to find a way forward here which will enable us to avoid problems of this sort with budgets."
"The Brussels Council, like yesterday's General Affairs Council, on the one hand again confirmed the boundaries within which we have to operate, but also established a certain degree of flexibility, and I want to elucidate what this flexibility involves."
"Admittedly, for example, the Council did say that we would reduce the funds set aside for the Structural and Cohesion Funds by EUR 2.5 billion - I might add, by the way, that it did so with the Commission's agreement, because we too had come to the conclusion that it could be expected to be extremely difficult, over the three years, to actually fully incorporate these funds into the programming."
"But it did not change the upper limit for expenditure decided on in Berlin."
"When we point out that the Berlin framework has to be strictly adhered to and that the decisions taken in Brussels cannot be altered either, it follows that there is a certain amount of room for manoeuvre."
"Looking carefully at what the Franco-German compromise, which brought about agreement in the Council, said about direct payments, one sees that it is only in the third year in which direct payments are to be made - 2006, when they will reach 35% - that what was decided in Brussels will be affected."
"Agricultural expenditure is to be fixed at the 2006 level."
"There is no mention of either 2005 or 2004."
"I want to use these two examples to demonstrate that we are right to say that what is on the table is not an offer that can only be either accepted in its entirety or rejected."
"Rather, it leaves a certain amount of room in which negotiations can be conducted in a sensible way."
"Once Copenhagen is over, the candidate countries will have do what the Committee on Foreign Affairs' reports demand of them, that is, concentrate, with our help, on acknowledged deficiencies and weaknesses."
"We will again report in detail on the results of these efforts."
"Now that 1 May 2004 has been fixed as the date for the accessions, this final report will be put before the Council and Parliament on 1 November, and quite conceivably on 31 October 2003, thus creating another opportunity for insisting that the commitments they have made should actually be met."
"As regards Bulgaria and Romania, the Council yesterday adopted the Commission's proposal for a more fully developed pre-accession strategy for both these countries, which applies to each country separately, so that there is no concerted strategy, but one for Bulgaria and one for Romania."
"There is a difference from previous timetables for negotiations in that we used to always specify dates by which specific decisions had to be taken concerning the negotiations."
"That is no longer necessary in this case, as nearly all the chapters have already been opened."
"We are now setting benchmarks both in the short and medium terms, as well as those with reference to the date of accession, which each country should have reached by a specific point in time in order that accession, planned for 2007, can go ahead."
"After that, that is to say, post-Copenhagen - as was said in this House this morning - the parliaments will have their moment, when the political decision-making process is set in motion."
"I do not need to say very much about this at this juncture, other than that the Commission will obviously be available to help Parliament in every way possible during the first months of 2003, which will be crucial."
"No matter which committee or forum asks for expert advice or expresses a need for discussion, we will be there for them."
"That is for us the Number One priority at the beginning of next year, and President Prodi will have more to say about that when, tomorrow, he stands here and presents our work programme."
"I believe that Parliament and the Commission will, together, be able to get on top of this extremely difficult task."
"I would now like to say something more about Turkey, an issue that will also have a part to play next year."
"I agree with the whole of what Mr Brok said - it could have been me speaking - about how the Turkey that will be able to join the European Union will be a quite different Turkey."
"It is precisely that that we want to make easier by means of the pre-accession process."
"I have to say that I do not see why we are to dispense with a strategy that has been so successful."
"It was what we did in Helsinki, more than anything that had preceded it, that got the process of change in Turkey really moving."
"As regards the date, the Commission has made its preference perfectly clear."
"The Commission continues to insist on all the candidates being treated equally, which means that we can only talk in terms of a date for opening negotiations when the political criteria have indeed been fulfilled, which they very definitely have not been so far."
"I also want to tell you that this issue has been brought up quite unilaterally, and without consultation, by the Turks."
"Never and nowhere has there been any discussion of the possibility of naming a date for the commencement of negotiations before the political criteria have been fulfilled."
"That is a unilateral demand on the part of Turkey, and neither I nor the Commission are willing simply to give in to a situation in which the other side steps up the pressure and says: 'If you do not give in to this pressure, you are causing a crisis in relations between us.'"
"That is not the way we should be treating each other."
"That is something I want to make absolutely clear."
"Related to that is the Cyprus question, on which I would like to say something briefly; here, too, I think that the Helsinki strategy is proving to be the right one."
"We would not have got where we are today without the Helsinki conclusions."
"I have always taken the view that, when things move in Cyprus, they do so very, very late in the day, which means that two things have to be made abundantly clear in political terms."
"Firstly, and whatever happens in the twenty-three days that remain to us, the decision on the accessions - including Cyprus' - must be taken at Copenhagen."
"It cannot be delayed; it is the fulcrum and pivot of the whole strategy."
"The solution we want is of course accession on the basis of fundamental agreement on the package proposed by Kofi Annan, but it goes without saying that it would also be possible to come to the necessary decisions in Copenhagen and then continue with the political process that is meant to bring about a peaceful solution in Cyprus."
"It is very definitely not being said that the decision in Copenhagen will represent an end to the peace-making effort if matters have not already been brought to a conclusion before Copenhagen."
"A whole range of issues have been raised in connection with the United Nations' proposals, and these touch on the peace plan's compatibility with European Community law."
"I want to take this opportunity to reiterate that there are certain things that are not negotiable."
"They are requirements that must be met."
"A Member State must, for example, be capable of contributing to our institutions' decision-making and must speak with one voice."
"It must possess structures of central government strong enough to realise and enforce Community law, and it must adhere to and defend our core values and principles, these being democracy, human rights, the protection of minorities and so on."
"The United Nations knew this to be an absolute conditio sine qua non from our point of view, and, having carried out an initial and careful scrutiny, I believe that I can say that the proposals comply with these conditions."
"That leaves us with a second difficulty: what is asked of us is a consequence of the principle of two zones and two communities on which the proposal is founded."
"What is being asked of us involves the adaptation of the acquis communautaire."
"I do not think it necessary for us to engage with these questions at the present moment, but we should do so when they are put to us by those who want to live together in this state in the future."
"For as long as they do not express their desire for this state, we do not, I believe, need to answer the question of which rules for co-existing in it are compatible with the acquis communautaire."
"The important thing is that we should not be giving anyone the opportunity to use reference to Community law as a way of evading responsibility for the political decision that now has to be taken."
"At the end of the day, this is about getting the final result accepted in the Member States and the candidate countries, and so I will say quite clearly that the final package for every single candidate country must also come complete with a decent measure of generosity on our part."
"There is no room here for small-mindedness."
"We are also getting to the point where we simply have to say that these concerns and aspirations are justified, and that, politically speaking, there will be no other way of explaining to people why joining the EU is the right thing for them to do."
"In that event, we will have to meet the candidate countries halfway and make it clear that there will under no circumstances be such a thing as second-class membership."
"I am very grateful to the Council Presidency for having already made this clear with reference to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Commission takes the same view."
"Once negotiations are completed, the countries that have done so will be participants with equal rights in the Intergovernmental Conference, and, moreover, right from the word go."
"The same applies to the Commission."
"All I want to say about safeguards and transitional periods is that these are perfectly normal instruments, which are intended to prevent us getting unpleasant surprises."
"They are nothing more than a necessary way of dealing with risks."
"I consider the work done by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, which is shortly to be completed, to be a valuable and important help in the final stage of these negotiations, and I would like to give voice to the hope that we will succeed, with the head of steam we are building up, in speeding up the train on the final stretch of its journey and enabling it to arrive punctually at the terminus in Copenhagen."
"(Applause)"
"- rapporteur. (FR) Mr President, after 28 years of conflict and occupation, there is now a glimmer of hope for the peaceful reunification of Cyprus."
"It is this glimmer of hope which inspired the draft resolution that we shall vote on tomorrow."
"We hope that the two sides, who are running short of time and nearing the deadline, will be able to accept, after Copenhagen, the major points contained in Kofi Annan's balanced proposals."
"If so, the reunified and reconciled island of Cyprus will be able to join the European Union."
"The Greek Cypriots have already accepted these proposals, within the deadline set by the Secretary-General, whereas the Turkish Cypriots are continuing to drag their feet."
"Any intervention by a third party could still destroy the fragile balance of the UN plan."
"It could have been destroyed, for example, by the threat from the Turkish Government, which insists that, even after a political solution has been found, Cyprus could not join the European Union before Turkey."
"This kind of colonial attitude - which I refer to in passing - would jeopardise the independence and the sovereignty of Cyprus, confirmed by the Security Council resolutions."
"It would also steamroller the opinion of the trade unions, opposition parties and the Turkish Cypriot population, 98% of whom, in a recent survey, voted in favour of joining."
"Since each candidate country is being judged on its own merits, a veto of this kind - if it were applied - could only be rejected outright and, in this scenario, the Copenhagen European Council would have the easy task of allowing the Republic of Cyprus to join the European Union, in line with the Helsinki conclusions."
"The Turkish Cypriot would unfortunately lose out because this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."
"In the same vein, I would also like the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Verheugen to reiterate to Parliament that a possible failure of the constitutional referendum in one of the two parts of the island will not jeopardise Cyprus's accession to the European Union."
"We have not quite reached this point yet and today, hopefully, if we make a last-ditch effort, we will not miss out on this historic opportunity."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in his introductory speech, Mr Brok said something that is, basically, applicable to all the candidate countries, but also to the Czech Republic."
"There is still room for catching up in both the economic and administrative spheres."
"I do not wish to go into them in depth, as these things are basically not problematic, but will be resolved in the near future."
"Please permit me to concentrate on one point that is of especial significance - the decrees of President Edward Bene?, which we have discussed at very great length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"On behalf of our group, I have tabled a final amendment, which I would like to put before you now. It reads thus: 'The European Parliament refers to the report commissioned by it and supports its common conclusions, namely that the presidential decrees do not pose an obstacle to Czech accession to the EU, meaning that all Union citizens will enjoy the same rights on Czech territory after accession, that all judgments handed down in absentia have been quashed, and that Law No. 115 of 8 May 1946 has no justification for its existence from the point of view of modern jurisprudence' - let me repeat - 'that Law No. 115 of 8 May 1946 has no justification for its existence from the point of view of modern jurisprudence; regards the statements of principle made in the German/Czech Declaration of 21 January 1997 as a sound basis for reconciliation, which represents the moral foundation for European integration; considers a political gesture by the Czechs to this effect as desirable.'"
"This text respects the dignity of all those who suffered during the past decades, although it is important again to call to mind the sequence of the historic events."
"First came rule by the Nazis, then the Czech lands were occupied by Nazi-ruled Germany, then there was the war, and then came the expulsions."
"A very, very large number of people suffered - Czechs, Sudeten Germans, Hungarians, Roma and others."
"I believe that this text respects the dignity of all of them, but also respects the dignity of all those who live in the Czech Republic and in the European Union today, of all those who are alive, but had nothing personally to do with these events and who are looking forward, to whom it is the present and the future that matter."
"Beyond that, this text makes no demands and exerts no pressure on the Czech Republic."
"Let me conclude by saying that, as my final amendment does justice to all sides, I ask you to vote tomorrow to accept it, along with the report as a whole."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for Estonia, I find myself thinking back to that remarkable day nine and a half years ago, when I arrived in Estonia for the first time."
"Even then, there was tangible evidence of a firm intention of clearing away the past, looking forward, uniting the people's own abilities with the possibilities of modern technology and bringing about an unparalleled modernisation of the economy and the administration."
"It is true that the drastic economic measures brought social hardship in their wake, but such things may also be observed in other countries."
"It appears to me, however, that Estonia's economic structure has in the meantime become healthier than in many other candidate countries."
"This increases the possibilities for now giving greater attention to society's social cohesion."
"Although I have already started on the problem areas, I would very much like to recall what Commissioner Verheugen said, that we have to show a bit of generosity now that we have reached the final negotiation stage."
"I wish to put this in specific terms by saying that the European Union is not going to be flooded by such things as Estonian milk, which, if it goes anywhere, will end up seeping away into Finland."
"We have seen, though, how, for ten years, the Estonians left their agriculture to the mercies of world market conditions."
"If we had done that in the European Union, we would surely show particular concern for those who survived such drastic treatment."
"Nothing less than that, I believe, should we show to the Estonians where this is concerned."
"So please let there be some generosity towards this sector in Estonia!"
"There are other problems in such areas as the extraction of oil-shale, where structural problems are added to environmental ones, and the curious thing is that it is in this sector that the minority are particularly heavily represented."
"There too, I believe, we in the European Union have to take some share in investment."
"But, all in all, I want to say to our Estonian friends: 'Tere tulemast ja kõike head, kallit söbrad eestist!'"
"In my role as deputy chairman of the delegation for the EU's relations with Lithuania, I would like to make the brief observation that, when we had our JPC meeting there last week, we had extensive discussions of why we were not very happy about the possible practical effects of the agreement on Kaliningrad."
"We fear that the Lithuanian authorities in particular, but also travellers themselves, will have to put up with a certain number of things being technically inadequate or impracticable, and we hope that it may be possible to find even better solutions."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, twelve years ago, the extraordinary event symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall, which separated two political blocs, but which also divided a people, to some extent represented a pioneering step in the process of European enlargement towards Central and Eastern Europe."
"It was following this reunification that the European Council, meeting in Copenhagen, in 1993, decided to integrate into the European Union the associated States of Central and Eastern Europe that wished to join."
"The Copenhagen European Council made it clear that the accession of these countries would depend on their fulfilment of the obligations inherent in their participation in the Union."
"We are all familiar with these obligations, which are known as the Copenhagen criteria, and so there is no need, in this context, to make specific mention of them."
"In addition to German reunification, we cannot ignore two other political events that, although lacking the same symbolic power, have taken on particular importance in the development of the next steps in this process of European reunification."
"I am referring, first of all, to the Nice Summit, at which the European Heads of State and Government undertook to reform the Community institutions, in the aim of ensuring that these are adapted to a Europe that is enlarged by a further twelve countries."
"We are all aware that failure in this area would leave the process of enlargement compromised for many years to come."
"Whatever opinion we may have about the institutional solutions that were reached, the fact is that since Nice the candidate countries have at least been aware of their relative positions in the Union and of what they can expect in the future."
"Secondly, I am referring to the Gothenburg Summit, which brought the Swedish Presidency to a close."
"In their conclusions, Europe's leaders categorically asserted that the process of enlargement was irreversible, having for the first time set a deadline - the end of 2002 - for closing negotiations with the candidate countries that are ready at that time, with the stated aim of these countries being able to participate as Members in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament."
"Today, as 2002 draws to a close and with the European Parliament having met this morning for the first time in plenary sitting with the representatives of all the candidate countries, our duty, and also our desire, is to applaud the extraordinary efforts that these countries have made to adapt their political, economic, social and judicial structures to the model of the European Union, efforts which, above all, have made this moment a victory that belongs to them and which must be acknowledged."
"As one Hungarian Member stated this morning, we can only regret the fact that the Communist dictatorship that subjugated these countries for more than forty years prevented them from participating in the marvellous adventure of European integration from the very beginning."
"These words do not suggest, however, a lack of awareness of the fact that the Union is an undertaking that involves risk and that, with enlargement, this risk increases through the bringing together of two worlds that, unfortunately, are at highly disparate stages of development, that will accentuate the differences between the richer regions and the less prosperous ones and will increase the proportion of the population living in the least-favoured regions."
"It is, therefore, to be expected that questions are raised and that fears are expressed, for example, with regard to regional cohesion policies being less effective or with regard to difficulties of funding structural policies in the economic and social spheres."
"It is this Europe, however, so full of challenges and difficulties, whose recent history has accelerated to the speed of light and which has seen all its balances change in a little over half a dozen years, that has separated the strong from the weak and the winners from the timid and those resigned to their fate."
"Mr President, one of the countries that has distinguished itself in its efforts to fall into line with the European Union, in the aim of joining it, is Hungary, whose progress and current situation I have sought to monitor as rapporteur for this Parliament."
"As expected, the Commission's last periodic report on Hungary concluded that, given the progress made by the date of its publication, this country would be in a position to conclude negotiations by the end of the year and to assume the obligations arising from accession in accordance with the timetable that had been set."
"This comes as no surprise."
"Hungary has always been one of the leading candidate countries with regard to the dynamic of negotiations and its achievements, specifically in the economic field, have been hailed as amongst the best in the region."
"The Hungarian economy still has one of the best performances in the region, and is characterised by one of the highest growth rates in Europe, the lowest rate of inflation seen in the last ten years, a relatively low unemployment rate, and a steady increase in trade with the European Union."
"In the resolutions adopted in the last two years, Parliament has drafted a number of recommendations, specifically intended to encourage the pursuit of reforms in the field of integrating the Roma minority, to strengthen social dialogue and to adopt a media law, or even with regard to observing the rules that govern the public markets."
"Today, we can say that progress has been made in these as in many other fields and that the efforts made by the Hungarian authorities have been consistent."
"To conclude, I only wish to say that Hungary is in a good position to join the European Union in 2004, although it must continue to pursue its preparations in line with the commitments it has given throughout the negotiations, and that we hope to have Hungary with us in the next legislature of this Parliament, with the same parliamentary representation enjoyed by the current Members States with an equivalent population."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are living through one of the most important periods in modern European history."
"All of us, nations, governments, parliaments, and we here in the European Parliament, are starting and writing a new chapter, with vision and realism, with hope and firmness."
"And every country, every nation, must feel equal and secure within this development."
"In this sense, Lithuania - for which I am acting as rapporteur - must not feel, when it comes to the final arrangements for Kaliningrad, that it has been treated differently, as far as its sovereignty is concerned, from the other Member States of the European Union."
"Malta, for which I am the Socialist Group's shadow rapporteur, has nothing to fear."
"Besides, all of us Mediterranean people, especially those of us from the islands, know that the human spirit creates and develops against the deep blue of the sea and sky and that, as sure as night follows day, the creative spirit will win through."
"The political determination of the Union, which must not tolerate any conceptions which might allow third parties to intervene in Union's activities, is being judged in Cyprus, the most institutionally and economically advanced of the candidate countries."
"The Union's determination to support any solution that respects the acquis communautaire and the need for the Republic of Cyprus to be an operational state is also being judged."
"That being so, the integration of Cyprus in the European Union is a foregone conclusion, irrespective of progress made in resolving the political problem."
"I trust that Romania and Bulgaria will soon become members of the European Union."
"I think Romania in particular is being treated a little more harshly than the other countries and I must point out that its quota of parliamentarians is out of proportion to its population."
"As a Greek, I expect that Turkey will soon become a fully paid-up member of the European Union."
"By which I mean a democratic Turkey, like all the other European countries."
"Kemal Ataturk, who planned a modern state for the Turkish people, will be vindicated once all the institutional reforms have been completed and implemented, once the military leadership obeys and executes the decisions taken by the democratic political leadership in Turkey."
"I am positive that the new political leadership in Turkey has realised that the way to build Europe is through democratic procedure, not eastern haggling."
"Finally, we are not accountants."
"We are politicians who need to pave the way for the new Europe with visionary realism and that is precisely what we shall be judged on and that is where we shall be vindicated."
"As a Greek, I wait and hope, as do you Commissioner, for the Treaty for the new Europe of the twenty-first century to be signed in Athens, in the shadow of Pericles' Acropolis, of Pnyka Hill, the site of the Municipal Church, and of the tribune from which Saint Paul preached to the Athenians."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, with the permission of the Members of this House, I would like to use this speech to make a statement relating to my twin roles, as rapporteur for Malta, and also as co-chairman of the Joint Committee on the Czech Republic."
"Today makes me proud, as Parliament has today demonstrated its openness and signalled to the candidates for accession that they are welcome among us."
"European parliamentarism has thereby shown signs of being very much alive."
"The impression I get from today's debate with the candidate countries is of how self-evident the whole thing is, that it is normal for Europe to meet together, for the first time in a peaceful, voluntary and democratic way."
"For Austria in particular, a country in the heart of Europe, this means that, following Europe's division by the consequences of the Second World War, a corner has been rounded on the way to a better, more economically and socially stable Europe with an added value in terms of security policy."
"We are continuing a Central European tradition, one which has been particularly brought home to us today by the 90th birthday of Otto von Habsburg, the committed MEP and son of an emperor."
"We must not, of course, allow the historical perspective to distract our attention from the problems of today."
"There is still much to be done in the run-up to accession - corruption has to be combated, just as administrative systems and an independent workable justice system have to be built up."
"There must of course be safety in the nuclear field, and so I welcome the expectation expressed in the report on the Czech Republic that the bilateral undertakings negotiated by the European Commission with regard to Temelin will be adhered to in full, and that, furthermore, power stations such as Ignalina and Koslodui, with parts of Bohunice, must be closed down."
"We can welcome the transitional arrangements that demonstrate flexibility in making it possible for the labour market and vulnerable sectors of the economy to be protected."
"The progressive introduction of direct payments to farmers in the candidate countries - primarily Poland - also makes sense."
"Such arrangements are in no way a handicap."
"Processes of integration have always been accompanied by transitional arrangements and by temporary safeguard clauses such as those to which you, Mr Verheugen, have referred."
"If enlargement were to fail, the Austrian economy would lose EUR 270 million per annum."
"The removal of barriers to trade alone amounts to EUR 450 million per annum, meaning that every Austrian is investing EUR 28 per annum in enlargement."
"Enlargement of the EU is where our future lies."
"There are problems from the past that need to be dealt with, and it is in this sense that the additional clause proposed by Jürgen Schroedter - who is the rapporteur on the Czech Republic - on the subject of the Bene? decrees, should be understood."
"I wish to fully endorse what he said in his speech advocating support for this article."
"By giving broad-based support to this amendment, Parliament would be sending out a positive message."
"Let me now turn to my own report on Malta."
"It is a good thing that there is also a Mediterranean component to enlargement."
"Malta is a small island state, and there is no doubt that it is in the European Union that its future lies."
"The problems of integration to be overcome have essentially to do with agriculture and subsidies to dockyards."
"Malta also has a profoundly European heritage."
"Austria has a particular interest in Malta because thousands of our holidaymakers go there every year and because we have a share in the privatised airport."
"Speaking in political terms, we hope that the outcome of a referendum on Malta's accession to the EU will be accepted as the people's democratic choice, for there will not be a third chance!"
"Mr President, many of today's speakers have called this a historic occasion - and rightly so - and I do not want to fall into the trap of repeating them."
"However, as a European citizen, the son of a Polish father, and as rapporteur for Poland, I would like to greet and welcome all the members of the Polish parliament who are seated in the visitors' gallery, both those who are going to become part of our group and all those who will join other groups as well."
"The report on Poland emerged from the vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in exactly the form I would have wished, in that all the amendments I supported were adopted and all those to which I was opposed were rejected."
"It is a well-balanced report which acknowledges the considerable progress made but expresses a number of reservations regarding the self-interested move of members of the civil service, which is evidence of a rather exaggerated interpretation of the spoil system, and the issue of state control of the press and television."
"Some progress had been made in this area but the situation is now once again at a standstill, if not regressing, and so I have tabled an amendment on the matter which I hope will be adopted tomorrow."
"I have to say that, throughout my work as rapporteur for Poland, I have constantly borne in mind something which Pope John Paul II said - and I am pleased to be able to mention his name here; I have not heard it spoken this morning despite the fact that he has been at the forefront of European reunification - something he said during an interview he granted me."
"When I asked His Holiness who would benefit most from the reconciliation he so longed for between the two Europes, he replied that the Europe of the former communist countries would be able to bring most to the other Europe because these countries' experiences under the communist system had taught them wisdom."
"This morning's debate gives me the hope, expressed by President Cox and Commissioner Verheugen too, that this prophecy will come true."
"I would like to see more conviction on the part of the Polish Members of the European Parliament - I have to say that we heard some Polish speakers this morning who were not representative - and I would like to see them share with us that strength, that drive which led the Poles to pull down walls, to form Solidarnosc and to pave the way for the fall of communism, which was a decisive factor in the building of our common future."
"(Applause)"
"I am afraid I must remind our guests that the Parliamentary Rules of Procedure do not allow those sitting in the gallery to show either agreement or disagreement with what is being said."
"Mr President, today, I will be devoting my entire speech to Slovakia, the country for which I am rapporteur on behalf of Parliament."
"Slovakia has reached the final leg of the negotiations on EU membership, which merits congratulations in view of the fact that, four years ago, that country was still in political isolation."
"In two consecutive elections, the population left no doubt as to its democratic and pro-European persuasion."
"According to opinion polls, support for the EU remains strong."
"Today is not the right time to reach a final verdict; this is something that Parliament will be doing at the beginning of next year."
"We still, of course, await the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit, but I am convinced that Slovakia will be capable of bringing the negotiations to a successful end."
"Today's resolution, therefore, also gives a kind of limited snapshot in time; we will be drawing up the full report next year."
"As with the other candidate countries, a great deal needs to be done before its accession in 2004."
"I should like to give Slovakia two priorities in this respect."
"In my view, strengthening its administrative capacity is the most important priority."
"It must be possible to implement EU rules satisfactorily and to spend EU funds properly."
"This is also in line with the aspiration for a more transparent government that will crack down hard on corruption."
"Slovakia's new government has announced initiatives in this connection, and we are awaiting the reports with interest and some trepidation."
"In the same framework of a transparent society and transparent government, it is important that they should continue to reform the judiciary and the structure around it."
"We still have major anxieties about the situation of the Roma, not only in respect of Slovakia, in fact."
"Every time I am directly confronted with their living conditions, I realise that of all the intentions that have been formulated over the past years, too little has as yet been realised in practice."
"I know that the problems cannot be solved over the space of a few years."
"The implementation of policy costs time and money."
"This is why I am asking the Slovakian Government for a kind of multi-annual commitment to solve those problems that will continue to exist post-accession."
"The same text can, in fact, be found in the report on the Czech Republic."
"Moreover, I am of the view that the position of the Roma in the enlarged European Union will be so unique that the Convention will have no choice but to devote attention to it."
"We are asking a great deal."
"We are doing this in the expectation that the Slovaks will recognise the fairness of this, just as they can expect fairness in the final assessment."
"We cannot ask more from new Member States than from the current Member States."
"This is why I take exception to the often unfair criticism levelled at Slovakia, including in my own country."
"Slovakia has drawn a line under its Meciar past."
"It is the achievements today that count and this is on which we should base our judgment."
"Mr President, new cultures, including the culture of Slovenia - the country for which I am the rapporteur - will add value to and, at the same time, bring new security for both themselves and the European family as a whole."
"This, then, is the time of half-full glasses, of optimism, of benefits."
"Of course, the time of difficulties, of half-empty glasses, will come when the governments have to attempt to win the acceptance of their people."
"The European Socialists have always fought for enlargement."
"The countries bordering on the Mediterranean, such as Italy, which are the gateway to Central Europe, have played a major role in the process."
"We are in favour of opening the doors wide to those who want to become part of the European family."
"Clearly, the right to become part of the club is not automatically granted: membership is won through very hard work, as the negotiators of the candidate countries are aware."
"I imagine that they might even, on occasion, have been disconcerted by the tough nature of the negotiations."
"Slovenia is the wealthiest of the candidate countries, and it has a European institutional tradition too."
"The main problem in the phase of preparation for accession was speeding up the administrative aspect of court cases and resolving the problems left over from the previous regime."
"The situation was therefore similar to that of a number of other candidate countries but less complex."
"At the time when much criticism was being expressed a number of years ago, it was always difficult to find any major sins or shortcomings in Slovenia which were not explained by the nature of daily life or by the number of people passing through the country."
"However, all the candidate countries, including Slovenia, will find it difficult to meet their commitments when they actually join Europe."
"In any case, the reports of the international organisations on Slovenia talk of a functioning market economy and respect for the Copenhagen criteria setting the level to be achieved."
"A paragraph has been included in the report which mentions combating fraud and corruption and combating drug trafficking."
"These are phenomena which are certainly present, but to a much lesser degree than in other countries."
"Mentioning them may make the text unbalanced: the best solution would be just to delete the paragraph."
"Moreover, out of the 102 countries in which the level of corruption has been recorded, Slovenia ranks only twenty-seventh and, what is more, organised a conference on corruption in 2002."
"It therefore cannot be said that nothing is being done in this area."
"Lastly, on a technical note, the term 'denationalisation' which I used in the original text has been translated in some language versions as 'privatisation', which has a different meaning."
"Mr President, the process of enlargement is one that we all broadly welcome."
"While making great demands of the candidate countries, it is a pity that the European Union has not already put its own house in order."
"In particular I am thinking of the need for reform of the common agricultural policy and the Commission's financial management."
"It still seems incapable of properly accounting for the massive public funds put at its disposal by our taxpayers."
"I also hope that, once the candidates have overcome their first flush of unquestioning enthusiasm for the European Union, they will begin to adopt a more sceptical attitude to many aspects of the European Union project."
"After all, since most of them have rejected the ghastly communist experiment that so distorted and corrupted their countries for the past 50 years, I hope they would wish to oppose inappropriate intrusion on their national sovereignty and the tide of leftist political correctness that is too often generated by European Union institutions."
"Speaking now as the rapporteur for Bulgaria, I especially welcome the parliamentary delegation from Bulgaria."
"I recognise the enormous progress that Bulgaria has made in economic, political and social reform in recent years."
"Its ambition to join the European Union by 2007 is realistic and we should say so. We must give it every assistance to achieve this ambition."
"Bulgaria has made great strides in recent years."
"There is now a properly functioning market economy and progress has been made on privatisation."
"The proposals for reforming the civil service and for tackling corruption are also an essential basis for political and economic change."
"So much needs to be done in so many areas."
"There is a vast grey economy and there is high unemployment, features not entirely unknown in some of the countries that are already European Union Member States."
"Macro-economic progress has yet to trickle down into tangible economic benefits for the population at large."
"There are still major areas of poverty."
"This applies not just to the Roma population, where more vigorous action is required, but to Bulgarians more generally."
"The most vulnerable element in any population are the children and I have drawn particular attention to the need for more resources, including Community funds, to be targeted in bringing about major improvements in child welfare and childcare."
"I must mention the Kozlodvy nuclear power plant and in particular the closure dates for units 3 and 4."
"Strong opinions have been voiced on this issue and unfortunately it has become a symbolic argument, with people digging in on both sides."
"Safety considerations must always be paramount when dealing with nuclear power."
"But there seems to be no good reason on safety grounds why closure should not take place in 2008, rather than 2006, if this would make a significant difference to Bulgaria's economic situation."
"The EU peer review, conducted under the auspices of the Council, should make this decision, taking account of the results of the IAEA mission in June and an objective analysis of the economic consequences of closure."
"Mr President, I wish to thank the Conference of Presidents for creating and sustaining this unique part-session."
"I should also like to thank our former colleague, Mr Haarder, and his team because they are creating an historic Danish Presidency."
"I pay particular tribute to the Commissioner himself and to his team."
"The Commissioner's powerful leadership has accepted no obstacle that would delay enlargement and he and his team have successfully tackled and overcome immense and daunting problems and have brought us to the happy position we enjoy today."
"I welcome most particularly in that context the Romanian parliamentary team."
"Romania, in common with other candidate countries in this two-part but single enlargement, has made substantial progress and her progress has been particularly marked since December 1999 when the new government took office, after the Helsinki Conference."
"If Romania follows faithfully the Commission's new and excellent roadmap and has the support of the Commission, the Council of Ministers and Parliament, Romania can most definitely reach her target date for EU entry of 1 January 2007 and reach that date not by right but by her own achievement."
"I therefore wish profoundly to retain that target date in Parliament's report."
"I am confident that by the end of this week Romania will become a member of Nato."
"By 1 January 2007, with hard work, consistency, application and our support, she could be here."
"I commend Romania's progress to this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, I wish to emphasise that the political and economic advantages of enlargement will of course far outweigh the potential costs to the Budget, but, despite this, there is still a need to give budget policy a framework that is reliable in the medium and long term and capable of gaining the support of a majority on both sides."
"We are then, to take one example, talking in terms of a Budget framework with some EUR 15 billion of expenditure in 2006, but, on the other hand - as we so often forget - we will have our own resources, amounting to some EUR 5 billion, which the new Member States will already have contributed to the European Union's Budget."
"This means that it is important to again clarify the positions on questions of principle relating to the adjustment of the new Financial Perspective, which were voted on in plenary in June."
"Since then, the Council, at its Brussels Summit, has also adopted parts of this position taken by Parliament, examples being the principle of progressive integration for direct payments to agriculture, the clarification that, after enlargement, none of the new Member States should become net contributors, and a ruling intended to prevent a country from being in a worse financial position after accession than it was immediately before it."
"It is very important to me that the necessary adjustment of the Financial Perspective is to be made on the basis of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement and on the proposal of the Commission jointly - that is what it says - jointly with the Council and Parliament and by the appropriate majorities."
"For example, Mr President-in-Office, I would expect it to be made clear in the Budget conciliation that Parliament is continually to be supplied with comprehensive information on the progress of the negotiations, and I would expect a trialogue on the subject to achieve agreement on how we are to move the Financial Perspective's adjustment procedure forward over the coming months."
"The many issues still open include such questions as: how, for example, are we to understand the formulation by the Berlin European Council, in item 12 of its Final Conclusions, which expressly states that a clear distinction is to be drawn between the new Member States and the expenditure by the old EU?"
"Will this statement from Berlin continue to stand or will every heading in the post-enlargement Budget be common to all of us?"
"That has to be clarified."
"If the accession date is to be 1 May 2003, will there be a supplementary Budget?"
"Does it even make sense to spend, as it were, four months organising pre-accession programmes, leaving them to run their course, and - whether it be in agriculture, structural policy or internal policy - treat the new members as such only after eight months have elapsed?"
"It is also, I believe, in issues concerning the new neighbours and partnerships that there has to be a very careful examination of which financial adjustments have to be carried out in such areas as heading 4, which deals with foreign policy."
"This affects both Turkey and other neighbours and new partners, with whom we will have to talk about quite specific new partnerships."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is marked by a good sense of community and by confidence in Europe's future."
"Positive emotions help to overcome the difficulties that still await the candidate countries."
"Processes of economic adjustment call for the greatest political and social commitment on the part of all sides."
"The processes of restructuring heavy industry and mining alone will call for an intensification of accompanying measures to combat rising unemployment."
"This makes it necessary to use all available measures that might help to prevent it, and to step up the social dialogue in the candidate countries."
"That alone will guarantee that social and labour legislation will continue to progress along democratic lines."
"We talk a great deal, and on many occasions, about the social dimension of Europe, but deliberately forget to point out that legislation on social affairs is just as important a constituent part of the acquis as are, for example, the provisions on competition."
"The transposition of the social acquis has an importance extending right across Europe, as it can be a means towards achieving stability preventing potential conflicts."
"In view of this, I ask you to adopt the two amendments in the name of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, tabled by Mr Oostlander and myself."
"In the time that remains to us before the candidate countries accede, much remains to be done in the areas of employment policy, economic policy and social policy."
"It is incumbent on those Member States that share borders with the candidate countries to support cross-border cooperation and press for advances in it."
"Workers in these regions must be helped to come to terms better with changes in the labour market."
"This alone will enable us to dismantle prejudices that still affect the freedom of movement of services and workers."
"I wish to conclude by emphasising that, in any case, the candidate countries deserve the greatest respect for the efforts they have made to date with accession to the EU in mind."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and dear parliamentary colleague, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, enlargement is an historical and moral need and a unique opportunity to reconcile this continent with itself."
"Underlying the debate we have held this morning and the debate we are holding on Mr Brok's report - whom I would like to congratulate on his work - is a need: to reflect in depth on ourselves, on our role in the world, on what the European Union project has been, what it is at the moment and what we want it to be within the context of an enlarged Union."
"And in terms of this reflection, I believe the work of the European Convention is of fundamental importance and I believe we must seek a suitable formula for involving - as has been requested this morning - the representatives of the candidate countries in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"With regard to the short term, I am convinced that, thanks to the efforts of the European Commission, of the Member States and of the candidate countries, within a few weeks, in Copenhagen, we will be able to reach a reasonable and fair agreement."
"I also believe that we will be able, on the basis of equal, and therefore non-discriminatory, conditions for all, to mark the way, by means of the pre-accession strategies which have been expressed here this morning and by concluding the negotiations under way."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, I believe it is important that we do not get bogged down in the immediate and the present."
"I believe that History is not only written as a narrative using the preterite tense. Because, if we do not have a clear vision of our future ambitions and projects, not only will we be unable to design our future, but we will also have great difficulties understanding the past."
"Today, Mr President, History is being conjugated in the present tense."
"And, in this historic present we are living through, the European Union is taking shape as one of its main protagonists."
"Today it is presented as an economic, financial and industrial power, but it has a great and essential need to affirm its presence on the international stage and to provide itself with a security and defence policy which will allow us to confront the new types of threat, especially following the attacks of 11 September."
"Mr President, we must overcome the challenges involved in enlargement, we must take advantage of all potential and all synergy, we must build a unified political and economic area which will bring together more than 500 million people, of which, in the initial phase, 300 will use the same currency."
"Mr President, I believe that, in summary, it is a question of us, with generosity and a vision of the future, being able, although figures are important, to put ideals before figures."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to preface my observations with an expression of my own gratitude and that of my group, for this debate, and also for all the work of reporting on enlargement and of preparation for it, which I address to the Commission among others."
"To say this, Commissioner, is not just to pay lip-service, for we have indeed received all the information we needed whenever we needed it."
"We have carried on the debate in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and I also want to thank that committee's chairman, not only for his report but also for all the cooperation that was involved."
"It is my belief that all groups and all the political forces on the committee did their best to accompany this process in a critical frame of mind and have helped to make it, and enlargement, a success."
"I have two specific points that I wish to address in addition to what my fellow-Members have said about the individual countries and also about the general aspect, which was apposite and intelligent."
"These have to do with two very real problems."
"My first point has to do with Cyprus, specifically with the UN Secretary-General's proposal on the subject, which has been welcomed by all sides."
"There is, however, one item in Annex IX that could lead to misunderstandings; I refer to the proposals relating to Article 1(1) on a referendum of the citizens in this divided country when the Basic Agreement is adopted."
"The questions in this referendum are to be answered with 'yes' or 'no'."
"They deal firstly with the new structure of the state and then with Cyprus' accession to the European Union."
"It is my belief that the European Union ought, quite independently of this - I am glad that I can already expect something of you, Commissioner - to decide this question in accordance with the Helsinki accords, and Cyprus should have its say on the subject."
"The second issue has to do with Turkey."
"I would like to remind you that we are not debating Turkey today, but are engaged in the debate on enlargement, and, although Turkey has had candidate status since 1999, it is not one of the countries expecting to accede in the immediate future."
"The Copenhagen political criteria have still not been fulfilled, despite Turkey's great efforts in that direction, the great successes it has had and the great progress it has made."
"I therefore see no reason to talk in terms of this or that date."
"Let me tell you this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: fixing a date is not an issue, at any rate not for us!"
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen and future fellow MEPs up in the public gallery, this is an historic day, a kind of preliminary celebration before the big celebration we are soon to hold together."
"It is a celebration that will mark the end of the long journey we have made together with the goal of jointly achieving the unification of Europe."
"Strasbourg and the region we are in were witness to the ways in which attempts were made to unify Europe in the past."
"All the anonymous graves in which thousands of French and German boys lie buried are a tragic reminder of the way in which violence and compulsion were used to impose European unity."
"The Berlin Wall, on the other hand, was, inversely, a way of preventing people from meeting and ideas from being shared."
"What is unique about the EU is the brilliant, but historically unusual, idea of bringing people together at the negotiating table instead of through trench warfare."
"My colleague, Mrs Paulsen likes to say that the EU is about giving power to bureaucrats rather than to soldiers, and that is quite a good way of putting it."
"The EU consists, however, not only of bureaucrats but also of politicians with ideas and visions."
"The European Parliament's combined idea and vision has been the fact that it is convinced of the advantages of developing European cooperation together."
"With stubbornness and consistency, we have given impetus to enlargement by establishing clear dates, requirements and staging posts."
"There have sometimes been stormy moments for governments and domestic policy, but we have stood firm."
"Mr Brok's report is a clear expression of this agreement."
"The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the report."
"For ourselves as liberals, enlargement - or reunification - has been the issue to which we have given top priority for many years."
"It is a natural follow-on from the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakthrough for democracy, freedom and the market economy in Eastern and Central Europe."
"The EU has for a long time been incomplete, with members only from Western Europe."
"It is only by acting together that we can defend and stand up for our common values and ambitions: freedom, democracy, human rights and a functioning market with growth and prosperity in a Europe that gives the citizen pride of place."
"The major challenges to come - the environmental problems, cross-border crime, the role of Europe in the world and our responsibility for a more just world order - also demand joint efforts, such as the work on reforming the European institutions so that they become more democratic and efficient."
"I am looking forward to our new fellow MEPs' contributions and fresh ideas in this area."
"Mr President, in a united Europe, we are all different, but we are of equal worth and must be judged by the same yardsticks."
"We liberals have stubbornly fought for a situation in which the Copenhagen criteria, especially the political criteria, are respected."
"Human rights abuses can never be excused, and we are delighted about the considerable progress that has been made in the candidate countries."
"We shall continue to monitor these areas, that is to say respect for minorities, press freedom and good governance in both the old and the new Member States."
"We think that it is in this way that the safety clauses should be used, that is to say through continuous examination of how we all apply and respect our common values."
"We must make demands upon ourselves, both in the old and the new Member States, which we must not see divided into A and B teams."
"Many difficult issues have been resolved during the autumn."
"The Danish Presidency has made fantastic efforts, as have the candidate countries."
"Certainly, it would be marvellous if, at the end of the year, we could also see a solution to the Cyprus issue."
"I hope that everyone can contribute to such a solution."
"I also want to appeal for a clear and positive signal to be given to Turkey."
"The new government is worth much encouragement and support on our part."
"Mr Brok's report should be interpreted as welcoming those of you in the candidate countries and inviting you to a celebration."
"It will be a celebration at which the division between 'we in the EU' and 'you in the candidate countries' ceases and at which we all become 'we in the EU'."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it does not need to be repeated that this is an historic day, for this House at any rate."
"My group, too, sees the enlargement of the European Union as an historic opportunity, and a large majority of us will be endorsing Mr Brok's report."
"It is not entirely clear to me why you, Mr Haarder, like Mrs Malmström just now, spoke in terms of reunification."
"What is apparent to me from a reading of European history is that this continent has never actually been united."
"What is now underway is made all the greater an achievement by the fact that it involves uniting this continent for the very first time."
"I do not want to sound too discordant a note, but I do at least want to mention three problematic aspects that lead me to be somewhat dissatisfied with the report, despite the general approval it enjoys."
"For a start, I find it regrettable that nearly all the amendments relating to the great social and employment problems engendered in the candidate countries by enlargement and the processes of transformation have been rejected."
"Too little attention is paid to these issues even in practical policy-making."
"Secondly, my group continues to be dissatisfied with the way in which, in contrast to earlier accessions to the EU, there is no full guarantee that the new Member States and their citizens will enjoy equal rights from the word go."
"I know, Commissioner, that you have done a great deal for the public at large, but the egoism of a number of governments has prevented essential work from being done."
"I am well aware of the difficulties involved, but I find it rather problematic when legal and financial discrimination are not prevented from the very outset in a process of enlargement described as an historic task."
"Thirdly, we regret the fact that proposals for further efforts in border regions have not been incorporated in the report."
"It is my belief that the governments responsible in particular, and quite possibly also the Commission, are doing too little in these regions to give real support as extensive changes take effect."
"The possibility cannot at present be excluded that at least some of these regions will become more like enlargement's transit zones."
"Quite apart from the practicalities of the problem, I therefore again call on the Commission and the governments to do everything possible to make what are at present border regions workshops for European integration and enable them to experience its positive effects on people and society, as the former border regions such as for example the Saarland, Lorraine, and Luxembourg so emphatically did."
"Mr President, let us hope that Mr Giscard d'Estaing spawns as much discussion with his Convention proposal as with his remarks about the undesirability of Turkey becoming a member."
"All of a sudden, everyone is worked up about the question of whether it has been right or wrong to hold out to Turkey the prospect of membership."
"If the truth be told, the two extreme scenarios are not very helpful in this discussion."
"On the one hand, there are the people who go along with Turkey's membership, provided that all the conditions are met, and on the other there are people who say: no, never."
"In between these black and white views, there are a large number of people who are trying their best to introduce all kinds of shades of grey."
"The contribution by Mr Brok was a typical example of this."
"He is unfortunately no longer present, but if I have understood him correctly, he stated today that he believes Turkey should be given a chance."
"However, if Turkey met all the EU requirements, then Turkey would no longer be Turkey."
"I plead with you, fellow MEPs, and Mr Brok, to stop playing this word game and stop clouding the issue."
"Yesterday, there was fog at the airport; today, you are producing fog in the Chamber."
"In the media, Mr Brok spelled out very clearly that he thought that the decision of 1999 to make Turkey a candidate was a mistake and that this mistake should be rectified."
"I applaud Mr Brok's flexibility and I also applaud his opinion here today, but this attitude as he expressed today is not compatible with the support expressed by himself as rapporteur, for one of Mr Ferber's amendments which states that a special relationship should be established between the EU and Turkey."
"This is an alternative to membership."
"I am opposed to this and I hope that Mr Brok is too, today and tomorrow."
"I urge you to stop clouding the issue and to stop playing word games."
"If there is a difference of opinion among us, it is about timing and the different stages in the rapprochement between Turkey and the EU."
"This is then no longer a discussion about the purpose of all these efforts, namely membership."
"We should do away with those double agendas, the hypocrisy, the saying 'yes' and hoping 'no'."
"If we give Turkey the green light, this means that the EU will pull out all the stops to make it possible for Turkey to become a member at some point in the future."
"What does this mean in practical terms?"
"If the new Turkish Government were to seize the opportunities of solving the conflict in Cyprus, if that government were at long last to translate the reforms already decided upon into practice, if, in addition, that government wanted to carry out fresh reforms, as it announced this weekend, with zero tolerance towards incidents of torture, if the self-same government were to release prisoners, including the Sakharov Prize winner Lela Zana ? if all of this happened, then the EU would have no option but to keep up with that country."
"I should like to echo the words of Commissioner Verheugen in this connection."
"If the candidate countries move in the direction of the EU, then the EU cannot afford to stand still."
"This also means that the rapprochement between Turkey and the EU cannot be unilateral."
"As far as I am concerned, this means that serious thought should be given in Copenhagen to setting a so-called review date, namely a date, say in a year's time, on which we will reconsider whether Turkey meets all the conditions and all the political criteria and then, if this finding is positive, to have the courage to set a date for negotiations in the future."
"Mr President, much work has been achieved in recent weeks to accelerate the enlargement process, but a number of difficulties have to be overcome before EU enlargement becomes a practical reality."
"We must not underestimate the challenges we face in the run-up to the accession of the ten countries to the European Union."
"The EU Convention must remember that many candidate countries are due to hold referenda on EU accession."
"We should make this as uncomplicated as possible for the people of the candidate countries."
"That is where the EU Convention could be running into trouble: it is going too far ahead of the peoples of Europe."
"Are we seriously asking the candidate countries to ratify the Accession Treaty by referenda next year only to ask them a year later to ratify another EU treaty on more changes to the day-to-day operation of the Union?"
"What would the people of the candidate countries be basing their decision in next year's referenda on?"
"On the existing EU Treaties - including the recently ratified Treaty of Nice - or on an array of new proposals from the EU Convention?"
"Have we not learnt anything from the recent referendum on the Treaty of Nice in Ireland?"
"The Treaty was fairly modest by any standards, but it was very difficult to explain the issues to the people."
"We succeeded in part the second time round in explaining the Treaty, but the lack of understanding of EU issues is still prevalent."
"However, some people at the EU Convention are rushing ahead with extensive reform in all matters connected with the day-to-day operation of the Union."
"We are presenting conflicting messages and proposals to the people of the candidate countries."
"In fact I would go further and say that the EU Convention runs the risk of blurring the enlargement process."
"I must remind the House and members of the Convention that the Convention is a consultative process - the real decisions should and must be made by the Council of Ministers."
"Let us not underestimate the amount of work which must be completed before enlargement becomes a working success."
"The candidate countries must implement the full range of EU directives and regulations."
"The enlargement negotiations are broken up into 38 different chapters."
"It is going to take the candidate countries time to implement this full body of legislation."
"We all know that the accession of ten new countries is not an easy task."
"The pace of reform is the main issue."
"Diplomats and politicians cannot be allowed to run too far ahead of the people of Europe on the issue of future developments."
"We need to bring the people of Europe with us at each stage and we cannot take their support for granted."
"From an Irish perspective, any future EU Treaty that appears to supersede the Irish Constitution will be extremely difficult - if not impossible - to sell to the Irish people."
"Any proposals that diminish the representation of small Member States within the EU institutions will fly in the face of the principles of equality that are the stated aims of the European Union."
"Mr President, there is a great deal of commotion surrounding enlargement."
"As far as EU-fähigkeit of the new Member States is concerned, I can be brief: the Brok report offers a good insight into any remaining doubts on the part of the EU."
"The candidate countries must focus their efforts on certain areas."
"In addition, European and national politicians must clarify to their respective peoples the efforts that have previously been made by the candidate countries."
"Another point is Turkey's candidature."
"In Helsinki, intense pressure on the EU meant that that country officially became a candidate Member."
"Ankara is now once again trying to press the EU for a date to open the negotiations."
"However, it appears clear to me that the EU should resist this pressure for the very good reason that Turkey is a country that does not fit into the EU."
"Although it is a democracy, it is certainly not a western one."
"Although it is a secular state, culture and history are very different from the current EU Member States, which bear the stamp of Christianity."
"We might as well delete the word 'European' if Turkey becomes an EU Member."
"In addition, Turkey has made some progress as a constitutional state, but not enough by a long chalk."
"I would, for example, remind you of the difficulties the Christians are facing in that country."
"The EU can offer Turkey closer cooperation in various areas, but the candidate status was a mistake that should, ideally, be put right."
"The moment of accession, however, is not the EU's final destination."
"What kind of a European Union will we have following enlargement?"
"A Europe that is capable of leaving behind old conflicts?"
"A Europe that supports peace, solidarity and fair relations among its Member States?"
"To me, the ideas about the adoption of the Community method for the CFSP appear to be at odds with these principles."
"The discrepancies between the Member States in this area are simply too great."
"Integration in this area can for that reason only be achieved by means of coercion."
"It is not possible to build a balanced policy on this basis."
"Moreover, this area has a lot to do with our sense of identity, which only increases the potential for tension among Member States."
"The countries in Europe should be vigilant about nationalism."
"However, it is also possible to develop nationalism at European level, whereby we only pursue the status of a world power to greater glorification of ourselves."
"Other large countries would then be suspect from the very start."
"This strikes me as even more harmful than traditional nationalism."
"Enlargement will hopefully bring with it some common sense on this score."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that Mr Gawronski is right: it is the 15-Member State Europe which is likely to benefit most from enlargement."
"However, I feel it must be pointed out and, indeed, I hope the Council and the Commission will comment on this, that this is not the end of the process of enlarging the European Union."
"There are a dozen Caucasian and Balkan countries which are not even on the list of candidate countries, whose situation is not even on a par with that of Turkey, and they are countries which the European Union needs, just as it needs Turkey, not least in order to prevent the development of any tendencies towards fundamentalism, as a number of Members have said today."
"We have heard the reports on each of the candidate countries presented, but I feel that it would have been only right and proper to give these ten countries which are about to join the Union a report on the current situation of each of the current 15 Member States."
"I feel that, from the economic perspective, it might have been appropriate for these countries to know that there is a danger of the European continent becoming 'Japanified', that Germany, Italy and France too are now incapable of carrying out the structural reforms that they have to, which, considering their size, could have an impact on the economies of the ten candidate countries."
"It might also be in the interests of these countries to inform them that the legal systems in some of the 15 countries of the current Union are certainly not worthy of a democracy."
"I refer to Belgium and Italy but also to what might appear to be more minor cases, such as what is happening at this time in your country, in Denmark, President-in-Office of the Council, and I am referring, in particular, to the way that the authorities of your country are handling the matter of the detention of the Chechen deputy Prime Minister, Akhmed Zakayev."
"I do not think this can be justified in terms of respect for the rule of law."
"We are talking about the Europe of democracies, but it may be that we should also be talking about the Europe of democracy. The democracy of this House, the democracy of the Council and the Commission, the democracy of the Union in general, would certainly not satisfy the criteria which we are setting for the candidate countries now."
"This is the issue being analysed by the Convention, an issue which I hope will be addressed and resolved with a decision to adopt the United States' approach, to adopt US-style democracy, not with a return to the European tradition which has done so much harm to our continent."
"Mr President, as speakers have already said, this has been an historic day for the current process of enlargement."
"I would like to look beyond Copenhagen to see what is going to happen in the next stage."
"Some speakers have raised the question of whether Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's comments about Turkey were outdated, whether this was the wrong message at the wrong time and whether, if Turkey should become a member, that would really be the end of Europe as we know it."
"He is right to raise this issue, because once we say yes definitively to Turkey and give it a date, how can we say no to Ukraine, Belarus and other countries which probably have more of their landmass within Europe than Turkey does?"
"Mr Rasmussen, Mr Watson and Mr Haarder have been very liberal in saying that once the political criteria have been met we can give a date for Turkey."
"What about the economic criteria in the Copenhagen Declaration of June 1993?"
"Central to that declaration was the question of institutional stability, which we all seem to be forgetting as we go about welcoming countries into the Union."
"Do we really think that the Union is going to be stable once Turkey, and perhaps other countries, which will then no doubt be welcomed under the same criteria, have joined, and that the Union can then be effectively managed?"
"This question will be examined at the NATO summit on enlargement later this week in Prague."
"The question which people are now asking is whether NATO is really capable of acting and whether it will be really effective once it has more central and eastern European countries?"
"The same applies to the European Union."
"The Helsinki Council made Turkey an official candidate country."
"So did the association agreement of 1961, but will the European Union, with Turkey as a full member, really be fully capable of acting and democratically accountable?"
"My thesis is threefold."
"Firstly, we should pause once the ten countries have come in and once we are completing the negotiations for Romania and Bulgaria."
"To set a date now, or even to set a date for a date, is premature."
"Secondly we must examine every single avenue, such as a special partnership with Turkey, before we commit ourselves to the full process of opening accession negotiations."
"Perhaps most important of all, the Copenhagen Council should set a process in motion, as Mr Prodi mentioned this morning, to consider our approach to future candidates seeking membership of the Union, so that we know how to deal with them."
"In conclusion, the European Council, headed by the Danes, is sleepwalking into the future."
"It is easier for everyone to say yes rather than no, but at this stage it seems that no member of the European Council wishes to say yes to Turkey, but none wishes to say no either."
"Let us be clear in our thinking and let us have a clear strategy so that we can assure Europe's citizens that in ten years' time they will have a stable, prosperous and effective European Union."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I confess to having been somewhat sceptical about the meeting with our colleagues from the candidate countries here in Strasbourg today, which could have been misunderstood as sending a message along the lines of, 'all our problems have been solved, and enlargement is going fine.'"
"Thank God that was not the case."
"It was truly moving to meet all these colleagues speaking different languages and to get the point across to them that there remains much to be done, and that there are still problems and tasks outstanding."
"It was also a good opportunity to set before them the fact that we too have a public to whom we have to explain the results of the negotiations and whom we have to win over."
"The process of adapting to the European Union's rules, the acquis communautaire, must be proceeded with."
"This Parliament makes a good lobby for enlargement, but the conditions - including the financial ones - have to be right."
"Enlargement is, then, not a charitable act or a work of mercy."
"It is an attempt at constructing a shared Europe, and that on the basis of the European Union's progress to date, which has been the result of shared political endeavour."
"It is about reversing the effects of Yalta."
"It is also about overturning the wartime and post-war order, and I believe that to be in the interests of all of us."
"To take an actual example, I do think that the Czech Republic, too, should be able to examine the past in a critical light and look to the future, just as everyone else should refrain from making political capital out of post-war events that, while comprehensible, are very much open to criticism."
"If we can convince both sides of this, then we can really build a new future."
"I turn now to Turkey, a country which, during the summer, enacted a range of measures to set in motion real progress towards the rule of law and fully-fledged democracy."
"Admittedly, the legal measures do not go far enough and have not yet been put into effect, but the government has declared its willingness to do so and also wants to demonstrate its European orientation and its acceptance of the European norm whereby religion and the state are kept separate."
"Most of all, we look to this government to resolved the Cyprus problem."
"Mr Elles, I consider it a dangerous initiative at this stage to do as one amendment proposes and put Turkey's chair outside the door and talk only in terms of a special relationship."
"Both Muslim citizens and citizens of Turkish descent have a place in the European Union."
"I do not believe that we can decide today whether there are to be actual negotiations with Turkey or when they should take place."
"It is very much in the interest of all of us to encourage Turkey, and to demonstrate that Islam and a modern democracy can be put on an equal footing, and I reject anything that might be understood to be a disincentive to them to do so."
"I will conclude by saying that I was in the Balkans at the beginning of this week, where I saw how enlargement evokes in people a degree of fear - fear of being left out, fear of being left behind."
"I ask the Commission and the Council to consider how, in the course of the next six months, they can generate signals that show that the Balkans will have a part in the enlargement process - not today, not tomorrow, but perhaps the day after that, if they do as the candidate countries have done and fulfil the same requirements."
"It would be a very positive step to send them a clear signal to this effect!"
"Mr President, the Cypriot accession will only have truly succeeded once we have seen a profound reconciliation of Greeks and Turks."
"Thankfully the proposals of Kofi Annan seem to be a sound constitutional basis for such a reconciliation."
"The package borrows cleverly from the Swiss model of the system of government and the Belgian model for European relations."
"What is now upon the table seems the best possible deal that the Turkish Cypriots can ever expect."
"It provides them with the status of legal and political equality and protects their interests as the smaller community."
"It commits the refounded Republic of Cyprus to supporting membership for Turkey itself and its transitional arrangements seem to be able to satisfy most of the demands concerning property, residency and self-esteem."
"Mr Erdogan, Mr Simitis, Mr Clerides and Mr Denktash must now prepare themselves to take a dramatic step towards integration and reconciliation and reject partition and revenge."
"Mr President, for the first time in history, we are gradually unifying the continent."
"It has never once been unified."
"However, for the time being, the debate is merely about geographically extending rather than deepening the Union, which is why we actually want the Union."
"Political union, economic union, common social policy, integrated ecological intervention here and throughout the world, these are the real reasons we want the Union and I hope and believe in my heart of hearts that our honourable friends from the candidate countries want the same, rather than to discuss other, more minor considerations."
"However, now that we are talking about enlargement, what enlargement really needs is equal treatment and respect for the dignity of others."
"And it does not always get it."
"We have not emphasised sufficiently, I think, even though it is in our resolution, that the unfair arrangement for the number of Members from Hungary and the Czech Republic must be removed as quickly as possible."
"It is absurd from every angle."
"I mean what are we doing, penny pinching?"
"It is beyond me."
"It is equally clear that, if enlargement is to succeed, it needs a clear time frame."
"Turkey has a right to know what the time frame is for its relations with the European Union."
"Bulgaria and Romania have the same right."
"Commissioner and Mr President-in-Office, the countries in the black hole in the Balkans have the same right and we say nothing about them, despite the fact that, whichever way you look at it, they are even closer, they are right at the centre of the continent of Europe."
"Finally, to Cyprus."
"The time appears to have come for serious negotiation of a political solution."
"We must support these negotiations."
"We must hope they turn out well."
"However, one thing must be made clear, clearer perhaps than what we have heard here."
"No solution can be advocated or accepted which permanently deviates from the acquis communautaire."
"Transitional arrangements are one thing, and every country has experienced them at some point during enlargement, but they apply for a specific period of time and they have an expiry date."
"So if we want to move forward, we have to make that clear to all the interested parties."
"Otherwise, I think we shall undermine an endeavour which augurs very well for the future."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, although the start of the peaceful reunification of Europe was symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall, we now know from yesterday's Foreign Affairs Council meeting that it is on 1 May 2004 that the EU will enlarge towards the first ten candidate countries."
"We also know, however, that the transition, or rather the process of transforming the economies of the countries concerned, will take much longer."
"I shall simply point out that the official unemployment rate in a country such as Poland stands at 17% and that, in the year 2000, Poland's per capita GDP was equivalent to just 39% of the Community average."
"Therefore, with regard to the transition process, I am hearing many of my fellow Members stress - and they are certainly right to do so - all the conditions that the candidate countries must still fulfil."
"For my part, Mr President-in-Office, I would like to ask you a very direct and very specific question about what the Council will do in response to the requests made last Friday in Warsaw by the governments of the ten candidate countries."
"I admit that I am no expert in this area, but I believe that their demands are perfectly legitimate: a financial package to generate macro-economic stability, a net financial situation which must be improved not just for 2004, but for 2004 to 2006 as well and, lastly, the full use of the Berlin budgetary facility."
"In my view, these demands are quite legitimate."
"Fearing, therefore, that I did indeed hear the Danish Prime Minister say this morning that he was not intending to renege on the positions adopted at the Brussels European Council, I would like to know exactly if, in response to the legitimate demands of the ten candidate country governments, you are going to make a better offer than the one made in Brussels, or if you are going to stick with what was decided at that European Council."
"I believe that, in addition to the general points that you mention, there are specific demands that must be taken on board and which I feel have been articulated - I repeat - quite legitimately by the governments of the candidate countries."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this historic debate and I look forward to the day, which is now just around the corner, when the representatives of each of the candidate countries will exercise their full rights as Members of this House and in each of the institutions of the European Union."
"I welcome in particular the confirmation by the Council of Foreign Affairs Ministers yesterday in Brussels of the full participation of the new Member States in shaping the Treaty that will follow the Convention."
"One of the key negotiating chapters remaining open relates to agriculture."
"The conclusions of the recent Brussels European Council clearly rule out any negotiation on the Berlin Agreement and Agenda 2000."
"This is the framework in which we must move forward to conclude the agricultural negotiations with the candidate countries."
"It is in the interests of all those countries which support a strong agricultural policy, be they existing or future Member States, to see the fastest possible integration into the common agricultural policy."
"Mr President, I would like to address my first comment to you personally."
"I have a formal complaint to make, and I could just as easily do that in the form of a point of order."
"This point of order relates to Rule 117, which provides for the equal treatment of the Union's languages."
"Where equal treatment is not possible, on the display screens for example, a long-established consistent approach is used whereby we would at least use the language of the country in which we are sitting, so here in Strasbourg, we would use French."
"Since yesterday afternoon, however, everyone can see that, on every additional display screen installed in the Chamber for the benefit of the new arrivals, the future members, only one language is used, that is, English."
"Many of us are upset about this, not just the French Members, I would add, but also MEPs of all nationalities, who do not want English to become the sole language of Europe."
"I also noted down, only last night, ladies and gentlemen, a comment made by a fellow Member from Spain which was that the new members will think that they are joining not the European Union, but the Federation of the United States of America."
"I would ask you to forward this complaint to Parliament's Presidency."
"It is also this fear that I wanted to express to you, on behalf of nine French members of my group, but also on behalf of many fellow Members."
"Are we sure that, by joining the European Union, in the form that it is, increasingly, assuming with each passing day, the candidate countries are entering Europe?"
"Are we sure that they are not, in actual fact, relinquishing part of their European soul, through which they have often created the most fertile cultures?"
"Are we sure that they are not victims of an intricate illusion and that, ultimately, they are not about to leave Europe to join an Atlantic universe, where differences, cultures, languages and, ultimately, the European heritage - with which they, like us, have been endowed - will be wiped out?"
"The fact is that they belong to Europe; there is no need for this to be acknowledged because they have belonged, naturally belonged, to Europe for centuries."
"It must be clearly understood that they are European countries even if they do not join the European Union: we could even say that, if they do not join, they will without doubt be even more European than if they do."
"In actual fact, the question is not the enlargement of Europe, which was carried out long ago; it is the enlargement of the European Union, in other words an organisation which is something entirely different and can even sometimes be the exact opposite."
"It is out of friendship for these people that I am saying this to them, on behalf of many French people - I even think it is the majority of French people - who are opposed to this dreadful and virtually totalitarian idea of so-called European integration."
"My dear friends of the East, you are giving up your souls, your heritage, your cultures, your freedoms and, ultimately, your very interests and nothing is more telling, at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, than the linguistic aspect that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech."
"I shall also take this opportunity to complain to the Commission, represented here by Mr Verheugen, that, last February, it asked the candidate countries to communicate in English during the negotiation process."
"This linguistic problem is a sign."
"The omnipresence of English points clearly to the trap: it is so very, very unfortunate, my friends from the countries of the East, that you are leaving one empire only to join another."
"Thank you Mr Coûteaux."
"As far as your comments are concerned, may I assure you that everything you said has been noted in accordance with the relevant rule of procedure and will be examined by Parliament's services."
"Mr President, on behalf of my colleagues from the MPF delegation, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the States that will soon be joining the Union, and in doing so, rejoining their natural family, the great European family from which they were separated by Communism."
"It is in this spirit that we shall adopt the Brok report."
"I would like to take this opportunity to express one regret and voice one hope."
"First of all, I regret that it has taken so long to re-integrate Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall, even though European integration is so clearly part of the values of our civilisation, of the Christian heritage that we share."
"Today, two other countries, Romania and Bulgaria, are not able to join Europe for some years."
"So, why not send them a signal now, why not allow them to join without waiting for the Treaty on European Union in the strict sense, which would not pose a problem since it is a flexible intergovernmental treaty rather than a treaty on the Community?"
"Secondly, we are also voicing a great hope."
"We shall construct the new Europe together."
"If things continue in the same way as at present, we could soon have a super-State that seeks to make everything centralised and uniform, which disregards national democracies."
"It is a real danger."
"Furthermore, this morning again, we heard from those who believe that, after enlargement, we will need a tighter central locking system in order to respond to the greater diversity."
"Like us, many of the soon-to-be new member states condemn this tendency."
"We would rather invent a new, diverse, more flexible Europe where there is more freedom and that is based on a respect for the national democracies."
"This morning, we heard a representative from Lithuania express concern about what would happen to Lithuania's decision-making freedom when it would be represented by eight MEPs in a European Parliament with 732 members."
"This is a legitimate question that many countries, even the largest, should ask themselves."
"The only way to prevent democracy being diluted in the future, to avoid the impression of no longer controlling anything, is to increase the involvement of the national parliaments in the European decision-making process by giving them a genuine right to say 'yes' or 'no' to their countries taking part in this or that decision."
"In order to achieve this more free and more democratic Europe, Mr President, those who value the freedom of their countries, those who value their national democracy, and therefore those who value the true Europe should unite to defend their values."
"Mr President, this is the eve of another remarkable event: the birth of the new Europe."
"The institutional reforms that it is the task of the Convention and the IGC to achieve, not least in order to reduce the risks and increase the opportunities for the citizens, are only the final, essential step before the reunification of our continent."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we citizens of the Union must not underestimate the historic importance of this event."
"At last, after 70 years, the countries of Eastern Europe are being invited to become part of a major new leading force in international politics."
"In actual fact, this is not enlargement."
"Rather, we prefer to talk about unification, for the peoples of the Union are being reunited with the peoples of the former Soviet empire, who were isolated from the area of freedom, peace and progress by the Stalinist superstate."
"I hope that, in the Europe of the future, they will be able to continue to speak their languages, just as we want to continue to speak ours."
"They are just as European as we are. Prague, Warsaw and Budapest, and Sofia and Bucharest too are just as much European cities as Rome, Athens, Paris, Madrid or London."
"I would point out, if I may, Mr President, as a citizen of Rome, that Europe has roots in Istanbul too, in the ancient city of Constantinople, the capital of the Roman empire in the East."
"That brings us to the subject of Turkey."
"I am firmly of the opinion that we must set a date before the end of 2003 for the start of Turkey's accession process."
"If we were to close the doors to this country, which did a great deal to protect Europe during the Cold War, that would be an error that would ultimately encourage the growth of Islamic fundamentalism."
"Turkish democracy has made a great deal of progress - with the abolition of the death penalty, for instance - although a great deal certainly still remains to be done."
"We Europeans have a duty to help this country. We have a duty to facilitate this journey towards the new Europe of the future."
"Let us hope that Copenhagen sends out a positive signal to this effect."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the enlargement of Europe brings us face to face with the historic question: we talk of enlarging Europe, but what exactly do we mean by Europe?"
"I think that to interpret the Union as a reinstatement of a geographical entity would be excessively mechanistic."
"The European Union is, I think, a reinstatement of an historical reality which goes back three thousand years and which needs a new basis if it is to continue working."
"And all those who played a part during those three thousand years will, where they still exist, naturally have a place in modern-day Europe."
"I say this because questions have been raised recently as to whether Turkey qualifies as a European country on the basis of geographical criteria."
"But of course the criteria cannot be geographical."
"Turkey is, without question, part of our history."
"May I remind you that when the crisis in the Ottoman Empire reached its peak in the nineteenth century, the European powers referred to the Sultan as 'the sick man of Europe', not the sick man of the Middle East or the sick man of Asia Minor."
"What stands in Turkey's way is not its lack of European credentials, but its lack of democratic credentials and its expansionist foreign policy."
"Today there is cause for hope on both these fronts."
"The recent elections were another example of the Turkish Republic showing willing and demonstrated that a real, fundamental change of government is possible."
"All that remains to be seen is if permanent changes will be introduced which will consolidate democracy in Turkey and help satisfy the Copenhagen criteria."
"And, provided that the Copenhagen criteria are met, there will be no further obstacle to Turkey's becoming a member of the European Union."
"As for the second issue, its aggressive, militaristic foreign policy, here too there is a criterion and that criterion is, of course, a resolution to the Cyprus problem, the occupation of northern Cyprus by the Turkish army."
"If, as it has been asked to do in European Parliament resolutions, Turkey really wants to help resolve the Cyprus problem on the basis of the UN Secretary-General's most recent plan, then it will start backing off in its foreign policy as well."
"This will bring about a peaceful revolution in this area, which will be especially valuable to Turkey, which has more need than anyone to carve out a democratic future for itself at last."
"Mr President, the main question that came to the fore during today's debate was to what extent the candidate countries are ready for accession."
"We regret that the question as to whether the European Union is ready for it has not been addressed, or, if at all, only in passing."
"In the euphoria of the moment, we should not be blind to the various problem areas."
"I think that the main problem remains the funding of enlargement and, inherently linked to this, the reform of agricultural policy."
"I still regret that the necessary reform has been postponed to 2007."
"I also regret that it will be only in 2013 that farmers in the new Member States will receive the same treatment as do those in the present European Union."
"Current European agricultural policy, linking subsidy to production, is indefensible and unacceptable."
"It creates surpluses, keeps food prices high, damages the environment and is also detrimental to farmers in the developing world."
"I think that we as Parliament should therefore continue to support Commissioner Fischler in his endeavours to achieve swift and thorough reforms in agricultural policy, with the subsidies being redirected to rural development and to the new Member States."
"We must avoid a two-speed Europe at all costs, with one speed for the rich countries of the current EU, which cling onto their privileges like grim death, and another for the poor countries among the new Member States which have the same duties but not, unfortunately, the same rights."
"Mr President, the extraordinary debate has made it even more apparent how diverse are both the viewpoints on the process of enlarging the European Union and also the problems of its future form."
"Some things are seen as the report depicts them, but many get more critical treatment than they do in the report."
"Certain things were said which cannot go without criticism; when Europe's borders are at issue, anyone who simply casts doubt on everything done at Yalta and Potsdam, should know what he is doing."
"It is perhaps no disaster for an announcement to be made about the deferral of the deadline for accession, but elections to the European Parliament are to be held a few weeks after that, and it will be the Fifteen alone who will decide on the results of the Convention."
"Above all, there are reasons of form and content for deferring the deadline."
"The problems still to be resolved are trickier than had been assumed."
"So it is that Poland and other states expect support for agriculture to be reconsidered and that they will not achieve parity before 2013."
"Fears that a first- and second-class EU could come into being have not been dispelled."
"Such fears are the natural reaction to great concessions being demanded of the candidates whilst there has been little or no negotiation of the transitional periods that are required."
"Commissioner Verheugen has understandable complexes if he expects MEPs to digest 6 000 pages of text in order to confirm accession."
"We should, however, be asking ourselves what we expect of the citizens of the future EU if they have to deal with the same amount."
"It is incumbent on parliaments - the national parliaments and our own - to put our finger on what is wrong and demand an approach that will secure stability and equality and prevent us ending up going round in endless circles."
"Mr President, this morning, I think that we indeed witnessed an historic moment, as all my fellow Members have said, when we welcomed our counterparts from the candidate States."
"I should like to raise a minor point, namely that of the interpreting."
"Instead of 11 official languages, we now have 20."
"This is a considerable step forward."
"We must congratulate the interpreting services, which have provided interpretation despite the testing technical conditions."
"As a native Catalan, it is my hope that, in the future, my language, which is spoken by 10 million European citizens, may also be recognised in this Chamber."
"I wanted to make this comment whilst we are examining the Brok report."
"With regard to the aforementioned report, one of the Copenhagen criteria stipulates that the Member States must respect minorities and national minorities in particular, and highlights some of the progress which has been made by the candidate states."
"This must be welcomed."
"The report neglects to tackle some of the difficult points, however."
"For example, I know that in some of the candidate States, administrative cuts have been implemented in such a way as to dilute the national minorities, whereas in other candidate countries, conditions are being imposed with regard to the formation of political parties in such a way that minorities cannot form one."
"And, lastly, there is the problem of the Bene? decrees which unjustly exploited these minorities in 1945, a crying injustice, which is still an issue today and which must one day be rectified."
"It is true, Mr President, it is true that, before we start giving lectures, we should take a look at ourselves."
"When I say 'we', I mean the Member States."
"For example, could a State which today refuses to ratify the European Charter of Linguistic Rights join Europe?"
"This is a question that we could ask, like many others, and that is why I believe that we must assess the Copenhagen criteria with a degree of indulgence and throw the doors of our Europe wide open."
"Thank you."
"Your comments have been noted."
"Mr President, we have not been sparing in our criticism of enlargement and we have often expressed concern, including in the Chamber of the European Parliament, at the problems it poses for the labour market - with the risk that it could upset the balance of the system of small and medium-sized businesses in Padania with very dangerous consequences - and at the fears, which we see properly addressed in the Brok report, that the inadequate legislation and the political traditions of some of these countries may mean that the necessary facilities are not in place or there are insufficient facilities to provide effective protection against the expansion of financial and Mafia crime."
"We do, however, want to take this opportunity to welcome and extend a brotherly hand to the free peoples who succeeded in preserving their cultural identity even through the terrible years of Communist oppression, who are joining Europe, just as we did ourselves, certainly not in order to accept, after so many years of dictatorship, the diktats of the standardisation imposed by globalisation or of political correctness, or to be subjected to centralism once again."
"We are counting on them to help us in these battles, to help us preserve the Christian nature of the Europe of the peoples and regions which we are trying to create."
"As regards the extremely sensitive subject of Turkey - which has been emerging at intervals throughout this debate, never far from the surface - we want to emphasise strongly the courage of the chairman, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, who has caused a ripple in the waters of the often over-cautious debate on European politics, stating the plain facts as they are, as we all know them to be, as is clear from all the history books studied by all the students of all European countries, namely that Turkey is not part of Europe historically, geographically or politically and that it does not satisfy the political accession criteria laid down at Copenhagen on human rights, fundamental freedoms or even freedom of religion."
"This is a country, a regime which has yet to resolve the historical issue of the annihilation, the holocaust of the Armenian people and which has made still less progress in terms of recognising the rights of the Kurdish minority, it is a country which it is legitimate to define, with all possible respect and all necessary diplomacy, as a kind of Mediterranean Columbia: it is home to one of the most dangerous Mafia groups which organises drug trafficking at international level."
"In other words, we feel that political union with Turkey is out of the question, not least in that, if Turkey were to become part of Europe, the European Union would then have direct borders with Iraq, Iran and Syria."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council - I should also have been pleased to greet the Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to concentrate on a topic that has already been mentioned, but I should like to address it in a markedly different way."
"I think that we, as the European Parliament, must seriously ask ourselves how we intend to deal with such an important country as Turkey in the long term."
"I think we have to give very serious answers to a few questions here."
"The first question is, do we really want to hold up a mirror to Turkey's progress reports year after year and say to it: sorry, you're not ready yet?"
"Do we want to permanently tolerate a situation where the European Union's common foreign and security policy is handicapped by being unable to make use of NATO resources because the Turks could potentially use that to blackmail us?"
"Before Turkey becomes a member or whether or not full membership of the European Union becomes a possibility, should we not rather be looking for answers to the question of how we can even today help the European Union to build special relations with Turkey, thus enabling us to seriously address all the questions that we need to answer jointly, quite specifically in the field of foreign and security policy?"
"I therefore call on my fellow Members to give very serious thought to this issue and then perhaps after all to accept the PPE-DE motion on this very subject and vote in favour of it."
"I am referring to Amendment No 7, which says that we must start building a special relationship with Turkey now so that we can solve all our common problems together."
"We should not wait until Turkey's situation in regard to human rights, democracy, and so on, is such that it can seriously be regarded as a candidate country. I should be pleased if this House would support this urgent matter so that we can achieve good cooperation with this important part of Europe."
"Mr President, although we meet together this afternoon as representatives of the Member States , our concern is obviously for our friends, the candidate countries."
"This morning's meeting was a wonderful and very positive symbol."
"However, the job is not finished."
"Like everyone, I hope that the negotiations will finish in the next few weeks and that they will have a positive outcome."
"In this respect, I regret the importance given over to financial concerns."
"Far from advocating a wasteful attitude - I am certainly not supporting the idea of reckless spending - our governments and ourselves must show some generosity and vision."
"'Realpolitik' is not necessarily synonymous with greed."
"There is a risk that inadequate budgets will hamper reforms in Central Europe and we may pay a high price for this in the future."
"The accession of our friends to the EU will not spell an end to the difficulties."
"My main concern is for public opinion and the state of mind of others."
"Thus, in our countries, there is still a great deal to do so that our citizens understand the profound meaning of the EU enlargement."
"For now, they are more or less blinded by complicated calculations and, ultimately, cannot see the wood for the trees."
"I fear that there is a degree of confusion in the candidate countries over what the European Union really is, over its fundamental objectives and what it means to have a will to live together whilst consenting to sovereignty being genuinely delegated."
"For countries that are fervently attached to their independence and their freedom, becoming a member of the European Union is a very beneficial - and I am not a Eurosceptic - but very considerable step."
"I regret that the negotiations, based on the Copenhagen criteria, have somewhat neglected this aspect of things, the greatest part being devoted to the technical, and particularly, the economic aspects of the dossier."
"Following accession, however, we must continue our work to enlighten and convince people throughout the enlarged EU."
"As the Commissioner himself said earlier, this subject is not simply about technical issues, it is also about our soul."
"Mr President, with the enlargement of the European Union the border we share with Russia will lengthen and we will have several new neighbours."
"Our new neighbours are also likely to apply for membership and enlargement will continue."
"It is very important for us all that our external border is both open and secure."
"No new barriers must be put up in Europe that would be a hindrance to relations and cooperation with other countries."
"We also have to level out the economic and social differences that exist between the Member States and our neighbouring countries."
"This is especially important for Member States situated on external borders."
"As enlargement proceeds we have to establish a new policy for a larger Europe, one that incorporates both bilateral relations with our present and future neighbours and developments in multilateral cooperation, for example, within the context of the Council of Europe and the EEC."
"This morning some Members of the European Parliament were trying to lecture Members of Parliament of the new Member States, saying they must be prepared to give up their own country's right of self-determination and accept that the Union will develop into a supranational federation."
"I do not agree with such points of view."
"An enlarging Union must be a democratic confederation of independent states led by a Council of Ministers that represents the Member States."
"Mr President, these are without doubt important times."
"This is an important session, a report with many positive points by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and a very important time for one of the candidate countries, Cyprus."
"I think that, although there may be good prospects, there are also question marks."
"I have two questions."
"The first is addressed to the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Haarder."
"Mr President-in-Office, there are two parallel procedures here, the integration procedure and the negotiation procedure based on the plan put forward by the UN Secretary-General, who is using the Copenhagen Summit as a cut-off point and one of whose conditions is that both sides sign up to the original version of his plan."
"Yesterday was the deadline for a verbal reply; the Republic of Cyprus has said yes but there has been no reply from the Turkish-Cypriot side, perhaps because Mr Denktash is ill."
"My question is this: if this state of affairs continues, by which I mean if there is no reply from the Turkish-Cypriot side and this uncertainty persists, can the presidency of the Council assure us that the first decision taken at the Copenhagen Summit will be the decision to integrate the Republic of Cyprus on the basis of the Helsinki resolutions?"
"My second question is addressed to Mr Verheugen, who is absent, which is somewhat unusual."
"He is generally punctilious in attending our sessions."
"I trust that his colleague will pass my question on to him."
"The Annan plan, which contains a number of interesting points, places quantitative restrictions on the right of establishment, on property rights and on the right to elect and be elected of the citizens of both sides, who may apply them for ever, not just for a transitional period. For ever!"
"That is a violation of the acquis communautaire."
"A Finnish national, for example, will have more rights in the Greek-Cypriot state than a Turkish Cypriot and a Portuguese national will have more rights in the Turkish-Cypriot state than a Greek Cypriot."
"This is clearly at odds with the acquis communautaire."
"Does the Commission intend - and I should like a reply to this question from Mr Verheugen when he arrives - to intervene in a positive and constructive manner in order to ensure that the Annan plan is in line rather than at odds with the acquis communautaire?"
"Mr President, I have had the privilege of working for the past three years on the EU-Lithuania Joint Parliamentary Committee, where we have had to deal with several difficult issues which have already been mentioned, so I will not repeat them."
"The determination of the candidate countries to overcome these problems and work positively has resulted in incredible progress."
"For a small country like Wales, which I represent, it is also significant that many other small countries will be represented here in the European Parliament in their own right."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants a Europe in which these small nations and regions play a significant role and where, at a future date, countries like Wales will have the same rights as our friends from the ten candidate countries."
"They must ensure that there is respect for minorities and that further steps are taken towards regionalisation."
"Europe is becoming more diverse, not just economically and socially but also linguistically, culturally and politically, and we welcome this."
"We must work towards a real Europe of the peoples, with equal rights and equal respect for everyone."
"Mr President, paragraph 46 of the report calls on the Council's Working Party on Nuclear Safety to report to Parliament on the implementation of safety measures for Temelin before accession negotiations are concluded."
"This requirement is proper and important because the operators are currently not even satisfying key minimum safety requirements such as renovation of the much discussed 28.8 m level."
"The much criticised quality of unsafe valves has not been improved either."
"The pipes still do not have a second protective coating as European standards require."
"The first protective coating is inadequate in any case."
"The Temelin nuclear power station does not therefore at all satisfy the conditions laid down by the Council working party as agreed in the Melk Process."
"If this is disregarded, the Commission's attempt, early this month, to create new safety standards for nuclear power stations can be considered a failure from the outset."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Members of this Parliament and colleagues from the candidate countries, may I extend a particularly warm welcome to our Latvian colleagues who were elected to their country's new parliament early in October this year."
"I welcome them so warmly because I have felt very involved in their efforts and in their work for many years."
"On days like today I ask myself - and I am sure I am not the only one to do so - what has particularly impressed me about the enlargement process in the last few years."
"Of the very many remarkable achievements, one is very seldom acknowledged."
"Many reports by the Commission or Parliament contain a short sentence that is pregnant with meaning - a sentence that rarely receives comment and where the attention paid to it bears no relation to its significance."
"That sentence reads quite simply - and it applies to all ten candidate countries: 'The political conditions for accession are satisfied.'"
"That means the first and for me the most important accession criterion formulated in Copenhagen is not an obstacle."
"I do not take this fundamental assessment for granted."
"We ought to express our appreciation to all our colleagues in the parliaments and governments of the candidate countries for having stuck fast to democratic principles even in difficult situations."
"The cultivation of democratic relations cannot be taken for granted in times of upheaval and reorientation, in times of enormous economic problems and radical changes in circumstances."
"After decades of dictatorship, the people have shown what the political priority must be: democracy and freedom take precedence; they must be cherished and safeguarded."
"Mr President, we have arrived at a crucial milestone in the history of Europe."
"I think that all of us experienced a pleasant buzz during this morning's meeting."
"From 1 May 2004, the Community will include no fewer than 25 countries."
"Almost the whole of Europe will now be united as a community."
"Ten candidate countries have essentially completed their preparations for membership."
"It has been a demanding and often painful process for these countries."
"They have still to develop the administrative and judicial capacity needed for implementing and complying with EU legislation in purely practical terms, for example in the areas of agriculture, food and the environment."
"That also applies at regional and local levels."
"One of the things I believe is that it is important for there, in actual practice, to be compliance in all the sectors with the requirements for the integration of environmental and health protection."
"That especially applies within agriculture and within infrastructure development."
"It is a requirement that applies not only up until the accession of the new Member States but also, and most significantly of all of course, after that date."
"Within the framework established as recently as at the Brussels Summit in October, the conditions of accession are now finally to be agreed for each individual new Member State."
"What is fundamentally required in the negotiations is a high degree of flexibility, as well as of solidarity both with the candidate countries and, reciprocally, between the Member States."
"We must see to it that the new Member States are guaranteed fair conditions of competition so that their accession to the EU can make a positive contribution to the development of the countries' prosperity."
"Moreover, I say this partly because only a positive and convincing endorsement by people at the forthcoming referendums will put this important enlargement in the proper perspective."
"I am convinced that the Danish Presidency and Commissioner Verheugen have the flexibility and the attitude of solidarity that will make it possible in Copenhagen to take the final decision on accession for each individual country, and if not on 12 December, then on 13 December."
"Mr President, the youngest generation can hardly imagine a continent rent asunder and the permanent threat of war between East and West."
"The people of Central Europe cut down the barbed wire themselves and, since then, the candidate countries have made significant progress."
"Despite this, we should not underestimate the amount of work that still needs to be done in the areas of good governance, corruption, human trafficking and minorities."
"Today's celebration marks the beginning of the home stretch, but the finish is not in sight for another two years."
"It is disappointing that some parties, such as the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) in the Netherlands, should seize upon enlargement as a means of regaining voters by exploiting public fears."
"These people are being badly informed."
"Responsible politicians point out not only the problems of enlargement, but also its great benefits."
"Populism is the new epidemic, which must be fought with liberal means and should not be encouraged."
"The European Union is itself incapable of preparing effectively for enlargement."
"The very narrow-minded French national self-interest makes the implementation of agricultural reforms impossible ."
"Moreover, a division on the subject of Turkey's accession is once again looming in Europe and in this Parliament."
"The invites have been sent; neither Giscard nor the Pope can retrieve these now from the post boxes, but it is too early to set a date for the start of the negotiations."
"We refuse to join forces with a country that still condones torture."
"For the coming generations, the greatest threats are outside our continent; here, peace appears to be guaranteed."
"Mr President, I have often, in this Assembly, had the opportunity to quote from the excellent Norwegian handbook for mountaineers."
"The eminently simple message is that, in the event of discrepancies between the map and the terrain, it is the terrain which should be followed."
"There are many examples, both in this House and in the European Union as a whole, of this fundamental rule's not being taken note of."
"Life goes on behind a veil of illusion, and the most striking example I have experienced is probably, in fact, this debate."
"None of the fundamental problems of what is termed eastward enlargement has been solved."
"On the one hand, there is no doubt that the economic realities will entail our maintaining the tradition, going back many years, of Western European exploitation of our Eastern European neighbours, involving differences in wages, differences in capital and so on. On the other hand, the adjustment taking place is an expression of the demand for an infrastructure, which was referred to by my fellow countryman Torben Lund and which is a long way from being in place."
"What is required is simply unfeasible."
"Let me just add that our excellent Minister for Europe is a terrific songwriter but that songwriting ability is not enough in this context."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this is an exceptional day for the nations of Europe, for we are undertaking - during peacetime - a process of enlargement, nay, of reunification which could not have been contemplated during the last century."
"It is a unique moment and an opportunity for everyone, members and future members of the Union alike, as Europe's history and diversity enshrine some fundamental values."
"Europe is at a crossroads."
"It has a larger population, it is more powerful and has more solidarity - it can still change world order."
"This Europe is capable, as long as it has the strength and the courage to do so, to put the individual back at the heart of the planet, to integrate the social and environmental dimension in all its decisions."
"The plan for sustainable development based on solidarity must be affirmed as the Union's objective."
"Together we will succeed."
"Europe will be what we make of it: either an average power, entrenched in its egoisms - the egoisms of nations that have provided the countries involved in enlargement with only EUR 25 million whereas the Marshall Plan granted them EUR 97 million, or a Union promoting its political, social and environmental values."
"For my part, ladies and gentlemen, I believe in the future that we are shaping, particularly with regard to the considerable efforts on the part of the candidate countries."
"It is our turn to put our words into action."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to deal only with the subject of internal security, because this security is very valuable to us, to the citizens of the European Union just as much as to the European Union as an economic location."
"One of our objectives with enlargement must be to gain more security by having a common strategy, a common policy in fighting against corruption, international crime, illegal immigration, and the like."
"All the candidate countries have made tremendous efforts in the preparation process to bring internal security up to a high standard."
"The European Union has been actively helping them in this with various programmes."
"The Commission makes an annual review of the progress made."
"Some have made a great deal of progress, while others sadly still have ground to make up."
"Without naming any countries, I should like to draw attention to some of these shortcomings."
"At one point in this report we read that increased efforts are needed to fight corruption and economic crime, which continue to give cause for serious concern."
"Or that there are still deficits in the approximation of laws in the area of money laundering or the protection of financial interests."
"Further on it says that particular attention needs to be paid to combating drugs and smuggling, fraud, corruption and organised crime, or that efforts to combat organised crime must be stepped up."
"These are quite specific points that show where individual candidate countries still have to make enormous efforts."
"As the candidate countries are represented here today, I call on you all to do everything to remedy the shortcomings that still exist and to ensure that the enlarged Union remains a union of security."
"I am sure that, with all the support you are receiving, you really will be able to work off these deficits and reach the objectives."
"That would be in the interests of us all."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, together with Mr Oostlander I have for many years now had the privilege of following the accession process from the point of view of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"The written report says what still now remains to be done."
"Unlike Mr Pirker, I should like to emphasise the tremendous progress that all the candidate countries have made in this area that is as broad as it is difficult - and in which they have also been supported by the Commission and our Member States: the abolition of the death penalty, which still existed at least in the laws of a few candidate countries, discrimination against various minorities, Russian minorities for example, the improved integration of Roma minorities, the construction of a democratic police and democratic criminal prosecution authorities and other important authorities in the justice and administration sector and much more besides has been achieved by really unparalleled efforts."
"This has been the case in all the candidate countries, to a greater or lesser extent to be sure, but it is particularly true of the Czech Republic, which is particularly close to my heart."
"I therefore find it all the more regrettable that the present Austrian Government is showing no recognition of the positive things that have been achieved and that at least one of our ruling parties is trying to win votes for itself with anti-Czech slogans in the current election campaign."
"They are of course focusing on the past again."
"I hope that after Sunday's elections we will have a government in Austria that makes the common future of the Czech Republic and Austria central and stands in the way neither of the enlargement nor of the deepening of the European Union."
"Mr President, this is a period when we confirm the end to historic divisions."
"Firstly I would like to say a word about Cyprus and urge a positive response from the Turkish Cypriot authorities to the Annan plan."
"I realise that Mr Denktash is sadly still very unwell, but it must be possible to signal agreement on this plan as the basis for negotiation."
"I know the majority of Turkish Cypriots want that positive response."
"Secondly, I urge support for Amendment No 24 to the report, tabled by the ELDR Group."
"This calls for the transformation of the accession monitoring process into a system of mutual peer review applicable to all Member States, old and new."
"This would ensure respect for democratic accountability, integrity of public administration, non-discrimination, civil liberties and the rule of law."
"We need to invest money, time and effort in our systems of democracy and justice throughout the European Union."
"The existing 15 Member States are certainly not perfect and we need to invest at least as much as we do in our agriculture."
"We spend a lot of time talking about agriculture and structural funds."
"We need to spend at least as much time talking about the underpinnings of democracy and justice in all our Member States, through mutually constructive evaluation."
"Mr President, I am in favour of the enlargement of the European Union to include the whole of geographical Europe and beyond, but if the major powers that dominate the European Union enlarge it, it is not out of generosity."
"Their industrial and financial groups have already got a grip on the economy of Eastern European countries and enlargement is the ideal means whereby this grip may be tightened."
"Accession to the European Union will not protect the workers of these countries against unemployment that is already high, the low wages or the reduction of social protection schemes and will not prevent peasant farmers from being driven from their land."
"These countries will not be integrated into the European Union as equals, but as subordinates subject to the decisions of the major powers and the domination of large employers in France, Germany or England."
"The workers will have to work for Western companies, earning noticeably less than the already inadequate salaries of their Western counterparts ."
"Furthermore, it is indeed scandalous to note that, for several years, the citizens of these countries will not be able to enjoy the same rights to movement and settlement enjoyed by current EU citizens."
"That is why when these countries join the European Union, I shall welcome the workers and the working classes and express the hope that in future struggles to change our lot, we shall be fighting side by side."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in general I welcome Mr Brok's report."
"I also want to say thank you for all the work that has been done by the Commission, the European Parliament and, especially, the candidate countries in order to make enlargement possible."
"Today, I nonetheless want to draw attention to the sustainable development strategy adopted by the Gothenburg Summit and also to the UN's environmental management programme adopted in Johannesburg."
"The EU has promised to take the lead in implementing this management programme."
"The trend towards ecologically sustainable development must now show itself in all the EU's policy areas and in all the plans and programmes aimed at meeting the need both for a change of direction in the EU and for environmental investment in the candidate countries."
"There must therefore be a considerable increase in the proportion of resources from the structural funds and from the common agricultural policy that are to be set aside for the environment."
"Up until 2006, approximately 10% of the structural funds are to be set aside for the purposes of environmental infrastructure, for example the cleansing of waste water."
"It is also necessary for environmental impact assessments to be made of the agricultural and structural policies, something that is also pointed out by the European Parliament."
"That comes into force in the Member States in 2003 and is absolutely necessary if we are to bring about sustainable development throughout the enlarged EU."
"Mr President, I warmly endorse this report and I would like in particular to speak on the issue of Turkey, given the recent unfortunate remarks by Mr Giscard d'Estaing."
"I consider these comments from the chairman of the Convention unacceptable and inappropriate."
"I take particular exception to his comment that people who backed Turkey's accession are 'the adversaries of the European Union'."
"I support Turkey's membership of the EU, but only on the basis that they fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"I do not subscribe to the narrow view that the Union is a 'Christian' club, I prefer to see it as a pluralist entity which reflects the diverse nature of the EU as it exists today, even before further expansion."
"I have always believed that Turkey's accession would provide an important bridgehead between the West and the Islamic world."
"Since 11 September this has become even more important."
"Eventual Turkish membership would demonstrate the ability of western democracy and culture to co-exist and fully cooperate with the Islamic world."
"The recent change in government in Turkey in no way alters my view."
"The people have spoken and we have to accept their verdict."
"I welcome the strong commitment given by AKP deputy leader Mr Abdullah Gul during his recent visit to Brussels to continue with the reform programme."
"However, before a date can be set for the commencement of negotiations for entry, further proof must be forthcoming that this reform programme is being implemented."
"Releasing political prisoners, ending torture, subjecting the security forces to the rule of law, respecting the rights of the Kurdish minority and other measures relating to the Copenhagen criteria are sure steps to securing the date for accession negotiations."
"Progress on this lies in the hands of the incoming administration in Turkey, not the EU."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities of the European Parliament, I should like to say that I am delighted that, as far as enlargement of the Union and laying the foundations for a real united Europe based on our common values is concerned, we have at last turned into the home straight."
"As we do so, I feel that the women of Europe have a very serious role to play and that it is high time, in the run up to the new constitutional Treaty of the European Union, that we placed respect for women's human rights and the practical application of the recognised principle of gender equality in all sectors of economic, social and political life in Europe at the top of the political agenda."
"Unfortunately, we are still a long way from this vision, as was perfectly clear during this morning's debate in the Chamber, when the list of speakers looked more like the membership list of a gentlemen's club to which women guests are occasionally invited."
"I am acutely concerned about the position of women in many of the candidate countries; their situation has not improved with the changeover to a free economy."
"Unemployment has risen and wage differentials have increased."
"Infrastructures for caring for children and the elderly are deteriorating, while trafficking in human beings, trading in women and children by international organised crime gangs, has taken on explosive proportions."
"We in the Committee on Women's Rights have repeatedly emphasised that efficiently applied measures to combat the sexual exploitation of and violence against women must be at the heart of the enlargement process."
"We would again point out that parties and governments need to promote the equal participation of men and women in decision-making procedures."
"There is no such thing as a credible policy which does not promote gender equality in decision-making procedures and future planning."
"Parties and governments should field the same number of men and women candidates in the 2004 European elections."
"Enlargement gives us the opportunity to sink the foundations of democracy even deeper."
"I am also convinced that gender equality is not a superfluous luxury; it is a basic necessity if we are to improve the quality of our decisions, improve our understanding of contemporary problems and make our democracy function more efficiently."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity, also on behalf of the Dutch Liberals, to express our support for the enlargement by the twelve countries with which negotiations are now under way. This is for historical reasons, which were repeated over and over again this morning, but also for political, economic and cultural reasons."
"We are in favour of enlargement, but I think that we should not further cover up the issue, which is made all the more pressing by the additional problems that the Big Bang will bring with it."
"Being a Member of the European Union is more difficult than becoming one."
"Most candidates seem to be making sufficient progress, but some of them have serious problems, particularly in the field of corruption, implementation of the acquis, administrative capacity and independent financial control."
"Whilst the Commission's progress reports are excellent, we are not yet convinced that the accession of all ten will be able to take place in 2004."
"We will evaluate this at the end of the negotiations."
"The Commission's regime of progress monitoring and safeguard clauses can sometimes provide the answer, but this fine instrument can only be deployed to a limited extent."
"In countries where the rule of law does not prevail, the safeguard clauses will not be of any help."
"What is the Commission's view on this?"
"After all, what does the EU stand for if essential principles such as the rule of law are not in place?"
"We take the view, moreover, that these conditions should apply not only to acceding countries, but also to the current Fifteen."
"A positive example is the report by Mr Jan Mulder in the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"This brings me to the final problem, that being that the EU's internal decision-making process is far from structured."
"We would like the forthcoming IGC to have an outcome that contributes to solving all kinds of bottlenecks, such as codecision of Parliament and the Council, public access to the Council's legislative meetings, repeal of the right of veto in the Council and the election of the President of the European Commission by the European Parliament or by the electorate."
"If, as in Nice, the IGC does not solve institutional bottlenecks, is there a plan B we can fall back on?"
"This is a question for the Council."
"At any rate, we should, above all, vote in favour of a fair-minded enlargement in April 2003."
"Mr President, talking of democracy and enlargement, I have just received a message that a journalist and members of Rifondazione have been expelled from Prague, where they had gone to take part in a demonstration against the enlargement of ????."
"I condemn this move."
"The European Union is neither a charitable institution nor the champion of prosperity and freedom for the people."
"It is a depressing mechanism for defending the interests of big business, it is the European outpost of the global imperialist system, which is hitting out at workers' rights and building up an army and repressive mechanisms to silence any opposition."
"The objective of enlargement is to fill the vacuum left when the socialist system was overturned in Europe, witness the cries of revenge heard in the Chamber today."
"The objective is also to strengthen the new bourgeoisie, fretting about its sovereignty as people become more and more aware of what they lost along with socialism."
"At the same time, NATO is being extended eastwards and taking on a more aggressive role with the full support of the United States."
"The nature of the European Union and the experience of the people in my country during 22 years of membership is such that we cannot conceal the truth from other people; we are compelled to warn them of the consequences of their incarceration."
"Despite expectations of prosperity cultivated by propaganda, the consequences of integration will be catastrophic for the economy of these countries, where production is still far lower than it was during the last years of socialism."
"The European Union already has a balance of trade surplus of EUR 30 billion a year, in other words instead of financing it is being financed."
"As far as Cyprus is concerned, it is common knowledge that the Annan plan, which has the full backing of the United States and the European Union, is a far cry from the framework of the UN resolutions and the cross-community agreements reached so far, which have been dumped in the bin."
"It is a disguised form of confederation, which will result in institutional recognition of partition and acceptance of the fait accompli of Turkish invasion and occupation."
"This fact has wider implications because it is tantamount to acceptance on the part of the UN itself of the use of military violence to achieve political aims and move borders."
"This development is the direct consequence of the procedure to integrate Cyprus into the European Union, the G8 resolution and the Helsinki resolution and our party warned of their consequences a very long time ago."
"It may well be the first time in the 84-year history of the Communist Party of Greece that we are unable to express satisfaction at the fact that our predictions have come true."
"Mr President, as a Pan-European it has been my privilege to work towards this great day since the 1970s."
"Otto von Habsburg was here today, he has been mentioned several times and I was able to accompany him all along the way."
"I celebrate this day, which is a great day for me."
"As the son of a Bohemian family, I am also glad that a member has spoken Czech here for the first time today, my friend Daniel Kroupa."
"He is in the tradition of that great social democrat Jiri Pelikan, who was here as a Czech in exile following the first direct elections of Members of the European Parliament."
"There have also, however, always been members of Bohemia's second ethnic group here, the Sudeten Germans."
"I am thinking of Volkmar Gabert and Egon Klepsch."
"I, too, am part of that tradition; we have always seen ourselves as Bohemia's ambassadors here."
"The Pan-European idea originated in Bohemia 80 years ago; Bohemia is the heart of Europe."
"That is why I regret the fact that, at the start of this year, there was suddenly talk in Prague of defending the post-war order."
"We do not need a post-war order in Europe."
"We do not need a wartime or pre-war order either; what we want to build at the start of the twenty-first century is a new, equitable order of nations, built on reconciliation, on healing of the wounds we have inflicted on one another, on justice, on mutual respect and mutual recognition."
"I therefore call on the Czech authorities to cast unjust decrees like the Bene? decrees on the scrap heap of history where they belong."
"Let us join together in building a new Europe where the peoples live together as equals, where ethnic groups and minorities are protected, where the European cultural diversity that was expressed so impressively in the speeches here this morning is respected."
"Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for a typically sound report."
"This is an historic day in Parliament."
"Enlargement is the largest issue we have to work on within the European Union."
"Europe will in that way become more secure for future generations, and democracy will be stronger in our part of the world."
"In certain quarters, a number of people are, however, sceptical about this cooperation, which has been accused of being only for the richer countries in our part of the world."
"Now, we are opening up that cooperation to all the countries in our part of the world and showing that it is an option for the whole of Europe."
"I share the view expressed by quite a few other speakers that we can all become winners in this situation."
"Clearly, enlargement will entail short-term costs, but I am completely convinced that we shall see financial gains."
"I myself come from the Baltic region."
"I can envisage the economy growing in our part of Europe, thanks to enlargement."
"In the area of environmental policy, the major gains will be made through our taking measures in those countries that are now becoming members of the EU."
"It will be of benefit to them, and it will be of benefit to ourselves."
"The same applies in the area of the labour market where there is a risk of jobs' moving as a result of poorer conditions."
"That situation will be improved through our all obtaining common minimum conditions."
"The other day, I was at a seminar on the subject of cross-border crime."
"Through close cooperation, we shall resolve this issue too."
"We all of us have the opportunities to become winners, both the existing EU countries and the candidate countries."
"It depends upon ourselves, however, and upon how we deal with the challenge now facing us."
"What we are concerned with here is a more diverse Europe that is richer economically, socially and culturally."
"Mr President, last week, I gave secondary school children in my province a few lessons on Europe and the imminent enlargement."
"My audience was, and this is striking in this day and age, attentive, interested, and also unperturbed."
"My political statement that it is not our political, or our personal, merit that we were born on the sunny side of the Iron Curtain and that it is through no fault of their own that the acceding countries had to live in our shadow for so long, was taken on board with due respect."
"However, whether my argument was sufficiently convincing was evident from the questions afterwards."
"How does it serve us, what are the precise benefits to us?"
"This morning's debate also shows the other side of the coin."
"Alongside the firm conviction that it is important to have this one indivisible Europe to guarantee that people can live together in peace, there were also other notions."
"How welcome are we?"
"Are we not turning into second-class citizens and what are you giving us in terms of extra funding to help us convince the citizens on our side?"
"We have managed to convincingly set in motion an enlargement scenario that should succeed."
"However, we should take to heart the fact that we have been less successful totally convincing our citizens of the importance of, and need for, the political ideal that this enlargement is for us all."
"We have communicated too little, and this means that uncertainty, or latent gut feelings, have a chance of surfacing, and enlargement degenerates into a political game with short-term gain."
"I am also taking part in this debate in my capacity as enlargement rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I therefore follow the issue closely."
"Something else that we should take to heart is the fact that people worry."
"These worries revolve around food safety, free movement, environmental issues and the cross-border approach to them."
"These also involve the nuclear power plants, shut down on the one hand and shrouded in doubt on the other."
"I think that now, after Copenhagen, we should tackle this issue firmly with both hands and far more effectively."
"Mr President, on my way here to Strasbourg I was reading Antony Beevor's excellent and quite shocking account of the Red Army's advance on Berlin."
"It was splendidly fitting travel reading for this historic part-session."
"The most important task of enlargement the Union has to face is to ensure that never again do European nations submit to the aspirations of power-hungry dictators or are driven to hatred for one another."
"It is just as crucial to strengthen our common democratic structures at the same time as enlargement takes place."
"I am glad that the representatives of the applicant countries are able to participate in the work of the delegation discussing the future of Europe."
"Until now we have spoken all too little about how the EU itself will benefit from enlargement."
"We are not actually just the party that is giving something."
"The candidate countries' magnificent cultural tradition and capacity for creativity will provide new opportunities for competitiveness built on information and skills as well as an improved quality of life for our citizens."
"Cultural and linguistic diversity is a great source of wealth and offers enormous potential."
"It is also gratifying to see that the applicant countries are also already involved in the Culture 2000 programme, among others."
"Criteria for membership, however, must be kept in mind right up until the negotiations have ended."
"We must remember that viable labour relations are an essential part of the Union's activity."
"As vice-chairman of the Estonian delegation, I am concerned about information received that social dialogue in Estonia has broken down."
"That is not acceptable nor is it wise."
"I hope that my neighbouring country, which has been very successful in the financial and technology sectors, can sort this problem out too."
"Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Brok and all the rapporteurs for this report."
"We are coming to the end of the first stage of European reunification, and this morning has given us a timely, encouraging glimpse of the future."
"Reunification will continue until we have welcomed into the embrace of the Union or into another, essentially just as effective body, all the countries which share the European culture and its basic values."
"It is imperative that we continue with this process if we want to help to establish the values of democracy, freedom and equality throughout the world, to make every day a day of greater peace, peace which is increasingly understanding of others and increasingly shared with others."
"I understand the issue of Europe's borders, but the borders of our society will be defined by the heritage we can offer the world: the more we share our culture, the wider our borders will be and the more citizens there will be who opt to share our ideas for the institutional, political and social organisation of the Community."
"Together with the other accession States, Slovenia is important because it represents the gateway through which the Balkan States who will share our multicultural, multiethnic and multifaith society will have to enter in future."
"I believe that the political goal we have achieved must be matched by progress in upholding human rights, the achievement of economic and social standards and the combating of corruption and crimes whose levels are still very high."
"It is genuinely important to discard the individualistic mindset and realise that we are part of a larger body, which we must essentially complement and never stubbornly disregard, where everyone has a part to play in the endeavours to achieve common goals."
"I hope that the Convention will be able to draw up a proposal which makes the instruments of democracy operational, which will help other areas of the world too and bring peace, prosperity and progress to mankind."
"Mr President, the EU-Lithuania Joint Parliamentary Committee met in Brussels last week and the discussions confirmed the progress made towards accession which is spelt out in paragraphs 78 to 84 of the report."
"Two chapters remain to be closed."
"Firstly in agriculture, where some flexibility on the issue of quotas would be welcome and secondly, in the financial chapter, where the contribution to the financing of the closure of the Ignalina nuclear power plant and the provision of alternative electricity generation are outstanding matters."
"This requires agreement on the decommissioning procedures and the timescale."
"The JPC noted the need to closely monitor progress with the SAPARD, Phare and Ispra programmes and to ensure that Lithuania is fully prepared to exploit the structural and rural funding possibilities after accession."
"The early approval of the single programming document is essential in this respect."
"Regarding the recent agreement made over the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, I want to stress that Lithuanian sovereignty must be respected and Schengen membership not compromised."
"We are, however, concerned that the practical problems may delay the implementation."
"I have made a study of the nuclear aspects of accession."
"The closures of the nuclear power plants at Ignalina and Kozloduy both require an energy strategy which takes neighbouring countries into account."
"For example the completion of Unit 2 at Cernovoda is fully justified by the Phare study of August 2001."
"The closure of units 3 and 4 at Kozloduy should be reassessed in the light of the International Atomic Energy Agency's conclusion, in its report, issued in June that these units have reached a level of operational safety which corresponds to those of the same age in other parts of the world."
"I hope that the Council will agree to such a revaluation."
"Mr President, the enlargement of the European Union from 2004 constitutes an historic milestone in the construction of Europe, something that we all sincerely welcome, for several reasons."
"First, because it symbolises the reconciliation of two parts of the same continent that were divided for more than half a century, until little more than a decade ago."
"Second, because this is the greatest enlargement in the history of the European Union, with the number of Member States almost doubling and a one-third increase in its population and territory."
"Third, because it encompasses countries that until recently lived under a state-run economy, which are now experiencing the painful but necessary phase of re-structuring their economies and which have a relatively low average per capita income."
"Fourthly, because most of the new countries still have a very large agricultural sector in comparison to the current European Union."
"It is in this context that I should like to emphasise two aspects:"
"firstly, aid must be dedicated to these countries; Community aid, financial aid and technical aid, in order to enable them to speed up their process of economic recovery and development."
"We must also bear in mind, however, that some regions of the current European Union of 15 are also very poor, and hence the European Union cannot at the same time abandon the policy of economic and social cohesion that it has been pursuing for these countries for some years;"
"secondly, it must be noted that doubling the number of farmers, with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, will require the common agricultural policy to be vastly simplified, and will also require a reduction in aid for all farmers, both future and present, following the new funding limits for the CAP laid down by the Brussels European Council of 25 October."
"The European Union must, therefore, take the proposal to reform the CAP recently put forward by its Commissioner for Agriculture seriously, in order to lay down a better future for farmers, both in the current Union and in the Union of the future."
"Mr President, and you, Commissioner Verheugen and Mr Haarder, Minister for European Affairs of the country to hold the presidency, who have both worked so hard today, may I say that you must have had a long day."
"I would, however, like to raise a matter that President Prodi mentioned today."
"He spoke in favour of a future European Union developing for itself a strong good-neighbour policy."
"Enlargement of the European Union in all its stages meant it acquired new neighbours."
"On the previous occasion the European Union acquired the Northern Dimension in addition to the western and southern dimensions that already existed."
"As a result of the forthcoming round of enlargement we shall have a very special eastern dimension."
"The good-neighbour policy should not, however, remain just words on paper: the European Union should also develop a proper practical policy with goals and action."
"The northern and eastern dimensions meet in the Baltic Sea area."
"After enlargement the Baltic Sea will virtually be an internal sea of the EU, except, however, in one corner where it meets Russia and what is almost that country's most populous region, St. Petersburg and the area around it."
"It is in this region that we must strengthen even further the cooperation that has already commenced, with the aim of achieving stability and social and ecological balance there."
"Furthermore, future regional and structural policy must make transboundary cooperation and cooperation on both the old and the new borders possible."
"Mr President, much has already been said about Turkey today."
"That is not at all surprising since this Parliament is a reflection of the population of the European Union and this topic is very much on the minds of our citizens at home."
"There are growing signs that in Copenhagen in December it is intended to give Turkey a date for the start of accession negotiations."
"Were the Council representative's words today not very clear?"
"But we are not under any pressure to move."
"The Copenhagen criteria have not been met and they are not negotiable."
"In this connection I would like to thank Mr Verheugen for speaking so clearly on the subject of Turkey."
"Important as Turkey is for us, there can be no political discounts for the Cyprus question or for Turkey's geostrategic role."
"Turkey has always wanted to set its own rules for accession under the slogan 'We are not like other candidates'."
"Turkey has always tried to put pressure on us, but that is not the way forward."
"It would, after all, be an affront to the representatives of the candidate countries present here today."
"Nevertheless, people like the German Federal Chancellor, for example, never tire of saying they will support Turkey's demand for a date to be set."
"That is not just a sign of severe incompetence in European policy."
"This chancellor, who has lied to and deceived his own people, is trying to make good the mistakes of his election campaign."
"Now relations between Germany and America are to be improved again at the expense of the European Union as a whole."
"Is that not pure opportunism?"
"Is it not beyond belief?"
"It is intolerably dishonest."
"It is particularly dishonest to the Turkish people."
"Is it not more honest to say to Turkey that there are still problems there and that we must address those problems in their own interest, because otherwise they cannot be solved?"
"The honest thing is to say that rapprochement between Turkey and the European Union can only come about in small, steady steps, if at all."
"The road is still not an easy one."
"We hope that Turkey, this great and proud nation, will pursue its road steadfastly in its own real interest and that it will at some point consider whether it really wants to cede so many sovereign rights to the European Union in accession or whether it would not rather cooperate with us on another level."
"We are making this offer even now."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I do not understand what all the fuss is about."
"We have been arguing about Turkey since yesterday."
"Whilst I have a very high regard for Mrs Sommer, it is she in particular who makes it impossible for me to understand at all why, when we are talking about enlargement, we are suddenly arguing about a question of principle, namely whether Turkey belongs in the European Union or not."
"We will very soon have an opportunity to deal with this question objectively when we talk about the Oostlander report."
"It is now a member of your group who is the rapporteur; he is a well-known politician and at any rate not a supporter of Turkey."
"His report will give us an opportunity to dispute or discuss this subject objectively."
"When I read Mr Ferber's motion, Amendment No 7, I increasingly suspect that it is not really about Turkey and the European Union at all."
"It appears to be about Germany, about German domestic politics."
"It appears to be about the fact that there will shortly be two important regional elections in Germany, in Hesse and in Lower Saxony."
"We supposedly have to argue about Turkey in the European Parliament now, but that is the real reason why we are taking the opportunity to do so."
"That is the main problem."
"I will be perfectly honest with you."
"At the moment I have more problems with Turkey than Mrs Sommer does, because I do not think much of Islamists, and I believe they are Islamists, even if nowadays they call themselves something else."
"I am very curious to know how they intend bringing about everything they have promised."
"I have tremendous problems with the latest development in particular."
"All the same, I do not see why we are now misusing this debate for something else."
"By suddenly producing such artificial debates, we are not actually being honest with the people of the European Union either."
"If you want, let us do that when we are discussing the Oostlander report, and then people will see that we are capable of discussing openly and honestly."
"Mr President, for 28 years, Berlin and Germany were divided."
"That is now history."
"For 28 years, Nicosia and Cyprus have been divided."
"Let that be history, and let it be so as soon as possible."
"Turkey must respect the UN resolutions and give its full support to efforts to reach a political solution regarding Cyprus."
"If the discussions fail, Cyprus must nonetheless be given the green light for membership in 2004 at the Copenhagen European Council this coming December."
"It is important to make it clear to the new Islamophile Turkish Government that it must ignore the Turkish Cypriot threat of a permanent division of Cyprus if the southern part is brought into the EU before the discussions between Turkey and Greece are concluded."
"I assume it is perfectly clear to the Turks that their country can never embark upon membership negotiations if the occupying troops are not withdrawn from a future EU Member State, namely Cyprus."
"We are concerned here with the credibility of the EU and with the EU as a peace project."
"Initiatives on the part of the new Turkish Government and the UN on the Cyprus issue must be based upon this obvious insight."
"In the text produced by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I have put forward the view that Turkey's democratic development, especially when it comes to the protection of ethnic and religious minorities, must be a prerequisite of increased financial pre-accession aid from the EU."
"In 1900, a quarter of Turkey's population was Christian."
"A hundred years later, a thousandth of the population is Christian."
"That is a tragic expression of extensive assaults upon religious freedom and religious tolerance, particularly affecting Christian Syrians and Armenians."
"I have also helped tighten up the appeals made by the European Parliament to the candidate countries when it comes, for example, to combating corruption, and I have also added an economic perspective."
"I should like to welcome the candidate countries to the EU."
"Mr President, I speak as a Member of the EU-Bulgaria Joint Parliamentary Committee and also as shadow rapporteur on Romania."
"I will try to be brief."
"On the issue of Bulgaria and Romania we need a target date, a focus."
"Therefore I fully support the proposed target date."
"Also, during a recent visit to Malta I saw the wonderful work being done in connection with sexual orientation."
"We must not leave that out of the equation when we look at the rights of minorities."
"It was clear to me from the work of the Malta gay rights movement that the employment industrial relations act is not compliant with the employment framework directive, especially in relation to sexual orientation."
"I welcome the positive statements on Turkey."
"As regards the negative statements on Turkey, I am afraid that, sadly, we have seen racism and xenophobia rear their ugly heads."
"We must apply the same terms, conditions and principles. We cannot be selective in the application of principles."
"The same principles must apply to all the candidate countries and also to the countries such as Turkey which have indicated that they wish to join the European Union."
"If we turn Turkey away, I believe that will be an action that we will live to regret."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner, who is here today, and the President-in-Office of the Council to explain how they are going to apply the principle of equality within this enlargement process."
"In my view, following the Franco-German agreement, it is necessary to stipulate that the financial impact of enlargement must not fall to the poorest areas, who are beneath the Community average and who require sustained progress."
"Equally, the bill for enlargement must not fall to the richest."
"We must protect the whole of the enlarged Europe from any risk of impoverishment of any part of it."
"We must extend paragraph 24 of the Brok report to all areas and regions of the European Union, since enlargement must not have negative repercussions for any Community territory."
